It is characterised by the development of benign tumours in many organs, including the skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs and brain. Brain involvement can lead to seizures, neurocognitive deficits and behavioural and developmental disorders. TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) occur in the majority of those with TSC, even in the approximately 50&#x000a0;% of patients with normal IQ (&#x0003e;70) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and they are rated as the most significant disease manifestations by patients and families because of their everyday impact on education, employment, family and social life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Better treatment options for TAND have the potential to both reduce health care demands and offer wider benefits for patients and their carers.</p><p>In the past, it was thought that the cognitive, behavioural and neurological manifestations of TSC might be entirely attributable to tubers&#x02014;characteristic areas of cerebral cortex or sub-cortical white matter&#x02014;which occur in most people with TSC. However, recent molecular and cellular insights indicate that the intracellular consequences of <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> gene mutations may also play a direct and potentially reversible role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. New imaging techniques have revealed subtle abnormalities of brain microstructure in otherwise normal-appearing white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins (hamartin and tuberin, respectively) form a complex that acts to suppress mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling; thus, disruption of the TSC1-TSC2 complex (as a consequence of mutations in either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>) leads to excessive mTORC1 signalling. The effects of this have been demonstrated in immunohistochemical and immunoblotting studies that have shown activation of the downstream effectors of mTORC1, S6 kinase and phospho-S6 in tuberous sclerosis lesions in both pre-clinical models and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In pre-clinical trials, treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors shrank or prevented kidney tumours, improved memory and learning, stopped or prevented epilepsy, and improved survival in transgenic <italic>Tsc1</italic>- and <italic>Tsc2</italic>-mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Published findings from the <italic>Tsc2</italic> study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] came at a time which served to reinforce interest in the neurocognitive trials in humans. Clinical trials using the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated significant reductions in brain and kidney tumour volume, along with acceptable safety and tolerability, in patients with tuberous sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These findings led to licensing of everolimus for these indications in the United States and Europe.</p><p>In the study of Davies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we also monitored memory, learning and executive function as secondary endpoints. During the treatment period, patients with tuberous sclerosis showed improvements in visuospatial and verbal recall memory and in executive function, but not in recognition memory tasks. However, because the trial was not a randomised controlled trial and involved very small numbers of patients, we could not distinguish learning effects due to repeat administration (so-called practice effects) of the tests from drug effects.</p><p>Up until 14 September 2015, a total of 11 controlled trials of investigational medicinal products investigating mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with tuberous sclerosis were listed at ClinicalTrials.gov. Several are completed or no longer recruiting. Most are investigating tumour-related outcomes. All are using everolimus or sirolimus (rapamycin). Researchers in one current phase II, non-randomised, open-label trial are investigating the efficacy of everolimus in TSC-associated seizures (NCT01070316). A signal-seeking, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus for neurocognitive problems in young people with TSC has been completed in the United States, but the results are not yet reported (NCT01289912) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The present trial, TRON, will be an investigation of everolimus in relation to neurocognitive function in adult patients with TSC. It will determine effect sizes to provide evidence for whether larger trials for this indication are appropriate. In contrast to the U.S. study (NCT01289912), it will be focused on adult patients who do not have active seizures or who have well-controlled seizures as well as some degree of cognitive impairment. TAND is multi-level with varying cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to differentiate between these, the principal level investigated here through the primary outcomes is the &#x02018;neuropsychological&#x02019; level, which will be referred to as <italic>neurocognition</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a single-centre, two-arm, individually randomised, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus versus placebo (allocation ratio of 2:1, respectively) in the treatment of neurocognitive problems in patients with TSC. Patients are treated in an outpatient setting at a specialist centre in a large teaching hospital.

The control group provides evidence of the learning effect due to repeated assessments. The proposed study seeks to determine effect sizes in relation to the primary outcome measures to enable informed designing of subsequent larger studies. This study is therefore not powered for formal statistical comparison of placebo and study drug groups.</p><p>We estimate the learning effect (i.e., the proportion of patients whose memory function improves due to familiarity with the assessments) to be slightly less than 0.15. A proportion of less than 0.15 in the intervention group would therefore indicate that the intervention (everolimus in the treatment of neurocognitive problems in tuberous sclerosis) does not warrant further investigation. A proportion of at least 0.35 would provide sufficient evidence for further investigation of this intervention. Values between these would be discussed in depth by members of the trial team.</p><p>Therefore, to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients in the intervention group who improve their memory function by 1 SD is at most 0.15 against the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of patients in the intervention group who improve their memory function by 1 SD is at least 0.35, with 80&#x000a0;% power and a one-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, we require a total sample size of 48 (i.e., 32 who receive the intervention and 16 control subjects). This sample size is inflated to allow for 20&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients aged between 16 and 60&#x000a0;years with tuberous sclerosis will be invited to take part in the trial. The trial will be advertised through the Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA) via its website, a regular update e-magazine and a magazine that is mailed to TSA members (approximately 1000 families). Clinical geneticists throughout the United Kingdom will be made aware of the study through the Clinical Genetics Clinical Research Network, and the study has been adopted by National Institute for Health Research via this network.

Their severity will be graded according to the CTCAE. Once detected, they will be treated appropriately and monitored until resolution, unless deemed by the investigator as not necessary and documented accordingly. Treatment may include interruption, modification or discontinuation of study drug treatment and changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalisations or any other medically required interventions. Recommended treatment of side effects is detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><p>Known common side effects of the IMP are listed in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), which is the reference safety information (RSI) for this trial. Any new relevant information between SmPC updates will be issued in the form of investigator notifications. On the basis of the approved RSI for everolimus, expected AE in patients with tuberous sclerosis are seizures and haemorrhage from AML; additional expected AE in females with lymphangioleimyomatosis complicating TSC are pneumothorax, chest infection, chylothorax and haemoptysis.</p><p>AE the nature and severity of which are consistent with the information set out in the SmPC for everolimus will be considered expected. Events ongoing at study completion will be followed as clinically indicated. Furthermore, effects of the study drug may be influenced by products that affect cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein.

Appointments will be postponed and rescheduled for patients who have had a generalised tonic-clonic seizure within 48&#x000a0;h of scheduled neurocognitive testing or a complex partial seizure within 24&#x000a0;h of scheduled neurocognitive testing. At the screening visit, background, demographic and administrative assessments will be carried out which will include relevant medical history/current medical conditions; a physical examination; and blood laboratory examinations as per protocol, including a hepatitis screen and a pregnancy test. Patients will also be assessed for IQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], handedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and pre-morbid intellectual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The clinician will also ascertain eligibility by evaluation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.</p><p>Following the screening visit (visit 1), eligible patients will be scheduled for the baseline and randomisation visit (visit 2) approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks later. This will be considered week 0, and treatment will commence. As outlined in the study assessment schedule (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), patients will then be followed for 6&#x000a0;months, with study visits taking place at week 2 (safety), week 4 (safety, some neurocognition), week 6 (safety), week 12 (full neurocognition) and week 24 (full neurocognition at the end of the treatment phase). Each of these visits will take place within 12&#x000a0;h after the last drug administration. A further assessment will be carried out 12&#x000a0;weeks after the end of the last drug or placebo administration, at week 36. Patients will visit the study site on the required days and may stay overnight if travelling from afar, though no hospitalisation will be required. It is anticipated that regular contact with participants and carers will offer the opportunity to address any issues which may contribute to attrition.</p><p>Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs and standard clinical laboratory evaluations of haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, AE and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring at each site visit. Monitoring by telephone will be carried out by the clinical trial team at 1&#x000a0;week after initiation of treatment and each month thereafter during the treatment phase of the study, unless a study visit takes place during that calendar month. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> for a full breakdown of the study assessment schedule.</p><p>Efficacy assessments for memory (verbal recall memory and non-verbal recall memory) will be measured using two tests that have been validated in the U.K. population across the age range required for this study and for which multiple parallel forms are available as required for retesting. Attentional/executive function will be measured using two tests from a similarly standardised computerised battery, and another from a further well-validated &#x02018;pen-and-paper&#x02019; test battery.</p><p>Verbal recall memory will be assessed using the list learning recall task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Non-verbal recall memory will be assessed using the complex figure recall task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Attentional/executive function will be assessed using the Stockings of Cambridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] planning task and the Spatial Working Memory test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and also using the dual task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Attention will be assessed by using the Rapid Visual Information Processing test, the visual search task, sustained listening tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the cancellation task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Executive function will be assessed by using the non-verbal intra-dimensional/extra-dimensional test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the verbal Controlled Oral Word Association Test/FAS test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The spatial span task will assess simple working memory. The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] will be used to assess psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology and/or psychiatric issues.</p><p>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] will be used to evaluate overall quality of life. Seizure severity will be assessed by using the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and a seizure diary. A carer, relative or friend will complete the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the Social Responsiveness Scale &#x02013; Adult version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] to assess any autism spectrum symptoms, and the Social Communication Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

This facility has a dedicated neurocognitive testing suite.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data management and monitoring</title><p>Data will be captured on study-specific case report forms (CRFs). CRFs will not constitute source data, and all data entered on the CRFs will be traceable to an original source record (electronic or paper), either as part of the electronic database or in the patient&#x02019;s file. All data management procedures will be detailed in the trial-specific data management plan.</p><p>The sponsor&#x02019;s monitoring standards will ensure 100&#x000a0;% verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, documentation of SAE, and recording of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs will be performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. All data will be kept for 15&#x000a0;years, in line with the sponsor&#x02019;s research governance framework regulations for clinical research. Data will be anonymised and stored confidentially in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 on password-protected servers maintained in the Cardiff University network.</p><p>A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established that will consist of an independent chair and two other independent members. The main role of the DMC will be to safeguard the interests of the trial&#x02019;s participants, review the data periodically and make recommendations to the Study Steering Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Main analysis</title><p>All randomised participants who received at least one dose of study drug will be included in the data analysis. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment they received. We will present data descriptively and determine effect sizes.

A one-sample chi-square test will be used to determine whether the proportion of patients in the intervention group with improved recall memory at 6&#x000a0;months by 1 SD is at least 0.35.

The effect (between baseline and 6&#x000a0;months) of the control and intervention arms on wider aspects of neurocognitive function, seizures and daily life will be similarly assessed. Secondary analyses will consider both the primary and secondary outcome measures as dimensions of memory function as continuous variables rather than just the proportion of improved patients over time. In further modelling, we will use repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance to model patterns of functioning over time at baseline and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. In these analyses, we will compare the scores from each neurocognitive test at 6&#x000a0;months between the intervention and control arms and will adjust for the balancing factors. The result will be presented as the (adjusted) difference in test outcomes between the intervention and control groups, along with 95&#x000a0;% CI and <italic>p</italic> value. The use of composite measures of these scales will be explored.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>This proof-of-principle trial will be the first to determine the effect sizes of treatment with everolimus or placebo for 6&#x000a0;months for recall memory and executive function in adults with tuberous sclerosis. The goal is to provide evidence for whether larger trials for this indication in an adult population are appropriate.</p><p>The findings of this study will advance current knowledge in terms of understanding and treatment of tuberous sclerosis. Participants who receive this intervention have the potential for an amelioration of the neurocognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis. Additional potential benefits exist, as mTOR inhibitors have been shown to reduce the size of renal AMLs that are present in most adults with tuberous sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and also to improve the characteristic facial rash (facial angiofibromatosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Wider potential benefits to society include reduced demand on carers and on health and social care services, as well as insights into the mechanistic basis for these problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis and potentially other patient groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is sponsored by Cardiff University and is currently ongoing and open to recruitment.
