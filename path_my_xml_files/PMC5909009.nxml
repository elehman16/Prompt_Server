resistance as well as reduces grip strength and extremity loading resistance, particularly
during elbow extension<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lateral
epicondylitis is known as tennis elbow, and the pain is caused by damage to the tendon of
the short radial extensor of the wrist on the lateral side of the elbow<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Relevant risk factors include overuse, repetitive
movements, wrong training, misalignment, flexibility problem, age, poor circulation, muscle
weakening or imbalance, and mental factors<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, tennis elbow is usually
related to individuals&#x02019; repetitive occupations or hobbies<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with pain in the lateral epicondyle show increased pain and decreased functional
abilities and grip strength due to the weakening of the rotator cuff and the scapula
muscular systems<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional impingements
of the shoulder joints occur because of the excessive compensation of the extensor resulting
from impaired shoulder stability attributable to changes in the joint dynamics and muscle
imbalance. As a result, the symptoms of tennis elbow appear because of minute damage to the
elastic tissues. Overload due to repetitive forearm movements leads to changes in the
shoulder complex and the symptoms of lateral epicondylitis appear because of the resultant
forearm and hand muscle overload<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
primary purposes of the treatment of tennis elbow are pain relief, movement preservation,
and enhancement of flexibility, muscle strength, and endurance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, with regard to the effects of treatment, eccentric
muscle contraction exercise provides substantial stimulation to the tendon cells that
generate collagen and enables the tendons to gain more power during activities, thereby
tolerating pressure<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shoulder stabilization exercise focuses on the recovery of balance among the shoulder
stabilizing muscles. Closed chain exercises have been recently used as therapeutic exercises
for the upper extremities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Push-up plus
exercises are performed as closed chain exercises of the upper extremities, and they are
widely used by subjects with shoulder problems as therapeutic exercises for the improvement
of shoulder functions because they are easy as strengthening exercises for the muscles
around the shoulder<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, among
closed chain exercises, sling exercises can increase loads step by step, increase muscle
strength, and improve proprioceptive sensibility<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of the rehabilitation of patients with instability of
the shoulder, training on unstable bearing surfaces leads to the recovery of the balance of
proprioceptive sensibility<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shoulder stability is important for upper extremity functions. Many previous studies
focused on the elbow only for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis patients, and studies
on the stability of the shoulder of tennis elbow patients are rare. Therefore, this study
aimed to conduct experiments to examine the effects of wrist extensor eccentric control
exercise or shoulder stabilization exercise after a basic direct treatment of the elbow in
the treatment tennis elbow patients in terms of pain and grip strength.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted on tennis elbow outpatients in their 20s&#x02013;50s of K Clinic
located in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do. Among the patients, those with tennis elbow for five
months or longer, those that took drugs or had injections because of tennis elbow, those
that experienced neurologic symptoms in their upper extremities, and those that could not
perform exercises were excluded from the study. A total of 18 subjects participated in the
study, and the subjects were divided into two groups through random assignment with lot
drawing: the wrist extensor eccentric control exercise group with five male and four female
subjects and the shoulder stabilization exercise group with five male and four female
subjects. The research design targeted patients at the hospital field, applying both
existing conservative treatments and applying additional exercise interventions. Before
performing the exercises, the wrist extensor eccentric control exercise group and the
shoulder stabilization exercise group underwent basic hyperthermia for 20&#x02005;min,
transcutaneous nerve simulation treatment for 15&#x02005;min, and massage and stretching for 5&#x02005;min.
The study was conducted after obtaining the consent on the purpose and progression of the
study from all subjects and approval from the institutional review board of Daegu University
(1040621-201705-HR-009-02).</p><p>The wrist extensor eccentric strengthening exercise group performed wrist muscle eccentric
contraction exercises using Thera bands, with the affected side forearm in the state of
internal version made after placing the forearm on the edge of the bed and with the hand
placed outside the bed. The exercises were performed slowly while extending the affected
side hand using the unaffected side hand during wrist extension and assisting the affected
side hand using the unaffected side hand during eccentric control exercise, so that the
eccentric control exercise could be performed within the range where there was no pain. The
exercise performed 15 times was equivalent to one set, and five sets were performed with a
break of 1&#x02005;min after each set.</p><p>The shoulder stabilization exercise group performed the push-up plus exercise using
slings<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a crawling position as the
starting position, the subject held the handle of the sling, which was at a height of 10&#x02005;cm
from the floor; maintained the angle between the shoulder joint and the knee joint at 90&#x000b0;;
maintained the head, spine, and pelvis to form a straight line; maintained eye contact with
the floor; and placed the hands and knees at shoulder width. The elbows were maintained
completely extended, and the ankle joints were maintained in plantar flexion. During the
push-up plus exercise, the unciform bones of the middle fingers were aligned with the
acromions, and the scapulae were maximally protracted so that the head and the trunk joints
formed straight lines. This posture was maintained for 5 s. The exercise performed five
times was equivalent to one set, and five sets were performed with a break of 1&#x02005;min after
each set. These interventions were conducted three times a week for three weeks for both
groups.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of the interventions on the two groups, the visual analogue scale,
digital sense of pain, and grip strength were evaluated before and after intervention. The
pain levels were measured before the intervention and three weeks later by having the
subjects firsthand check the positions corresponding to their pain on a scale of 0 (the
state of no pain) to 10 (the state in which unendurable pain was felt).</p><p>The threshold of tenderness due to lateral epicondylitis was measured in units of
N/cm<sup>2</sup> using a digital algometer on the tenderness points in the upper trapezius
muscle and the lateral epicondyle of the shoulder. The threshold of tenderness of the upper
trapezius muscle was measured in a comfortable sitting position and that of the lateral
epicondyle was measured when the arm was comfortably placed on the bed. The subjects were
instructed to make an &#x0201c;ah&#x0201d; sound when they felt pain while pressure was being applied. The
pressure at which pain began to be felt was measured three times with an interval of 1&#x02005;min
after each measurement. In addition, the position of measurement was marked to prevent the
position from changing during the measurements and the subjects from knowing the measurement
results.</p><p>Grip strength was measured using a digital grip dynamometer DW701 (Takei Inc., Japan). The
grip dynamometer was placed on the second knuckle of the finger to measure the grip strength
between the thumb and other fingers, and the subject gripped the grip dynamometer for 5&#x02005;s
within the range where no pain was felt, with both arms naturally lowered while ensuring
that the grip dynamometer was not shaken or put into contact with the body. This measurement
was conducted three times and the average value was used.</p><p>Data were analyzed using Window SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were conducted to compare the states between before and after intervention
in each group. Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted for the intergroup comparison to
determine the differences between the two groups. P&#x0003c;0.05 was set for all analyses and the
significance level was set to &#x003b1;= 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="726"><col width="26%" span="1"/><col width="35%" span="1"/><col width="39%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WECEG (n=9)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSEG (n=9)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.0 &#x000b1; 5.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.7 &#x000b1; 6.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.9 &#x000b1; 9.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.6 &#x000b1; 10.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.0 &#x000b1; 10.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.4 &#x000b1; 10.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD.

effects of rotator cuff strengthening/ultrasonic therapy and rotator cuff
strengthening/wrist extensor eccentric contraction exercise, among all other intervention
methods, for different periods, and both groups showed significant pain relief when pain was
measured three weeks after beginning the interventions<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, wrist extensor eccentric muscle contraction
exercise also showed significant pain relief after intervention. Given the foregoing, the
eccentric control exercise stimulated the mechanoreceptors in the tenocytes, thus leading to
the generation of collagen and recovery from tennis elbow accompanied by pain relief<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The shoulder stabilization exercise also
showed significant pain relief after intervention. The symptoms of lateral epicondylitis
appear because of changes in the shoulder complex and the compensatory actions caused by the
overload of the forearm muscles resulting from repetitive movements of the forearm and the
hand<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The push up plus exercise using a
sling is considered to have increased the activity of the muscles around the scapula<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, thus leading to pain relief. However, no
significant difference was found in the intergroup comparison.</p><p>In the measurement of the thresholds of tenderness in the upper trapezius muscle due to
lateral epicondylitis, both groups showed significant increases after intervention.
Consistent with the results of Sharma et al., the significant increases in the threshold of
shoulder tenderness seemed to have appeared because the wrist extensor eccentric contraction
exercise and the scapula stabilization exercise relieved the symptoms of lateral
epicondylitis<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The wrist extensor
eccentric contraction exercise reduces the pressure load on musculotendinous units,
increases tension, and reduces pressure on the tendon during movements<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the scapula stabilization exercise using a
sling is a closed chain exercise considered to stimulate the proprioceptors of the joints,
increase the axial loads, and assist muscle contraction to maintain posture and provide
dynamic stability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It helps the
shoulder stability of lateral epicondylitis patients to increase the threshold of shoulder
tenderness. However, in the intergroup comparison of the thresholds of upper trapezius
muscle tenderness, the threshold of the scapula stabilization exercise group was
significantly higher. The overcompensation of the wrist extensor leads to an imbalance
between shoulder joint dynamics and muscles, thus resulting in the impingement of scapula
stability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, symptomatic
shoulder pain occurs because of the decreased activity of the muscle serratus anterior and
the increased activity of the upper trapezius muscle<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies indicated that the application of scapula
stabilization exercise on unstable bearing surfaces relieved the symptoms because of the
decreased activity of the muscle serratus anterior and the increased activity of the upper
trapezius muscle<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby relieving
pain.</p><p>In the intragroup comparison of the thresholds of tenderness of the lateral epicondyle,
both groups showed significant increases. However, no significant difference was found in
the intergroup comparison. According to recent theories, eccentric muscle contraction
exercise is effective in neovascularization, which is a factor of the causes of
tendinopathies with pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
low-intensity eccentric exercise reduces the dynamic sensitivity of deep tissues to enhance
the threshold of tenderness<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, among scapula stabilization exercises, rehabilitation exercises and muscle
strengthening exercises on unstable bearing surfaces increase the activity of muscles,
enable exercises at high levels of difficulties, and improve the balance of the
proprioceptors of the joints<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vicenzino
et al. indicated that in the interventions for lateral epicondylitis patients, the
experimental group that performed the Mulligan lateral mobilization of the proximal forearm
showed more significant increases in the threshold of the lateral epicondyle as treatment
effects than the placebo group and the control group<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In grip strength measurements, the eccentric muscle contraction exercise group and scapula
stabilization exercise group showed more significant increases after intervention than
before intervention. In the intergroup comparison, the group that performed the scapula
stabilization exercise showed significantly more increases. Grip strength is measured as one
of the evaluations of lateral epicondylitis patients. Pain relief or an increase in force
leads to increased grip strength<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Eccentric exercise is considered to increase blood flow, prevent injury to the damaged area,
and cause neovascularization<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby
leading to pain relief resulting from the increased grip strength. Scapula stabilization
exercise can improve the balance of shoulders kinematically impaired because of the overuse
of the elbow and thus lead to increased grip strength<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sharma et al. conducted a survey on the Patient-rated tennis Elbow
Evaluation Questionnaire to evaluate the pain, grip strength, digital tenderness threshold,
and tennis elbow of an eccentric contraction exercise group and a rotator cuff strengthening
exercise group by comparing the before and after intervention and found that the latter
group showed significantly more increases than the former only in the measurement of grip
strength<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, wrist extensor eccentric strengthening exercises and scapula stabilization
exercises can be useful as intervention methods for relief from pain due to lateral
epicondylitis and for the improvement of functions impaired by lateral epicondylitis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Boyer</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name><name><surname>Hastings</surname><given-names>H</given-names><suffix>2nd</suffix></name></person-group>: <article-title>Lateral tennis elbow: &#x0201c;Is there any science out
