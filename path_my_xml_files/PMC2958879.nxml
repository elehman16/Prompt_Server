All testing was performed first thing in the morning following an overnight fast. Baseline measurements of RMR were measured using indirect calorimetry using a facemask, and body composition was measured using air displacement plethysmography. Saliva was collected via passive drool and analyzed for cortisol concentration using ELISA. Following baseline testing, subjects were randomly assigned in a double blind manner to one of two groups: 4 g/d of Safflower Oil (SO); or 4 g/d of FO supplying 1,600 mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 800 mg/d docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

However, several rodent studies have shown clearly that diets rich in omega 3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are found in large amounts in the oil from cold-water fish, lead to significantly lower total body fat stores vs diets rich in other fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon are not completely understood, but there are several possible explanations. For example, EPA and DHA are very effective at suppressing lipogenic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], thereby limiting the synthesis of lipids. EPA and DHA have also been found to increase the oxidation of lipids as a result of an increase in carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT 1) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which allows greater fatty acid transport across the inner mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additionally, EPA can increase mitochondrial lipid oxidation indirectly by inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl CoA, and is a potent inhibitor of CAT I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, EPA and DHA can also decrease the sensitivity of CAT I to malonyl CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which may allow a higher rate of lipid oxidation across a variety of different metabolic states. It is also possible that omega 3 fatty acids may influence total body lipid accretion by increasing thermogenesis as a result of increased activity of uncoupling proteins and peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and/or by increasing lean body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which would indirectly increase thermogenesis.</p><p>Although there is some disagreement in the literature, there appears to be a negative effect of the stress hormone cortisol on body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The well-documented association between Cushing's disease and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] clearly shows that conditions that significantly increase cortisol levels can increase fat accretion. However, it is not known if treatments that lower cortisol levels can positively impact body composition. There is limited evidence that fish oil supplementation can reduce cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which raises the possibility that the consumption of fish oil could decrease body fat % by decreasing cortisol levels. To date, no study has examined the relationship between salivary cortisol and body composition following treatment with fish oil.</p><p>Despite the mechanistic data and results in rodents, very little is known about the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on body composition and metabolic rate in humans. In the first study using humans, Couet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found that when 6 g/d of visible dietary fat was replaced with 6 g/d of fish oil for 3 wk, there was a significant increase in fat oxidation as measured by RER, and a concomitant decrease in total body fat as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. There was also an increase in the resting metabolic rate, but this was no longer evident when the observed slight increase in lean mass during the fish oil treatment was accounted for, perhaps suggesting that fish oil may increase RMR by increasing lean mass. More recently, Hill et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found that supplementing the diet with fish oil significantly reduced fat mass compared to a control group supplemented with sunflower oil. Similarly, Thorsdottir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] found that including fish, or fish oil supplements, in a hypoenergetic diet resulted in greater weight loss in young overweight men compared to a hypoenergetic diet that did not include fish or fish oil.</p><p>The aim of the present study was 1) to determine the effects of supplemental fish oil on body composition and resting metabolic rate in healthy adults, and 2) to determine the effects of supplemental fish oil on morning salivary cortisol concentrations, and determine if there is a relationship between changes in salivary cortisol concentrations and changes in body composition following fish oil treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Prior to all testing, approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board at Gettysburg College and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p><p>Healthy adults (18-55y) were recruited through flyers posted at Gettysburg College and surrounding community. Individuals who ate fatty fish at least 3 times a month, or were supplementing their diet with omega 3 fatty acids, or had a known metabolic or endocrine disorder were excluded. Subjects were healthy and active, but not engaged in consistent, systematic exercise training. In total, 44 individuals volunteered to participate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

No significant correlations were observed in the SO group between the change in salivary cortisol concentration and the change in % body fat (r = -0.321; p = 0.17), change in fat free mass (r = 0.007; p = 0.98), or the change in fat mass (r = -0.309; p = 0.19).</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic Data</title><p>No significant differences between groups were observed over time for resting metabolic rate (SO = -62 &#x000b1; 184 kcal, FO = 17 &#x000b1; 260 kcal; p = 0.40), or for the respiratory exchange ratio (SO = 0.023 &#x000b1; 0.54; FO = -0.019 &#x000b1; 0.85, p = 0.16).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study showed that 6 weeks of supplemental fish oil significantly increased lean mass, and significantly reduced fat mass in healthy adults. This is in agreement with Couet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], who observed a significant 0.88 kg reduction in fat mass, and a non-significant 0.20 kg increase in lean mass following 3 weeks of an increased consumption of fish oil. In their study, they added fish oil to the diet, but kept total fat and energy constant between the treatments. In the present study, the fish oil was added on top of an ad libitum diet, with instructions given to the subjects to maintain their normal dietary patterns throughout the study. Similarly, Hill et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found a significant reduction in fat mass following 12 weeks of supplementation with fish oil in overweight subjects. They also observed an increase in lean mass in the fish oil group, however, like the data reported by Couet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it did not reach significance. Thorsdottir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] recently found that supplementation with fish oil, or inclusion of fish in an energy-restricted diet resulted in significantly greater weight loss in young men. Additionally, they found that young men taking the fish oil supplements had a significantly greater reduction in waist circumference compared to the control group, or the group that increased their dietary intake of fish.</p><p>Unlike the Couet et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we did not observe an increase in RMR, or a decrease in RER following fish oil treatment. The failure to find an increase in RMR following fish oil treatment is hard to explain given the significant increase in lean mass observed in the present study. Several studies have shown that lean mass is the largest determinant of RMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and decreasing lean mass decreases RMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while increasing lean mass increases RMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, it would be expected that the increase in lean mass would correspond to an increased RMR following fish oil treatment. In the Couet et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], metabolic data were measured for 45 min following a 90 min rest period. This is a longer time period than the 40 min used in the present study. However, it is doubtful that this methodological difference between the studies contributed to the differing effects observed for RMR and RER values since recent studies have shown that very short rest periods (as little as 5 min) produce reproducible results that correlate extremely well with RMR measures made over much longer time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is also unlikely that the use of a subset (n = 24) of the total subject population can explain the failure to observe any metabolic changes since analysis of the 24 subjects found that they responded similar to the entire group in regards to body composition changes. It remains unclear why the increased lean mass observed following fish oil treatment did not correspond to an increase in RMR.</p><p>Intuitively it would make sense that if fat mass was reduced, but resting metabolic rate did not change following fish oil treatment, then the amount of calories coming from the oxidation of fatty acids should be increased. However, this was not the case in the present study. Although there was an absolute reduction in the RER following fish oil treatment (which would indicate an increased oxidation of fatty acids), the difference was not statistically significant. While it is possible that a type II error was committed and the reduction in RER was a real effect, it is also possible that the fish oil treatment increased fat oxidation at other times during the day such as during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], or during the post-prandial period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>A potential shortcoming of the present study was not using dietary records to monitor the subjects' intake during the study. Although there are several potential problems with the use of dietary records (for a review of inaccuracies with self-recorded diet records see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]), they would have provided us with some insight into the dietary habits of the subjects during the study. It therefore remains a possibility that the fish oil supplements resulted in the subjects changing their normal dietary habits. Although increasing dietary fat does not generally cause a decrease in voluntary fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], it has been shown that fish oil may reduce appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which could have led to the subjects consuming less total calories during the study. While a reduction in volitional food intake would explain the observed reduction in fat mass following fish oil treatment, it does not explain the increase in lean mass we observed.</p><p>Although other studies have observed a significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], or insignificant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], increase in lean mass following fish oil treatment, to date no study has determined the mechanism by which dietary fish oil causes an increased accretion of lean mass. One possibility lies in the well-documented ability of dietary omega 3 fatty acids to reduce inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], since inflammatory cytokines have the ability to increase protein degradation mainly by activating the ATP-ubiquitin-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is possible then, that dietary fish oil is simply decreasing the breakdown of protein tissue caused by inflammatory cytokines, and this results in an increased accretion of protein over time.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that fish oil supplementation was able to increase lean mass by reducing cortisol levels since it is well established that cortisol increases protein catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The significant negative correlation (r = -0.504, p = 0.02) observed in the fish oil group between the change in lean mass and the change in salivary cortisol concentrations would support this hypothesis. Although other studies have observed a decrease in cortisol levels following fish oil consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the exact mechanism(s) responsible are currently unknown. However, it is possible that the reduction of IL-6 as a result of fish oil consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] is causing a reduction in cortisol production since it has been shown that IL-6 induces increases in cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It is unclear whether it is the well-documented ability of fish oil to reduce inflammatory cytokines, the reduction in cortisol, or a combination of both, that resulted in the increased lean mass observed in the present study following fish oil treatment. More work is needed to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the accretion of lean mass following fish oil consumption.</p><p>The role of cortisol in obesity is poorly understood. Excessive cortisol levels, such as those observed in patients with Cushing's disease, results in substantial fat mass gains - especially in the abdominal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, there is disagreement between studies about the relationship between values of cortisol that are within a normal physiological range, and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, several studies have shown an association with higher levels of cortisol and fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In the present study, there was a significant correlation between the change in salivary cortisol and the change in fat mass following fish oil treatment (r = 0.661, p = 0.001). Recent work by Purnell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] has shown that a reduction in fat mass as a result of dieting does not lower cortisol production, which would suggest that the relationship observed in the present study between salivary cortisol and fat mass was not simply a result of the reduction in fat mass. However, further work is needed to determine exactly how the reduction in cortisol levels may have influenced fat loss observed in the FO group.</p><p>In conclusion, 6 weeks of supplemental fish oil significantly increased lean mass, and significantly reduced fat mass in healthy adults. Given the short duration of this study, it is unclear how these changes would impact long-term body composition changes and more research is needed to determine the impact of chronic fish oil supplementation on long-term body composition. The reduction in salivary cortisol following fish oil treatment was significantly correlated with the increased fat free mass and the decreased fat mass observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this association has been described in the literature. Since higher salivary cortisol levels are associated with higher mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], the reduction in salivary cortisol levels observed in the present study following fish oil supplementation likely has significant implications beyond positive changes in body composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EEN was responsible for developing the concept and design of the study, data collection, statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.
