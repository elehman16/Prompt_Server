<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the
perineum to enlarge it. Perineal pain is the most common complaint of mothers after
episiotomy. Chamomile extract has been proposed as a sedative in traditional medicine.
This study was conducted to assess the effect of chamomile cream on the pain after
episiotomy. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This triple blind clinical trial was performed on
114 eligible women at Ommolbanin Hospital in Mashhad, Iran in 2014.They were randomly
assigned to two groups using random blocks. After delivery, mothers in the intervention
group used 0.5 g of prescribed chamomile while the control group used placebo cream on the
stitch twice a day lasting ten days. Episiotomy pain was evaluated before intervention and
12 hours after episiotomy repair and also on the first, seventh, tenth and fourteenth day
after delivery by McGill pain questionnaire. Data was analyzed by SPSS ver.13.</p><p>
<bold><italic> Results:</italic></bold> There was no significant difference between the
two groups before the intervention, 12 hours and the first day after delivery. However, a
significant difference was found on the seventh, tenth and fourteenth day after delivery.
McGill mean (SD) score on the seventh, tenth and fourteenth in experimental group was
11.36 (5.04), 4.44 (3.43) and 7.16 (4.10) respectively. It was reported 14.88 (7.34),
7.41(4.92) and 9.96 (4.81) in placebo group, respectively. </p><p>

improves maternal and neonatal outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>It is one of the most common medical procedures
performed on women in Iran, which have been reported 88.3% at Ommolbanin hospital of
Mashhad, in 2006.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Also Khajavi et al.,
reported that the prevalence of episiotomy is 97.3% in primiparous women in Tehran, Iran
which is higher than other countries.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> Although its routine use in childbirth has steadily declined in recent decades, it is
still widely practiced in Asian countries. It could be explained because of the short
perineal and sturdy tissue of Asian women. Little research has been yet conducted on
episiotomy.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>Khajavi et al., reported
that Medio-lateral episiotomy is widely used in Iran despite its disadvantages.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> The most common complaint of episiotomy is perineal pain.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>Khajavi et al., showed that perineal pain in the first, tenth,
fortieth and ninetieth day after birth was 96.4%, 63%, 25% and 12%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Episiotomy Pain is always difficult and
stressful for primiparous women, which has several negative aspects such as negative effect
on the first experience of motherhood, mothers' inability to care the infant,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> delay in mother-infant communication, insomnia,
fatigue, confusion, anxiety, and ignoring health educations in relation to maternal- infant
care.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> Thus, we have to recover women more quickly after childbirth by removing their perineal
pain and discomfort.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Drug or non-drug
methods are used to reduce the perineal pain.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Non-drug methods include using hot and cold compression, and salt water or
diluted Savlone in the bathroom.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Drug
methods such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Despite empirical evidence of drug treatments,
some issues should be considered in selecting them such as: pain intensity, constipation
property, digestive problems, risks and possible complications of baby through the breast
milk.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Drug treatments make high
costs for consumer and the health care system as well as it has more side effects.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p> World Health Organization (WHO) has a great emphasis on using herbal medicine because of
complications of chemical drugs. Currently, finding the most effective method with minimal
complications, availability and easily acceptance by women has always been considered by
researchers.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p> Chamomile is one of the plants that are currently used in Iranian traditional medicine as
an analgesic, which contains 120 chemical compositions including &#x003b1;-bisabolol, bisabolol
oxides, spiro-ethers, chamazulene and flavonoids.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Episiotomy pain often caused by inflammation and edema.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Due to the strong anti-inflammatory effect of
chamomile which has been mentioned in several studies, <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, it seems that chamomile could be used as a pain killer by reducing
edema and inflammation in the first days after delivery.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In addition to the mechanisms in inhibiting the prostaglandin synthesis
in reducing pain, other painless mechanisms are also possible.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p> Based on the importance of reducing episiotomy pain, the complications &#x0200e;of chemical drugs,
the general trend towards herbal medicine, the researchers decided to conduct a study on the
effect of chamomile cream on episiotomy pain and provide more favorable services by using
its findings to ensure maternal health&#x0200f;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This triple blind clinical trial was done on 114 eligible women admitted to Ommolbanin
hospital in Mashhad, Iran. To determine the sample size based on a preliminary study, the
mean and deviation of the 10<sup>th</sup> day were obtained in experimental group 0.87
(0.90) and in control group 0.56 (1.10).</p><p> After the approval of the ethics committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, The
study was registered in the Iranian registry center of clinical trials with
IRCT2013051413336N1 code.</p><p> Dried chamomile flowers (Matricaria Chamomile) was purchased from Zardband Company of
Tehran and its identity was confirmed by herbarium&#x000a0;Lab of Mashhad Pharmacy&#x000a0;School. For
making Chamomile extract, 60 gr of crushed chamomile which made by mill was poured in to
each thimble and extracted with 70% alcohol by Soxhlet extractor and then after removing the
solvent by rotary evaporator, concentrated extract was prepared in the laboratory of
Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad. Then concentrated extract was weighed and its
efficiency was obtained and according to Charousaei and Dabirian,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> chamomile cream 1.3% was made of the combination of chamomile
extract with cold cream and placebo cream containing simple foundation of cream (Cold Cream)
by the pharmacist and were coded (code A and B&#x0200f;(.Tubes of chamomile and placebo creams were
similar in appearance. Encoded process was done by the pharmacist. It should be mentioned
that participants, statistical analysts, researcher and research assistant were unaware of
codes until the end of the study.</p><p> The inclusion criteria of this study were as following: Primiparous women aged 18-35
years, vaginal delivery with episiotomy, living with her husband, body mass index in the
range of 19.8-30, absence of disease impaired wound healing, not using drugs affecting wound
healing, singleton pregnancy with cephalic presentation, lack of symptomatic infection of
the vagina and vulva (infectious discharge, itching, and irritant), no revealed
abnormalities in the baby, no severe rectocele or cystocele (grade 2 or higher), no septum
or mass in vagina, no obstetric problem history, not using sedative for 4 hours before
delivery and no reconstructive surgery history of the vagina and the perineum.</p><p> The exclusion criteria were as following: the presence of disorder in the progress of
labor, duration of second stage of labor for more than 2 hours, extension of the incision
area and turning into grade 3 or 4 tear or rupture except episiotomy tear, abnormal vaginal
bleeding, shoulder dystocia (when maneuvers used to relieve shoulder dystocia except Mac
Robert maneuver), expulsion the placenta by hand, hematoma formation, having sexual
intercourse until end of the study (15 days postpartum), curettage or resection within the
first 24 hours after delivery, undesired events during the first 14 days after delivery,
using cream regularly, having puerperal fever, infection of the episiotomy area, need to
suturing again and complications arising from the use of chamomile cream&#x0200f; .</p><p> In this study, data were gathered by questionnaires including base information and
examination results (selection form of the subjects, forms of delivery stages and
episiotomy, daily form of sedative, antibiotics consumption, health and nutrition care,
etc.), constipation assessment scale in pregnancy and Short-form McGill Pain
Questionnaire&#x0200f;.</p><p> The validity of the base information and examination and the constipation assessment form
was confirmed by content validity. The validity of Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire was
determined by criterion-related validity on 10 participants. Thus, the ability of the
instrument to measure episiotomy pain compared to the pain visual tool (correlation
coefficient r=0.85).</p><p> The reliability of the selection form and daily data entry form were confirmed. The
reliability of labor stages forms and episiotomy information were confirmed with the
assessor agreement (r= 0.89, r=0.94). The reliability of Short-form McGill Pain
Questionnaire was approved by internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) (r =0.91). In
addition, the reliability of Constipation Assessment Scale has been confirmed by Brusard and
Brend (1998, r =0.92)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and Tabatabai
Chehr (2001, r =0.82) in pregnant women.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p> The procedure were as following: after the approval of the ethics committee of Mashhad
University of Medical Sciences (code 911324), the purposes of the study was explained to
eligible women referred to Ommolbanin hospital. They were selected by simple sampling method
and then they were randomly assigned into two groups A or B using random blocks after
obtaining informed consent.</p><p> Delivery stages care, delivery, repair of episiotomy was done by the researcher assistant.
After expulsion the placenta and repair of episiotomy in lithotomy position, information
about the baby, episiotomy incision size, type of yarn used and the number of stitches were
recorded. After repair of episiotomy, the researcher gave the necessary training about
stitch and perineum care, personal hygiene, how to complete daily information form (such as
sedative and antibiotics consumption, using cream for the stitches, hygiene, nutrition and
physical activity) to the mothers. Also educational pamphlet was given to them. An encoded
package cream was given to the mothers 2 hours after episiotomy recovery and they were
taught how to use it. They had to rub 0.5gr of the cream (in the size of knuckle) on the
stitches after washing their hands and perineum so that it completely covers the surface of
the wound and repeat it twice a day (every 12 hours) to ten days. Pain in the perineal area
were evaluated immediately before the intervention (2 hours after perineal repair), 12 hours
after the complete repair of episiotomy and on 1<sup>st</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> ,
10<sup>th</sup> days after delivery and also 14<sup>th</sup> day (if there was any
moderate to severe pain on tenth day after birth).</p><p> Mothers completed short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire to assess episiotomy pain. The
questionnaire consisted of three parts: sensory-emotional-verbal descriptions (in the range
of painless to severe pain), Visual Pain Scale (0-10 scores) and pain intensity (in the
range of painless to severe pain). The total score of pain is equal to the total score
obtained in almost all categories in different aspects of pain, which is in the rage of 0-60
scores. Omitting variables of the study were evaluated on 7<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>,
and 14<sup>th</sup> days after delivery.</p><p> Data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 13. The normality of data were determined by using the
Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. To compare the two groups in terms of quantitative variables with
normal distribution, independent t-test in with non-normal distribution Mann-Whitney test
was used. To compare the groups in terms of qualitative&#x02013; ordinal variables, the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used and for qualitative&#x02013; nominal variables, Chi-square test was
applied. To compare the quantitative variables changes in the two groups, repeated measures
were used. P&#x0003c;0&#x0200f;.05 was considered significant&#x0200f;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> During the study (May- November 2013), 16 patients were excluded due to the elimination
criteria (7 patients in the control group and 9 in the intervention group due to not using
the cream regularly, not referring and access to the researcher, infection and the need for
suturing again). Finally, 98 patients completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p> The analysis was conducted on the 48 patients in the control group and 50 patients in the
intervention group (per protocol or on treatment analysis). The difference between two
groups was not statistically significant in terms of characteristics such as age, education,
socioeconomic status, characteristics of pregnancy, doing strengthening exercises, pelvic
floor muscle and other intervening variables during labor such as fatigue and hunger in the
second stage of labor, disturbance in progress of the first stage of labor, duration of
second and third stage of labor, the number of vaginal examinations for first and second
stage of labor, fetal head position at birth, the interval time between injection of
lidocaine and episiotomy incision, information about the baby weight, sex and height, pain
during urinating and defecating, having constipation, antibiotics consumption, hygiene care,
nutrition, physical activity in the first and 10<sup>th</sup> days after delivery and other
variables related to episiotomy (P&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table

(P= 0.16), 12 hours after episiotomy recovery (P=0.38) and the first day after delivery
(P=0.11) using t-test showed that there was no significant difference between two groups,
but episiotomy pain on the 7<sup>th</sup> day (P=0.03), the 10<sup>th</sup> day (P=0.02) and
14<sup>th</sup> days after delivery (P=0.03) were significant between two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>&#x0200f;). Comparison of mean scores of episiotomy pain
between two groups using ANOVA with repeated measures indicated that the episiotomy pain
intensity in patients treated with chamomile cream was decreased on the seventh day, tenth
and fourteenth days after delivery compared to patients treated with placebo (P=0.05) .</p><p> Mann-Whitney test showed that none of the sensory and affective components of pain before
the intervention, 12 hours after episiotomy recovery, the first and fourteen days after
delivery were significantly different in two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05), except irritant pain on the
first day (P=0.04) and fourteenth day (P=0.03) and the sensitivity on the first day (P=0.03)
and fourteenth day (P=0.04) had significant differences between the two groups&#x0200f;.</p><p> Considering sensory components of episiotomy pain based on the Mann-Whitney test showed
that irritant pain, being sensitive on the seventh and tenth day, heaviness feeling on
seventh day and cramp pain on tenth day after delivery were significantly different in the
two groups (P&#x0003c;0.05). Among emotional components, tormentor pain on the tenth day after
delivery was significantly different between two groups (P&#x0003c;0.05&#x0200f;).</p><p> In this study, the rate of using gelofen tablet, diclofenac, indomethacin and
acetaminophen suppository was not significantly different between the two groups. But the
amount of acetaminophen tablet was significantly lower in patients treated with chamomile
cream than the placebo group (P=0.001). It appears that Chamomile cream decreases the need
for sedative by reducing pain&#x0200f;.</p><p> In present study, there was no report on side effects of using Chamomile cream and placebo
cream among mothers in both experimental and control groups. Mothers satisfaction of using
the cream on the seventh day after birth (P=0.05) was not significantly different between
the two groups, however on the tenth day after the birth, mothers had more satisfaction
about chamomile cream than placebo cream (P=0.03&#x0200f;).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of variables mean scores related to episiotomy in chamomile and placebo

hours after episiotomy recovery (P=0.38) and also on the first day after birth. Qnais showed
that chamomile extract at a dose of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg has dose-dependent analgesic
effect.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>The prevalence and the rate
of pain reported more in the first few days after birth. Khajavi et al., showed that
perineal pain were 96.4%, 63%, 25% and 12% in the first, tenth and fortieth and ninetieth
day after birth, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Also,
Macarthur et al., in the University of Toronto in Canada reported perineal pain 97% during
24 hours after delivery,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which is
similar to Khajavi et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In the present
study, 98% of patients complained perineal pain in the first 24 hours after delivery ranging
from 5-49 by McGill pain questionnaire which is similar to the other studies.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus,
it seems that patients require more analgesic drugs within the first day after birth.
Regarding to the dose-dependent analgesic effect of chamomile, it seems that the dose used
in this study for analgesic in the first 12 hours and the first day after birth was less
than the needed dose. The results of this study are coordinated with Pazandeh&#x02019;s et al.,
study these authors, reported that chamomile essence has not reduced episiotomy pain in the
first 12 hours after delivery.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p> The findings of this study showed that the use of chamomile cream was effective for pain
relief on seventh (P =0.03), tenth (P =0.02) and fourteen days (P =0.03) after delivery .The
mean pain score in seventh and tenth days after delivery in the placebo group versus
chamomile group was 1&#x0200f;.3 (the pain score on the seventh day in chamomile group was 11.36
(5.04) versus 14.88 (7.34) in control group and on the tenth day after delivery in chamomile
group was 7.10 (4.10) versus 9.96 (4.81). The mean pain score on the fourteen day in placebo
group versus chamomile group was 1.7. In present study, chamomile may be effective through
several mechanisms (opioidergic, serotonergic, anti-inflammatory) in analgesia. As a result,
several studies have raised the possibility of analgesic effect of chamomile through
opioidergic.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> In this regard, Mohebali et al., showed that Chamomile in both phases of the Formalin test
has analgesic effect on mice. In the first phase, its analgesic effect is caused by
mechanisms in the central nervous system. The second phase of the formalin test is partly
due to the inflammation process.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>there
are some evidences that shows extract effect is somewhat similar to receptor antagonists of
serotonergic in reducing pain; of course, the extent of this effect and its similarity
depends on the amount of Germacranolide and Parthenolide in the extract. Therefore, it is
possible that part of the nociceptive is applied through serotonergic system.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p> The anti-inflammatory effect of Chamomile essence is due to inhibitory effect of Chamomile
essences especially Bisabolol and Chamazulene on Cyclooxygenase and Lipooxygenase
enzymes.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p> According to the reports, acquired lakton from Chamomile contains Epoxyartemurin and
Partenolid which have preventing effects on creating components resulting in Arachidonic
Acid that is Thromboxane B2 and Leukotriene.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>Epigenin in the extract has analgesic effect and also has interference
with the body's Histamine system and cause reversible inhibition and dose-dependent
inflammation of the skin.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p> Pain, warmth, redness, swelling and loss of function are some local signs of
inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the present study,
it seems that chamomile, because of its strong anti-inflammatory properties, has relieved
episiotomy pain by reducing pain mediators in the inflammatory part and reducing
inflammatory Prostaglandins and due to its anti-inflationary property resulting from
Azulene, Chamazulene, Alpha Bisabolol essence<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> by reducing swelling and inflammation in the first days after birth.
Modarres et al., showed that the severity of menstrual pain was significantly lower in the
group taking Chamomile capsules than the group taking Mefenamic acid capsules two days after
using drugs in the first month of treatment (P&#x0003c;0.001) and the second month of
treatment(P&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p> These results confirmed that analgesic effect of chamomile is aligned.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In Charousaei&#x02019;s &#x00026; Dabirian study stoma
symptoms(pain, itching) was removed in group, which used Chamomile compresses twice a day,
more than the group using Hydrocortisone 1% cream.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Confirming the analgesic effect of aromatherapy with chamomile, Lim
&#x00026; Lee showed that inhalation aromatherapy for ten minutes after tonsillectomy, with a
mixture of Lavender and Chamomile oil in the ratio1: 2, reduces the amount of perceived pain
, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the heart beating.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p> Pazandeh et al., used Chamomile essence produced by steam distillation method to reduce
episiotomy pain; participants poured 3 drops of Chamomile essence in two liters of warm
water and used it 2 times a day for 20 minutes during 2 weeks as aromatherapy while sitting
in bath. The result showed that Chamomile essence has not lessened episiotomy pain in the
first 12 hours after birth and in 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> days after
birth,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which is not consistent with
the results of the present study. This difference could be related to the differences in the
type, quality and quantity of the prescribed herbal medication&#x0200f;.</p><p> McGill pain tools describe pain in 3 dimentions: sensory, emotional and evaluative. Based
on our results, irritant pain and sensitivity 24 hours after labor and on the seventh, tenth
and fourteenth days after delivery, feeling of heaviness on the seventh day and cramp pain
on the tenth day was significantly lower in mothers using Chamomile cream than ones using
the placebo cream. In the present study, Chamomile may lead to reduction in sensitivity and
cramp pain and heaviness feeling through softening and moisturizing wound skin, as well as
its anti-inflammatory effects resulting from &#x003b1;-bisabolol and chamazulene essence and its
anti-spasmodic effect resulting from flavonoids and comarin.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Sahba and Mohammadalipour found that Chamomile mouth wash
reduces the needed time for controlling pain and irritant feeling,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> that is in line with the results of the present study.</p><p> In traditional books, consuming Chamomile products as external use has been also
recommended for softening necrosis and granulated tissue (rigid tissue), swelling,
inflammation, ulcer guard and skin rash.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Chamomile is also a key ingredient in creams
used to treat eczema<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and used as an
emollient for hairs.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p> The limitations of this study were as follows: individual and genetic differences,
impossibility of monitoring the use of creams and observing personal hygiene. Although it
was attempted to control them by providing similar training and giving pamphlets to
mothers&#x0200f;.</p><p> It is recommended to evaluate the effect of Chamomile with more doses on reduction of
episiotomy pain on the first day after delivery as well as the effect of Chamomile cream
prepared by the soxhlet method comparing to the Percolated method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> This study confirms analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of this plant which has been
reported in traditional medicine text books&#x0200f;. Since Chamomile cream reduces episiotomy pain
and no significant side effect has been reported by mothers, and also because in recent
years the tendency of people to use herbal medicine has been increased, Chamomile cream
could be used as a pain killer of episiotomy in primiparous women to improve the quality of
obstetric services&#x0200f;.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> We thanks to the Deputy of Research and ethics Committee of the University, staff of
