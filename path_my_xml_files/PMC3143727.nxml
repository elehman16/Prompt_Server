                walking endurance and decreased functional mobility are some of the more serious
                        disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215510381167">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215510381167">2</xref></sup>
                Some authors also reported that at a given speed, hemiplegic patients spend more
                energy per unit of distance travelled than healthy individuals do.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215510381167">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215510381167">4</xref></sup> In addition, Bohannon <italic>et

                walking in the community as one of the most important goals of rehabilitation.</p><p>Hemiplegic shoulder pain is also common after a stroke. It adversely affects the
                recovery of arm function and independence in the activities of daily
                        living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215510381167">6</xref></sup> Although the relationship between subluxation and hemiplegic
                shoulder pain remains unclear, various techniques are commonly used to correct this
                subluxation, including slings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215510381167">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215510381167">8</xref></sup>
                and neuromuscular electric stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215510381167">9</xref></sup> Arm slings have various
                purposes, including realigning scapular symmetry, supporting the forearm in a flexed
                arm position, improving anatomic alignment with an auxiliary support and supporting
                the shoulder with a cuff. Despite some uncertainty about their efficacy and timing
                of use, arm slings are still the most preferred treatment modality for shoulder
                subluxation in patients with hemiplegia with stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215510381167">10</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, there has been only one report about the effect of arm sling on
                gait of hemiplegic patients. Yavuzer and Ergin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215510381167">11</xref></sup> reported that an arm sling
                improved gait pattern using kinematic and kinetic parameters, especially during gait
                training sessions of patients with hemiplegia who have impaired body image and
                excessive motion of the centre of gravity. However, no study on the impact of arm
                sling on energy efficiency in hemiplegia has yet been reported. On the basis of
                previous study, it is hypothesized that shoulder support by an arm sling improves
                not only gait pattern but also the energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.
                This study was designed to investigate the effect of shoulder support by an arm
                sling on gait speed and energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-0269215510381167"><title>Methods</title><p>Enrolled subjects were 47 consecutive outpatients with hemiparesis caused by stroke.
                Inclusion criteria for hemiparetic patients were (a) first cerebrovascular accident
                verified by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, (b) ability to
                understand and follow commands, (c) ambulatory before stroke, (d) no medical

                neurologic problems other than stroke, or were currently receiving medications known
                to affect balance or gait, or refused the participation of present study. After

                shoulder forearm support was designed and turned out to prevent glenohumeral
                subluxation and stabilize the shoulder joint more effectively than a Bobath sling or

                heart rate difference from prewalking was less than 5 beats/min, patients started
                the second walk with the same method. A crossover design was used because a blinded

                was significantly increased with the arm sling. The mean and standard deviation of
                resting O<sub>2</sub> rate of all patients was 2.9 and 0.8&#x02009;mL/kg min. The
                    O<sub>2</sub> rate in hemiplegic patients with the arm sling was significantly
                reduced by 7%, compared to walking without the arm sling (5.8&#x02009;mL/kg
                min and 6.2&#x02009;mL/kg min, respectively). The O<sub>2</sub> cost in hemiplegic
                patients walking without the arm sling was 1.5 times greater than walking with it
                (0.2&#x02009;mL/kg&#x02009;m and 0.3&#x02009;mL/kg&#x02009;m, respectively).</p><p>When patients were stratified according to their demographic and clinical
                characteristics, such as gender, type of stroke, hemiparetic side, spasticity, motor
                skill, onset duration, shoulder pain and subluxation, there were no significant
                differences of heart rate, gait speed, O<sub>2</sub> rate and O<sub>2</sub>
                cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-0269215510381167"><title>Discussion</title><p>Human locomotion involves smooth advancement of the body through space with the least

                patients with stroke is characterized by asymmetry in stride times and stride

                in hemiplegic patients, it was reported that the energy expenditure was increased
                during performance of activities of daily living (ADL) due to the impairment of
                cardiopulmonary functions, therefore, the cardiovascular loading was also
                        increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215510381167">23</xref></sup></p><p>Given the above background, we speculated that minimization of unnecessary energy
                expenditure and cardiovascular loading during gait would be important for gait
                rehabilitation in patients with stroke. Although there has been controversy on the
                efficiency of an arm sling for treatment of shoulder subluxation or pain, it was
                reported that an arm sling improved gait pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215510381167">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we conducted this
                study and, to our knowledge, it is the first to report the beneficial effect of an
                arm sling on the direct energy expenditure in hemiplegic patient while walking.</p><p>The measurement of heart rate has been reported to be useful in large studies
                including the elderly, hemiplegic and cardiovascular patients because it is simple
                to perform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215510381167">24</xref></sup>
                In the present study, although mean heart rate was significantly decreased as
                compared with baseline following the application of an arm sling, it seemed not to
                be of clinical importance as the difference was too small. However, this tendency
                implies that the application of an arm sling may reduce the cardiovascular loading
                during gait in patients with hemiplegia, which also suggests that an arm sling could
                be an effective tool for gait training in patients with hemiplegia.</p><p>Gait speed has a crucial effect on independence in patients with hemiplegia and may
                vary depending on the authors, but has mostly been reported to be
                        25&#x02013;40&#x02009;m/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215510381167">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215510381167">26</xref></sup> Robinett and

                healthy people averaged 44.5&#x02009;m/min. With regard to arm slings, Yavuzer and
                        Ergin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215510381167">11</xref></sup> reported that the gait speed and stance period of the paretic
                side increased, double support time of the paretic side decreased, excursion of the
                centre of gravity decreased and weight bearing of the paretic side increased in
                hemiplegic patients while using the arm sling.</p><p>In the present study, hemiplegic patients without an arm sling walked on an even
                level at their comfortable gait speed; the gait speed of this level
                (30.1&#x02009;m/min, 1.81&#x02009;km/h) is similar to slow speed walking
                (2&#x02009;km/h) in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215510381167">28</xref></sup> Although the gait speed
                following the application of an arm sling was also within slow speed walking level
                (32.7&#x02009;m/min, 1.96&#x02009;km/h), it increased significantly compared with
                the non-application group. In stroke patients, gait rehabilitation, including
                increase of gait speed, is essential for the performance of independent ADL.
                Therefore, the result of the present study suggests that an arm sling may be a
                useful modalities in gait rehabilitation.</p><p>Most of the studies on the effect of supplemental aids on oxygen consumption and
                energy expenditure have been conducted with a main focus on the lower extremities.
                Study of the effect of supplemental aids for upper extremities on oxygen consumption
                and energy expenditure is rare. Hanada and Kerrigan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215510381167">29</xref></sup> reported that arm
                immobilization did not increase energy expenditure during level walking at a
                comfortable gait speed in a healthy person. On the other hand, Kim <italic>et
                    al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215510381167">28</xref></sup> reported that arm restriction while walking resulted in
                significant changes in energy consumption. Oxygen rate with arm restriction was
                significantly increased during fast walking (6&#x02009;km/h), but the oxygen
                consumption rate with arm restriction was not changed while walking at a comfortable
                speed (4&#x02009;km/h) and was significantly decreased during slow speed walking
                (2&#x02009;km/h). Although subjects were healthy people and arm restriction rather
                than shoulder support using an arm sling was attempted, these findings were in
                agreement with the results of the present study that O<sub>2</sub> rate and
                    O<sub>2</sub> cost decreased following the application of an arm sling. Because
                oxygen consumption has been an indicator for measuring the work efficiency and has
                shown consistent values with no respect to the age, sex and exercise

                efficiency was significantly improved following the application of an arm sling.</p><p>In our clinic, arm slings &#x02013; usually Kang&#x02019;s Multi-support &#x02013;
                are given to patients with hemiplegia during the flaccid period of the paretic upper
                extremity. Lee <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215510381167">31</xref></sup> reported that Kang&#x02019;s
                Multi-support was helpful in reducing weight asymmetry compared with no sling or a
                cuff-type sling and that it improved the standing balance of hemiplegic patients
                because it contacts the patient&#x02019;s body surface more than a cuff-type sling
                or no sling. Therefore, we have applied Kang&#x02019;s Multi-support to hemiplegic
                patients with stroke to support paretic arm. Because hemiplegic patients with an
                impaired body image are unaware of the location of their body weight line and they
                do not have any sense of instability, they fail to make any postural adjustments so
                the arm sling may serve as a feedback tool and remind the patient&#x02019;s arm to
                help postural adjustments. It may also help hemiparetic patients with attention
                deficit or neglect pay more attention and position the paretic arm
                        correctly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215510381167">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215510381167">32</xref></sup></p><p>Many therapists do not want hemiparetic patients to use walking aids such as canes or

                study by Yavuzer and Ergin, the results of the present study suggest that
                application of an arm sling affects the gait efficiency in hemiplegic patients
                positively.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the sample size was relatively
                small. Therefore, the results of present study may not be clinically relevant
                although they seemed to be a statistically significant. Second, because the present
                study was conducted for short period, generalization of these results was
                inconclusive unless further studies on long-term effect of arm sling on hemiplegic
                gait are performed. However, the present study does use clinical results to suggest
                that hemiplegic arm support with an arm sling results in improvement of gait in
                hemiplegic patients. In addition, the present study also provides objective data on
                arm slings which have been controversial over their usefulness in hemiplegic
                patients. To clarify the effectiveness of an arm sling for hemiplegic patients,
                further study considering these limitations is needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-0269215510381167"><title>Clinical messages</title><p>
