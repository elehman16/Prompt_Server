In the study group (n=45), 17-B estradiol transdermal patches 100 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic> were applied from the second day of the cycle and continued every other day. Then, each patch was removed after four days. In the control group (n=45), oral estradiol valerate 6 <italic>mg</italic> was started at the same time and continued daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was a significant difference in estradiol level on the day of progesterone administration and the day of embryo transfer between the two groups (p= 0.001 in both), but no significant difference was observed between them in biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates (32.6% <italic>vs</italic>. 33.3%, p=1.000 and 30.2% <italic>vs</italic>. 33.3%, p=0.810, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It is suggested that estradiol transdermal patches be used instead of oral estradiol in FET cycles.

There are two major problems associated with <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF), including ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Also, diminished pregnancy rate in IVF and/or embryo-transfer (ET) cycles is the consequence of uterine refractoriness due to higher estrogen levels (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, cryopreservation of embryos is a required strategy to avoid iatrogenic problems (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), which is one of the methods currently used as a safe approach to improve pregnancy rates (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The pregnancy outcome of FET is identified to be dependent on some clinical and embryological features such as the age of woman at the time of cryopreservation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), cause of infertility (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the technique of oocyte fertilization (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the developmental phase of embryos at freezing (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the embryo quality before freezing (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), the level of estradiol and endometrial thickness at the time of transfer (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the degree of embryo damage after thawing (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and the resumption of post-thaw blastomere divisions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Implantation is one of the key stages for the success of ART (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Its success depends on three main factors including embryo quality, endometrial receptivity (ER), and synchrony between embryo and endometrium (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Cryo-thaw cycles are done with various regimens of exogenous estrogen and progesterone used for endometrial preparation.</p><p>Different methods have been tried to prepare the endometrium in FET cycles, but the best regimen is not known yet (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Endometrial receptivity can be affected by exogenously administered estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P) in various regimens and in either way, oral or parenteral (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Estradiol priming has been shown to cause proliferation of endometrial cells in the basal layer that induce p receptors (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Adequate E2 priming of the endometrium results in endometrial proliferation and the induction of appropriate P receptors to induce endometrial receptivity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The oral route of estrogen is simple and well-tolerated (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). After oral administration, E2 is extensively metabolized by the intestinal mucosa and then the liver. Ingested E2 is easily converted to estrone (E1) and estrone sulfate (E1S), with steady-state E1 levels around 3&#x02013;6 folds higher than those of E2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Significantly less of transdermally absorbed E2 is converted to E1, with E1/E2 ratio of 1 to 2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The first-pass hepatic metabolism can be avoided by using parenteral routes of transdermal, intramuscular (IM), or vaginal type (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The transdermal route is easy and rather useful with low side effects and can be exploited by patients themselves (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Transdermal routes were used extensively in hormone replacement therapy in menopausal patients (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In addition, the transdermal route yields the most steady-state levels and has been proposed to be preferred over oral routes for induction of endometrial receptivity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to compare two methods of endometrial preparation for FET, oral estradiol and 17&#x000df;-estradiol transdermal patch.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study design and participants:</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of Yazd Research and Clinical Center for Infertility affiliated to Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences. The registration ID number, IRCT2012112610328N2, was recorded on Nov 14, 2012.</p><p>A total number of 90 patients who underwent frozen -thawed embryo transfer cycles were enrolled in this study. They referred to Yazd Research and Clinical Center of Infertility between April 2012 and Jan 2013.</p><p>The patients were given sufficient information to provide written informed consent. All the women underwent either conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Also, embryo cryopreservation was done. It is to be noted that, in the embryo freezing and thawing protocols, the catheters used for embryo transfer were the same.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization:</title><p>Eligible women were randomly assigned to two groups in a ratio of 1:1 by means of computer-generated random numbers. As for the inclusion criteria, all the women who had frozen embryos from previous IVF cycles and had at least two top-quality embryos appropriate for cryopreservation were included in the experiment. Top-quality embryos were defined as day-2 embryos having four or more equally sized and shaped blastomeres, with &#x0003c;10% fragmentation without multinucleation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Age over 20 and under 40 years and FSH less than 12 were the other inclusion criteria.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included polycystic ovarian syndrome, endocrine or metabolic disorder, endometriosis, embryos derived from donated gametes, any underlying diseases (kidney, liver or heart diseases), and bad-quality embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocols:</title><p>All the patients selected for the research were primed for a frozen transfer using two different ways of exogenous steroid therapy. In the study group with transdermal route (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) (n=45), 100 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic> of 17-B estradiol transdermal patch (Novartis, Turkey) was applied every other day from the second day of menstruation cycle, and each patch was removed after four days. In the control group with oral route (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (n=45), at the time of cycle, 6 <italic>mg</italic> of oral estradiol valerate (Aburaihan, Iran) was started daily. In both groups, clinical monitoring was done by transvaginal ultrasound from the 11th day of the cycle to measure endometrial thickness. If endometrial thickness was less than 7.5 <italic>mm</italic>, oral estradiol dosage was increased to 8 <italic>mg</italic> and transdermal patches to 200 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic> every other day. If endometrial thickness was 7.5 or more, 100 <italic>mg</italic> of progesterone in oil (Aburaihan, Iran) was administered IM on a daily basis. ET was done after three days.</p></sec><sec><title>Embryo Transfer:</title><p>Cryopreservation and thawing protocols were used through vitrification by the Cryotop method on days 2 or 3 after retrieval. In this study, embryos were morphologically similar in both groups before cryopreservation.</p><p>Cryopreserved early cleavage (EC)-stage embryos were thawed one day before the transfer and cultured overnight. If at least 50% of the blastomeres were intact on the day of thawing and overnight cleavage of at least one blastomere took place, embryo transfer was done.</p><p>Both the embryo stage (<italic>i.e.</italic> number of blastomeres
) and grade (<italic>i.e.</italic> degree of fragmentation and blastomere regularity
) were recorded for each transferred embryo. The number of transferred embryos depended on the embryo quality and the patient&#x02019;s age. One to three embryos were transferred by a Labotect catheter (Labotect, Germany).</p><p>For luteal support in the control group, the patients received estradiol valerate 6 <italic>mg/day</italic> and progesterone 100 <italic>mg</italic> IM per day. In the study group, the patients were given transdermal patches 100 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic> every other day as described and progesterone 100 <italic>mg</italic> IM per day. Serum B-hCG level was checked 14 days after ET. If it was positive, vaginal or abdominal sonography was performed two to three weeks later to identify the number of gestational sacs and presence of any fetal heart beats. Luteal support was continued up to the 10th week of gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures:</title><p>The primary outcome measure was endometrial thickness on the day of progesterone administration. The secondary outcome measures were chemical and clinical pregnancy, abortion rate, day of embryo transfer, and cycle cancellation rate. Through transvaginal sonography, endometrial thickness was measured as the distance between the two layers of endometrium. Chemical pregnancy was defined as the presence of serum B-HCG &#x02265;25 <italic>IU/L</italic> 14 days after embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy was determined as the presence of a gestational sac with heart beats identified by vaginal or abdominal ultrasound 4&#x02013;5 weeks after embryo transfer. The implantation rate was determined as the ratio of gestational sacs to the number of embryos transferred. Finally, abortion was regarded as pregnancy loss before twenty weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis:</title><p>The SPSS 19 package program (SPSS Inc, an IBM Company) was used to do all the statistical analyses. The normality of distribution of variables was tested by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Independent sample t-test was used for quantitative variables which were normally distributed and Mann-Whitney test for data which were not distributed normally. Also, Chi-squared and Fisher exact tests were used for qualitative variables. A two-sided p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data is shown as the mean&#x000b1;standard deviation and percentages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results were reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement. Of 188 women candidates for FET, 90 patients were enrolled in our study. There were no women lost to follow-up. However, due to an endometrial polyp, one patient was excluded of the study group. In the control group, three patients were excluded due to their thin endometrium. Therefore, totally four women were excluded from the final analysis. No cycle was cancelled due to the failure of the embryos to thaw or cleave successfully. The CONSORT statement flow diagram is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>

Implantation of embryos is critical in determining the success of assisted reproductive technology (ART) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A crucial factor for implantation in FET is accurate synchronization between endometrial maturation and embryo development (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This is in spite of transfer of high-quality embryos, the pregnancy rate may remain disappointingly low (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Receptivity of the endometrium is dependent on the hormonal status of the endometrium at the time of implantation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Our results showed a better rate of implantation in the study group, but it did not achieve statistical significance. In addition, there was no difference between the study and control groups regarding chemical and clinical pregnancy rate. On the other hand, different routes of oestrogen administration had a similar effect on endometrial thickness. Banz et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) evaluated artificial cycles with a transdermal estradiol patch in combination with the vaginal progesterone Crinone 8%. They concluded that, by this method, additional pregnancies can be achieved with minimal burden on the patients. Also, this method was suggested as a method of choice for endometrial preparation in FET cycles.</p><p>Joels et al. compared the effects of oral micronized E2 and transdermal estradiol on endometrial receptivity and concluded that endometrial glandular histology in the oral protocol was delayed by averagely 1.6 days in comparison to women that were given transdermal E2. Also, they revealed that the supra physiological levels of serum E2 may have unfavorable effects on endometrial receptivity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Luca et al. examined the efficacy of endometrial preparation with exogenous steroids, with/without pre-treatment using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in women with a normal ovarian function. They administered depot GnRH agonists for luteal phase support with 17&#x000df;-estradiol transdermal patches at steadily increasing dosage from 100 to 300 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic>. This treatment was given for at least 12 days. In another group, patients received 17&#x000df;-estradiol transdermal patches alone by starting at a dose of 200 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic>. This was increased to 300 <italic>&#x003bc;g</italic> after 7 days. It was concluded that the difference was not significant with regard to pregnancy (19.7% and 24.1%), abortion (17.8% and 11.7%), and implantation rate (10.4% and 11.9%) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>As for our results, no significant difference was seen in pregnancy rate in the two groups, but there emerged a lower pregnancy rate in the control group associated with a higher serum E2 level. The better implantation rates in the study group may be suggestive of higher synchronization between embryo and endometrial development, which improved the endometrial receptivity in this group (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with those of Joels who showed a high level of E2 may have unfavorable influences on endometrial receptivity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, they are in contrast to Banz&#x02019;s study in which he concluded that the estradiol serum level could not predict success (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The question is whether or not these higher E2 levels influence pregnancy rate. A high concentration of estrogen has mostly been viewed responsible for a lower pregnancy rate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A high E2 level in the proliferative phase leads to the regulation of progesterone receptors in the endometrium (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, the gene expression profiles of human endometrium might be adversely affected by high levels of E2 serum and/or progesterone. Endometrial receptivity and, consequently, implantation can be, thus, impaired (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence also proposes that &#x0201c;on-time&#x0201d; implantation is vital to successful pregnancy establishment in both humans and mice. Thus, a critical level of estrogen is essential in regulating the window of uterine receptivity for implantation in a P<sub>4</sub>-primed uterus by changing gene expression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>This proposes that uterine gene expression responsible for blastocyst implantation is sustained at a proper estrogen concentration and becomes refractory at higher levels of circulating E2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>So, these results support the theory that the window of uterine receptivity in ART cycles would be open for a prolonged period at lower estrogen levels but rapidly closes at higher endogenous estrogen levels (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), hence, limiting the time for the transferred embryos to implant successfully (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Since the first-pass hepatic metabolism can be avoided by the transdermal route, and significantly less of transdermally absorbed E2 is converted into E1, it yields the most steady-state levels of E2 and has been proposed to be preferred over the oral route for induction of endometrial receptivity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Shortening the time for endometrial preparation and subsequently early embryo transfer in our study resulted in decreased anxiety, duration of treatment cycle, cancellation rate, and costs. These results are in contrast to those gained by Navot et al. who reported a shortened preparation period (5&#x02013;10 days) led to lower pregnancy rates (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). On the other hand, our findings are in agreement with Krasnow&#x02019;s study, which concluded that the endometrial glandular histology in the oral protocol was delayed by an average of 1.6 days in comparison to the one among women given transdermal E2 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In our study, the drug was consumed at lower doses as compared to that reported by Banz and Krasnow (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed no significant differences in implantation, biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates between the two examined groups. However, it provided enough evidence that estradiol transdermal patches can be used instead of oral estradiol in FET cycles. This is due to the reduced costs, drug dosage and emotional stresses as well as the simplicity of the protocol for patients.It is hope that by further improvement in this area, this strategy will be of use in all FET cycles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to thank the vice chancellor of Yazd Research and Clinical Center for Infertility who supported this project financially.
