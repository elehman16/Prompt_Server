No placental passage and fine glucose level control are established benefits of insulin administration in pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] On the other hand, insulin usage has some disadvantages and doubts remain about insulin consumption inconveniences in pregnancy. These include the need for multiple injections, maternal hypoglycemic risk, higher maternal weight gain during pregnancy (possibly due to increased appetite), and increased treatment costs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have shown that an oral anti glycemic drug may not only have better maternal and fetal consequences but also could bring patients&#x02019; acceptance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Metformin has been introduced as an alternative drug for insulin in GDM treatment theoretically.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This agent induces less gluconeogenesis and higher peripheral glucose uptake. Reducing insulin resistance is of great concern as well.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Tertti <italic>et al</italic>., in 2008 after studying 173 patients with GDM concluded that metformin did not induce maternal hypoglycemia, excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and major fetal anomalies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In some other studies, it has been shown that metformin administration in GDM has not been accompanying neonatal disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Reviews of some studies comparing metformin and insulin in GDM show discrepancies about few complications.

On the other hand, results from these studies are not similar. Considering national concerns about GDM treatment in Iran, to date, it is not well accepted to subscribe any drug other than insulin for GDM treatment. So, for the first time in Iranian medical history this study was done in order to introduce an oral anti hyperglycemic agent to Iranian obstetricians.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate metformin outcomes in early neonatal period in neonates of women treated with this drug and comparing it with insulin taker outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this prospective, blinded randomized clinical parallel-group trial performed in Shabih Khani hospital, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, 200 pregnant women, 18 to 45 years old with a single fetus pregnancy and without any history or documented diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy and with gestational age of 24-34 weeks, were screened for GDM with glucose challenge test (GCT) (plasma glucose level test 1 h after oral intake of 50 grams glucose) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Any patient with impaired GCT was evaluated with a complementary test (glucose tolerance test, GTT: checking fasting blood sugar and BS of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> h after oral intake of 100 grams glucose).

Plasma glucose levels of fasting and 2 h after breakfast, lunch and dinner were recorded within one week. If FBS &#x0003e; 95 or BS 2h &#x0003e; 120 were obtained, it was assumed that lifestyle modifications had not been sufficient and necessitated drug administration.

Of 200 women enrolled in this study, 100 women were treated with insulin and 100 were treated with metformin. In metformin group 22 women required supplemental insulin to achieve target values of plasma glucose. These patients were excluded and replaced with new patients.

Plasma glucose target levels were defined as FBS &#x0003c; 95 mg/dl and BS 2h &#x0003c; 120 mg/dl. Patients in the metformin group (100 patients) received metformin tablets with an initial dosage of 500 mg/d and if necessary, dose adjustments were made up to 2500 mg/d. In insulin group (100 patients), insulin was administered with an initial dose of 0.5 IU/kg/d divided as 2/3 of total dose injected in the morning and 1/3 in the afternoon. Two third of total Insulin dosage was injected as NPH insulin and 1/3 as regular. If target levels of BS were not obtained, as any 10 mg/dl of glucose level more than target levels, 1 IU of NPH or regular insulin (depending on the time of impaired glucose intolerance) was added to initial insulin dose.

Insulin group infants were admitted in NICU about 2 folds more than metformin group infants. (RR = 2.35) Balani <italic>et al</italic>., reported similar results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] but Rowan <italic>et al</italic>., showed no statistical significance between groups related to admission.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] It is assumed that higher rate of NICU admission in the current study and Balani <italic>et al</italic>., study could be due to higher prevalence of preterm labor in these studies.</p><p>Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was significantly more in the insulin group in our study.

(<italic>P</italic> = 0.038) (RR = 2.5) this could be due to more preterm labors in the insulin group. Rowan <italic>et al</italic>., reported no statistically significant difference between groups on this topic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] This may be due to more immature lungs among preterm neonates in our study rather than study done by Rowan <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Neonatal hypoglycemia revealed no statistical significance between groups in our trial. Tertti <italic>et al</italic>., reported no statistical significance either.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] But, Rowan <italic>et al</italic>., reported lower rate of hypoglycemia in metformin group rather than insulin group. (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] This could be due to considering hypoglycemia as BS less than 28.8 mg/dL in the study of Rowan <italic>et al</italic>., and less than 35 mg/dL in current study.</p><p>Although, higher rates of anomalies were observed in the insulin group rather than metformin group neonates (3 vs. 0), but it revealed no statistical differences between groups in our study. Tertti <italic>et al</italic>., concluded in their trial that metformin does not result in great fetal anomalies but due to its passage via the placenta, it would be of concern.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This statement has been documented by Hawthorne, Rowan and Balani either.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>No statistical difference were observed among study groups related to infantile sepsis in this trial, as well as study performed by Rowan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>No case of stillbirth was observed in the current study, as well as Balani <italic>et al</italic>., study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Due to hepatic metabolism of metformin and its passage via the placenta, it could be doubtful whether it alters hepatic function of a newborn baby or not. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference among groups related to umbilical blood samples of AST, ALT and ALP levels. So, metformin may be of no danger to the liver in the fetus.</p><p>Evaluating degree of glucose control in days before delivery necessitated measuring HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the time of delivery. Although, statistical difference was observed between groups and metformin receivers had better glucose control, but mean values of both groups were within normal range of glucose control. This elucidates that metformin is as effective as insulin in controlling blood sugar level.</p><p>Long term side effects of metformin on newborns may be of great concern either. Recent data regarding this aspect show that after 2 years follow-up of children whose mothers had taken metformin or insulin for GDM control in Australia and New Zealand, children exposed to metformin had larger measures of subcutaneous fat, but overall body fat has been the same as in children whose mothers were treated with insulin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Main limitation of this study are believed to be some patient's non compliance for routine follow-up, and some difficulties in laboratory tests such as inadequacy of instruments and low technical experience of some laboratory technicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Regarding the results of the current study, it is concluded that metformin can be an excellent alternative for insulin in the treatment of GDM.
