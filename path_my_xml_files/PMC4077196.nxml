is an established strategy in the treatment of septic shock in Japan and parts of
Western Europe. PMX-DHP is currently the subject of a pivotal North American
randomized controlled trial (EUPHRATES) in patients with septic shock and confirmed
endotoxemia, as measured by the endotoxin activity assay. The major mechanism of
action of this therapy is the removal of circulating endotoxin. High affinity binding
of circulating endotoxin by the PMX-DHP column may decrease circulating endotoxin
levels by up to 90% after two standard treatments. Basic research has shown
reductions in circulating cytokine levels and in renal tubular apoptosis. Clinical
research has shown that PMX-DHP therapy results in hemodynamic improvements,
improvements in oxygenation, renal function, and reductions in mortality. Further
research is needed to further define additional patient populations with endotoxemia
that may benefit from PMX-DHP therapy as well as to further elucidate dosing, timing,
and additional information on mechanisms of action. This review will present the
mechanistic rationale for this targeted strategy of endotoxin removal using PMX-DHP
in endotoxemic septic patients, highlighting both the specific effects of the therapy
and the evidence accumulated so far of clinical improvement following this therapy in
terms of recovery of organ function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Targeting lipopolysaccharide in septic shock</title><p>This viewpoint discusses the proven and potential mechanisms of action for polymyxin B
hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) as a biologically plausible and clinically efficacious therapy
in sepsis and endotoxemia. The role of endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in sepsis
is well established with over 10,000 publications in the medical literature. LPS is a
key component of the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Structurally, its biologic
activity relates to the lipid A portion of the molecule, which is highly conserved
across most bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. LPS when injected systemically in both animals and humans in a
dose-dependent fashion induces elevations in cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and
IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Clinical responses include pyrexia, chills, hypotension, and, at higher
doses, shock, organ failure and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown elevated levels of circulating LPS in patients
with sepsis originating not only from Gram-negative infections, but also in patients
with Gram-positive infections, and in those where cultures do not identify a
microbiologic source of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The likely mechanism of endotoxemia in these cases is the translocation of
gut microbial flora secondary to intestinal hypoperfusion. Animal studies supporting
this hypothesis have included those that have identified high levels of circulating LPS
after supra-celiac aortic cross clamping for aortic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar observations of endotoxemia have been noted in human cardiopulmonary
bypass, severe burn, liver transplant, and trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The possibility to do these studies has been bolstered by the development of the
endotoxin activity assay (EAA), which has allowed accurate measurement of endotoxin
activity levels <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The EAA measures the activity of circulating bio-available lipid A, thus
overcoming many of the interference issues that exist with the limulus ameobocyte lysate
assay. Elevations in the EAA correlate well with the observed clinical status of
patients. EAA levels in sepsis patients in the ICU correlate with adverse outcomes,
including risk of death and duration of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that elevation in the EAA can provide
additional prognostic value in assessing patients with milder or earlier forms of
sepsis, in perioperative major surgery patients, and in severe sepsis and septic shock
patients for whom specific anti-endotoxin therapies are being contemplated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, studies have demonstrated persistent elevations in LPS levels as measured
by the EAA up to 3 days after initial development of severe sepsis. Furthermore, the
total exposure to circulating endotoxin as measured by the area under the curve when EAA
levels are plotted over the first 3 days of admission (endotoxin burden) correlates with
the degree of total organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Organ failure is the biggest correlate to attributable mortality in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, fluctuations in circulating endotoxin levels in septic patients
have been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This has led to the hypothesis that both the elimination of high levels of
circulating endotoxin and the blunting of the changes in these levels over time is a
potential therapeutic strategy in endotoxemia with associated septic shock
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Time frame of events and windows of opportunity for treatment.</bold> EAA,
endotoxin activity assay.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc13912-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Polymyxin B</title><p>Polymyxin B is a cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotic derived from <italic>Bacillus
polymyxa</italic> that has the ability to bind and neutralize endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Studies have shown that systemic polymyxin B blunts the TNF-&#x003b1; response
to endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Polymyxin B also blocks the formation of LPS-LPS binding protein complexes
through its high binding affinity for the LPS molecule. Unfortunately, infusion of
polymyxin in humans results in nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, limiting its
intravenous use to salvage therapy for Gram-negative enterobacteriaciae resistant to
other antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clinical trials of polymyxin B as an anti-sepsis/anti-endotoxin agent bound
to dextran failed to advance through clinical trials in the 1990s, again related to
systemic toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Hemoperfusion with polymyxin B immobilized cartridges</title><p>A novel therapeutic strategy whereby polymyxin B is immobilized to a polystyrene-derived
fiber in a hemoperfusion device that is used to remove circulating endotoxin was
developed in Japan in the early 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The PMX cartridge was created by
covalently immobilizing polymyxin B to polystyrene-derived fibers, which can then be
used to filter blood externally using an extracorporeal circuit, thereby removing
circulating LPS through its adsorption to the PMX cartridge. The surface area of the
cartridge is extremely large, allowing up to 90% of circulating endotoxin to be cleared
in a short period of time, as demonstrated by Shoji and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Clinically, the EAA-J study confirmed that endotoxin levels may fluctuate in
the inter-treatment period thought to be related to the movement of endotoxin out of
other compartments (protein bound, micelles, ongoing septic sources), reinforcing the
potential rationale for current practice of two treatments 24 hours apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To date, PMX-DHP has been used in more than 100,000 patients with a very low
incidence of adverse events (&#x0003c;1%) and high tolerability. The most commonly observed
adverse events are thrombocytopenia, transient hypotension and allergic reactions. These
have been logged by regulators in North America, Europe, and Japan, as well as in the
EUPHAS2 registry currently active in Europe, and in published literature. There is no
evidence that polymyxin B enters the systemic circulation in significant quantities in
treated patients.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Polymixin B cartridge containing polystyrenic fibers bound to polymixin-B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc13912-2"/></fig><p>Small randomized studies on this device have also shown the ability of the PMX cartridge
to dramatically reduce endotoxin concentrations compared with carrier fiber cartridges,
charcoal or resin over the course of a 2-hour treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Due to the strong binding capacity of polymyxin B and the affinity of
polymyxin B for the highly conserved lipid A portion of LPS, the device has also been
shown to remove a large variety of the various endotoxins produced by an array of
different Gram-negative bacteria, showing the versatility of this treatment. Recently,
Tani and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] tested the endotoxin adsorption capacity of the device, reporting that the
PMX cartridge is able to trap approximately 300,000 endotoxin units in a standard 2-hour
perfusion session. This correlates well with the observed order of magnitude of the
typical endotoxin burden during severe sepsis. Similarly, the EAA-J trial demonstrated
an average absolute 20% reduction in EAA levels (from 0.65 to 0.45) in an unselected
cohort of septic patients who received PMX-DHP on clinical grounds at the discretion of
the treating physician, representing very roughly a 2,000 pg/ml reduction in endotoxin
levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of action</title><p>The main mechanism of action behind PMX-DHP is the direct adsorption of circulating LPS.
At the molecular level this relies on both the polystyrene-polymyxin B bonding and the
LPS-polymyxin B affinity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The first bond is the
covalent linkage of polymyxin B to the fiber surface, thus protecting the patient from
the nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effects of polymyxin B. Molecular studies on polymyxin B
and LPS interaction have determined that a stable bond is created, with hydrophobic
interactions dominating the interaction for intermolecular distances up to 1 nm, such as
between the lipid A and polymyxin B hydrophobic residues. At larger intermolecular
distances, LPS phosphate groups, with negatives charges, interact with positively
charged diaminobutyric acid residues of polymyxin B, giving rise to ionic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The large surface area of the PMX column exerts fluid drag but allows for a
large amount of interaction with the fiber. Fiore and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have shown that, within a wide range of wall sheer stresses, the capability
of polymyxin B to capture endotoxin molecules extends to distances of one order of
magnitude greater than the characteristic distance of the stable intermolecular
hydrophobic bond. Therefore, the polymyxin adsorbed to the fiber is able to capture LPS
from a threshold distance of 10 to 20 nm during the normal blood flow of a standard
treatment.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binds to polymixin B (PMX) with weak ionic forces and

any other system. Dab, hydrophilic residues; Leu, Leucine; MOA, methyl octanoic
acid; Phe, Phenylalanine.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc13912-3"/></fig><p>As a secondary mechanism the PMX column has also been reported to remove inflammatory
cells such as monocytes and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. While it is unlikely that these inflammatory cells are removed through
binding with PMX directly, they may be removed by either being physically entrapped by
the fiber weave of the filter or attaching to LPS, which in turn binds to polymyxin,
thereby using LPS as an adsorption bridge (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). White
cell count reductions have been observed clinically in some patients treated with
PMX-DHP. In either case, the removal of activated inflammatory cells can have the
secondary effect of reducing the circulating levels of inflammatory mediators, such as
the cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6. Consequently, the exaggerated systemic immune
response of patients can be reduced, preventing or decreasing multiorgan failure.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Pictorial view of activated cells adsorbed by the fibers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc13912-4"/></fig><p>Interestingly, PMX-DHP treatment has also been associated with decreasing circulating
apoptotic factors, such as Fas, Fas-L, Bax, Bcl-2, and reductions in the levels of renal
tubular and glomerular cellular apoptosis, which in turn was associated with recovery of
renal tubular formation, reduced inflammation and improved renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This provides another potential mechanism involved in the overall reduction
in organ dysfunction following PMX-DHP, including a rationale for the often observed
clinical effect on acute kidney injury.</p><p>There are other reports of PMX-DHP therapy changing levels of other measurable players
in the inflammatory response in sepsis. These include lipotichoeic acid, HMGB-1, and
even mediators of the inflammatory response in amiodarone toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, there is little causal evidence to support a direct role for PMX in
these cases. The mechanisms for this are unclear and may reflect pleiotropic effects of
reducing endotoxin burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal data</title><p>The first large mammal safety study of PMX was done in 20 dogs infused with
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in a Gram-negative sepsis model. It demonstrated the
ability of PMX-DHP to reduce circulating endotoxin levels, improve blood pressure, and
reduce mortality in treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Further studies in guinea pigs and sheep have noted improved
gastrointestinal perfusion and reductions in clinical parameters of shock and hypoxemia
in sepsis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, animal studies from Japan have focused on potential new areas for
clinical use through studies on a rat sepsis model with endotoxin-induced acute lung
injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical data</title><sec><title>Small studies</title><p>There are many published trials of small and somewhat heterogeneous cohorts of
patients mainly from Japan as well as case reports and case series from elsewhere
demonstrating impressive efficacy of PMX-DHP in severe sepsis. Studies on human
subjects have been reported since 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], with more than 120 English language publications reporting on over 2,000
patients treated with PMX-DHP now in the public domain. The first multi-center trial
was done by Tani and colleagues in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], where 37 of 70 subjects with severe sepsis were treated with PMX-DHP and
the treatment group demonstrated an 18% reduction in absolute 14-day mortality
compared to the control population.</p></sec><sec><title>Meta-analyses/systematic reviews</title><p>Recently, Zhou and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] published a meta-analysis of all randomized trials of blood purification
strategies in sepsis, including high volume hemofiltration, PMX-DHP, and plasma
exchange. Importantly, while they showed an overall reduction in mortality from 50.1%
to 35.7% (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.84), they highlighted
that the result would no longer be significant if the eight trials on PMX-DHP with
457 patients were excluded, thus suggesting that the clinical effect that drove the
result of the meta-analysis was principally due to the PMX-DHP trials.</p><p>Cruz and colleagues published an earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of 28
trials where PMX-DHP was used to treat patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
Although there was heterogeneity amongst the trials, which were largely done in
Europe and Japan, across a total cohort of 978 patients treated with the therapy,
improvements were noted in hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure) as well as
oxygenation (P/F ratio), and there was a statistically significant improvement in
risk of death (risk ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, these data need to be considered as hypothesis generating,
since despite the strong positive clinical signal, the included trials are largely
underpowered, unblinded, and have variable inclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomized controlled trials</title><sec><title>European pilot trial</title><p>A European multicenter pilot trial was conducted by Vincent and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] in six academic centers in France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, The
Netherlands and the UK. The study was powered for safety and surrogate
non-mortality endpoints. Treatment consisted of only a single PMX cartridge, which
is considered half of the current recommended dose. Thirty-six septic patients
were randomized to PMX- DHP (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) or standard care
(n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19). There was no difference in mortality, although there was a
statistically significant improvement in mean arterial pressure and other
hemodynamic measures as well as a reduction in the need for renal replacement
therapy in the treated group. From the safety perspective, authors reported a
safety profile that was favorable towards PMX-DHP versus the control
population.</p></sec><sec><title>EUPHAS</title><p>In 2009, the Early Use of Polymyxin Hemoperfusion in Abdominal Septic Shock
(EUPHAS) trial, a randomized unblinded study of 64 patients in 10 tertiary Italian
ICUs, demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoints
of hemodynamics and organ dysfunction. Specifically, renal function as measured by
improvement of serum creatinine, diuresis, and the renal component of the
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72 hours showed positive trends.
Also, the absolute risk of death at 28 days improved significantly from 53% in the
conventional therapy group to 32% in the PMX-DHP treated group
(<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). These results, albeit encouraging, are considered
controversial as the trial was stopped early after an interim analysis showed a
mortality difference, which was a secondary endpoint. In addition, the trial was
not blinded. Patients were selected for therapy based on evidence of septic shock
from an intra-abdominal source to hopefully enrich the patient population with
likely endotoxemic patients, but the EAA was not measured. Despite these
limitations, EUPHAS may have had a comparative advantage to other sepsis trials
that selected patients for anti-endotoxin therapy regardless of source of sepsis
or measured levels of endotoxin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ongoing studies</title><sec><title>EUPHAS2</title><p>EUPHAS2 is a prospective web-based registry of patients treated with PMX-DHP
designed to validate the reproducibility of randomized clinical trial results and
to observe the 'real world' efficacy and utility of PMX-DHP therapy across a wider
variety of patient populations than those included in clinical trials. To date,
the registry has captured data on 426 treated patients. Unpublished data from the
registry that have been presented to date seem to show similar benefits to those
observed in EUPHAS and other trials.</p></sec><sec><title>ABDO-MIX</title><p>The effects of Hemoperfusion With a Polymyxin B Membrane in Peritonitis With
Septic Shock (ABDO-MIX; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01222663) is a French randomized,
controlled, open label multi-centered study that evaluated 28 day mortality in
patients with septic shock due to peritonitis. Eligible patients were randomized
to standard care versus standard care plus PMX-DHP within 36 hours of abdominal
surgery to repair a hollow viscous perforation. The trial enrolled 240 patients.
Although this study has not been published, preliminary results were presented at
the 2014 ISICEM conference. This study failed to show a difference in mortality
between the groups, but the study had a number of potential problems that may have
contributed to this observation. These include cartridge clotting and failure
rates that are dramatically higher than in other trials or clinical experience to
date suggesting technical issues in the implementation of the therapy protocol.
Also, the observed composite mortality was substantially less than the estimate
included in the sample size calculation, thus decreasing the power of the study to
detect a difference. Still, once published, ABDO-MIX should be carefully reviewed
in the context of other previous and emerging data.</p></sec><sec><title>EUPHRATES</title><p>The EUPHRATES trial (Evaluating the Use of Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion in a
Randomized Controlled Trial of Adults Treated for Endotoxemia and Septic Shock;
ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT01046669) is a multi-centered, blinded, randomized
controlled trial of PMX-DHP in patients with septic shock and confirmed
endotoxemia using EAA greater than 0.60. The trial is being conducted in 50 ICUs
in the United States and Canada and aims to enroll 360 patients, but has an
adaptive design that allows for a sample size adjustment based on a Data and
Safety Monitoring Board interim analysis. The primary endpoint for the trial is
28-day all-cause mortality. Unique features of the trial include absence of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria as a requirement for inclusion,
use of the EAA to confirm endotoxemia as a requisite for treatment, and use of a
detailed 'fascade' hemoperfusion event as a blinding mechanism. Similar to
previous studies, PMX-DHP is being done in two treatment sessions of 2 hours
duration approximately 1 day apart. Patients are enrolled after persistent septic
shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation who remain on vaspressors for at least
2 but not more than 30 hours and have an EAA &#x0003e;0.60.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PMX-DHP is a well-tolerated and safe treatment for septic shock with a long history of
clinical experience and both clinical and basic science data to support efficacy in
endotoxemia. Its principle mechanism of action is through the removal of circulating
endotoxin, although its effects are likely pleiotropic. In an era of numerous failed
clinical trials in sepsis, it is easy to be cynical. However, this personalized,
targeted approach to a disease with unacceptable mortality, with a treatment with a long
history of clinical use and strong supporters around the globe truly may represent a
step forward in improving patient care.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EAA: Endotoxin activity assay; EUPHAS: Early use of polymyxin hemoperfusion in abdominal
