Depression in older people is associated with loss, loneliness and physical co-morbidities; it is known to be under-diagnosed and under-treated. Older people may find it difficult to speak to their GPs about low mood, and GPs may avoid identifying depression due to limited consultation time and referral options for older patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A nested qualitative study in a randomised controlled trial for older people with moderate to severe depression: the CASPER Plus Trial (Collaborative Care for Screen Positive Elders). We interviewed GPs, case managers (CM) and patient participants to explore perspectives and experiences of delivering and receiving a psychosocial intervention, developed specifically for older adults in primary care, within a collaborative care framework. Transcripts were analysed thematically using principles of constant comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty three interviews were conducted and, across the three data-sets, four main themes were identified: revealing hidden depression, reducing the &#x02018;blind spots&#x02019;, opportunity to talk outside the primary care consultation and &#x02018;moving on&#x02019; from depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Depression in older people is commonly hidden, and may coexist with physical conditions that are prioritised by both patients and GPs. Being invited to participate in a trial about depression may allow older people to disclose their feelings, name the problem, and seek help. Offering older people an opportunity to talk outside the primary care consultation is valued by patients and GPs. A psychosocial intervention delivered by a case manager in the primary care setting may fill the gap in the care of older people with depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN45842879">ISRCTN45842879</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Older people</kwd><kwd>Collaborative care</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Qualitative method</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Estimates of the prevalence of depression in older people vary but may be as high as 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Poor mental health is often co-morbid with long term, chronic physical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, all of which are more common in later life. Depression reduces quality of life and increases the risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Depression also increases use of health and social care, including use of unscheduled care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Loneliness and depression are strongly associated in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and loneliness is an independent risk factor for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Barriers to identifying and managing depression in an older population are complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Older people with long term conditions (LTCs) may view their chronic illness as a justifiable cause of low mood, and may hold negative views about available treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Older people may be reluctant to define their distress as a mental health problem because of the perceived stigma associated with the label &#x02018;depression&#x02019;, and thus be reluctant to consult, not considering their emotional health as a subject worthy of their GP&#x02019;s attention. Burroughs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported that diagnosis and treatment can emphasise the biomedical model with less attention paid to social and contextual issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Coventry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that depression was often &#x02018;normalised&#x02019; among those with chronic physical health problems. A one-year follow-up study by Licht-Strunk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed, compared to depressed older patients identified by their GPs, prognosis of those with undetected depression is poor.</p><p>Older people may experience difficulty in accessing mental health care, which may be due to a lack of capacity within the healthcare system with adults over 65 being less likely than younger people to be referred to IAPT services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, older people are an important &#x02018;under-served&#x02019; group, increasingly affected by economic deprivation, social isolation and loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. With the growing ageing population there is an increasing need for an intervention specifically developed for older people with depression.</p><p>Evidence shows that Behavioural Activation (BA) is an effective treatment for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], particularly in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. BA forms the cornerstone of a number of recent trials where the intervention was delivered by psychological well-being practitioners (PWPs) within a collaborative care model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This framework, defined by Gunn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] incorporates: a multi-professional approach to patient care, a structured management plan, scheduled patient follow-ups and enhanced communication between professionals (See Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The collaborative care framework (Gunn et al.

Thus, a large US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] shows evidence of its effectiveness as a treatment for depression in adults over 60, and in the UK the CADET study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported persistent positive effects of collaborative care in improving depression among a general adult population, up to 12&#x000a0;months after initiation of the intervention. The COINCIDE study of collaborative care for adults with co-morbid depression and diabetes or cardiovascular disease also showed positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The CASPER Plus trial was developed specifically to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of collaborative care for older people with moderate to severe depression in a UK setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Simpson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported on the experiences of depressed patients receiving collaborative care in the UK, suggesting case managers were able to reduce the sense of stigma at being diagnosed with a mental health problem and resolve misconceptions around antidepressant medication prescribed by the GPs. However, Knowles et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that established divisions between physical and mental health continue to pose barriers for the management of people with long term conditions and depression; and identified a need among such patients for a separate space to discuss psychological concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Little work has been done to explore the perspectives of older adults with depression being offered and receiving treatment for depression within a CC framework. Through semi-structured interviews, our aim was to investigate both patient and professional views in order to gain multiple perspectives on the understanding of depression and depression management in older people.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Nested in the CASPER Plus study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), we conducted a qualitative evaluation using semi-structured interviews across three sites in the north of England to explore acceptability, views and experiences of GPs, trial participants (patients) and case managers. Ethical approval for the RCT and this qualitative study was gained by Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, Yorkshire &#x00026; Humber (reference 10/H1306/61).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and sampling</title><p>We aimed to interview a purposive sample of GPs, patient participants and those who declined to participate or withdrew from the intervention, and case managers. Our approach was to sample patients and GPs from recruiting practices in both urban and rural areas in the north of England, in order to gather data from areas of differing deprivation indices and achieve a spread in gender, age and socioeconomic status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interview schedule and selection process</title><p>Participants from three groups were invited to take part in an interview: GPs working within CASPER Plus trial practices, patients who consented to participate and were randomised to CC and case managers who delivered the intervention.</p><p>Invitation letters, with an information leaflet describing the interview process and a consent form with a pre-paid envelope to return to the research team, were sent to patient participants by post; GPs and CMs were sent invitation letters with an information leaflet and a consent form by email. Before interviews commenced, written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Initially, all GPs and patient participants who had completed their part in the trial were invited to be interviewed. In the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] GP practices were recruited sequentially, each practice then inviting eligible patients over 65&#x000a0;years to participate in the trial. Once five or more patients from each practice had completed the intervention, the lead GP was invited to be interviewed in the qualitative study.</p><p>All patient participants were invited to be interviewed after they had completed the intervention. Non-responders in both groups were followed up by telephone. We aimed to interview two groups of patient participants: those who completed treatment and those who withdrew from treatment.</p><p>At the start of our study, following the order of GP practice recruitment, all participants invited to take part were from the central site: urban and rural practices in York, Harrogate, Hull and surrounding areas. As these are areas of relatively low to moderate deprivation, we then used a selection process to ensure that participants from areas of higher deprivation were invited to be interviewed.</p><p>Of the 18 GPs invited to take part, 12 consented to be interviewed. All 12 case managers who took part in the trial were invited to be interviewed, all of whom had received training and delivered the intervention to at least three patient participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p>Interviews were carried out by KO, KB and SN at a place convenient to the participant: either at the GP practice (for GPs), at the home of the patient participant or, for CMs, in the researcher&#x02019;s office. Interviews were conducted between May 2013 and November 2014. All interviews were digitally recorded (with participants&#x02019; signed consent), transcribed verbatim and anonymised. The topic guides were designed with reference to the literature, approved by the research team, and developed iteratively in light of the emerging themes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Analysis</title><p>The transcriptions formed the data which were then analysed iteratively, allowing for modification of the topic guides as analysis progressed. Analysis was undertaken by individual researchers KO, CCG and KB (of different professional backgrounds: health sciences research, academic primary care, academic health research) using thematic analysis and principles of constant comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] methods. Data analysis involved a process of organising the data, descriptive coding, interpretive coding, writing and theorising. Deviant cases were actively sought throughout the analysis and emerging ideas and themes modified in response.

Our findings indicate that depression in older people is commonly hidden, and invitation to participate in a trial can serve to uncover depression in patients and to raise awareness in GPs; interaction with the CM provides older patients with an opportunity to talk outside the primary care consultation, to deal with their low mood and move forwards.</p><p>Our findings support the literature suggesting that case management can help to reduce stigma and may improve access to mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; certainly being invited to participate in a trial acted as a catalyst for older people to reflect on their feelings and the depression may not have been identified outside the trial setting.</p><p>Both GPs and patients may normalise depression and view it as an expected consequence of having one or more chronic health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. GPs may be reluctant to address signs and symptoms of the condition, partly due to the lack of treatment options for older depressed adults, and the limited consultation time in which to address the problem. Our results add to the evidence that there is insufficient capacity within existing primary care for psychosocial support of older people with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and that older people may value a separate space to discuss their problems.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>This study explored multiple perspectives on the views and experiences of those receiving and delivering a psychosocial intervention for depression within a CC framework. While our aim was to interview people across a wide demographic range, we were less successful in engaging many from areas of lower socioeconomic status (SES). This, we believe, may be a reflection of social deprivation levels; patient participants constrained by social or financial circumstances were less likely to respond to an invitation to participate in the main trial, and those who did were less likely to agree to take part in an interview after they completed treatment. Similarly, GPs in areas of lower SES were less likely to respond to an invitation to be interviewed. Additionally, black or minority ethnic groups were poorly represented in the population of GP practices participating in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Depression is commonly hidden and coexists with physical conditions that are prioritised by both patients and GPs. Being invited to participate in a trial about depression seems to facilitate acceptance of symptoms, may reduce stigma and allow older people to disclose their feelings, name the problem, and access care. Older people value an opportunity to talk outside the GP consultation.</p><p>Although the results of the CASPER Plus randomised controlled trial are as yet unknown, the findings from this nested qualitative study suggest that a psychosocial intervention delivered by a case manager can provide a valuable resource, which fills a gap in the care of older people with depression. Behavioural Activation (BA) encourages increased activity and social contact which may improve physical health symptoms as well as mood; it can enable older people to &#x02018;move on&#x02019; from depression, providing them with the tools to manage their symptoms.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BA</term><def><p>Behavioural Activation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CC</term><def><p>Collaborative care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CM</term><def><p>Case manager</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-9</term><def><p>Patient Health Questionnaire 9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Socioeconomic status.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SG conceived the Casper Plus study; CCG developed the protocol for the nested qualitative study, supervised data collection and analysis and writing the paper.
