In addition, it leads to obesity during adulthood.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Lifestyle has a significant role on either causing or preventing obesity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Because educational programs have a positive effect on weight control and having healthy behaviors among children and their parents,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the risk of this problem can be reduced by appropriate and consistent training.</p><p>Because eating habits and parents' health beliefs can affect the child's weight, parents have a fundamental role in maintaining their childrens' weight; hence, designing educational programs for mothers can lead to weight control in children.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In fact, if training can help parents become more sensitive about obesity, its complications, and severity and lead them toward the correct behavior, it is mostly probable that both the parents and the child would choose the correct behavior.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Unfortunately, despite all trainings concerning obesity, the prevalence of obesity is still increasing; therefore, it appears that if a health training has a theoretical basis, it could be more effective.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Health belief model (HBM) is one of the oldest health behavior theories,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which has positive effects on lifestyle modification.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the other hand, behavioral recommendations for controlling obesity among children, which are based on this model[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are simple and practical and can easily be transferred to children by their mothers. Most of the previous studies regarding controlling obesity provided training for obese children, and despite the fundamental role of mothers in children's weight management, their education has mostly been ignored. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of lifestyle training based on the health belief model for mothers of obese and overweight children regarding obesity-related behaviors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In a semi-experimental study, which was conducted in 2014 (August 23 to December 22), 64 mothers of obese and overweight students of the fifth and sixth grades were enrolled after obtaining their written consent. Sample size was calculated using an appropriate formula with a confidence interval of 95% and test power of 80%. Sampling was conducted after taking permission from the ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. For sampling, through drawing, first from the six educational districts of Isfahan, one district was selected, and then from the schools of the selected district, 4 elementary schools (2 for boys and 2 for girls) were randomly selected. Selected schools were considered for random allocation to both the groups of control (32 participants) and intervention (32 participants). Then, after referring to the selected schools, fifth and sixth grades students who met the inclusion criteria were selected through continuous simple sampling. The inclusion criteria were having a body mass index (BMI) of more than 85<sup>th</sup> percentile, not having any hormonal or diagnosed disease related to obesity, and having mentally and psychologically healthy mothers. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight (kilograms) by the square of height (meter). The weights were measured using one scale, which was calibrated with a 1-kg weight, and measurement was conducted with the least clothing and no shoes. Height was measured while standing, without bending the knees, and from the top of the head to the heels using a tape measure that was embedded on the wall. Then, the percentile of children's BMI was checked on reference charts.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The intervention included proving healthy lifestyle training for controlling children's obesity based on the health belief model to mothers of the intervention group in two groups of 16 persons during 4 sessions (each session lasted 45&#x02013;50 min) for each group, along with providing educational notes and pamphlets regarding obesity in children. At the end of the study, the control group also received the educational intervention.</p><p>Topics such as the definition of obesity, effective factors of obesity, role of healthy diet and physical activities in preventing obesity, solutions for having a healthy diet and increased physical activity, healthy management of watching television, and the importance of family exercise were discussed during educational sessions. Regarding the perceived threats, topics such as the high prevalence of obesity, children's obesity or overweight, and negative consequences of problems of childhood obesity were discussed. The perceived benefits of the importance of maintaining appropriate weight in children's health were also discussed. Regarding the perceived barriers, mothers were introduced to some of the existing barriers, including lack of educational programs on healthy diets, insufficient space and time for exercising at school, TV advertisements about unhealthy snacks, consuming junk food by friends' child, and high costs of sports classes.</p><p>Data collection tools were demographic characteristics questionnaire and a standard questionnaire for evaluating knowledge, attitude (perceived threat, benefits, and barriers structures), and performance related to obesity among children,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which were completed at three stages, i.e. before, immediately after, and 2 months after the intervention by interviewing the mothers. Eight questions of knowledge domain were answered as &#x0201c;correct,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;wrong,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;don't know,&#x0201d; and 16 questions of attitude and 17 questions of performance domains were scored based on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicated mothers' high knowledge and better attitude as well as desirable behaviors of parents and child for controlling obesity.</p><p>Data were analyzed using Mann&#x02013;Whitney, Chi-square, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc least significant difference (LSD) tests with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All subjects were enrolled in the study after obtaining the necessary permissions from authorities and written Consent from the subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In this study 150 mothers who met the inclusion criteria participated.

Moreover, the mean scores of obesity-related behaviors in mothers had no significant difference between both the groups at the times of before and immediately after the intervention, however, their difference was significant 2 months after the intervention. Results also showed that the mean scores of obesity-related behaviors in children were significantly increased in the intervention group immediately after and 2 months after the intervention compared to before the intervention.

Considering the improvement of behaviors in general and in children in the intervention group and no significant difference in mother's behavior immediately after the intervention, it could be said that, although the educational program was designed for mothers, the contents of educational courses were probably transferred by the mothers to their children and the change occurred faster among children than mothers; the reason could be that making lifestyle changes is harder for older people compared to the young, and lifestyle modification requires more time in them as it was observed 2 months after the educational program, that the changes in mothers were also significant.</p><p>A study conducted by Cason and Logan in South Carolina, America, indicated that educating fourth grade students about the food pyramid and physical activity would improve their diet-related health behaviors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Azadi <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that executing educational program for teenage students in Tehran city, Iran would improve their nutritional behaviors.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Sabet Sarvestani <italic>et al</italic>. in their study indicated that behavior modification programs, including problem solving trainings, yoga, food habits, and appropriate physical activity for teenage girls, would improve their nutritional behaviors.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Results of the present study are in line with the abovementioned studies with one difference; the present study was based on the health belief model and focused on educating mothers. Therefore, it could be said that the present program has helped mothers to become more sensitive about obesity, its complications, and severity, and by increasing their knowledge, they could transfer correct health behaviors to their children. Furthermore, the results showed that, in the intervention group, the mean score of knowledge in mothers, immediately after the intervention was higher than before the intervention, and this increase continued till 2 months after the intervention. Moreover, the mean score of perceived threat in mothers immediately after and 2 months after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, results showed that the executed educational program for mothers led to control of obesity-related behaviors until 2 months after the intervention. Hence, it appears that understanding the importance of obesity and its complications as a serious health threat for children by mothers could change their behaviors to make efforts for eliminating existing barriers for controlling their child's weight and would also modify obesity-related behaviors in children. We had a limitation of following up the behaviors in participants for more than 2 months because of unwillingness of participants, hence, a further study is required in this field.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences supported our research project.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This article was derived from a master thesis with project number 393312, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.
