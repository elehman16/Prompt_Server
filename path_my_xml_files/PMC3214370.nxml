Different strategies have been taken into account to improve the response rate. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine as an adjuvant therapy to HB vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>Sixty three end-stage renal disease patients were recruited on dialysis that were older than 18 years and had passed at least 3 doses of HB vaccination schedule, and had HBS antibody (Ab) with titer less than 10 IU/L. The patients were divided into two groups; A (30 patients) and B (33 patients). Both of the groups received a 3-dose HB vaccination schedule of 40 &#x003bc; g intramuscularly in the left deltoid muscle at 0, 1 and 6 months. Group A also received Td vaccine intramuscularly simultaneous with the first dose of HB vaccine. HBS Ab was measured in periods of 1 and 6 months after completion of the vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>One month after completion of the vaccination, group A had better but not significant response rate (96%) than group B (83.9%) (p &#x0003e; 0.05); in addition, after 6 month there was no difference between the two groups (87.5% vs. 83.3%) (p &#x0003e; 0.05). Patients with HCV infection had lower response rate than patients who did not have HCV infection (33.3% vs. 92.5%) (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Age had negative effect on immune response to HB vaccination (r = -0.339; p = 0.005).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The use of Td vaccine concurrent with HB vaccination may increase the response rate in non-responder individuals; however, it seems it does not have any role in the persistence of immune response. Age and HCV infection negatively affected the response to HB vaccination in dialysis patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS:</title><kwd>Hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>Peritoneal Dialysis</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis B Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Antibody production in patients with end-stage renal disease impairs due to impairment of T-cell activation, reduction in number of B Lymphocytes, and dendritic cells which are the major antigen presenting cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Therefore, that infection is the second biggest cause of mortality in this population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>One of the infections is hepatitis B virus.

Inclusion criteria were: 1) age equal or more than 18 years, 2) HBS Ag negative, 3) received at least a 3-dose HB vaccination schedule at 0, 1, and 6 months intervals (initial vaccination course) but with HBS Ab titer less than 10 IU/L.</p><p>We tried to match groups from different aspects including age, gender, diabetes mellitus, type of dialysis, and immunosuppressive drugs consumption.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: 1) death, 2) transplantation, 3) noncooperation to the study.

They divided them into three groups of healthy individuals (n = 40), hemodialysis (n = 24), and pregnant women (n = 12).</p><p>Some patients of each group received HB vaccine with intervals of 1 month for three times simultaneous with tetanus toxoid, and the rest received 3 doses of HB vaccine.</p><p>The group who received tetanus toxoid had greater response rate and HBS Ab titer than another one (p &#x0003e; 0.05).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></p><p>The difference between our study and Sonmez et al might be due to different sample size, population or effect of other factors on HBS Ab level.</p><p>In the present study, 6 months after vaccination, 7 patients (14.6%) with an effective response had lost HBS Ab. In these patients HBS Ab level was 10-100 IU/L at first month of vaccination. Therefore HBS Ab more than 100 may be essential for persistence of protective HBS Ab level after 6 months. Ramezani et al reported that HBS Ab titer above 100 IU/L guarantees efficacious protection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>However, different studies mentioned many factors to be effective on the response rate to HB vaccine, but role of none of them were confirmed. In the current study, age, and concomitant infection with HCV significantly had a negative influence on response rate to HB vaccine. Patients with HCV infection and older patients had lower response rate (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Navarro et al reported that hemodialysis patients with HCV infection had a weaker response than those without it (23% vs. 62.7%) (p &#x0003c; 0.01).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>There are different results about the effect of age on response rate. Navarro et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> and Ibrahim et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> reported that age has no negative effect on seroconversion, but these results were different from what Buti et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> and Jadoul et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> have reported.</p><p>Jadoul et al demonstrated that after 12 months, patients of ages less than 60 have better protective HBS Ab than those over 75 years (100% vs. 50%) (p = 0.048).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>We came up to the same results of Navarro et al that gender and duration on dialysis had no effect on response rate (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>In this study, there was no significant correlation between response rate and immunosup-pressive drugs consumption (p &#x0003e; 0.05). Patients who underwent hemodialysis had a weaker response than those treated with peritoneal dialysis, but it was not statistically significant (87.5% vs. 93.8%) (p &#x0003e; 0.05). Having et al demonstrated that the response rate did not differ from patients of hemodialysis to those of peritoneal dialysis (78.7% vs.77.3%) (p &#x0003e; 0.05).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>In our study, diabetic patients had a better response rate than non-diabetics, that it was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) six months after the vaccination. It also was different from those of Ocak et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>In summary, it seems that Td vaccine simultaneous with HB vaccine may increase the response rate to vaccine, but it has no role in persistence of seroconversion; however, further and longer investigations on more population are recommended. Age and concomitant HCV infection have negative effect on response rate to HB vaccine. Perhaps these patients need close follow-up and/or repeated doses of HB vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>
