Studies in Asia estimate a prevalence of 3.7%&#x02013;22% using Rome II diagnostic criteria.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, the data reported from developed countries such as United States estimate the prevalence of IBS at 10%&#x02013;20% and the incidence of IBS at 1%&#x02013;2% per year. The incidence is markedly different among countries depending on the race, food habits, diagnostic criteria used, and so on. Of people with IBS, approximately 10%&#x02013;20% seek medical care.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort often reported as cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Four bowel patterns may be seen with IBS. These patterns include IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation), and IBS-A (alternating diarrhea and constipation). Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons why people seek medical care and is the most bothersome symptom in patients of IBS.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A report by Indian Society of Gastroenterology Task Force revealed that as high as 70% of IBS patients have abdominal pain or discomfort significantly affecting the patient's quality of life.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Treatment for IBS may include medicine, stress relief, and changes in eating habits.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The cause of abdominal pain has traditionally been ascribed to smooth muscle spasm. Therefore, antispasmodics have been and remain the main stay of therapy, but clinical evidence supporting the use is limited. Most of the clinical trials done to assess their effectiveness are dated and only three trials have been conducted in the last 10 years. Most of these are small studies and are fraught with methodological flaws, including diagnostic criteria used, inclusion criteria used, dosing schedules, duration of therapy, and study end points used to assess the response. Antispasmodics, namely, hyoscyamine, dicyclomine, propantheline, and mebeverine are commonly used, but they are associated with lot of anticholenergic side effects, which restricts their use. Drotaverine, an antispasmodic, has a good relaxing effect on intestinal smooth muscle, which helps in alleviating pain and does not have side effects like anticholinergics.</p><p>There is paucity of data regarding uses of drotaverine in alleviating the pain and overall symptoms of IBS. Two abstracts[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have shown beneficial effects in patients of IBS. The present study has been undertaken, to systematically evaluate the effects of drotaverine, with regards to relief of pain (frequency and severity), stool frequency and overall global improvement in patient's complaints. All the symptoms have been quantified using visual analog scale (VAS).</p><p>These data reveal that any therapy that relieves the abdominal pain or discomfort improves the patient's Quality of Life.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 180 patients from all the three centers, namely, Jaipur (S.M.S. Medical College), Allahabad (M.L.N. Medical College), and Delhi (St. Stephens Hospital) were randomized by the computer-generated randomization numbers. The concealment was ensured by keeping the results of number allotted in a sealed envelope, in the custody of Ethics committee of SMS Medical College, Jaipur, which was not opened till the end of the analysis of the study. Patients were assigned to drotaverine and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>Patients with symptoms indicative of IBS that met the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS were investigated. A stool test for ova and/or parasites, occult stool blood, blood test for full count, liver function tests (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) had to be in the normal range. The Exclusion Criteria were: pregnancy, age under 18 and over 80 years, any history of fever, passage of blood in stool, loss of weight in the recent past, any organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract, malignancy of any other organ, patient on any other concomitant medication for abdominal pain, bowel disturbance, or altering gastrointestinal motility.</p><p>The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each patient admitted to the study was randomly given a tablet of drotaverine HCl (80 mg, Walter Bushnell Pvt Ltd) or placebo thrice a day, for 4 weeks. Patients were asked to visit every week. The visits were as follows:</p><p>Visit 0 (at enrolment), visit 1 (1 week after taking drug), visit 2 (2 weeks after treatment), visit 3 (3 weeks after treatment), visit 4 (4<sup>th</sup> week, i.e., end of study).</p><p>The compliance with medication was ensured by counting the number of tablets not used by the patient, before giving next set of drugs at each visit.</p><p>The parameters that were taken into consideration are as follows:</p><p>

IBS has a considerable impact and causes reduced quality of life.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] People with IBS are more likely to be unable to work and to have visited their doctor than the general population. Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons why people seek medical care (after headaches, backaches, and dizziness).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This study shows that, in patients with IBS, treatment with drotaverine HCl 80 mg given three times daily for 4 weeks is more effective than placebo in reducing abdominal symptoms related to IBS.</p><p>Because no objective markers for improvement of IBS exist, determination of efficacy of drotaverine is based on somewhat arbitrary rating scales. Changes in abdominal pain, bowel habits, and overall well-being are the main outcome measurements recommended in these studies. In our study, we used VAS for assessing the pain response to the treatment.</p><p>Several types of therapy are available for IBS treatment and include bulking agents, prokinetics, antispasmodics, 5-HT agonists and antagonists, smooth muscle relaxants, and antidepressants. However, most studies are hampered by poor methodology and inconclusive findings.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The absence of truly randomized placebo-controlled trials for many of these therapies has limited meaningful progress in this area.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>To quote Klein &#x0201c;Not a single study offers convincing evidence that any therapy is effective in treating the IBS symptom complex. The only method that can reliably evaluate IBS therapies is the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Out of all the clinical trials conducted to evaluate various treatment options, only smooth muscle relaxants consistently decreased abdominal pain, the most frequent and disabling symptom of the IBS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>So far, only a few studies have shown the role of drotaverine on symptoms of IBS. In a preliminary study, Pap <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had shown the efficacy of this drug in IBS in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. They found that the decrease of pain was 47% in the IBS group as compared with 3% in the placebo group. This study, however, did not clearly define the main outcome measures used and if there was any global benefit in pain of IBS. Mishra and colleagues[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found that drotaverine decreased pain frequency and severity significantly in 31.4% and 71.4% of IBS patients as compared with placebo at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> weeks, respectively. Our results were found to be in concordance with the previously reported findings (25.9%, 60%, and 77.7% at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> weeks, respectively).</p><p>Two patients in the drotaverine group and seven patients in the placebo group left the study due to reasons not linked to the treatment. Four percent of patients in the drotaverine group and 3% of patients in the placebo group experienced mild adverse effects [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. These effects did not warrant discontinuation of therapy. Drotaverine was well tolerated and found to be safe.</p><p>In our study, the improvement in IBS symptoms observed in the group treated with drotaverine may be due to the relaxing effect of drotaverine on the intestinal smooth muscle obtained by the inhibition of PDE (Phosphodiesterase) inhibitory and Ca2+&#x02013;calmodulin complex.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, the antispasmodic effect of drotaverine could explain not only the reduced diarrhea present in the majority of our patients through a prolongation of orocecal transit time but also of the constipation present in the rest of the group. In fact, antispasmodics may decrease the functional obstruction caused by increased phasic colonic contractions that may be present in constipation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The role of a multidimensional therapeutic approach in the management of IBS is well recognized.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] An effective physician&#x02013;patient relationship, patient education, reassurance, and judicious dietary modification remain central to treatment. Pharmacologic treatment should be targeted at major symptoms, and treatment should be carefully monitored for adverse effects that can mitigate the benefit of an intervention. We found reasonable evidence to support the use of drotaverine for abdominal pain, which is a predominant and disabling symptom in patients with IBS. More needs to be known about IBS and how to effectively treat it. Focused and sustained research is absolutely crucial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We acknowledge Walter Bushnell for providing the study medication, drotaverine tablet (Drotin DS).
