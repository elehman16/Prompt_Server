They hasten the onset, improve the quality of the block as well as prolong the duration of analgesia. However, the parent drug (morphine) that was initially employed for epidural analgesia had low lipid solubility and a long latency. Its use has been associated with the occurrence of undesirable side effects as pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The search for a better molecule is still going on. Butorphanol is a lipid-soluble narcotic with weak &#x003bc;-receptor agonist and antagonist activity and strong k-receptor agonism.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It has strong analgesic and sedative properties without respiratory depression. Butorphanol has been frequently used for post-operative analgesia and labor analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Fentanyl is a highly lipid-soluble, strong &#x003bc;-receptor agonist and phenyl piperidine derivative with a rapid onset and short duration of action.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Previous studies have compared the two narcotics for post-operative epidural analgesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] None of studies have compared fentanyl and butorphanol as adjuncts for intraoperative epidural anesthesia. The present study was undertaken to compare the safety and efficacy of epidural butorphanol versus epidural fentanyl for lower abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After Institute's Ethical Committee approval and informed consent from the patients, 75 adult patients of either sex of American Society of Anesthesiologist grade I or II in the age group of 20-60 years, undergoing lower abdominal and lower limb surgery under epidural anesthesia were enrolled into the study. Exclusion criteria included patient's refusal, spinal deformity, bleeding diathesis, sepsis, significant cardiorespiratory and hepatic, renal and neurological disease. Patients were familiarized with visual analgesia scale (VAS) scoring pre-operatively and taught to grade their pain on the scale.</p><p>Ranitidine 150 mg and alprazolam 0.25 mg orally were given as premedicants 2 h before the surgery. In the operating room, the patient was connected to a multichannel monitor showing electrocardiography, heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and respiratory rate (RR). A peripheral venous access with 18G cannula was secured. The patients were pre-loaded with Ringer's lactate 10 ml/kg over 15-20 min prior to epidural block. With proper positioning and under all aseptic precautions epidural space was identified in L<sub>3-4</sub> intervertebral space using 18G Tuohy's needle with the loss of resistance to air technique. Epidural catheter was threaded 3-4 cm inside the epidural space and fixed.</p><p>A test dose of 3 ml of 1.5% lignocaine with adrenaline was given after initial negative aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Then, 20 ml of 0.5% plain bupivacaine (B) alone or along with one of the two study drugs was injected into the epidural space. Patients were randomly divided by computer generated random numbers into three groups of 25 each: B, bupivacaine and butorphanol (BB) and bupivacaine + fentanyl (BF). B (0.5%) 20 ml was administered epidurally in all the three groups with the addition of 1 mg butorphanol in BB group and 100 &#x003bc;g fentanyl in the BF group. The study drugs were prepared by a trained anesthesia technician and the anesthesiologist giving the epidural block and making the observations in the intra-operative as well as the post-operative period was unaware of the drug used. The hemodynamic parameters including HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> were monitored and noted every 5 min for the first 20 min and then every 10 min until the end of surgery. The various block characteristics were observed including:</p><p>

</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by pin-prick method using a blunt needle at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min post-drug injection into the epidural space. The motor block was measured at 0, 10, 20 and 30 min post-drug administration and every 30 min post-surgery until the regression of the motor block. The surgical procedure was started 30 min after the drug injection.</p><p>In the post-operative period, pain scores were assessed on the VAS scale every hour till 6 h and then every 2 h till 24 h. Vitals were recorded at the same time intervals as pain scores. Duration of analgesia was taken as the time from the onset of analgesia up to the time when the VAS reached 5. Patient was then given the rescue analgesic (Tramadol 100 mg in 10 ml normal saline) through the epidural catheter and study in that patient ceased. The epidural catheter was kept for 24 h in the post-operative period and post-operative analgesia was maintained with epidural top ups with Tramadol 100 mg in 10 ml normal saline on patient demand. Complications such as, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, headache, pruritus, respiratory depression was noted and treated accordingly.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 13). During the planning stage of the study, the sample size was calculated with the help of power analysis. Assuming type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.1 to detect 30 min difference in post-operative analgesia so as to yield a power of 80%, a sample size of 21 patients was calculated for each group. The inclusion of 25 patients in each group was done for better validation of results. Data is expressed as mean with a standard deviation. Discrete data is expressed as frequency with percentage of total. Normal distribution was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis using Bonferroni test. Chi-square test and Fischer exact test were used to compare discrete variables between the groups.

Administration of 20 ml of 0.5% plain B showed latency of 6-11 min (mean 7.28) and the analgesia was completed in 12-18 min (mean 15.08), consistent with the study by Moore <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Addition of 1 mg butorphanol to 20 ml 0.5% plain B reduced the latency of onset of analgesia to 5-9 min and the completion of analgesia occurred earlier (9-14 min; mean 11.80). Abboud <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] studied epidural butorphanol for the relief of post-operative pain after caesarean section and reported the time of onset of pain relief with 1 mg butorphanol to be 15 min. Mok <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared epidural butorphanol and morphine for the relief of post-operative pain and reported the onset of pain relief at 15 min with 4 mg butorphanol and peak pain relief at 30 min. the difference observed is probably due to the fact that the authors had used butorphanol dissolved in normal saline in the post-operative period, when the patient complained of moderate to severe pain and while in our study, 1 mg butorphanol was administered along with 20 ml 0.5% plain B before the start of surgery. The onset of analgesia was more rapid (4-8 min; mean 4.92) and was completed in 8-13 min (mean 10.80) with the addition of 100 &#x003bc;g fentanyl to 20 ml 0.5% plain B. Cousins and Mather[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported the time of onset of analgesia with epidural fentanyl 100 &#x003bc;g to be 4-10 min.</p><p>The quality of the sensory block was significantly improved with the addition of both the opioids to B. Majority of the patients in group BB and group BF had good quality of analgesia. No patient received any supplemental analgesic during the surgery.</p><p>The pain scores as assessed on the VAS were low and remained low for a significant time in the post-operative period with the addition of fentanyl or butorphanol to B [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The duration of analgesia was also significantly prolonged with the addition of narcotics to LA. We observed duration of analgesia with 20 ml 0.5% B alone to be 2-7 h (mean 4.76) in consistent with other studies that given by Modig and Paalzov[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (range 2.7-5 h; mean 4.3) and Paech <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (mean 5.2 h). The duration of analgesia was prolonged with the addition of 100 &#x003bc;g fentanyl (3-9 h; mean 5.96) in our study, consistent with that given by Cousins and Mather[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (5.7 h) and Paech <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (5.2 h). The duration of analgesia was longest with B-butorphanol combination (5-10 h; mean 7.64). Various studies using epidural butorphanol for post-operative analgesia have reported the duration of analgesia to be 4-6 h, 5 h and 5.35 h with 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg and respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Malik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have also reported in their study that butorphanol provides a longer duration of analgesia than fentanyl, similar to our study.</p><p>Narcotic analgesics are well-known for the potential side effects such as pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Delayed respiratory depression is the most troublesome of these side effects and appears to be largely responsible for the reluctance of anesthesiologists to use intrathecal or epidural narcotics. This phenomenon is thought to be due to transport of drug in cerebrospinal fluid from the lumbar region to the fourth ventricle, with consequent depression of the medullary respiratory centers. The incidence of delayed respiratory depression appears to be greatest with poorly lipid-soluble narcotic drugs, like morphine.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Bromage[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] suggested that lipid-soluble, highly protein bound narcotic analgesics might be less likely to exhibit this phenomenon and this appears to be true for both butorphanol and fentanyl. The patients were continuously observed for respiratory depression with SpO<sub>2</sub> (&#x0003c; 90%) and RR (&#x0003c; 10). No case of respiratory depression was observed in any group, consistent with other studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The incidence of pruritus was higher in group BF (25%) as compared to group (BB).
