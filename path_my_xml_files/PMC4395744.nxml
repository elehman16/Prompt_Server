the kinematics of the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex during forward bending by individuals with
reduced hamstring extensibility. [Subjects] Eighteen males with reduced hamstring
extensibility were randomly assigned to one of two groups:, the hamstring KT group (n=9),
or the sham KT group (n=9). [Methods] The kinematics of the lumbopelvic-hip complex during
lumbar forward bending was measured using a motion capture system before and after
applying KT. [Results] The angle of lumbar flexion during late lumbar forward bending
increased significantly post-KT compared to pre-KT measurements in the hamstring KT group.
[Conclusion] These findings suggest that KT does not directly affect an individual&#x02019;s
movement during lumbar forward bending.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinematics</kwd><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Lumbar forward bending</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Specific postures and movements required in sports, as well as improper training, can
negatively affect the hamstring extensibility of athletes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hamstring extensibility may subsequently affect pelvic movement,
and posture, and sagittal curvature during lumbopelvic bending<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because the hamstring muscles originate at the pelvic ischial
tuberosity, and the pelvis is regarded as the root of the spine<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, reduced hamstring extensibility can cause changes in
lumbo-pelvic rhythm<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly,
hamstring-stretching programs are recommended for maintaining and improving hamstring
extensibility<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Of the various hamstring-stretching programs available, Kinesio taping (KT) has been
investigated as a means of improving hamstring extensibility. Akba&#x0015f; et al. demonstrated that
hamstring extensibility increased significantly after implementing KT in comparison with
conventional exercise program for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, KT increased the range of
motion (ROM) in the passive straight leg raise (SLR) test and increased knee extension
angle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few studies have
investigated the effect of KT on movement patterns, especially that of lumbo-pelvic rhythm.
Although, Lemos et al. showed that application of KT increased the lumbar flexion angle of
healthy subjects<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Lee et al. showed
that application of KT increased the anterior inclination of the pelvis on both sides in
healthy subjects<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, these studies only
investigated the movement of one joint. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effect of
KT on the kinematics of the lumbopelvic-hip complex during lumbar forward bending. We
hypothesized that KT would reduce lumbar flexion, and increase pelvic anterior tilt and hip
flexion during lumbar forward bending.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eighteen males with reduced hamstring extensibility on the right side were randomly
assigned to one of two groups: the hamstring KT group (n=9; mean age: 23.55 &#x000b1; 4.00&#x02005;years;
mean height: 172.55 &#x000b1; 4.97&#x02005;cm; mean weight: 66.22 &#x000b1; 7.01&#x02005;kg) or the sham KT group (n=9; mean
age: 21.00 &#x000b1; 1.73&#x02005;years; mean height: 176.11 &#x000b1; 7.00&#x02005;cm; mean weight: 73.11 &#x000b1; 15.28&#x02005;kg). The
inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) reduced hamstring extensibility (angle of active knee
extension (AKE) &#x02264; 160&#x000b0;), and 2) the ability to maintain full extension during lumbar forward
bending<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion criteria included a history of knee, hip, or low
back pain, or scoliosis, or surgery of the lower extremities or low back in the previous 6
months. Prior to participation, all subjects read and signed an informed consent form
approved by the Inje University Ethics Committee for Human Investigations.</p><p>Kinematic measurements of the lumbopelvic-hip complex in the sagittal plane during lumbar
forward bending were obtained using a VICON MX-T20 motion capture system (Vicon Motion
Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK). Sixteen reflective markers were attached to landmarks, consistent
with the VICON Plug-in-Gait model<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Four
additional reflective markers were added to assess the kinematics of the lumbar spine; These
were attached to the first and second lumbar spinous processes, and to both sides of the
second lumbar spinous process<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Before applying KT, movement analysis was performed. The subjects were asked to perform
lumbar forward bending. For early lumbar forward bending, the subjects stood comfortably
with their feet shoulder-width apart, and then bent forward slowly until their fingertips
reached a crossbar. Subjects maintained this position for 3 s. For late lumbar forward
bending, the subjects were asked to bend as far forward as possible and maintain this
position for 3&#x02005;s, followed by a return to the standing position. All subjects performed knee
extension and the lumbar forward bending motions three times.</p><p>The hamstring KT protocol was similar to that described by Lumbroso et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and standard 5-cm beige tape was used for
all subjects. Hamstring KT was applied with the subject in a standing position with slight
lumbar forward bending in order to achieve initial hip flexion. The examiner applied tape
from the ischial tuberosity to the lateral popliteal fossa on the lateral hamstring in an
I-shape. A second I-shaped taping was applied from the ischial tuberosity to the medial
popliteal fossa on the medial hamstring. The tape was stretched to approximately 30% of its
maximal stretch during application<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the sham KT group, tape was applied in the same locations as in the hamstring KT group, but
without stretching or lumbar forward bending. Immediately after applying KT, lumbar forward
bending was repeated in the same manner as in the initial assessment, pre-KT. Kinematic data
were recorded three times for each condition during lumbar forward bending, and the mean
values of the peak angles were used in the data analysis.</p><p>Kinematic data were collected at a sampling data rate of 100&#x02005;Hz and processed using the
Nexus software (version 1.7; Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK). The angle of lumbar
flexion was calculated as the change in the angle of the lumbar spine vector relative to the
pelvis. The angle of pelvic anterior tilt was calculated as the absolute motion of the
pelvic segment, and the angle of hip flexion was calculated as the change in the angle of
the thigh vector relative to the pelvic segment. Lumbar flexion, pelvic anterior tilt, and
hip flexion were defined as positive angular values of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip,
respectively.</p><p>All data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Software, Chicago, IL, USA). A Two-way
repeated ANOVA (within-group factor: time, between-group factor: group) was used to
determine the main effects and their interaction for movement of the lumbopelvic-hip
complex, with a p-value of &#x0003c; 0.05 indicating statistical significance. A post
hoc<italic/>t-test was also performed, with a statistical significance for level of tests
was also set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A significant main effect was observed for time (pre-KT vs. post-KT) for the angle of

flexion. These findings indicate that KT does not directly affect the movement of the
lumbopelvic-hip complex. One possible reason for this finding is that lumbar forward bending
includes thoracic, lumbar, pelvic, and hip movements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and KT was used to control only one joint connecting with the
hamstring muscle, and did not affect the other structures, or their movements. A second
possible reason for this finding is that the movement pattern can be influenced by various
factors, including ROM, proprioception, and muscles stiffness<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, we propose that
KT does not immediately influence the movement pattern.</p><p>Our results showed that the lumbar flexion angle during late lumbar forward bending
increased significantly post-KT compared to pre-KT measurements within the hamstring KT
group. The tension provided by KT may have helped to move the muscles, fascia, or the joint
into a more desirable position<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>;
however, it may also have limited ROM in the taped region. The KT technique used here
involves applying the tape after hip flexion has been initiated. Because of this, early
lumbar forward bending did not affect the pelvis or hip movements, whereas the hip and
pelvis were affected in late lumbar forward bending due to increased KT tension.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was small; only 18 subjects with
reduced hamstring extensibility were recruited to investigate changes in the lumbopelvic-hip
complex. Second, this study investigated only acute or immediate effects. Additional studies
are required to investigate the long-term effects of KT on motion of the lumbopelvic-hip
complex.</p><p>This study investigated the effects of KT on the kinematics of the lumbopelvic-hip complex
during lumbar forward bending. Our results indicate that KT does not influence in the angle
of pelvic anterior tilt or hip flexion during lumbar forward bending. Thus, KT is not
appropriate as an intervention for the improvement of the movement pattern.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the
