and research shows that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol has a greater
immuno-protective effect than inhalational anesthesia in human medicine. However, in
veterinary clinics, these effects remain ambiguous. To clarify the details, we focused on
propofol and isoflurane, investigating clinical blood hematology and immunological
profiles drawn from healthy dogs under and after two anesthesia techniques. Twelve healthy
adult beagles were included in this study, randomly assigned to the propofol anesthesia
group (group P: n=6) or the isoflurane anesthesia group (group I: n=6). In both groups,
the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood decreased after 2 hr of anesthesia (2 hr),
but group P showed significantly less decrease than group I. For T-lymphocyte subsets
examined by flowcytometry, the ratio of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of group P at 2 hr also exhibited a high level compared to
group I. Moreover, for mRNA expression of cytokines measured by real-time PCR, the IL2
(pro-inflammatory cytokine) of group P showed no decrease like group I. The IL10
(anti-inflammatory cytokine) of group P also showed no increase like group I, while both
cytokines maintained nearly the same level until 2 hr. These results suggest that,
compared to propofol, isoflurane had more strongly immuno-suppression caused by
anesthesia, and propofol itself might have some immuno-protective effects. Thus, TIVA with
propofol might benefit immunological support in the perioperative period of dogs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>canine</kwd><kwd>immuno-suppression</kwd><kwd>isoflurane</kwd><kwd>propofol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Anesthesia is widely-used in veterinary medical clinics as a support for clinical treatments
and surgery; however, it is also well-known that anesthesia itself suppresses the immune
system. Influencing the functions of immunocompetent cells and inflammatory mediator gene
expression and secretion, most anesthetics have a direct suppressive effect on cellular and
neurohumoral immunity [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Every anesthetic has
different immunosuppressive effects, and researchers generally agree that total intravenous
anesthesia (TIVA) is less immunosuppressive than inhalational anesthesia [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most commonly used in veterinary medicine, propofol
also has shown immunosuppressive effects, but fewer than the other volatile anesthetics;
moreover, it has some protective influences on the immune system. For example, while
inhalation anesthetics induced apoptosis in normal peripheral lymphocytes <italic>in
vitro</italic> [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], propofol showed less induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Propofol also exhibits less suppressive
characteristics for neutrophil phagocytosis compared with isoflurane [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], more activated T-helper cells in human lung cancer patients under
anesthesia [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and more protective effects for
alveolar inflammatory response compared with desflurane [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As a result of these studies, many researchers have reported that TIVA,
especially with propofol, has more beneficial immunological effects than volatile anesthetics
in human medicine.</p><p>In veterinary medicine, TIVA and propofol have come to be generally used in many cases;
however, there remain only a few reports of such beneficial effects [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the immunological details remain unclear. To clarify the
differences in anesthetics&#x02019; immuno-suppressive effects in dogs, we focused on propofol and
isoflurane, investigating clinical blood hematology and biochemistry profiles drawn from
healthy dogs under and after two different anesthesia techniques. Furthermore, we examined
T-lymphocyte subsets for the immunological profiles, determining mRNA expression levels of
inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), such as IL2, IL10, IL12
and IFN&#x003b3;.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Dogs</italic>: Twelve healthy adult beagles (6 males and 6 females) were included
in the study. All dogs were kept in the animal facilities of our university, and mean age
was 1.5 years old (range 1.2 to 3.2). The protocol was approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary
Medicine (Permit number 24&#x02013;89).</p><p><italic>Anesthesia and instrumentation</italic>: The dogs were randomly assigned to the
propofol anesthesia group (group P: n=6) or the isoflurane anesthesia group (group I: n=6).
A catheter (surflo IV catheter, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into a cephalic vein
before anesthesia. All dogs were allowed to breathe oxygen by face mask for 5 min prior to
anesthesia.</p><p>Dogs in group P received midazoram (0.3 mg/kg, dormicam; Asteras, Tokyo, Japan)
intravenously as a co-induction agent. Five min later, they were induced with propofol (6
mg/kg, Propofol 1%; Nichi-Iko, Toyama, Japan) administered by slow IV injection, at a rate
of approximately 6 mg/kg/min. After endotracheal intubation (6&#x02013;7 Fr induction tube, TOP,
Tokyo, Japan), the dogs were connected to the small animal anesthesia machine (Acoma, Tokyo,
Japan) with rebreathing circuit (MC Medical, Tokyo, Japan) using a 100% oxygen flow rate of
2 <italic>l</italic>/min. After induction, mechanical ventilation was started immediately
using with pressure cycled respirator (COMPOS B-EV; Metran, Kawaguchi, Japan) at 13
mmH<sub>2</sub>O of peak inspiratory pressure, 6/min of breathing frequency and 1.6 sec of
inspiratory time. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained within the reference range (35 to 45
mmHg). Anesthesia was maintained by continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (0.5
mg/kg/min) and fentanyl (0.2 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/kg/min). Both agents were diluted in normal
saline (0.9% saline, Otsuka-Pharm, Tokyo, Japan) and administered by syringe pump (JMS
syringe pump SP115, JMS co., Hiroshima, Japan) at 5 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr. While
maintaining a state of anesthesia, monitoring occurred for heart rate, hemoglobin oxygen
saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), rectal temperature and EtCO<sub>2</sub> every 30 min by
biological information monitor (Colin BP-608 Evolution, Omron, Tokyo, Japan). After 2 hr of
maintenance, anesthesia was discontinued. Dogs were mechanically ventilated until signs of
spontaneous ventilation were apparent, and extubated appropriately.</p><p>Dogs in group I received the same co-induction agent, induction, intubation, ventilation,
monitoring and extubation. During maintenance of anesthesia for 2 hr, the dogs were
maintained with isoflurane (Isoflu; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharm, Osaka, Japan) and fentanyl
(0.2 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/kg/min, continuous intravenous infusion). The vaporizer&#x02019;s
(Vaporizer MKIIIa, Acoma) setting was adjusted for end-tidal isoflurane concentration
(EtISO) between 1.1 and 1.2%. Dogs were transfused with normal saline at the same volume as
group P. In both protocols, one anesthetist evaluated the adequate depth of anesthesia via
muscle relaxation, eyeball position, palpebral reflex and pain sensation. In order to
achieve a similar level of pain sensation, fentanyl was used in both groups at the same
dose.</p><p><italic>Blood sampling</italic>: Blood specimens were taken from the jugular vein of all
dogs at the same time points, before anesthesia (&#x02018;pre&#x02019;), after anesthesia (2 hr), 1 day
later (day 1), 3 days later (day 3) and 7 days later (day 7).</p><p><italic>Hematology and biochemistry profiles</italic>: Five hundred <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of
blood specimens with EDTA were analyzed using an automatic cell counter (Celltac alpha,
Nihon-Koden, Tokyo, Japan) to count RBC and WBC. Blood smears of each specimen were made and
evaluated for a manual WBC differential. Hct and total protein (TP) were measured by
hematcrit tube (Terumo) and refractometers (Master3 alpha, Terumo). Plasma was collected
from 1 m<italic>l</italic> of heparinized blood specimens and measured for ALB, ALT, ALKP,
BUN and CRE using the Vet Test 8008 chemistry analyzer (IDEXX, Tokyo, Japan). For Na, K and
Cl, a Fuji DRI-CHEM 7000 (Fuji-Film, Tokyo, Japan) was used. Also, calculated was a
decreasing rate compared to &#x02018;pre&#x02019; (defined as 100) for RBC, WBC, TP and lymphocytes.</p><p><italic>PBMC</italic>: Five m<italic>l</italic> of heparinized whole blood specimen was
mixed with the same volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and layered on 3
m<italic>l</italic> of lymphocyte separation medium (Nakarai, Kyoto, Japan). The sample
was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 50 min at RT. PBMC from the upper part of the Ficoll layer
were collected and washed with PBS before Lysing Buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
U.S.A.) was added. After incubation for 5 min at RT, the sample was washed twice with PBS
and counted with a hemocytometer (Improved Neubauer; Elma, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p><italic>Flowcytometry</italic>: PBMC were adjusted at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells /50

added and incubated for 5 min at RT. Samples were then homogenized with
QIA-shredder<sup>TM</sup>250 (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), and the total RNA was
collected according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. One <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g of total RNA was
reverse transcribed using an oligo (dT) 12&#x02013;18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ,

propofol itself attenuates inotropoic response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, and
propofol, combined with fentanyl, reduced heart rates in humans [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, one study reported that no bradycardia occurred in dogs under
TIVA with propofol and fentanyl, with heart rates between 80 to 120 beat/min [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In that report, propofol was used at 0.2&#x02013;0.4
mg/kg/min, less than in our study (0.5 mg/kg/min), therefore explaining this difference and
why bradycardia occurred in group P. On the other hand, fentanyl may cause bradycardia, due
to opioid-induced medullary vagal stimulation [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>],
in contrast, isoflurane increased heart rates in anesthetized dogs by decreasing cardiac
vagal activity [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, isoflurane may be
associated with the smaller decrease in heart rate seen in group I, in spite of using
fentanyl simultaneously.</p><p>In both groups, all hematological parameters (TP, RBC and lymphocytes) decreased at 2 hr
compared with &#x02018;pre&#x02019;. This finding could result from blood dilution. It has already been
reported that both propofol and isoflurane cause vasodilation during anesthesia in human
patients [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in dogs [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, the
transfusion of crystalloid solution itself has been shown to cause blood dilution during
anesthesia [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, in this study, blood
pressure was not monitored under anesthesia. Intraoperative hypotension, caused by
anesthesia, may suppress the immune system in humans [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and in rats [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, this hypotension
may have affected our results. This measurement would be important and helpful for future
research in clarifying the details of this issue.</p><p>The change ratios of RBC between &#x02018;pre&#x02019; and 2 hr in both groups were higher than that of TP,
but not significantly. One study reported that the splenic size was enlarged in dogs under
anesthesia [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], indicating that RBC might be trapped
in the spleen at 2 hr. However, there was a marked decrease in lymphocytes at 2 hr; the
change ratio of group P was significantly lower than group I. It is impossible to account
for this phenomenon simply with vasodilution; it could be related to some immunological
protective effect of propofol.</p><p>In human medicine, both propofol and isoflurane have shown decreased lymphocytes in the
immune response to hysterectomy, and even less in TIVA with propofol [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, most of these reports were related to surgery, not only
anesthesia. On the other hand, <italic>in vitro</italic>, isoflurane-induced apoptosis of
lymphocytes [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and propofol did not interfere with
the proliferation of T-lymphocytes [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, our
results indicating a different change ratio in lymphocytes might be associated with the
differences of immunological effect between propofol and isoflurane.</p><p>During the perioperative period, it is important to maintain a high number of lymphocytes
in PBMC to prevent infectious diseases and early recovery from surgery, especially in cancer
patients [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The immunosuppressive effects for
lymphocytes have been associated with the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To investigate the details of this issue, we
focused on T-lymphocyte, which plays a critical role in cellular immune response during
anesthesia; we also examined its subset and expression of cytokine.</p><p>For T-lymphocyte subsets, studies have compared TIVA and sevoflurane in human patients,
showing that the number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes after TIVA showed less decrease
than after sevoflurane anesthesia [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study,
CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes were also decreased at 2 hr in both groups, but group P
showed a more moderate decrease than group I. Afterwards, group P recovered at day 1 at the
same level as &#x02018;pre&#x02019;, while group I continued at a lower level until day 3. These results
suggest that propofol had some immuno-protective effect in terms of the decrease of
T-lymphocytes after anesthesia.</p><p>For mRNA expression of cytokines, the IL2 of group P showed no decrease like group I,
maintaining the same level of &#x02018;pre&#x02019; until 2 hr. IL2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and in
human medicine, researchers also observed no decrease after TIVA with propofol, compared to
the decrease following sevoflurane anesthesia [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
On the other hand, IL10 is thought to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and in our study,
the IL10 of group P showed no increase like group I, also maintaining the same level of
&#x02018;pre&#x02019; until 2 hr. In human medicine, however, the IL10 of TIVA showed a higher level than
that of inhalational anesthesia during the perioperative period [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This conflict might result from different study design, such as
patients with or without surgery, IL10 measurement by real-time PCR or ELISA, and different
usages and doses of anesthetic drugs. In our study, propofol showed less IL2 decrease and
less IL10 increase at 2 hr, indicating that propofol itself might have an immuno-protective
effect on cytokine mRNA expression, countering the immuno-suppression caused by
anesthesia.</p><p>Group P&#x02019;s IL12 and IFN&#x003b3; showed virtually no change, maintaining the same level until day 5,
while that of group I showed an increase at day 3. This increase coincided with a recovery
of CD8+ lymphocytes in group I at day 3, so it might be associated with the increase in CD8+
lymphocytes. IL12 and IFN&#x003b3; are also made by CD8+ lymphocytes; they are also thought to
stimulate the proliferation of Th1 cells, while inhibiting Th2 cells. In human cancer
patients, the Th1/Th2 ratio in TIVA with propofol showed no change after anesthesia, while
that in inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane showed significant decreases [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Th1/Th2 ratio might be associated with cancer
progression and metastasis, which also has been reported in dogs [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our study, the Th1/Th2 ratio was not examined, but these results
suggest that the Th1/Th2 ratio decreased on day 3 after isoflurane anesthesia, but propofol
might prevent this kind of immunological deterioration.</p><p>In this experiment, we used fentanyl in both groups to imitate the current method commonly
used in veterinary clinics. Future studies should investigate the immune effect of an
anesthetic agent alone, as well as its interaction with fentanyl. And, although we cofirmed
adequate anesthetic depth in both groups, we could not ensure that each group reached
identical anesthetic depths. However, we used normal dosage of isoflurane [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/min for propofol, which is
higher than the common dosage (0.2&#x02013;0.4 mg/kg/min) currently used in veterinary clinics
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
Nevertheless, immuno-suppression was higher in group I than in group P. Therefore, propofol
itself may have had an immuno-protective effect unrelated to any differences in anesthetic
depth.</p><p>These data show that isoflurane had more strongly suppression for immune system caused by
anesthesia than propofol, and propofol might have some immuno-protective effects,
particularly against the decrease of T-lymphocytes and changes in the pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines. It also might be associated with the Th1/Th2 ratio during
anesthesia in dogs. However, the number of samples in our study was inadequate, and the
protein level of cytokine expression in PBMC should be examined. Furthermore, as we used
only GAPDH as an internal standard for mRNA expression, it also should be examined the most
suitable internal standard among all candidates. Hereafter, it becomes important to clarify
the relationship between TIVA and cancer recurrence as well as the relationship between TIVA
and the rate of incidence for infectious disease in the perioperative period. Further
research may emphasize that TIVA with propofol in dogs has more immunological merit, making
it useful for many purposes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Billard</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moulla</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourgain</surname><given-names>J.
