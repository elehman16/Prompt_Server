This humanized, recombinant, monoclonal antibody fragment is the first treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration that improves visual acuity. In 2 recent randomized controlled trials, MARINA (the Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the ANCHOR study (Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in Age-Related Macular Degeneration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], it prevented vision loss and improved visual acuity.</p><p>The availability of ranibizumab is therefore likely to transform the management of neovascular macular degeneration, a disease that can be blinding and is epidemic in the developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, ranibizumab is expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], its monthly intravitreal dosing regimen is inconvenient and potentially increases the risk of bacterial endophthalmitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and its efficacy beyond 2 years is unknown. Before ranibizumab was licensed in the United States, some physicians treated patients with bevacizumab, a similar, but much cheaper, molecule which is licensed for the treatment of metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Preliminary studies of bevacizumab's efficacy in neovascular macular degeneration suggest benefits similar to those of ranibizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], so its "off label" use might continue, or it might be studied in randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with macular degeneration (and eventually licensed for this indication if found to be effective), or the price of ranibizumab might be reduced. There is also evidence that fewer than 24 monthly injections of ranibizumab may be just as efficacious, and trials are underway evaluating less frequent dosing, and variable dosing regimens guided by visual acuity and optical coherence tomography findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present analysis was to perform incremental cost-effectiveness analyses of the use of ranibizumab for neovascular macular degeneration. These analyses investigated ranibizumab's efficiency in terms of improved vision and quality of life outcomes, compared with current standard management, and the extent to which the initial cost of ranibizumab will be offset by savings due to prevention of vision loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Model Overview</title><p>We developed a Markov model using the decision analysis software TreeAge[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] to simulate the progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in patients in the United States and to predict the following outcomes associated with a ranibizumab treatment strategy and a no ranibizumab treatment strategy (i.e. standard or usual care): the probability of blindness, number of blind-years (years spent blind), number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct costs (excluding patient time and travel costs) from a societal perspective and from a health care funder's perspective in 2004 U.S. dollars. We compared the 2 strategies in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over time horizons of up to 10 years. Note that in the United Kingdom, the incremental cost per QALY would sometimes be referred to as a cost-utility ratio. In this paper, we refer to cost per QALY, cost per case of blindness averted and cost per blind-year averted as cost-effectiveness ratios, an approach that is standard in the United States.</p><p>Disease progression was characterized by a series of annual transitions between health states, defined by the patient's visual acuity and measured in terms of the number of letters read by the better seeing eye on the logMAR chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our model was therefore a "second eye" model, i.e. the other ("first") eye was assumed to have worse vision, and therefore after treatment with ranibizumab QALYs accrued immediately. The 5 health states considered were referred to as 90, 75, 60, 45 and 30 letters, and corresponded to the number of letters read being &#x0003e; 85, 70&#x02013;80, 55&#x02013;65, 40&#x02013;50, and &#x0003c; 35, respectively. We assumed that, each year, a patient's visual acuity would either increase by 15 letters, remain the same, decrease by 15 letters, or decrease by 30 letters. (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for a simplified version of the model). The probabilities of these events did not depend on the number of letters able to be read at the start of the year. A patient was classified as blind when they moved to the 30 letters state, corresponding to a visual acuity of &#x0003c; 35 letters read (Snellen equivalent &#x0003c; 20/200). In the United States, and many other countries, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity of &#x02264; 20/200 in the better eye with the best correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simplified diagram of Markov tree model, which was analysed for the Ranibizumab treatment strategy and the No ranibizumab treatment strategy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1478-7547-6-12-1"/></fig><p>Our assumptions about ranibizumab's efficacy, and hence the annual transition probabilities between health states, were based on the results of MARINA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], rather than the ANCHOR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], because MARINA outcomes were reported at 2 years follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], compared to only 12 months for the ANCHOR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and, at 12 months follow-up, the efficacy of ranibizumab compared to sham injection in MARINA was virtually identical to the efficacy of ranibizumab compared with verteporfin photodynamic therapy assessed in the ANCHOR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, approximately three-quarters of patients with neovascular macular degeneration have the type of disease studied in MARINA (minimally classic or occult choroidal neovascularization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], compared with one-quarter of patients who have predominantly classic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which was studied in the ANCHOR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In MARINA, other accepted therapies were permitted, including verteporfin photodynamic therapy in line with reimbursement guidelines, so our analysis compared ranibizmab treatment with standard care without ranibizumab.</p><p>Beyond the 2-year time horizon of MARINA we considered 3 hypothetical scenarios underpinned by different assumptions about disease progression, and ranibizumab's effectiveness and dosing regimen (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We assumed that transition probabilities between visual acuity health states for the no ranibizumab strategy would be the same for all 3 scenarios. In the "base-case" ranibizumab scenario we assumed that the changes in visual acuity associated with ranibizumab in the second year of MARINA would continue for the next 2 years, and that patients would then develop the atrophy form of macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We assumed that ranibizumab would be given according to the MARINA dosing regimen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] for the first 2 years, then every 3 months for Years 3 and 4, then ceased. For the "sustained-effect" scenario, we again assumed that the effect of ranibizumab observed in the second year of MARINA would continue for the next 2 years, but that visual acuity at the end of the 4-year time horizon would be sustained. We assumed that ranibizumab would be given less frequently than in MARINA and for only 2 years. For the "non-sustained-effect" scenario, we assumed that ranibizumab would be given according to the MARINA dosing regimen for 2 years, but that it would be ineffective beyond that time and would therefore be ceased and visual acuity would decline at the same rate as in the no ranibizumab treatment strategy.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Assumptions for annual transition probabilities, and ranibizumab dosing regimen</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Ranibizumab treatment</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>No ranibizumab treatment</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold>Base-case scenario</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Sustained-effect scenario</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Non-sustained-effect scenario</bold></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Annual transition probabilities*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Time horizon</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Years 1 and 2</td><td align="left">Results of MARINA, 0.5 mg ranibizumab arm.</td><td align="left">As for base-case</td><td align="left">As for base-case</td><td align="left">Results of MARINA, sham arm.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Years 3 and 4</td><td align="left">Year 2 MARINA data, 0.5 mg ranibizumab arm.</td><td align="left">As for base-case</td><td align="left">Year 2 MARINA data, sham arm</td><td align="left">Year 2 MARINA data, sham arm.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Years 5 to 10</td><td align="left">Year 5 to 10 progression rates of the geographic atrophy form of age-related macular degeneration</td><td align="left">No further transitions (neither increasing nor decreasing visual acuity)</td><td align="left">Year 2 MARINA data, sham arm, progression rates decreasing by 40% each year</td><td align="left">Year 2 MARINA data, sham arm, progression rates decreasing by 40% each year</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ranibizumab dosing regimen</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">One dose monthly for the first 2 years, then every 3 months until end of Year 4.

We took the probability of a 15 letter gain in visual acuity to be the probability of an increase in visual acuity by &#x02265; 15 letters, and the probability of a loss of 30 letters to be the probability of a loss of &#x02265; 30 letters. We calculated the probability of no change in visual acuity by subtracting the probability of an increase of &#x02265; 15 letters from the probability of a loss of &#x0003c; 15 letters, and the probability of a loss of 15 letters by subtracting the sum of the probabilities of a loss of &#x0003c; 15 letters and a loss of &#x02265; 30 letters from 1.</p><p>The annual transition probabilities for the first year were simply the cumulative probabilities at the end of 12 months.

We assumed that each year following a diagnosis of geographic atrophy there would either be no change in visual acuity, a loss of 15 letters or a loss of 30 letters, and that the probabilities of these 3 events did not depend on the number of letters able to be read at the start of the year. For the first 4 years following diagnosis these annual transition probabilities were estimated from the natural history data reported by Sunness et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]</p><p>We combined the data from visual acuity (VA) group 1 (67 cases with VA &#x0003e; 20/50) and group 2 (43 cases with VA &#x02264; 20/50 and &#x0003e; 20/200). Because of the small number of cases available, we assumed that the transition probabilities would be the same in each of the first 4 years. The cumulative percentages of eyes with visual acuity worsening by 3 or more lines (15 or more letters) after 4 years of follow-up were obtained from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (70% for VA group 1 and 43% for VA group 2). A weighted average of these cumulative percentages was obtained with weights proportional to the number of cases in each group, leading to the combined estimate of 59.4%. The cumulative percentages of eyes with visual acuity worsening by 6 or more lines (30 or more letters) after 4 years of follow-up were obtained from the text (45% for VA group 1 and 20% for VA group 2). Again, a weighted average of this cumulative percentage was obtained, leading to the combined estimate of 34.8%. The cumulative percentage of eyes with worsening visual acuity (VA) by 3 or more lines but not by 6 or more lines was obtained by subtraction (59.4% &#x02013; 34.8% = 24.6%). The annual transition probabilities were then obtained by expressing the cumulative probabilities of losing 15 or 30 letters from baseline after 4 years of follow-up in terms of these annual transition probabilities and solving the resulting equations.

These costs did not vary with the treatment strategy. The macular degeneration medical care costs were sourced from an analysis of Medicare files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

When the costs of such caregiving were included in this analysis, and a dose of ranibizumab was costed at the price of bevacizumab, the ranibizumab treatment strategy cost less than no treatment, even over a time horizon of 2 years. When the cost of ranibizumab was taken to be its current wholesale price, ranibizumab treatment was cost-saving over time horizons longer than 6 years.</p><p>Many health care funders will, however, make decisions about the provision of ranibizumab from the perspective of their own organisation, and will not consider the cost of non-medical care for people with poor visual acuity. When caregiver costs were excluded from our analyses, ranibizumab treatment was cost-saving at 10-years under only one set of assumptions: sustained-effectiveness, administration of ranibizumab less frequently for only 2 years, and the ranibizumab cost equal to the bevacizumab price (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). However, treatments do not have to be cost-saving to be considered "cost-effective". Although there is no universally accepted threshold cost-effectiveness ratio below which an intervention is viewed as cost-effective, Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), for example, is increasingly likely to reject technologies on the basis of cost-ineffectiveness when their cost per QALY is between US$30,000 and US$45,900 (between approximately &#x000a3;20,000 and &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This suggests that NICE definitely regards interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $30,000 per QALY as cost-effective, and may regard those with ratios between $30,000 and around $50,000 per QALY as cost-effective. In contrast, Murray et al. recently defined "very cost-effective" interventions as those that gain each year of healthy life at a cost less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per head, and "cost-effective" interventions as those that gain a year of healthy life at a cost of between one and 3 times GDP per head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Murray and colleagues' analysis was based on disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), which are similar, but not identical, to QALYs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, some inferences about the "cost-effectiveness" of ranibizumab can be made on the basis of Murray et al.'s analysis. The GDP per person in the U.S. was $43,500 in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Ranibizumab could therefore be regarded as very cost-effective when its cost per QALY was less than about $50,000, and cost effective when this ratio was less than about $130,000. At the 10-year time horizon, ranibizumab could therefore be regarded as cost-effective according to Murray and colleagues' criteria, but would be unlikely to be recommended by NICE if the price per dose was greater than about $1,000.</p><p>Detsky and Laupacis recently drew attention to speculation that the identification of threshold cost-effectiveness ratios for funding could encourage drug companies to charge a price that achieves that ratio, even if the drug could be sold profitably at a lower price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, our results could in fact be used by funding agencies in the United States to determine the price at which ranibizumab falls below their own cost-effectiveness threshold for funding (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and to underpin price negotiations with the manufacturer. An alternative approach to implementing cost-effective treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration would be to conduct a randomized controlled trial of bevazicumab relative to ranibizumab. A UK-based economic analysis used modelling to determine the efficacy profile bevazicumab would need to have to be regarded as cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This approach is likely to take far longer than price negotiations for ranibizumab.</p><p>NICE did in fact conduct an appraisal of ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, which included an independent economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This evaluation used the United Kingdom price of &#x000a3;761.20 for a ranibizumab injection, which, when converted to US dollars on the basis of the Gross Domestic Product Purchasing Power Parity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], is about 60% of the US wholesale price. Other costs were derived largely from clinical guidelines and discussions with specialists. The evaluation's estimate for the annual cost of medical, community and residential care for a patient who becomes blind was only one-fifth of the cost estimate derived from US experience that we used in our study. NICE recommended ranibizumab for the treatment of all forms of neovascular age-related macular degeneration included on its marketing authorisation, under specified clinical conditions, and provided the cost of treatment beyond 14 injections is met by ranibizumab's manufacturer. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ranibizumab treatment of minimally classic or occult no classic lesions, over a 10 year follow-up period and assuming only 14 injections are administered was &#x000a3;19,904 per QALY, which is consistent with the thresholds outlined above.</p><p>Our analysis had a US context. It was underpinned by the results of a high quality randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], US cost data from the Medicare files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], caregiver cost and utility data from US studies of patients with macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and explicit assumptions about dosing regimens and post-trial efficacy. We did not include adverse events associated with ranibizumab in our model as none occurred with increased frequency in MARINA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] or the ANCHOR study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, an analysis of combined data from the 2 trials suggested that ranibizumab increased the risk of nonocular hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and this possibility is being monitored in a long-term extension study and ongoing trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All patients in both trials received intravitreal injections, but serious uveitis occurred in only 7 of the 1,139 patients (0.6%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] Including this very rare event in the model would not impact predicted health or cost outcomes. Similarly, any disutility associated with the intravitreal injections, for example due to pain, was not considered because the duration of the injections and any consequential decrease in the utility of life was too small to have any impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios.</p><p>Beyond 2 years, our model was based on 3 sets of assumptions about treatment effectiveness and dosing, as trial data were unavailable. In contrast, the independent economic evaluation commissioned by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and the bevazicumab modelling study by Raftery and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] assumed that after a two-year ranibizumab treatment period visual acuity would decline at the same rate as observed in the control group. Each of the three scenarios we modelled is likely to reflect the experience of at least some patients. Data from ongoing studies will clarify the average long-term outcomes of ranibizumab therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Notwithstanding the uncertainty about long-term outcomes, our study demonstrated that over a 10-year time horizon, under all plausible assumptions, ranibizumab was cost-saving from a societal perspective. From a health care funder's perspective, ranibizumab was cost-effective over a 10-year time horizon when it cost $1000 per dose or less (about half the current wholesale price). Ranibizumab would be cost-effective at a higher price in settings where cost-effectiveness ratios higher than $50,000 per QALY were regarded as acceptable.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
