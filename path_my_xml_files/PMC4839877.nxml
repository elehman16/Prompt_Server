It is effective for symptom control of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, its efficacy in the treatment of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection remains unclear. This pilot, randomized, controlled, head-to-head study was conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy was noninferior to double-dose rabeprazole-based triple therapy in the treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Consecutive <italic>H pylori</italic>-infected subjects were randomly allocated to either 7-day dexlansoprazole MR-based standard triple therapy (dexlansoprazole MR 60&#x0200a;mg once daily, clarithromycin 500&#x0200a;mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 1&#x0200a;g twice daily) or rabeprazole-based triple therapy (rabeprazole 20&#x0200a;mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500&#x0200a;mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 1&#x0200a;g twice daily). <italic>H pylori</italic> status was assessed 6 weeks after the end of treatment.</p><p>A total of 177 <italic>H pylori</italic>-infected patients were randomized to receive dexlansoprazole MR-based (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;90) or rabeprazole-based (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;87) triple therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated no differences between eradication rates of the 2 study groups (83.3% vs 81.6%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.736). Per-protocol analysis yielded comparable results (85.1% vs 81.2%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.497). Both groups exhibited similar frequencies of adverse events (7.8% vs 4.6%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.536) and drug compliance (98.9% vs 97.7%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.496).

Both ITT and PP analyses demonstrated that the eradication rate of dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy was similar to that of rabeprazole-based triple therapy (83.3% vs 81.6% and 85.1% vs 81.2%, respectively). Additionally, both therapies had similar frequencies of adverse events and drug compliance. The data clearly indicate that single-dose dexlansoprazole MR is noninferior to double-dose rabeprazole-base triple therapy in the treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Currently, lansoprazole 30&#x0200a;mg twice daily is widely used in clinical practice. In this study, single-dose of dexlansoprazole MR 60&#x0200a;mg daily was applied for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication. In terms of cost-effective view, the pharmaceutical costs of 7-day dexlansoprazole MR- and rabeprazole-based triple therapies in Taiwan were $19.4 and $20.4, respectively. The former was cheaper than the latter. Dexlansoprazole MR-based therapies can therefore be recommended in the first-line treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection for Taiwanese and probably most people in the world.</p><p>In the current study, the frequencies of adverse events in the dexlansoprazole-MR and rabeprazole group were 7.8% and 4.6%, respectively. The 2 therapeutic groups had comparable frequency of adverse events. Additionally, they shared similar drug compliance (97.8% vs 97.7%). In the dexlansoprazole MR group, 1 patient discontinued eradication therapy due to skin rash. On the other hand, a patient in the rabeprazole group stopped anti-<italic>H pylori</italic> therapy owing to severe dizziness.</p><p>The main reasons for eradication failure for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, <italic>CYP2C19</italic> genotypes, and smoking.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In the current study, the eradication rate in the patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains was lower than that in those with clarithromycin-susceptible strains (66.7 vs 93.1%). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the presence of clarithromycin was an independent factor predictive of treatment failure (odds ratio: 6.75). Our findings were consistent with several previous studies that demonstrated clarithromcyin as a key factor influencing eradication outcome of standard triple therapy.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The prevalence of <italic>H pylori</italic> strains harboring amoxicillin resistance in Taiwan ranged from 0% to 2.3% in previous reports.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the current trial, the rate of resistant strains to amoxicillin 0%. Since none of the <italic>H pylori</italic> strains were resistant to amoxicillin, assessing the impact of amoxicillin resistance on eradication outcome of standard triple therapy was precluded. It merits further studies to investigate whether amoxicillin resistance is another independent factor predicting treatment failure of the therapy.</p><p>This study was an open-label, noninferior, randomized controlled trial. We recruited 197 patients for the study assuming 8% of eradication difference and 10% loss of follow-up. The statistic power and type 1 error of this analysis were 90% and 5%, respectively. The strengths of this study included providing the data regarding antibiotic resistance. Additionally, this study investigated the impacts of antibiotic resistances on eradication rate of standard triple therapy. However, the study has several limitations. First, the current study was conducted only in a single country. The results should therefore be confirmed in other countries with different patterns of antibiotic resistances. Second, antibiotic susceptibility data were only available in some of the patients because most of the patients were referred from other gastroenterologists and culture was not performed at initial endoscopy. Additionally, the genetic factors of hosts such as <italic>CYP2C19</italic> genotypes determining eradication were not examined in this study. Nonetheless, this study is the pilot study to investigate the eradication rate of dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy. In addition, the study confirms that dexlansoprazole MR- and conventional PPI-based triple therapies have comparable eradication rates for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy can achieve a similar eradication rate as rabeprazole-based therapy. Since the cost of the single-dose dexlansoprazole MR (60&#x0200a;mg) regimen is lower than that of the double-dose rabeprazole (20&#x0200a;mg) regimen, single-dose dexlansoprazole-based triple therapy can reasonably be recommended for the first-line eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are indebted to study nurses L.Y.
