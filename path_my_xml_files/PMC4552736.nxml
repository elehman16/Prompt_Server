Between-group comparisons of continuous variables were performed by independent Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. Repeated measured variables such as IOP, MBP, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, and PIP were analyzed using a linear mixed model with the patient indicator as a random effect and group, time, and group-by-time as fixed effects.

Multiple factors affect the increase in IOP during pneumoperitoneum in the ST position: EtCO<sub>2</sub>, CVP, MBP, PIP, transperitoneal absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, and duration of surgery.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, in the present study, based on the univariate linear regression during T3 and T4, BMI, PIP, total CO<sub>2</sub> amount, and IAP were significant predictors of IOP changes over the T3&#x02013;T4 period. All these significant predictors were positively correlated (positive slope coefficients) with IOP and were included in multivariate models for the T3&#x02013;T4 period. Multivariate analysis revealed that the only significant predictor of IOP was IAP (slope coefficient, 0.5178; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). A possible explanation may be that a low IAP led to a decrease in the peritoneal CO<sub>2</sub> absorption and PIP, which may have attenuated the IOP increase.</p><p>All RALRP procedures were performed by a single surgeon with ample experience. Before this study, he had performed RALRP on 20 mmHg of pneumoperitoneum pressure during trocar insertion, and after the ST position, the pressure was decreased to 15 mmHg. However, IAP would be adjusted up to 20 mmHg in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or inadequate surgical conditions. Even though a new trial was required for this study, there were no significant differences between the first 34 and the last 34 procedures.</p><p>In regards to depth of NMB, the monitoring of adductor pollicis (AP) muscle has been applied as a validated method.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, in the present study, the patients&#x02019; arm lay alongside the torso, and was covered by a surgical drape to prevent interference with the robotic arms. As an alternative method, the CS muscle offers a better reflection of the larynx and diaphragm.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Therefore, we measured the depth of NMB at the CS muscle instead of the AP muscle. This could be a limitation of our study. When measuring the depth of NMB at the CS muscle using acceleromyography, concomitant signals from the orbicularis oculi are inevitable, resulting in a mixed signal.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In addition, higher current is thought to be required to provoke maximal facial muscle contractions,[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which could exacerbate the problem of direct muscle stimulation. However, we believe that the effect of this was minimized as a constant degree of NMB was maintained in each group.</p><p>The Other limitations of our study are as follows. It has been demonstrated that a low-pressure pneumoperitoneum can lead to a reduction in postoperative pain compared with a standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In the current study however, there was no significant difference in postoperative pain between the two groups. This may be because IAP, even in Group M, was less than 12mmHg, which was defined as the standard pressure in previous studies.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Third, the scale used to evaluate the surgical conditions was more subjective compared with that used in previous studies.[<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135412.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] We rated the overall and worst surgical conditions at the end of the ST position, whereas previous studies rated the surgical conditions at a regular time interval throughout the surgery. More objective and concrete measures are thus required for more precise results. Finally, in case of poor surgical conditions, no rescue doses of muscle relaxants or increased doses of general anesthetics was administered. Instead, IAP was increased from 8 mmHg to 10 mmHg to 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg to 20 mmHg (maximum) to improve the surgical conditions in both groups, whenever the surgeon felt uncomfortable or needed an adjustment during surgery. Although we assessed the depth of NMB every 15 min in both groups, there could have been occasions of inadequate NMB depth. Also, because a constant level of anesthesia was maintained, the effect of anesthesia depth on the surgical conditions was not evaluated.</p><p>Actually, With the exception of the surgeon&#x02019;s satisfaction in this study, it is difficult to conclude that deep NMB is superior from an anaesthesiology point of view. However, considering the adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum and IOP increases in elderly patients undergoing RALRP, we believe that surgical conditions under low-pressure, facilitated by deep NMB may have clinical significance from both the anaesthetic and surgical perspective.</p><p>In conclusion, continuous deep NMB may lead to the improvement of surgical conditions and facilitate RALRP at low IAP levels, which may contribute to the significant attenuation of the IOP increase during pneumoperitoneum in the ST position. Further clinical studies are required for other types of surgeries to further clarify the effectiveness of deep NMB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135412.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135412.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135412.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Sample case report form.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135412.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135412.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Sample informed consent form.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135412.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135412.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical research protocols (English version).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135412.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135412.s005"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical research protocols (original language version).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135412.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the biostatisticians of the Department of Research Affairs for their statistical comments and analysis as well as Dong-Su Jang, MFA, medical illustrator, Medical Research Support Section, Yonsei University College of Medicine, for his help with figures.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135412.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
