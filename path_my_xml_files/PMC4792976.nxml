sling exercise training for stabilization influences the cervical spine angles and
cervical range of motion of straight neck patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty straight
neck patients were selected as subjects and they were randomly divided into two groups,
the stretching and sling stabilization exercise groups which 60 minutes of exercise three
times a week for 6weeks. All the subjects in each of the two respective study groups
received an X-ray and had their cervical range of motion measured, both before and after
the exercise. [Results] When differences in the cervical spine angle between the pre- and
the post-test were checked, it was found that only the stretching exercise group showed
statistically significant decreases in the craniovertebral angle and the cranial rotation
angle. When differences in the range of motion between pre- and post-test were checked,
the sling stabilization exercise group showed a significant change in flexion, right
rotation, left lateral bending, right lateral bending, and the stretching exercise group
showed a significant change in left rotation, left lateral bending, and right lateral
bending. [Conclusion] These results indicate that both types of exercises are effective at
improving the cervical range of motion of straight neck patients, and that the stretching
exercise was more effective than the sling stabilization exercise at improving cervical
spine angles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Straight neck</kwd><kwd>Sling exercise</kwd><kwd>Stretching exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Owing to the development of modern technology, the use of smartphones has been increasing
rapidly. According to the Pew Research Center<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, smartphone users represent 56% of the entire US population, and the
average amount of time spent on a smartphone per day is 5.1 hours. This increases up to 5.6
hours per day on weekends. It was reported that the average time spent on a smartphone per
day has increased rapidly as the smartphone penetration rate has soared. However, poor
posture while using a smartphone for continuous periods causes musculoskeletal problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Forward neck posture (forward head posture), a postural distortion, is regarded as a
typical musculoskeletal disorder, and it is commonly seen in patients with cervical
diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the horizontal distance
between the ear&#x02019;s tragus and the posterior angle of the acromion is more than 5&#x02005;cm while a
person is standing, the occiput and upper cervical spine lean forward excessively and the
lower cervical spine and the upper vertebrae lean backward excessively. All these symptoms
correspond to the features of forward head posture (forward neck posture)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. When abnormal alignment of the vertebrae is
continuously maintained due to inappropriate posture, that is, forward head posture, the
vertebrae and surrounding soft tissues might be easily exposed to a sudden impact or chronic
stress, and this could lead to possible changes in the blood vessels, spinal disease, organ
dysfunction, degenerative diseases, and autonomic dysfunctions, such as headaches and
chronic fatigue<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sling stabilization exercise can be used as a therapy for straight neck treatment and
Kim and Kim<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> have noted that stretching
and sling exercises are effective at ameliorating cervical spine instability. The curative
power of a sling stabilization exercise is found in its ability to enhance mobility, improve
sensorimotor function, and increase relaxation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sling stabilization exercise is a type of treatment in which
patients with neck pain can use their own body weight to resist gravity; thus, this type of
exercise can be performed very safely. As the sling stabilization exercise enables patients
to perform unloading exercise in a gravity-reduced environment, it has a similar effect to
what would be expected from an aquatic exercise. A study was concluded to determine the
effect of the co-contraction of the masticatory muscles during neck stabilization exercises
on changes in the thickness of the neck flexors. That study concluded that co-contraction of
the masticatory muscles during neck stabilization exercise is helpful, increasing the
thickness of the longus colli muscle<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number of different types of stretching exercises can be used to treat patients with
chronic neck pain, including dynamic stretching, which a patient can practice alone for
prophylaxis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation, where the release and contraction of a muscle are repeatedly
practiced, and Evjenth-Hamberg stretching, where isometric contraction and static stretching
are applied to agonist and antagonist muscles using the hold-relax technique and the
contract-relax technique<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the effects of stretching
exercises on forward head posture. In that study, the subjects were divided into three
groups, a balance exercise group, a stretching exercise group, and a control group, and the
respective groups performed the assigned exercises for four weeks. That study found that
maximum muscle contraction was increased in the balance exercise group and the stretching
exercise group. It also found that the forward head posture improved in those two groups. In
addition, Park<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
symptoms of forward head posture improved after applying static stretching and
Evjenth-Hamberg stretching.</p><p>Most of the existing studies have mainly focused on comparing stretching with other types
of exercises and they have concentrated only on demonstrating that stretching is effective
for the treatment of forward head posture. However, very few studies have investigated the
effect of training patients to use stretching and sling stabilization exercises in order to
treat straight neck symptoms. Only a few studies have focused on how to treat straight neck
symptoms and correct spinal alignment. Hence, this present study was conducted to compare
the pre- and post-test results of the craniovertebral angle (CVA), the cranial rotation
angle (CRA), and cervical range of motion (ROM), aiming to demonstrate whether or not
training by stretching and sling stabilization exercises has any remedial value.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>From among people in their 20s who were suffering from straight neck syndrome, 20 patients,
diagnosed with straight neck, were recruited as the study&#x02019;s subjects. The subjects were
divided into two groups: one sling stabilization exercise group, and one stretching exercise
group. All the subjects voluntarily participated in the experiment and were thoroughly
briefed on the purpose of the study and the tasks to be performed. The experiment began only
after the subjects fully understood the study&#x02019;s intention and had consented to
participation. Exclusion criteria included: heart disease, a mental health condition,
dementia, sensory disturbance, spinal tumor, spondylolisthesis, pelvic osteoporosis, spinal
osteoporosis, lumbar herniated intervertebral disc, or any other disease that might have
influenced the spine or musculoskeletal system during experiment.</p><p>For ROM, the angle of flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending were measured
within the active range of motion, using a standard goniometer (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When the ROM was measured, the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) was used as an index of reliability. As the ICC (2, k) was 0.934, the
reliability of the measurements was considered to be high. The measurements were taken
twice, and the mean value of the two measurements was used for the analysis. The
measurements were taken before the experiment began and then again after the 6-week
intervention had ended.</p><p>For the CVA and CRA measurements, the subjects were positioned so as to retain their
natural head posture while standing at ease with both of their arms relaxed and placed
alongside their torso. To measure the cervical angle, the 7th cervical (C7) vertebra, ear
tragus, and the lateral canthus of each subject were linked by straight lines on the X-ray,
and then the CVA and CRA were measured. If the X-ray showed a small CVA and a large CRA, the
subject was noted as having greater forward head posture.</p><p>For the sling stabilization exercise, the cervical flexion-extension exercise and cervical
lateral bending exercise were performed with the aid of sling stabilization exercise
equipment. To perform the cervical flexion-extension exercise, the subjects were instructed
to maintain the head in a neutral position while in a supine position and to slowly extend
the neck, using the strap of the sling. The cervical flexion exercise was performed with the
subjects in the prone position. In this position, the strap of sling was adjusted so that it
would be perpendicular to the surface of the ground in order to prevent the chin and
shoulders from being lifted during the exercise. The subjects performed three sets of
exercise, and the exercise was repeated 15 times within each of the sets. Between each set,
the subjects rested for 30 seconds. To perform the cervical lateral bending exercise, the
subjects slowly performed right and left lateral bending of the head while releasing their
neck. They were instructed not to lift their shoulders. The subjects performed three sets of
exercise, and the exercise was repeated 15 times within each of the sets. Between each set,
the subjects rested for 30 seconds. To perform the stretching exercise, this study adopted a
method in which active contractions and passive relaxations of the agonist muscles were
repeated, and active contraction of antagonist muscles was added, finally. Modifying the
stretching exercise used by Park<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles were stretched in this study. This
stretching exercise was performed for six weeks, and it was practiced three times each week.
To stretch the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the subjects were instructed to lie in the supine
position, to let their head and neck hang over the end of a hospital bed, and to place their
shoulders at the edge of a bed. The therapist was told to stand at the head of the hospital
bed after fixing the subject&#x02019;s shoulder and chest to the table using a belt. The head and
neck posture were arranged so that the subjects would easily feel the tension created by the
muscle contraction. When the therapist held the subject&#x02019;s head, both of the subject&#x02019;s ears
were covered by both of the therapist&#x02019;s palms, and the subject&#x02019;s sternocleidomastoid muscles
were held by the therapist&#x02019;s fingers. While holding this posture, the therapist fully
rotated the subject&#x02019;s head to the right and pulled the head, making it perform left lateral
bending. The subject was then instructed to say &#x02018;stop&#x02019; at the point just prior to pain being
triggered. When that occurred, the early stage of stretching began. At this stage, the
subject was directed to apply force. The subject pressed the therapist&#x02019;s right hand in order
to signal that the therapist should apply a similar amount of force in the opposite
direction. Using these balanced forces, the therapist guided the subject in performing
isometric contractions. The subject performed the isometric contraction for six seconds,
counting from one to six, and gradually increased the intensity of the contraction, in order
to prevent the Valsalva maneuver from occurring. While the subject relaxed for two to three
seconds after the contraction, the therapist moved the subject&#x02019;s head in the direction in
which greater stretching was possible. The therapist had to move the subject&#x02019;s head beyond
the point which the muscle did not allow further movement, and held the stretch for 15&#x02013;16
seconds. Finally, the therapist asked the subject to look to the right side and to move the
head in the direction where the subject could extend the head further. By resisting this
type of movement, the therapist strengthened the subject&#x02019;s antagonist muscles. This movement
was continued for six seconds and the subject was allowed to rest for 10 seconds. These
movements were repeated four times, and a total of 160 seconds were assigned to the
stretching exercises. For the upper trapezius, the subject was instructed to hang his head
and neck over the end of a hospital bed in the supine position and the therapist used a belt
to fix the subject&#x02019;s shoulder and chest to the bed. The therapist was required to stand at
the head of the bed, to hold the back of subject&#x02019;s head in his right hand, and to hold up
the subject&#x02019;s head using his wrist and arm. The subject&#x02019;s jaw was held by the therapist&#x02019;s
left hand and the therapist pulled up the subject&#x02019;s head. In this condition, the therapist
arranged the subject&#x02019;s cervical vertebrae to first slowly rotate fully to the right and then
to engage in left lateral bending. This time, the therapist&#x02019;s body moved along with the
subject&#x02019;s head. Afterwards, isometric contraction was implemented and maintained for six
seconds. In order to strengthen the antagonist muscle, the therapist kept his hands in the
same place and pulled the subject&#x02019;s jaw to the right. The therapist then asked the subject
to look towards the direction in which the head was to be extended to and move the head
further in that direction. By resisting these movements, the therapist strengthened the
subject&#x02019;s antagonist muscles. The time assigned for the isometric contraction, the method
used to relax the muscle, and the entire time assigned for the stretching exercise were
identical to the conditions used for the sternocleidomastoid stretches.</p><p>The measurements were analyzed using the statistical analysis program, SPSS 18.0. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test was used to verify the normality of the data. In order to
analyze the way in which the straight neck symptoms varied depending on the type of
treatment, the independent t-test was used. The paired t-test was used to investigate
variations in the pre- and post-test measusres of straight neck and spinal posture,
depending on the type of treatment. A statistical significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05 was used.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Namseoul University (Cheonan,
Korea, NSU-140609-2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study investigated whether sling stabilization and stretching exercises could cause

present study found that only the stretching exercise group displayed a significant
difference in terms of CVA and CRA changes when the pre- and post-test results were
compared. In the stretching exercise group, CVA decreased from 71.33&#x000b1;6.28 to 65.33&#x000b1;5.22
degrees and CRA decreased from 150.66&#x000b1;11.21 to 142.70&#x000b1;10.53 degrees.</p><p>Yang et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study of
subjects with forward head posture, who performed neck flexion and extension exercises,
stretching exercises, and neck stabilization exercises using sling exercise equipment. That
study compared the pre- and post-test results of threshold measuring pressure pain, CVA, and
CRA. No significant difference was found in threshold pressure pain, while significant
differences were found in the CVA and CRA values of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA).
In another study, 25 subjects were divided into two groups, a sling stabilization exercise
group and a control group, and they were instructed to conduct the assigned exercise for
four weeks. CVA, CRA, muscle activity, and cervical alignments were measured after the
completion of the exercise. When the pre- and post-test results of CVA and CRA were
compared, the sling stabilization exercise group displayed significant differences were both
CVA and CRA, while a significant difference was found in the CVA value of the control group,
which only performed the stretching exercise<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As shown in this study, the stretching exercise returned the shortened muscle to normality,
and the abnormal cervical range of motion caused by the shortened muscle also returned to
normality. Thus, the stretching exercise was found to be effective at normalizing abnormal
forward head posture. The sling stabilization exercise was also found to have exerted a
positive influence. In the sling stabilization exercise group, the subjects were able to
exercise with no influence of gravity, within their own cervical ROM, under the therapist&#x02019;s
control, using the sling equipment. The weakened muscle was mobilized and the imbalanced
muscles were balanced again. Thus, the normalization of abnormal forward head posture is
possible using the sling stabilization exercise. However, a statistically significant result
was not found for this group. This can be attributed to the fact that the subjects&#x02019; living
habits could not be thoroughly controlled and the therapist&#x02019;s contribution to the sling
stabilization exercise group was less than the interference in the stretching exercise
group. Therefore, the patient&#x02019;s weakened muscle could not be fully used, which could
resulted in the lack of a significant difference in the findings.</p><p>In terms of ROM changes, the measurement of cervical ROM, is regarded as the standard test
by which a patient with a disorder such as straight neck syndrome is assessed, because it
enables investigators to focus on the factors of pain and functional movement. ROM is also
frequently used as a yardstick to judge whether actual remedial value has occurred. In many
studies, ROM has been proven to have a significant correlation with cervical disorders<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chun et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the older patients who had performed
stretching exercises were found to have increased their cervical range of motion. The neck
pain group that had been treated by both the ROM technique (joint mobilization) and the
physical therapy technique, displayed better results, thereby demonstrating that flexion,
extension, left lateral bending, right lateral bending, left rotation, and right rotation
were all improved in comparison to the other neck pain group, which had only been treated
using the physical therapy technique<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
study, in which the head-neck flexion exercise was performed using sling equipment, reported
that the ROM for flexion and extension was significantly improved<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study the sling stabilization exercise group showed a significant difference
in the flexion, right rotation, left lateral bending, and right lateral bending results, and
the stretching exercise group showed a significant difference in the left rotation, left
lateral bending, and right lateral bending results. It seems that the muscular asymmetry,
caused by the straight neck symptom, was returned to the symmetric state by the sling
stabilization exercise. Hence, the normal alignment of the cervical spine was realized by
the exercise conducted by the sling stabilization exercise group and this led to the
improvement in ROM. Moreover, the stretching exercise used in the stretching exercise group
contributed to the normalization of muscle length by extending the shortened muscle, and
this normalization of muscle length led to the improvement in ROM.</p><p>The results of this study coincide with the findings presented in many previous studies;
thus, it is possible to infer that the stretching exercise and the sling stabilization
exercise exert a positive influence on ROM. The reason why not all of the ROM variables in
this present study showed improvements that were as significant as the improvements found in
other studies, is attributed to the fact that the exercise methods used in this present
study were different from those used in other studies; moreover, in this present study, the
individual subjects&#x02019; daily living habits could not be thoroughly controlled.</p><p>This study found that the sling stabilization exercise group showed significant improvement
in the ROM, while the stretching exercise group showed a significant improvement in cervical
alignment and ROM. All parts of the human body are intimately connected to one another, and
imbalance causes abnormal body phenomena to appear when a problem breaks out even in a
single part of human body. Because muscles in the human body control musculoskeletal
posture, they play a fundamental role in movement. Thus, the work load on human muscles is
always heavy. Due to this peculiar nature of muscles, they are vulnerable to irregular
posture, unsafe movements, over-use, and unusual usage. Therefore, structural damage and
functional disorders are apt to occur frequently in the muscles of the human body<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study revealed that pains around the
neck might develop into a more serious disease because of the psychological stress they
cause<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In relation to cervical spine alignment and ROM, this study&#x02019;s findings suggest that future
studies should try to identify the way in which different types of therapies could be used
to treat straight neck patients, in addition to current treatment approaches. Future studies
should also examine how psychological treatment could be given along with various types of
existing treatment, to help ensure better patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this paper was provided by Namseoul University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Smith A: Smartphone ownership &#x02212;
