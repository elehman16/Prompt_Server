Patients were screened for eligibility during a 14-day screening period. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) to receive PR-fampridine 10 mg tablets or matching placebo twice daily every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Scheduled visits took place at screening, day 1 and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. A post-dosing follow-up visit was conducted two weeks after the end of treatment. Randomisation was determined by a centralised system on day 1 of the trial and treatment assignments were made through an Interactive Web Response System. All patients and trial staff, including the principal investigator, were blinded to patient treatment assignments. Blinding was achieved by using a matched placebo.

Because this was an exploratory study, there were no pre-specified primary/secondary endpoints and no formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. Walking ability was assessed using the MSWS-12<sup>9</sup> and the seven-item Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The MSWS-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate limitations of their mobility owing to MS during the preceding two weeks on a five-point scale (from 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely). Total score ranges from 1&#x02013;60 and was transformed to a scale of 0&#x02013;100; reduced score indicates improvement in walking. The PGIC is a global assessment of the patient&#x02019;s impression of how the study drug affected their overall walking during the preceding seven days. The PGIC was assessed at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, and scored on a seven-point scale (from 1 = very much worse to 7 = very much improved).</p><p>Mobility and dynamic balance were assessed using the TUG test,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which measures the time/speed it takes for a patient to stand up from a seated position, walk three metres out, turn around and walk back and return to the seated position. Increased speed on the TUG indicates improvement in mobility and dynamic balance. Static and dynamic balance were measured using the BBS,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> which is comprised of 14 balance-related tasks scored from 0 (unable to perform) to 4 (able to perform independently). The BBS is the sum of scores across these tasks and ranges from 0 (poor balance) to 56 (good balance). Positive change on the BBS indicates improvement in balance. The TUG and BBS, which have demonstrated high reliability in patients with MS,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> were chosen to further assess the impact of PR-fampridine treatment on mobility, specifically on static and dynamic balance. Balance has not been previously evaluated with PR-fampridine treatment in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial but may impact patients&#x02019; walking ability and mobility.</p><p>The impact of MS on the patient and quality of life (QoL) were assessed using the 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) physical subscale (PHYS)<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions 5-level (EQ-5D-5L).<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The self-administered MSIS-29 questionnaire contains a 20-item PHYS and a nine-item psychological subscale. For a particular visit, the MSIS-29 PHYS score was calculated by summing the 20 items and transforming the score to a scale with a range of 0 (no impact of MS) to 100 (extreme impact of MS). Negative change on the MSIS-29 PHYS indicates improvement in physical health. The EQ-5D-5L is a generic instrument comprised of five questions and a visual analogue scale (VAS). A utility score is derived from the five questions addressing mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, with responses/scores ranging from 1 (no problem) to 5 (severe problem). The VAS score ranges from 0 (worst imagined health state) to 100 (best imagined health state). The EQ-5D was assessed at day 1 and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, and a positive change in both the utility and VAS scores indicates an improvement in health state.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) and concomitant medications and by performing physical examination, vital sign measurements and 12-lead electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1352458515581436"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A sample size of 120 patients (60 patients per group) was chosen based on bootstrapping that sampled data from a previous study<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> to create 1000 datasets of 60 patients each, and repeated for sample sizes of 70 and 80 patients. For each sample, the proportion of patients with a six-point change or more in MSWS-12<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> score was calculated, and the percentage of samples that fell within an interval of the actual percentage in the study was calculated to explore whether increasing the sample size increased the precision. Using the sample size of 60 patients for both treatment groups, 84% of samples were within 8% of the true proportion and increasing the size did not appreciably increase precision.</p><p>The intent-to-treat population consisted of all patients who were randomised, received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one post-baseline assessment for a given parameter. Efficacy analyses were based on an intent-to-treat analysis with missing data imputed by the last observation carried forward method when at least one post-baseline value was available. Baseline values were not carried forward and were defined as the mean over the screening and baseline visits. Mean changes in each efficacy endpoint, except for the PGIC, were calculated over 24 weeks using the last observation carried forward values to calculate the average. Because the PGIC was designed to assess change since the previous visit, week 2 was the only time point that was valid for between-group comparisons of treatment effect.</p><p>This was an exploratory study, and descriptive statistics were used to summarise endpoints. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. Based on the distribution of changes from baseline across patients, all by-visit analyses were summarised using median change from baseline on the outcome. Median changes were presented with corresponding non-parametric 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>Mean changes from baseline on the MSWS-12 were categorised using the following thresholds: a less than one-point improvement/no change/worsening and then increasing thresholds of improvement from &#x02a7e;1 point to &#x02a7e;10 points in one-point increments. These categories were summarised as the number/percentage of patients meeting each threshold. Mean percentage changes from baseline in TUG speed were categorised using the following thresholds: &#x02a7d;0% (worsening/no change), &#x0003e;0% (any improvement) and then increasing thresholds of improvement from &#x02a7e;10% to &#x02a7e;40% in 5% increments. These categories were summarised as the number/percentage of patients meeting each threshold.</p><p>In order to characterise magnitude of the observed treatment effect relative to variance in the outcome measures, <italic>post hoc</italic> statistical testing compared multiple thresholds of improvement between treatment groups for MSWS-12 and TUG using a logistic regression adjusted for baseline. Multiple MSWS-12 thresholds of change were examined based on ranges previously identified as clinically meaningful (&#x02a7e;4&#x02013;6 points based on a 100-point scale) over three months.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis using the chi-square test compared the percentage of patients in each treatment group who reported any improvement in PGIC after two weeks of treatment. To assess magnitude of treatment effect over time, changes from baseline to each visit also were summarised for each efficacy endpoint, except for PGIC.</p><p>For missing data in MSWS-12, a visit in which &#x02a7e;50% of the component questions were answered but at least one question was missing, scores from unanswered questions were imputed using the respondent-specific mean score. MSWS-12 score was considered missing for a visit in which &#x02a7e;50% of the questions were unanswered. For the TUG test, two trials of the TUG were conducted at each visit and speed for any particular visit was calculated as the average for trials 1 and 2. If either trial was missing, then speed from the completed trial was used. For the BBS, if at least two questions were missing at a visit, the score was set to missing. If two or fewer questions were missing, these were imputed using the respondent-specific mean score. For MSIS-29 PHYS, if a patient had missing data for &#x0003c;10 of the 20 items, the mean of the non-missing items was used to impute the missing items. If &#x02a7e;10 items were missing, then the PHYS score was set to missing. For EQ-5D-5L, no imputation was used for missing values for the five summary scores or for VAS. A summary utility index value was calculated for patients with non-missing data for each of the five questions at a visit. The crosswalk method<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> was used to map EQ-5D-5L to the EQ-5D 3-level United Kingdom value set, because value sets for EQ-5D-5L are still under development. Utility index value ranges from &#x02212;0.594 (worst health state) to 1.000 (best health state).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section13-1352458515581436"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 132 patients were randomised at 24 sites in Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

In addition to greater median improvements in TUG speed and MSWS-12 score, a higher cumulative proportion of patients receiving PR-fampridine versus placebo met each threshold of improvement in TUG speed (&#x0003e;0% and &#x02a7e;10% to &#x02a7e;40%) and MSWS-12 score (&#x02a7e;1 to &#x02a7e;10 points), including thresholds in a range (&#x02a7e;4 to &#x02a7e;6 points) previously identified as clinically meaningful for MSWS-12 with different data sources.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The MOBILE study was the first randomised, placebo-controlled study that assessed the effect of PR-fampridine on dynamic and static balance.

The discrepancy observed in this trial between the MSIS-29 and EQ-5D-5L may be related to the insensitivity of generic measures to assess MS-related changes in QoL. The MSIS-29 PHYS results in this trial supported those observed in the ENABLE study, in which PR-fampridine therapy demonstrated significant/clinically meaningful improvements on QoL/health state, measured by a broad range of MS-specific and generic patient-reported endpoints, over 48 weeks in &#x0003e;600 patients who received PR-fampridine.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Safety findings from MOBILE were consistent with the known safety profile of PR-fampridine,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with the exception that incidence of UTIs was higher in placebo-treated patients compared with patients receiving PR-fampridine.

In the current study, UTIs were confirmed by culture. In contrast, the pivotal trials did not require confirmation of UTIs, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the rate of UTIs. No seizures were observed in MOBILE and although more patients receiving PR-fampridine reported balance disorders, gait disturbance and dizziness versus placebo, the incidence of falls was higher in the placebo group. Balance disorders, gait disturbance and dizziness are broad, non-specific AEs, and increases in these events may not result in an increase in falls, as was the case in the MOBILE study. Furthermore, the improvement in TUG and BBS could have manifested in fewer falls among the patients treated with PR-fampridine.</p><p>The findings of MOBILE confirm and expand findings of previous controlled studies with a longer treatment period, geographically different study population and broader range of objective and patient-reported measures of mobility and balance to assess different domains of walking.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> MOBILE was exploratory in design and its findings require confirmation in a prospective trial that is underway.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1352458515581436" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the results of MOBILE support that PR-fampridine therapy provides significant and sustained improvements in walking characteristics beyond walking speed; in particular, PR-fampridine therapy resulted in early and sustained benefits on measures of dynamic and static balance and mobility as well as patient-reported walking disability. Overall, these findings provided additional support for the potential of PR-fampridine to result in clinically meaningful improvements in walking quality/ambulatory function in patients with MS with walking disability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Figure_1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e986" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Materials_Appendix__1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e994" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Biogen, who provided funding for editorial support in the development of this manuscript; Maria Hovenden from Excel Scientific Solutions wrote the first draft of the manuscript based on input from other authors, and Kristen DeYoung from Excel Scientific Solutions copy-edited and styled the manuscript per journal requirements.
