Time spent engaging in sedentary activities also increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and is associated with obesity, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely, regular involvement in moderate to vigorous bouts of physically active is documented as beneficial to cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Accordingly, the weakening of the cardiovascular system associated with aging could be countered by increasing levels of physical activity and functional fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Aerobic-based training has been proposed as an effective mechanism for improving cardiovascular protection, with training resulting in reductions of 2% on total cholesterol (TC), 2% on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and 9% on triglycerides (TG), and increases of 3% on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in men 18 years of age and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Research has also found positive training related adaptations on TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], or only on LDL-C and TC/HDL-C, without changes on TC, HDL-C and TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the variety of characteristics (frequency, intensity, time, and type) of exercise used in previous studies may partly explain inconsistent findings of different modes of aerobic exercise causing unchanged TC, HDL-C or LDL-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Inconsistent results also exist in strength-based training programs with some failing to achieve changes in blood lipid profile in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or in adult men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], while others have reported benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Additionally, some studies focusing on the effects of the gender in the lipid profile have found significant differences, with women having higher HDL-C, decreased LDL-C, and decreased TG comparing with men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. High-sensitivy C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is known to be a sensitive marker of inflammation and has also been related to increased risk of vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Accordingly, factors that may interfere with hs-CRP levels, such as physical activity, require further investigation in populations that are at increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Considering the observed deterioration of the cardiovascular system and the metabolic profile that tends to accompany aging, it is important to know the potential benefits derived from the exercise. Although the effects of aerobic versus resistance training on cardiovascular risk factors have been compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], there is a need to further investigate the effects of the aerobic-based exercise versus strength-based exercise on body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), lipids, blood pressure, hs-CRP, and walking distance in older women and men. Accordingly, in the current study we hypothesized that moderate intensity, progressive aerobic-based and strength-based training would improve metabolic health of older women and men.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline evaluation (before treatment), no significant differences were observed between the exercising and control groups for any of the studied variables.

Moreover, cardiorespiratory fitness also improves as result of the increase on the 6-minute walk distance. Dietary composition is a potentially confounding factor and is known to influence lipoprotein concentrations. To minimize any confounding effects associated with variation in diet, all participants were fed a similar diet during the 16 weeks of the investigation. Both programs were successfully in that they both resulted in 13% gains on 6-min walk distance. This observation suggests that aerobic and strength based exercise programs may result in improved cardiovascular functionality in older participants, potentially countering the documented age-related decline in peak oxygen uptake.</p><p>Following studies examining the effects of endurance and strength training on cardiovascular health have generally found either positive changes in lipid profile or no changes at all. More favorable changes in response to training occur usually in those with more pronounced dyslipidemia at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and have been pointed as dependent on loss of body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our baseline values were normal for TG and HDL-C, optimal for LDL-C, and desirable (control group) and borderline high (exercising group) for TC, according to the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Also, in the current study, at baseline in the total participant group, BMI, WC and BW correlated positively with TC, TG and hs-CRP. Moreover, WC and BW correlated with TC/HDL-C.</p><p>Our finding that TC, LDL-C, TG, and TC/HDL-C diminish with exercise is consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], even those programs that have not attained resulted in gains after strength training in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in adult men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To explain why some programs have not resulted in gains, some researchers have pointed a dose-response relationship between serum lipid levels (TC, TG, HDL-C, and TC/HDL-C) and levels of physical activity (intensity and duration) in adult women and men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Accordingly, Cox and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] have demonstrated lower TC and LDL-C after 6 months of higher-, but not lower-, intensity exercise in middle and older sedentary women. However, Sillanpaa and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] failed to attain changes on TC, TG and LDL-C after 21-week of high-intensity endurance and heavy resistance strength training in healthy 40-65-year-old men. Independent of the mechanism underlying lipid changes, a reduction of 1% on TC has been shown to reduce the risk for coronary artery disease by 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which implies that our exercising participants have reduced about 12% their risk. Moreover, a 1% reduction in LDL-C reduces the risk of major coronary events by approximately 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which means that we have about a 26% gain.</p><p>Our finding that HDL-C increases with exercise is consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, not all studies have found gains in HDL-C following aerobic-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or strength-based programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This absence of gains have been justified with the higher initial levels of HDL-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], with the lower exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], with the good initial body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and with the lack of control of the time of blood sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Seasonal fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and changes in dietary fat intake or leisure time physical activity may also influence the changes in the lipid profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our baseline HDL-C values were within normal range, and both exercising programs seem to have had enough intensity to promote gains on HDL-C, accompanied by reduction on BW, BMI, and WC. Also, a gap of at least 48 hours occurs between the last training session and the sampling. As a decrease of 1% on HDL-C has been associated with a 2-3% increase in the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and assuming that the reverse is true, the 5% increase observed in our both programs should decrease CHD by 10-15%.</p><p>Recent data have shown decreases on resting blood pressure after prolonged endurance training of 1.9/1.6 (SBP/DBP) mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and after strength training of about 3 mmHg in both SBP and DBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This positive effects caused by the physical training have been more pronounced among hypertensive participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Participants in this study had normal DBP (&#x0003c;80 mm Hg) and high SBP (140-159 mm Hg) at baseline. Interestingly, after the training only DBP have reduced 3 mm Hg that may have clinical and biological relevance in the risk of heart disease.</p><p>In this study, aerobic and strength-based training have reduced 26% inflammation as measured by hs-CRP concentrations. Previous findings on the effect of strength and endurance training on hs-CRP levels have been inconsistent, with some studies showing benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and others showing no effect at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying an exercise training-induced reduction in serum hs-CRP concentrations remain unknown. However, the lack of effects of exercise on hs-CRP has been explained by the few concomitant metabolic risk factors of the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and by a lack of changes in anthropometric variables (e.g., body weight, waist circumference) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In fact, our participants at baseline have been sedentary, obese - particularly the exercising group (mean (SD) BMI 30.6 (5.0) kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and hypertensive (mean (SD) SBP 148 (20) mmHg). Moreover, the changes on BMI, WC and BW could help to justify the changes on hs-CRP. Additionally, the gains on muscular function as result of the increases on 6-minute walk distance would also influence the hs-CRP.</p><p>In conclusion, the training programs used in this study produced significant benefits on 6-minute walk distance, DBP, BW, WC, BMI, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and hs-CRP. Accordingly, the results of the current study suggest that moderate intensity aerobic-based and strength-based programs, with 16 weeks of duration, are enough to positively influence the metabolic health indicators of sedentary older women and men.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty three sedentary individuals (65-95 years old) volunteered (mean (SD) age 76 (8) years) to participate in this study (38 women, 25 men).

TC was determined using a Trider-based (CHOD-PAP) colorimetric end-point assay (CH 3810, Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK). HDL-C was determined using a direct two-point kinetic assay kit (CH 2652, Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK). LDL-C determination was done using a direct two-point kinetic assay kit (CH 9702, Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK). TG were determined using a Trinder-based (GPO-PAP) colorimetric end point assay (TR 3823, Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK). All the methods were controlled and validated using external controls from INSA and RIQAS.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Statistical analysis</bold></title><p>Differences between groups (exercising and control), between genders (females and males), and between exercising subgroups (aerobic and strength-based) were analyzed using a univariate analysis of variance. Differences between evaluations (before and after) were analyzed with a univariate analysis of variance for repeated measures. F and p values from the Pillai test were calculated for within participant's comparisons. Bonferroni's tests were used for multiple comparisons. Values are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), and statistical significance was accepted at the p &#x0003c; 0.05 level.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RAM participated in the design of the study, participated in the exercise protocols, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
