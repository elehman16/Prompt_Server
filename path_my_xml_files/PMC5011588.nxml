technique on spatiotemporal variables of gait in individuals who had a stroke. [Subjects
and Methods] Twenty-four subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups: Mulligan&#x02019;s
mobilization with movement group (n=12) and &#x0201c;weight-bearing with placebo&#x0201d; mobilization
with movement group (n=12). The subjects in the mobilization with movement group performed
5 sets of 10 glides a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The mobilization with movement
technique comprised grade III movements that involved gliding and resting. The control
group subjects performed lunges in the same conditions as those of the experimental group.
Gait function was measured in terms of spatiotemporal parameters to determine the effect
of mobilization with movement. [Results] The mobilization with movement group showed
significant improvements in velocity, cadence, stride length, single-support time, and
step length of the affected side, and step length and stride length of the non-affected
side. Overall, the mobilization with movement group showed significantly greater
improvements than the control group in terms of velocity, cadence, and single-support time
of the affected side. [Conclusion] Mobilization with movement can be used to improve the
gait function of patients recovering from stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Mulligan&#x02019;s mobilization with movement</kwd><kwd>Gait function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Flaccidity appears during the early stage after stroke; however, as time passes, it is
accompanied by spasticity, which occurs in 90% of stroke patients. It limits voluntary
movements because of muscle stiffness. In particular, spasticity of the ankle plantar flexor
disrupts static and dynamic balance, as well as the normal gait pattern<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shortened calf
muscles in individuals with hemiparesis cause ankle joint stiffness, increase its
hypomobility and resistance to mobility, and decrease passive joint mobility, which
ultimately causes limitation of the ankle joint<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal muscle tension and movement
limitation due to muscle weakness of the ankle joint cause limitation of functional
activities such as changing from a sitting position to standing, locomotion, and climbing
stairs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients have difficulty
in standing up without help, and difficulties in negotiating obstacles start to emerge
during walking<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the reasons for
the decrease in gait speed and asymmetric gait in hemiplegic patients is the limitation of
passive and active movements due to structural changes in the connective tissue and
articular capsule around the ankle joint<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The motor function of the ankle joint greatly affects balance and walking abilities. In
addition, improvement of walking ability is a major goal in patients undergoing stroke
rehabilitation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Manual therapy is widely used and advocated for many aspects of peripheral joint
dysfunction. Mulligan&#x02019;s mobilization with movement (MWM) technique is commonly used in
musculoskeletal physiotherapy. The recently developed manual therapy techniques include
Brian Mulligan&#x02019;s widely used MWM for peripheral joint pain, which has been shown to improve
range of motion and promote earlier return to function after lateral ankle sprain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The clinical efficacy of Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique is also applicable to the MWM technique
for talocrural dorsiflexion, which is frequently used to improve talocrural dorsiflexion
deficits that often occur after lateral ankle sprain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. MWMs correct this by repositioning the joint, causing it to track
normally<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanisms behind the
effectiveness of MWMs are based on mechanical dysfunction and therefore on positional fault
correction<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to verify whether Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique improve the
temporal and spatial variables of the gait of individuals who had a stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were chosen from among 24 stroke patients who were undergoing
physical therapy at a rehabilitation hospital. The participant selection criteria were as
follows: those who had hemiparesis due to stroke with onset at &#x0003e;6 months, the ability to
follow verbal instructions, the ability to communicate at a certain level, recovered the
motor functions of their paretic lower limbs at Brunnstrom stage 2&#x02013;4, and a score of &#x0003e;24
points on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean. Patients were excluded if they had a
neurological condition, orthopedic disease, or visual impairment. All the patients who
participated in this trial provided their written informed consent after receiving a full
explanation of the expected results and side effects of the intervention. The present study
was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2015-114).</p><p>The 24 subjects were randomly assigned to either Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM group (MWM; n=12) or a
&#x0201c;weight-bearing with placebo&#x0201d; MWM group (control; n=12). The general characteristics of the
12 subjects in the experimental group were as follows: 6 males and 6 females; a mean age of
41.58&#x02005;years; a mean height of 165.67&#x02005;cm; a mean weight of 62.42&#x02005;kg; and a mean time since
stroke onset of 8.87 months; right- and left-side hemiplegia in 8 and 4 cases, respectively.
The characteristics of the 12 subjects in the control group were as follows: 6 males and 6
females; a mean age of 53.0&#x02005;years; a mean height of 164.58&#x02005;cm; a mean weight of 60.67&#x02005;kg;
and a mean time since stroke onset of 10.46 months; and right- and left-side hemiplegia in 5
and 7 cases, respectively. No significant differences in these characteristics were found
between the 2 groups.</p><p>The participants in the experimental group performed Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique at 5 sets of
10 glides a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The participants in the control group performed
lunges in the same conditions as the experimental group. The participants in the control
group were trained for 5 sets of 10 lunges a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Before the
intervention, all the participants received conventional physical therapy for 30 minutes per
day, 5 days per week over a 4-week period. Gait ability was blindly assessed before and
after the intervention.</p><p>Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique consisted of gliding and resting. Each gliding involved 10 seconds
of posterior talar glide with dorsiflexion and 5 seconds of resting between the gliding. For
the gliding, grade III movements were used. The therapist applied a sustained
posteroanterior glide to the tibia through the belt by leaning backward while the talus and
forefoot were fixed in the space between the thumb and the second finger of the right hand.
The other hand was positioned anteriorly over the proximal tibia to direct the knee over the
line of the second and third toes. Then, the participant was instructed to perform a slow
dorsiflexion movement until the first onset of pain or end of range of motion without the
heel lifting off the couch.</p><p>Gait function was measured by using GAITRite (GAITRite, CIR system Inc., Havertown,
Pennsylvania, USA). GAITRite was used for the measurement of spatiotemporal parameters,
including gait velocity, cadence, step length, and stride length<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measurement was performed 3 times. To eliminate
fatigue from walking, the subjects took a 30-second rest after walking each time.</p><p>The SPSS 18.0 software program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical
analysis. The data showed normal distribution as assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A
paired t-test was used to compare pretest and posttest measurements of gait function within
the groups, and the independent t-test was used to compare the difference in gait function
before and after training between the groups. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The MWM group showed significant improvements in velocity, which increased from 41.35&#x02005;cm/s
before training to 51.72&#x02005;cm/s after training (p&#x0003c;0.001); cadence, step length, stride
length, and single-support time of the affected side; and step length and stride length of
the non-affected side (p&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the control group demonstrated significant
improvements in step length and stride length of the non-affected side (p&#x0003c;0.05). The MWM

and spatial variables of gait of individuals who had a stroke. The application of Mulligan&#x02019;s
MWM techniques effectively improved the gait function of the patients in this study.</p><p>The pressure from weight bearing on the affected side of the lower extremity is decreased
by up to 43%, which makes stroke patients prone to falls to the affected side because of
loss of balance. They experience difficulty in standing without assistance, which impairs
their ambulatory abilities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these
reasons, gait and balance training is essential for stroke patients. This training involves
exercise of the ankle to improve gait and balance. In particular, problems with the
dorsiflexors of the ankle were reported to be the highest risk factor of falls<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and tonic paralysis in the plantar
flexors of the ankle disrupt the normal gait pattern<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some treatments are
available to resolve these problems, including neurodevelopmental techniques, functional
electrical stimulation, biofeedback, strength training, and treadmill training. However, in
this study, the efficacy of Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique was verified. This technique consisted
of gliding and resting. Each gliding consisted of 10 seconds of posterior talar glide with
dorsiflexion of the ankle joint and 5 seconds of resting between the gliding. For the
gliding, grade III movements were used. The therapist applied a sustained posteroanterior
glide to the tibia through the belt by leaning backward while the talus and forefoot were
fixed in the space between the thumb and the second right-hand finger. The MWM group had
significantly greater improvements in velocity, cadence, and single-support time of the
affected side (p&#x0003c;0.05) than the control group, which suggests that Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM
technique could improve the gait ability of patients recovering from stroke.</p><p>The symptoms of postural imbalance in stroke patients are evident during standing because
of the increased weight bearing toward the non-paretic side. Decreased standing balance and
loss of the ability to shift weight toward the paretic leg can also develop after a
stroke<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Difficulty in shifting weight
toward the paretic side can affect gait function. Therefore, limitations in movements can
decrease the range and amount of physical activities that can be performed and could lead to
further decreases in postural balance, which may ultimately result in the deterioration of
physical health<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study
investigated a sustained posteroanterior glide to the tibia for improvement of weight shift
in stroke patients. The MWM group showed a significant improvement in single-support time of
the affected side, which increased from 20.08%/gait cycle (GC) before training to 23.33%/GC
after training (p&#x0003c;0.05). For increasing the single-support time of the affected side,
Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM is more effective than the lunge position. Muscle cooperation in the ankle
joint puts the center of gravity on the ankle joint in the standing position. It requires
normal range of motion of the ankle joint and muscular strength<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The normal
range of motion of the ankle joint in the standing position improved in the MWM group owing
to the posteroanterior glide to the tibia.</p><p>Based on the findings of the present study, Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM could increase the velocity,
cadence, step length, stride length, and single-support time of the affected side, and the
step length and stride length of the non-affected side. Moreover, increased single-support
time of the affected side will positively influence the motivation of patients during GC and
weight bearing on the non-paretic side toward maintaining their bodies within the limits of
stability. Thus, the positive effect of Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM on gait function and its
effectiveness as a treatment regimen for improving the GC in stroke patients were
confirmed.</p><p>This study has limitations, including the lack of diversity in the dependent variables.
This is because only gait ability was measured. In addition, Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM technique is
commonly used in musculoskeletal physical therapy; however, it was used in this study to
improve the GC in stroke patients. Hence, further research on the efficacy of Mulligan&#x02019;s MWM
in stroke rehabilitation should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Thibaut</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatelle</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ziegler</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Spasticity after stroke: physiology, assessment and
