Commonly used therapies, such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and anti-RANKL antibodies, have contributed to reducing osteoporotic fractures. However, these therapies are thought to act by reducing bone resorption only.</p><p>Teriparatide is the recombinant N-terminal fragment (residues 1&#x02013;34) of human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH[1&#x02013;34]). In contrast to bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and anti-RANKL antibodies, teriparatide 20 &#x003bc;g/day increases bone formation, largely through stimulating the overall anabolic activity of osteoblasts.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) is a marker of bone formation that is cleaved off during the processing of type I procollagen to mature type I collagen.<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Serum PINP is relatively insensitive to the circadian rhythm or the effects of food intake and has a high signal-to-noise ratio, making it particularly clinically useful.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Serum PINP increases with the increasing anabolic action of teriparatide treatment.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is a strong relationship between early change in PINP and later change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) during teriparatide therapy.<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, monitoring with PINP and lumbar spine BMD can identify positive responses in most patients taking teriparatide and negative responses in most patients not taking teriparatide.<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Monitoring of PINP may therefore be a useful aid in the management of patients with osteoporosis during teriparatide treatment,<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and in the clinical setting in Japan, many prescribers use PINP as a marker for drug monitoring of teriparatide.<xref rid="b6-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The effects of teriparatide 20 &#x003bc;g/day on BMD, serum markers of bone turnover, incidence of fracture, and safety have been assessed in a Phase III randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Japanese subjects (men and women) at high risk of fracture.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The study included 12 months of placebo-controlled, blinded therapy followed by 12 months of open-label treatment during which all subjects received teriparatide.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The data showed that teriparatide 20 &#x003bc;g/day was well tolerated and stimulated bone formation during 12 and 24 months of treatment in Japanese subjects with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The study data were also used to confirm the strong relationship between PINP and BMD.<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In the clinical setting, the PINP biomarker is the most popular assessment of bone metabolism during treatment with daily teriparatide, which provides a bone anabolic effect.<xref rid="b6-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Besides, serum calcium is tightly regulated by PTH through the kidneys and osteoclasts.<xref rid="b7-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Factors such as vitamin D3<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> have been shown to influence calcium blood levels.

To address this unanswered clinical question, we planned to evaluate safety of teriparatide in patients with high PINP values. Since PINP is not always measured during treatment of patients with osteoporosis, it was difficult to conduct such an evaluation in an observational, post-marketing surveillance study. We therefore performed a post hoc exploratory analysis of this Phase III study to determine if there was an association between serum PINP elevation and serum calcium concentration or calcium metabolism-related disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This post hoc analysis was conducted with data from a previously published, multicenter, Phase III study that assessed the safety and efficacy of teriparatide 20 &#x003bc;g/day in Japanese men and women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture during a 12-month treatment period followed by an open-label treatment period (up to 24 months) in which all subjects received teriparatide.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The study design of this Phase III study has been previously reported.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The objectives of this post hoc analysis were to assess: 1) changes in serum calcium in patients with high serum PINP (&#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;g/L) at any time point during the study; and 2) changes in serum PINP and serum calcium in patients with calcium metabolism-related adverse events (AEs) during the study.</p><p>As previously reported, serum PINP concentrations significantly increased after teriparatide treatment in this study.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A preliminary analysis showed that PINP exceeded the upper limit of the normal range (79.1 &#x003bc;g/L) at least one time point during teriparatide treatment in &#x0003e;80% of subjects and at every time point in &#x0003e;20% of subjects. A serum PINP value of 200 &#x003bc;g/L is approximately 2.5-fold that of the upper limit of the normal range and was between the 90th and 95th percentile (90th percentile: 180 &#x003bc;g/L; 95th percentile: 218 &#x003bc;g/L) of all measurements (all subjects at all time points; 844 points) during teriparatide treatment in this study. Since the 95th percentile is normally used to establish the reference range for laboratory tests, we used 200 &#x003bc;g/L as the threshold of &#x0201c;abnormal&#x0201d; values during teriparatide treatment. As a result, the upper 5% of patients with the highest serum PINP concentrations was judged to have abnormally high values of serum PINP.</p><p>This original study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT00433160) was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.

Two subjects experienced hypercalcemia and recovered without altering teriparatide treatment, although we were unable to identify any specific characteristics that were different in these two subjects compared to the other subjects in the study. In addition, no subjects discontinued due to an elevation in serum calcium, despite the fact that the study protocol allowed this as a discontinuation criterion, and no increase in the incidence of potentially study drug-related AEs was observed.

A limitation to using PINP as a barometer for clinical response is the reported variability among patients.<xref rid="b17-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, Eastell et al found that lesser PINP increases may be due to variations in patient adherence, teriparatide injection and storage technique, or the presence of medical conditions to limit response to therapy.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-1101" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Study-specific limitations included the relatively short duration of the placebo-controlled phase (1 year) and the moderate size of the study population, which prevented statistical analysis of any potential association between calcium metabolism-related disorders and elevated serum PINP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, increases in PINP, a marker of bone formation, were rapid and sustained. There was no apparent association between serum PINP elevation after daily teriparatide treatment and serum calcium concentration or calcium metabolism-related AEs in Japanese subjects. These data suggest that teriparatide therapy may be safe and effective for treating Japanese subjects with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the subjects, their families, the study sites, and the study personnel who participated in this clinical trial.
