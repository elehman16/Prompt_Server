In India, the prevalence of dental caries is as high as 60&#x02013;80% among children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Despite the high prevalence of dental caries, oral health has not received sufficient importance in India.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The etiology of dental caries is quite complex involving interaction between the agent, host, and environmental factors. Dental caries can be prevented by modifying the agent, host and environmental factors involved in its causation. <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> are important agent factor and major causative bacteria implicated in dental caries.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Many studies have shown a direct relationship between the occurrence of carious lesions and salivary <italic>Streptococcus Mutans</italic> count.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Chewing gums that are used by a large proportion of populations have gained a lot of consideration in caries prevention as they stimulate saliva, one of the most significant important host factors that determine the occurrence of dental caries. Stimulated saliva has an increased concentration of bicarbonates that result in elevated plaque pH and enhanced acid buffering capacity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The stimulated saliva is also a state of mineral supersaturation that promotes enamel remineralization.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Traditional chewing gums sweetened with sucrose may contribute to the cariogenicity of the diet, hence sugar substitutes such as, lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and Xylitol are commonly used in foods to replace sugars. In the midst of a variety of chewing gums, sugar free chewing gums containing the sugar substitute have proved valuable against dental caries. Study results have shown that oral bacteria do not use these sugar substitutes to produce acids that demineralize enamel and dentin.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Chewing gums containing Xylitol have received special attention, since along with the mechanical cleaning due to saliva stimulation it also own anti-bacterial effects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Among the various polyols Xylitol alone has a taste comparable to sucrose in terms of sweetness.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Xylitol chewing gum is found to reduce salivary and plaque <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> count.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Certain herbal chewing gums are also marketed claiming to provide a beneficial effect against dental caries. &#x0201c;Orbit White&#x0201d; is one herbal chewing gum available in the Indian market for the last few years. It contains &#x0201c;pudina&#x0201d; that is an herbal mint and traditionally used in India as a flavoring agent in preparing dishes. It has a known anti-bacterial effect against <italic>Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Alcaligenes fecalis and Bacillus cereus</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] herbal chewing gums containing pudina probably may have an influence on oral microorganisms but literature reveals no evidence in this regard.</p><p>A major criticism of the clinical trials on chewing gums relates to their designs. Xylitol chewing gums have been consistently evaluated against control groups wherein the subjects were advised not to chew the test chewing gum. However, the effect of chewing per se should not be ignored. It is, therefore, not possible to assess the effect of sweeteners and other additives in chewing gum without a control group that chews a control (placebo) gum. Exploration of available literature revealed no studies comparing the anti-bacterial effect of Xylitol containing chewing gums with herbal chewing gums against salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>. The present study was conducted with an aim to assess and compare the relative effect of these two chewing gums and a placebo gum (gum base) on salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts, among high school children in Davangere city.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The present study is a randomized, clinical, follow-up study with a concurrent parallel design conducted among high school children in Davangere city. Davangere city consists of a total of 155 higher primary schools. Sample size determination was based on the data obtained from a pilot study. For &#x003b1; error fixed at &#x0003c;5% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and &#x003b2; fixed at 20%, the sample size was determined as 72 (24/group). Ethical clearance was obtained from the ethical review board of Bapuji Dental College and Hospital, Davangere. The study included students having, at least one frank carious cavity and salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts of equal to or &#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml of saliva.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Method employed to obtain the desired sample</title><p>Out of a total of 155 schools, eight schools (two schools from each zone) were selected among which three schools were randomly selected by employing the lottery method. List of all the students belonging to age groups 12&#x02013;15 years from the selected schools was obtained from the school records. Among these those who were, (1) had been taking anti-biotic therapy within the last 2 weeks, (2) had hypersensitivity to any product used in the study, (3) were unable to comply with the study appointment schedule, (4) were suffering from acute or chronic systemic disease with potential oral manifestations, (5) wore a removable prosthesis, (6) were undergoing orthodontic treatment, (7) were suffering from temporomandibular joint disorders, (8) had a history of gastro intestinal problem, or (9) were habitual gum chewers, were all excluded.</p><p>The remaining students were examined and those having at least one frank carious cavity were selected. The examination of the frank cavity was carried under natural light and the tooth suspected of having a carious lesion was further confirmed by drying the tooth with a chip blower, removing the overlying debris and feeling the base of the lesion using a cloud particle imager probe. These students were further subjected to salivary analysis to assess the salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Assessment of salivary <italic>Streptococcus Mutans</italic> count</title><p>One ml of unstimulated saliva from the selected students was collected. The children were instructed to let saliva collect without swallowing for at least 1 min, and then to expectorate into the sterile test tube and was repeated until a minimum of 1 ml of saliva was collected. It was diluted with saline (1:10). The diluted sample was streaked on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide.</p><p>Children who had salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts of &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> were considered as possible participants and among these 24 children/school were selected randomly. 24 students from each school were considered as one sub group This resulted in a total sample of 72 children (24 &#x000d7; 3) for the final study. A detailed schedule of visits to the selected schools in assigned time frame was prepared well in advance by discussing with the school authorities and based on the study design. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children participating in the study (Since Sec 90 of IPC suggest that the age for giving valid consent of 12 yrs or above child for any procedures).</p><p>The chewing gums used in the study were: Herbal chewing gum-&#x0201c;Orbit white&#x0201d; (Xylitol, Lotte India Corportation Ltd., orbit white, Wrigley Company) &#x02013; Group A, 100% Xylitol chewing gum-&#x0201c;Xylitol&#x0201d; (Lotte Company) &#x02013; Group B, Placebo chewing gum-&#x0201c;gum base&#x0201d; &#x02013; Group C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Packing of chewing gum</title><p>The chewing gum pellets were removed from their respective wrappers and packed in identical boxes.</p><p>In the pretested questionnaire, all the required and relevant information of the participants&#x02019; socio-demographic data, diet history, and oral hygiene habits interview method was recorded.

The three chewing gums the investigator was blinded about the group allocation and the chewing gums used by the children. The chewing gum assignment was done as mentioned below: Block I (Group A) &#x02013; &#x0201c;Orbit white&#x0201d;, block II (Group B) &#x02013; &#x0201c;Xylitol&#x0201d; and block III (Group C) &#x02013; &#x0201c;Gum base&#x0201d;. The chewing gums were distributed once every week (28 pellets each time). Subjects were instructed to chew one pellet each time for four times a day for 10 min after breakfast, lunch, evening snacks and dinner for 21 days. All subjects were advised to maintain their routine dietary habits, daily oral hygiene regimens and not to consume any other chewing gum except that which is provided to them during the study period. To keep a check on the compliance check list was provided to the students. The class teachers were also asked to remind the students to chew the chewing gums every day. The investigator visited the schools every alternate day to check for the compliance. On every visit, the students were reminded to chew the chewing gums as according to the given instructions. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> day, unstimulated salivary sample was collected and assessed for salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>.

Chewing results in salivary stimulation that can neutralize or elevate the pH of plaque especially at the interface between the tooth and the plaque. Stimulated saliva can also enhance the clearance of fermentable carbohydrates purely through its mechanical action.</p><p>The current study employed block randomization method for the following reasons; (1) the three test materials used in the current study were different in their color, consistency and taste. Applying block randomization was the only way to blind the participants with respect to three different test materials used in the study (2) to avoid trading and exchange of gums since a statistically significant difference was observed in health behavior of different blocks/subgroups which could have modified the results, multivariate analysis was performed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>] which clearly suggested that the results observed were mainly due to chewing gum.</p><p>Salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts were obtained using unstimulated saliva instead of stimulated saliva for the following reasons because salivary tests are generally more usable than tests based on plaque, which are often more technically sensitive.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Additionally the <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> count obtained from plaque do not represent the whole mouth.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] By use of saliva samples also mechanical dislodging of <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> from plaque can be controlled thus avoiding falsely or inconsistently increasing their level.</p><p>Previous studies revealed that 5&#x02013;10 g/day of Xylitol was required for its anti-bacterial effect.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The product used in the current study contained 1.28 g of Xylitol/pellet, hence four pellets were advised/day so as to deliver around 5.14 g of Xylitol/day. Sugar free chewing gums when used after meals are suggested to have a beneficial effect for this reason in the present study subjects were instructed to chew the gum after every meal and evening snacks.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The control group was maintained in order to balance the anti-bacterial effect caused due to salivary stimulation by chewing gums, so that any difference in the posttest salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> count between the groups can be attributed to only the active ingredients present in the chewing gums. Due to it the compliance was poorer in placebo group but the diffference in compliance between the three groups was not significant.</p><p>In the present study, although numerically a marginal reduction in salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> count was observed in the herbal chewing gum group at the end of the follow-up period, the difference was statistically not significant. This is perhaps the first study to assess the anti-bacterial effect of herbal chewing gum. As there are no reports available in the literature, the scope for valid comparisons is severely constrained. Xylitol chewing gum has shown to possess a significant anti-microbial effect against salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>. This is in conformity with the results obtained in several previous studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] In a study conducted by Holerson <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) and in a study by Isotupa (1995) on orthodontic patients, the participants chewed Xylitol chewing gums 2 pellets three times/day and two pellets six times/day respectively for 4 weeks.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Results of both studies have shown significant reduction in salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts which are in agreement with the results obtained in the present study. In the present study, the subjects chewed the assigned chewing gum only 4 times a day. Based on the observation it can be speculated that chewing gums 4 times or 6 times a day has a similar effect on salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>.</p><p>The results of the current study are very much in agreement with the studies of Simon's <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Autio[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] conducted among elderly adults and preschool children respectively, although the age groups and frequency of chewing gums/day were slightly different when compared to the present study. This suggests that the effect of Xylitol chewing gum is not restricted to a specific age group.</p><p>Longer period of Xylitol consumption does not appear to significantly decrease the number of MS in the saliva compared with a control group of nonconsumers[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in contrast to the results obtained with short periods of use.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] It is said that the reduction in salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> persists for a specific period after instituting the chewing of Xylitol containing gums. After which the organisms develop resistance to Xylitol followed by the rise in the number of salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>, these organisms were found to be less adherent to the tooth surface hence less pathogenic (cariogenic) thus providing long term effect anti-caries effect.</p><p>The effect obtained by Xylitol chewing gum on <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts may be due to the fact that Xylitol is not fermented by cariogenic plaque bacteria and thus, does not lower the pH of plaque.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] As the plaque pH does not decrease, enamel demineralization is prevented, and plaque bacteria do not proliferate. Xylitol, however, is absorbed and accumulates intracellularly in <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic>. Xylitol competes with sucrose for its cell-wall transporter and its intracellular metabolic processes. Unlike the metabolism of sucrose, which produces energy and promotes bacterial growth, <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> only expend energy to break down the accumulated Xylitol without yielding energy in return.</p><p>In the present study Placebo chewing gum also showed a reduction in salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts compared to the baseline even if the difference was statistically not significant. Similar results were obtained in the study done by Soderling and Trahan[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] among dental students where in unsweetened chewing gum base was chewed 3&#x02013;5 times a day for a period of 2 weeks.</p><p>Xylitol chewing gum was found to be superior in its anti-bacterial effect on salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> when compared to the placebo gum, but the difference was statistically not significant. The appreciable effect on salivary <italic>Mutans Streptococci</italic> counts by placebo chewing gum may be due to the texture of the gum base being harder to chew thus increasing salivation.</p><p>The compliance levels found in Xylitol, and herbal chewing gum groups was good compliance. In comparison, the compliance was poorer in the placebo group with only 46% showing good compliance. The reasons attributed to poor compliance by majority of the students were that, they had forgot to chew the gums, and few said that they had been out of the station and had forgot to carry the gums. The compliance level was not significantly different aong the study groups (xylitol and herbal chewing gum) Majority of the subjects in the placebo group complained that the gum was harder in consistency and bland in taste. The subjects tolerated chewing gums well without reporting any side effects. This finding is in agreement with the once obtained in other studies.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</p><p>The data obtained showed statistically significant difference between the sub groups with respect to the brushing frequency, material used to clean the teeth and rinsing after meal that in turn could have confounded the results. To account for this, logistic regression was performed to investigate their interaction effect. This analysis revealed that among all the independent variables, chewing of gum was the only variable which showed statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) association with reduction in salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts (dependent variable) in the Xylitol groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>From the present study it can be concluded that, 100% Xylitol sweetened chewing gum when chewed four times a day for 10 min each time for a period 21 days can significantly reduce the salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts which may be beneficial in controlling dental caries among risk patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
