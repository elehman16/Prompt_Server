Intrapartum antibiotic exposure, including even those considered safe in pregnancy, have been associated with childhood obesity and compromised immunity. Data on the extent of antibiotic use, safety and its impact on birth outcomes and neonatal health in Sub-Saharan Africa is very limited. This study sought to ascertain the extent of antibiotic use in pregnancy and its effects on birth outcomes in a rural hospital in Ghana.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study was a retrospective randomized study of mothers who delivered babies in a rural hospital between 2011 and 2015 in Ghana. A total of 412 mother/baby records out of 2100 pre-selected met the inclusion criteria of the study. Indicators of neonatal health used were birthweight, Apgar score, incidence of birth defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Sixty five percent of pregnant women were administered antibiotics at some stage during pregnancy. Beta Lactam antibiotics accounted for more than 67% of all antibiotics prescribed. There was a statistically significant association between antibiotic exposure and pregnancy factors such as stage of pregnancy, parity and mode of delivery but not with socio-economic status of the mother. Intrapartum antibiotic exposure did not significantly affect the birthweight, incidence of congenital birth defect and mean Apgar scores. After adjusting for method of delivery, however, perinatal antibiotic use (24&#x000a0;h to delivery) was associated with lower mean Apgar scores. Birth weight was affected significantly by maternal socio-economic factors such as age and marital status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Sixty five percent of women attending the antenatal clinic received antibiotics. Intrapartum antibiotics did not affect early markers of neonatal health such as birthweight, congenital birth defect and mean Apgar scores. However, antibiotic use less than 24&#x000a0;h to delivery was associated with a decrease in mean APGAR score.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Birth outcomes</kwd><kwd>Congenital defects</kwd><kwd>APGAR scores</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic</kwd><kwd>Intrapartum</kwd><kwd>Birthweight</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">There has been a sturdy increase in global antibiotic prescription and consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several concerns have been raised about irrational use of antibiotics and its subsequent impact on drug resistance and cost of healthcare. Furthermore, the role that human microbiota, believed to account for the greater part of human body weight, plays in programming the immunity and metabolism of an individual has re-emphasized the need to regulate use of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Pregnancy presents with significant risk of complications which may lead to morbidity and mortality for mother-baby pairs. Globally, more than 50% of neonatal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa because of infections and limited health resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To manage the complications associated with pregnancy and motherhood, many medicines are employed. Antibiotics remain important in pregnancy and may be second to only iron and food supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to limited health resources, such as laboratories to carry-out culture and sensitivity test, the extent of exposure of pregnant women and babies to antibiotics and the effects on their health may be underestimated.</p><p id="Par12">There have been several attempts to promote rational antibiotic use partly because of the risk of drug resistance, increased cost of healthcare, as well as the risk of teratogenicity in the developing foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, recent studies have shown that there may be other insidious risk associated with antibiotic use in pregnancy independent on safety profile, mechanism of action or even class the of antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For instance it is well documented that Caesarian birth or intrapartum antibiotic exposure contributes adversely to childhood obesity and compromised immunity of the baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unlike classical teratogenesis, these effects occur indirectly through alterations of the maternal microbiota without the agent necessarily crossing the placenta to affect the tissues of the foetus.</p><p id="Par13">Neonatal Health and Birth outcome is highly dependent on maternal health, nutrition and socio-economic factors. The use and choice of antibiotic during pregnancy depends primarily on maternal factors such as health, nutrition, mode of delivery and socio-economic factors. These maternal factors influence the indicators used to estimate birth outcomes and neonatal health such as birth weight, APGAR scores, and incidences of birth defects. To able to understand the full extent and effects of intrapartum antibiotics on mother and babies, there is a need to elucidate the complex interplay between maternal health, mode of delivery and socio-economic status and neonatal health.</p><p id="Par14">A key point in the millennium development goals is reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. To date there is little clinical data on the trends of antibiotic use during pregnancy and its effects on neonatal health from sub-Saharan Africa. Using Birth weight, APGAR scores, and incidences of birth defects as indicators of birth outcomes and early neonatal health and survival, this study examines the use of antibiotics during pregnancy, its effects on birth and neonatal health and as well as the effects of other maternal factors on antibiotic use in a rural health facility in Ghana.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par15">Seventh-Day Adventist Hospital, Dominase is a 45 bed capacity hospital located in Dominase about 19&#x000a0;km off the Kumasi&#x02013;Cape coast highway. The hospital has an obstetrics and gynaecology unit which runs an antenatal clinic with a resident gynaecologist, pharmacist and several midwives and nurses. To limit the impact of un-prescribed and undocumented antibiotic usage, the area chosen was predominately rural with no existent pharmacy. Furthermore, the National Health Insurance Scheme of Ghana runs a &#x0201c;capitation policy&#x0201d; where patients choose a particular primary health care facility for their needs without paying out of pocket. Patients who visit any other facility aside the allocated facility have to pay to access healthcare. This discouraged the tendency for mothers from seeking health services from other facilities as well as reduce self &#x02013;medication. This is of particular importance because antibiotics can be obtained without prescription in Ghana.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par16">The design was a retrospective descriptive study. The primary source of data was prescriptions generated and recorded in patient medical records filed in the hospital between January 2011 and December 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sampling method</title><p id="Par17">Folder numbers of all live babies born in the hospital between January, 2011 and September, 2015 were retrieved from the registration book at the maternity unit. Five hundred folder numbers were selected for each of the 5 years from the registration book using systematic sample, making a total of 2500 folders. The contents of 2100 folders were available for the study. Each folder of mother-baby pairs was subsequently screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Pearson Chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. Relative risk and Odds ratio were used as a measure of the degree of association between an event (outcome) and comparable groups. Students T- test and One way analysis of variance (one-way Anova) were used to analyze the difference in mean values between a set of comparable groups or values. Bonferroni was used as the post hoc test after one- way Anova. A <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Potential confounders</title><p id="Par25">The study assumed that antibiotic prescribed was synonymous with exposure which is not always the case. Because of the rural nature of the setting the hospital dispensary dispenses most of the medications prescribed at the same facility. This reduces the inconvenience of patients moving to city centers for their prescribed medicines. The dose prescribed, the duration of therapy and the frequency of administration were not taken into consideration.</p><p id="Par26">The design of the study could not totally account for possible out-of- hospital antibiotic use. The choice of a rural community with few chemical shop outlets and no pharmacy was expected to reduce this potential confounder.</p><p id="Par27">The National Health Insurance Scheme runs a &#x0201c;capitation policy&#x0201d; where a patient chooses one primary health care facility for their needs. The policy also reduces patients moving from one hospital to another because if a patient visits another hospital they have to pay hospital charges. This reduces attrition and tendency for self- medication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sociodemographic data</title><p id="Par28">The biodata recorded were mothers&#x02019; age at birth, gravida, marital status, occupational status and religious affiliation.

However antibiotic use was associated multiple gravida and Cesarean section. The odds ratio for antibiotic exposure during Caesarean were 13.8 times higher (95% CI, 5.9&#x02013;32.5, K&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55.47) than that for women who delivered vaginally.</p><p id="Par30">There was an association (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) between antibiotic exposure with advance in stage of pregnancy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
