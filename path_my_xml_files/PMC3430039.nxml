Nutritional interventions are one of the most important ones. Nutritional intervention can have beneficial effects on the markers of glycemic control and other cardiovascular risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Following nutritional intervention, the complications of diabetes mellitus also will be improved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Life style modifications including changing the nutritional habits are difficult kinds of interventions. Having knowledge regarding the nutritional recommendation is not enough and even in spite of good knowledge, it is difficult for patients to act according to the knowledge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> This is more important in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes due to lower knowledge of nutrition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Previous studies pointed out the important role of nutrition education in controlling glucose in elderly with diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> and mentioned the key role of education for changing nutritional habits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> The effectiveness of nutritional educational programs also is important. A change of behavior model that is suitable for nutritional educational programs is Hubly's change of behavior model. This model includes beliefs, attitudes, subjective norms and enabling factors (BASNEF Model).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Behavioral attitude is a product of one's belief; in fact, it is the positive or negative evaluation of behavior. Subjective norms are one's belief relative to influential persons and this is on social pressures and reflections. Enabling factors are skills and sources that allow person's aim or intention to change the behavior.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> The novelty of the present study is related to the type of study participants. We chose elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. According to our knowledge, there is no study regarding the effects of educational model among elderly patients. Almost all the studies on diabetes have been conducted on newly diagnosed and not elderly patients. It is always a question if the educational model can be effective among elderly patients. Furthermore, BASNEF model has not been administered for the educational intervention yet. Therefore, another innovation of the present study was the application of this kind of educational model.</p><p>Based on the cited materials and paucity of interventions performed in nutrition education of elderly, this study was performed to determine the effect of nutrition education on knowledge and dietary behaviors as well as glycemic control status of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes based on BASNEF model.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled educational trial. The studied population included elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in Isfahan (Iran) Diabetes Institution during 2010. The age of participants was 60 years or greater and none had cognitive or motor disabilities. The participants in the present study were chosen by stratified random sampling method from among elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. 100 elderly with type 2 diabetes were chosen and were randomly divided to intervention (n=50) and control (n=50) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Inclusion criteria were being more than 60 years old, consuming no special diet for a kind of specific disease, having type 2 diabetes for at least one year, and not having moving disability or cognitive impairment. Those patients that did not participate in one educational session were excluded from the study. The sample size was calculated by this formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JRMS-16-1149-g001.jpg"/></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patients diagram during the present study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-16-1149-g002"/></fig><p>Therefore, it was needed to have 44 patients in each group. This study was approved by the research council and ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was completed by all the patients.</p><p>This was an educational intervention based on BASNEF model. This model includes beliefs, attitudes, subjective norms and enabling factors.</p><p>The data collection tools in this study included: A) questionnaire designed based on BASNEF model and included demographic characteristics (14 items), knowledge questions (15 items), attitude to behavioral beliefs (5 items) and evaluations of behavioral outcomes (5 items), enabling factors (5 items) , and subjective norms (5 item). This questionnaire was completed by structured interview. The scoring method of the questionnaire was such that 1 score was given to the true answer and zero was given to the false answer in knowledge part. In beliefs part, it was designed on 3-point Likert scales and score range of each item varied between 1 to 3 so that 1 score was given to &#x0201c;I disagree&#x0201d; , 2 scores to &#x0201c;I do not have idea&#x0201d;, and 3 scores to &#x0201c;I agree&#x0201d;. About subjective norms and enabling factors, items were designed as 2&#x02013;options. The scale of scores was considered out of 100 for all parts of questionnaire.</p><p>The validity of given questionnaire was measured by content validity and face validity methods. The questionnaire was provided on sources and valid books. Five experts&#x02019; views were given for assessing content validity. Some of the suggestions of the reviewers were used to change the wording of the questionnaire. This questionnaire was given to 20 elderly patients with diabetes (similar but non-participants in the study) for confirming face validity and explanations, questions and defects of the questionnaire were considered. The reliability of given questionnaire was confirmed by test&#x02013;retest for knowledge questions (r=0.76) and by internal validity for attitude questions (&#x003b1;=0.80).</p><p>B) Three days food record questionnaire was used for assessing nutrition performance of diabetic elderly. For assessing the amount of each food group consumption the gram of each kind of food was changed to equivalent servings based on the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid.</p><p>c) Biochemical tests of blood including fasting plasma glucose (FBS) and HbA1C were performed in a lab. FBS was measured via enzymatic method with a commercially enzymatic kit (Parsazmoon-2010) by using autoanalyzer (BT3000). Hb1AC was measured according to the immunoturbidimetric method using Rondex commercially kit (Rondox-2010) by using autoanalyzer (BT3000). Before educational intervention in intervention and control groups, the given questionnaires were completed and patients were referred to the lab for doing tests with an introducing letter.</p><p>The four 70-minute educational sessions were conducted during one month. The goals of the sessions were to increase the frequency of meals, to decrease use of fat and simple sugars and to increase use of fruits and vegetables for intervention group. The final session included patients&#x02018; family that was conducted with the presence of staff and participants. Content of education was transferred to target group by lecture, question and answer, and discussion. Education pamphlets were given to patients&#x02019; family in order to involve them in intervention at the end of educational session. Telephone follow-ups in week 4 and 8 after intervention by researchers to patients and their families were done in order to emphasize on educational materials, and to response to possible questions of the patients. Three months after training intervention, questionnaire was completed in both intervention and control groups again and blood tests were performed in order to determine the indices regarding the glycemic control. All the nutritional educations were provided by the nutritionist. Control group received usual care and they did not receive specific nutritional education. SPSS software (version 15) was used for data analysis. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, and McNemar tests were used for comparing the qualitative variables. Independent-sample t test and paired-sample t test were used in the present study for comparing the quantitative variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, 97 of the original 100 patients completed the study (48 in intervention group and 49 in control group).

These factors for intervention group included information, dietary skills, opportunity of nutrition education and consultation. They had a nutrition consult with a dietitian or other qualified nutrition professional on a one-on-one basis. While non-existence of such factors in the control group led to no change of their mean score of enabling factors.

Frequency of meals showed 35% increase in intervention group, while the mean intake of fat and bread-grain group showed significant decrease. In addition, the number of servings of fruits and vegetables group showed significant increase in the intervention group after nutritional educational intervention.

Elevated HbA1C was associated with increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> Therefore, the effect of interventions on the level of HbA1C is important. In addition, significant change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was observed, so that intervention could decrease FPG to 140 mg/dl in intervention group. It seems that improvement of indices of glucose control can be resulted from decreasing the amount of simple sugars and refined carbohydrates and increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables intake in intervention group. A recent meta&#x02013;analysis in 2008 showed that lower intake of refined carbohydrates led to improvement in the indices of glucose control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></p><p>Decreasing the rate of tendency for follow up during the study was one of the limitations of the current study.

We compared the effects of BASNEF educational model in the present study with a control group because we had no reports regarding the beneficial effects of this model among elderly with diabetes. However, it was better that BASNEF model had been compared with another educational model. It is suggested that future studies compare the effects of this model with other educational models.</p><p>The results of the current study could extrapolate to other population groups with diabetes. As this model was effective in elderly group, it might be also appropriate for other groups with diabetes.</p><p>Finally, BASNEF-based nutritional educational intervention led to improved dietary behaviors in addition to improved knowledge and attitudes of older adults with diabetes, which were associated with improved indices of blood glucose control following a three-month intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>GRSH, AN, AH, and LA participated in the design and conducting the study and preparing the manuscript.
