The longer-chain omega-3 found in fish, seafood and some algae &#x02013; known as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) &#x02013; are the most biologically important forms, not only for cardiovascular and immune system health, but also for normal development and functioning of the brain and nervous system <xref rid="pone.0043909-Brenna1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological, biochemical and intervention studies suggests that low dietary intakes of these long-chain omega-3 may have a detrimental effect on children's behavior and cognitive development <xref rid="pone.0043909-Schuchardt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Prior to this study there was already some evidence from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that dietary supplementation with omega-3 long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) may have benefits for child behavior and learning <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, almost all such studies had involved populations with specific developmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia or developmental coordination disorder (DCD). They were also small trials with considerable differences between the populations studied, treatment formulations used, and outcomes assessed. Findings from these RCTs had therefore been mixed, but the most consistently reported benefits in children of school age had included improvements in attention and concentration, and reductions in other &#x02018;ADHD-type&#x02019; symptoms such as impulsive and oppositional behaviour, as well as anxiety and emotional lability <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Highly significant improvements in both reading and spelling performance were also found in the one study that assessed these outcomes <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>These findings raised the important question of whether such results might have broader applicability. A systematic review of the effects of omega-3 intake on child behavior and learning, carried out in 2006 for the UK Food Standards Agency, emphasized that findings from groups of children with varying levels of clinically reported neurodevelopmental disorder could not reliably be used to assess the potential effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the educational performance of mainstream UK school children <xref rid="pone.0043909-Ells1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. There was thus a clear need for RCTs involving healthy children from the general school population. In designing such a study, however, we reasoned that any benefits from omega-3 supplementation would more likely be demonstrable in children who were initially underperforming on the outcomes of interest. Official figures show that 20% of all children in mainstream UK schools are in need of additional learning support <xref rid="pone.0043909-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Given the importance of literacy skills to children's educational progress, reading achievement was chosen as a primary outcome in this study; and we decided to focus simply on those children whose current reading performance placed them within the bottom 20% of the general population distribution.</p><p>Treatment formulations were another important issue. Most previous research had used varying mixtures of EPA and DHA (the two main omega-3 LC-PUFAs found in fish oils) and sometimes other ingredients, making it difficult to identify which component(s) might be responsible for any treatment effects. DHA is an essential structural component of neuronal membranes, and therefore the main omega-3 found in brain and nerve tissue. Furthermore, the ability of humans to synthesize DHA in-vivo from shorter-chain, plant-derived omega-3 such as alpha-linolenic acid, is very limited, making a direct dietary supply of DHA particularly important <xref rid="pone.0043909-Brenna1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>This study was therefore designed to investigate the importance of DHA for behavior and learning in healthy but underperforming children from the mainstream school population. The study outcomes were selected for their relevance to children's educational progress and future life chances, and involved simple, practical measures of reading, working memory and behavior.</p><p>(a) <italic><underline>Reading</underline></italic>: Literacy skills are fundamental to educational and occupational success. Only 85 per cent of UK adults had a basic level of functional literacy in 2005, and in 2006, five million adults were judged to be under-functioning in this domain <xref rid="pone.0043909-Her1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These statistics are an issue of major public concern; and given the dynamic and cumulative nature of the development of literacy skills in children, early intervention is known to be more cost-effective than later remediation <xref rid="pone.0043909-Heckman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>(b) <italic><underline>Working memory</underline></italic>: The ability to hold and manipulate information in the short-term is important for many aspects of everyday life as well as educational performance; and furthermore, working memory problems (particularly the accurate processing and retrieval of auditory/verbal sequential information), are commonly associated with reading difficulties <xref rid="pone.0043909-Gathercole1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Nevo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

In children within this age range, this would typically equate to a reading performance of around 2 years below the level expected for the child's chronological age. Before first randomization, however, it became apparent that planned study numbers would not be achieved unless this inclusion criterion was relaxed to the 33<sup>rd</sup> centile (equivalent to reading at around 18 months behind chronological age); hence, the protocol was modified accordingly.</p><p>Children with specific medical disorders (e.g. visual or hearing impairment), general learning difficulties, or who were taking medications expected to affect behavior and learning, were excluded from the study, as were those whose first language at home was not English. Schools were also asked to exclude any children whose social/family circumstances would have made inclusion into the study inappropriate (e.g. serious illness in the family). Children who, according to their parents, ate fish more than twice a week or took omega-3 supplements were also excluded.</p><p>The Oxfordshire Local Authority was an active partner in the research, and they provided information on how children from participating schools had performed on the national attainment tests conducted on all 7 year olds in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland <xref rid="pone.0043909-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. From this, an initial list was drawn up of all children with below average attainment in reading at that age.

As expected, there were none in the course of this trial. The parents of three children reported minor adverse events during the intervention period and so they discontinued treatment, but no unblinding was required. The adverse events were: asthma symptoms (Active), nettle rash (Placebo) and disruptive behavior (Active). The parent of one child in the Active group reported hair loss 6 weeks after completing the study.</p><sec id="s3i1"><title>Reported side effects</title><p>No group differences were found for 16 of the 17 potential side effects assessed by the Barkley scale. However, children in the Placebo group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;146) were reported to have more insomnia or trouble sleeping than those taking the Active supplement (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;140). Means (sds) for this item were 1.4 (2.2) and 1.0 (2.0) respectively (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003c;0.03).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Compliance</title><p>Counts of capsules returned by schools indicated mean compliance of approximately 75% and this did not differ between Active (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;138) and Placebo groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;157). (From 200 capsules allocated to schools for each child, quantities returned were: Active mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50.0, sd&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;51.8) and Placebo Mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42.0, sd&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39.5). Of the 50 capsules allocated to parents for non-school days, more than 50% of data were missing and so these are not reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation for 16 weeks with 600 mg/day of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA or placebo in 362 healthy school children mainly aged 7&#x02013;9 years who were initially underperforming in reading (&#x02264;33<sup>rd</sup> centile). Our primary outcomes were reading, working memory, and behavior (ADHD-type symptoms) as rated by both parents and teachers, all of which are known to be important for children's future educational and occupational achievement.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>(a) Reading</title><p>The effects of DHA on children's reading progress were found to vary with their initial reading performance. No treatment effect was found in the sample as a whole (selected for initial reading &#x02264;33<sup>rd</sup> centile). However, small but significant benefits from DHA supplementation were seen in the 224 children whose initial reading performance was &#x02264;20<sup>th</sup> centile, (the target population in our original study design), and these benefits were more pronounced in those children whose initial reading performance was &#x02264;10<sup>th</sup> centile.</p><p>The practical implications of these findings are best illustrated by the reading age scores (derived from the same data as the age-standardized reading scores, and shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043909-t005">Table 5</xref>). In children with initial reading performance &#x02264;20<sup>th</sup> centile, active treatment was associated with an <italic>additional</italic> 0.8 months mean increase in reading age change scores compared with placebo, while in those initially reading &#x02264;10<sup>th</sup> centile, the <italic>additional</italic> reading age gain from treatment was 1.9 months. As reading ages would typically be expected to increase by 4 months over the 16-week treatment period, this means that the gains from DHA supplementation in these sub-groups of poorer readers were around 20% and 50% greater, respectively, than would normally be expected, helping these children to catch up with their peer group.</p><p>Only two previous studies of omega-3 supplementation in UK children have involved reading as an outcome measure. In an unselected sample of typically developing children aged 8&#x02013;10 years who were reading normally for their age, no treatment effects were found <xref rid="pone.0043909-Kirby1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. By contrast, highly significant benefits were found in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder, whose reading performance was initially well below the level expected for their age <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our results are broadly compatible with both these findings, in that we only found benefits for reading in those children whose initial performance was at or below the 20<sup>th</sup> centile. Recently, a small study from Australia found no overall treatment effect of omega-3 on reading, although this trial was small and underpowered, and involved children selected for ADHD symptoms <xref rid="pone.0043909-Milte1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Significant correlations were found, however, between increases in blood DHA and improvements in reading; and these associations were more pronounced in the subgroup who also had reading difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>(b) Working Memory</title><p>Group differences did not reach significance for the primary outcome of change scores on the working memory measures (Recall of Digits Forward and Backward), although the mean scores post-intervention for children receiving DHA were significantly higher on Recall of Digits Forward (tapping auditory sequential verbal memory).</p><p>The children in this study were not selected for working memory problems, but their initial scores on these measures were found to be 0.5&#x02013;1 sd below population norms (consistent with the importance of working memory in the development of reading skills). Thus there was some room for improvement on these measures in our sample. This was not the case in the only other RCT of mainstream schoolchildren to investigate omega-3 for working memory, which found no effects of supplementation using similar measures <xref rid="pone.0043909-Kirby1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the present study, the subgroup analyses suggested that any improvements in working memory might be greater in children with poorer initial reading performance, but further studies would be need to explore this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>(c) Behavior</title><p>Parent ratings of the children's behavior showed significant reductions on most symptom scales at the 16-week follow-up, i.e. there was a significant placebo effect. Despite this, the ITT analyses showed significant effects of DHA over placebo for the sample as a whole on 8 of the 14 scales, assessing a range of ADHD-type symptoms. These included sub-scales assessing hyperactivity and oppositional behaviour, and global scales tapping emotional lability (mood swings) and restless-impulsive behaviour as well as total ADHD-type symptoms. These findings are in keeping with those from previous trials of omega-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in children with various developmental disorders of behavior and learning <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Sinn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> it is notable that similar effects were found here in normal healthy children, even though their behavioral problems pre-treatment were within the normal population range.</p><p>By contrast, teachers' ratings of the children's behavior showed minimal changes during the 16-week treatment period, and no differences between treatment groups. Disparities between teacher and parent ratings of child behavior are extremely common (which is why a formal clinical diagnosis of ADHD requires consistency across different settings). It is perhaps unsurprising that parents might be more sensitive than teachers or other professionals to any changes in their child's behavior over a short intervention period, as this has been found in controlled studies of other nutritional interventions for child behaviour <xref rid="pone.0043909-Schab1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> as well as in other trials of omega-3 supplementation <xref rid="pone.0043909-Sinn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, teacher ratings have proved sensitive to behavioral change in some of the previous studies of omega-3 for ADHD-type symptoms in children <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Kirby1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>It is possible that missing data from parent ratings in our current study could have introduced an element of positive bias, but we think this unlikely. The findings are in line with the accumulating evidence that supplementation with omega-3 is of modest benefit in reducing ADHD-type symptoms in children <xref rid="pone.0043909-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043909-Richardson4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. They also broaden this evidence from clinical groups with varying types of developmental disorders, and other children whose behavioral problems are above average, to healthy children whose behavioral problems fall within the normal population range.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The context in which this trial was carried out was mainstream UK schools, where the influence of the researchers was low and contact with parents was indirect and minimal, whereas most previous trials have involved children with specific behavioral and/or learning difficulties recruited either from clinics or from direct advertisement to parents. This classifies it as an &#x0201c;effectiveness&#x0201d; - i.e. &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; study - rather than an &#x0201c;efficacy&#x0201d; study, and provides reasonable grounds to trust the generalizability of these data to other mainstream school populations, albeit with some caveats.</p><p>Generalizability to <italic>all</italic> children aged 7&#x02013;9 years attending mainstream UK schools is clearly limited, as our sample was pre-selected for underperformance in reading. In terms of socioeconomic status, the children in this study were fairly representative of the general population of England, as the percentage receiving free school meals was comparable to national figures (20.2% vs 18.6%). However, ethnic minorities were under-represented (91.2% were white, compared with 77.7% nationally), primarily because our study required that children use English as their first language at home. The percentage of boys was also slightly elevated (53% vs 51% nationally), reflecting the fact that in this age range, boys are typically more likely than girls to be underperforming in reading.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for Research and Practice</title><p>Various implementation issues concerning dose and formulation, delivery and uptake may have a bearing on these results and therefore merit brief consideration.</p><p>The dose we selected (600 mg/day) was comparable to those used in most other trials of long-chain omega-3 for child behavior and/or learning to date <xref rid="pone.0043909-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and only slightly higher than the intake of 500 mg/day recommended for general cardiovascular health in adults by leading scientists in the field <xref rid="pone.0043909-International1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Higher doses might possibly yield more substantial treatment effects, but this would need to be investigated via systematic dose-ranging studies, because intakes of individual nutrients may not relate in any simple linear fashion to health or performance outcomes <xref rid="pone.0043909-Verkerk1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>The formulation we used provided only DHA, whereas most previous studies have used varying combinations of DHA, EPA and sometimes other fatty acids. A recent meta-analysis found that treatment effects on ADHD-type symptoms increased with the proportion of EPA (and thus decreased with the proportion of DHA) in the supplements used <xref rid="pone.0043909-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This analysis was based on only 10 small and highly heterogeneous trials, however, and direct comparisons would be needed to evaluate the relative merits of different formulations with any degree of certainty.</p><p>The efficiency of delivery and uptake can also influence results in any intervention study. The supplements were provided to children on school days by a range of different staff at the 74 schools involved. Counts of capsules returned from schools suggested that satisfactory compliance with the treatment was achieved in these settings, but these data were not complete. Similarly, the parents who gave the children their supplies during weekends and other non-school days will have varied in their motivation and adherence to the treatment schedule; compliance data here were unfortunately impossible to obtain, in line with other studies.</p><p>This study provides the first evidence that dietary supplementation with the omega-3 DHA might improve both the behavior and the learning of healthy children from the general school population. The supplement was found to be safe and well tolerated, as expected. The benefits we found for reading were only evident amongst those children whose initial reading performance fell within the lowest 20% of the normal distribution, suggesting that for this particular outcome measure, DHA supplementation should be regarded as a targeted intervention for the poorest readers rather than a universal one. For behavior, however, it is possible that the benefits may have broader applicability, as reductions in parents' ratings of ADHD-type symptoms were evident across the entire sample studied here, despite the relatively mild nature of these children's initial behavior problems. The current results thus extend the previous findings in this area from clinically-defined groups to healthy but underperforming children from the general school population, and suggest that dietary deficiencies of DHA might have subtle behavioral effects on children in general, as has been shown for some combinations of artificial food additives <xref rid="pone.0043909-McCann1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Dietary intakes of long-chain omega-3 in modern western-type diets are widely acknowledged to be sub-optimal, both for general physical health and for mental health and performance <xref rid="pone.0043909-Hibbeln1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Similarly, the importance of early intervention for behavior and literacy problems in children is widely acknowledged to be more effective and less costly than interventions later in life, by which time such problems can become compounded and the life chances of these children further compromised <xref rid="pone.0043909-Heckman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These findings clearly require replication, but we suggest that future studies should adopt a similar focus on the most vulnerable groups within the general population, ideally using additional measures to assess the relative costs and benefits of this kind of dietary supplementation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043909.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
