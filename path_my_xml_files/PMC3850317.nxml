Psychosocial interventions are known to not only prevent and lessen various mental problems,

groups, experimental (n=33)and control (n=32). The experimental group received spiritual group
psychotherapy counseling for 12 sessions, 2 hours per week for a 3 months period. The control
group did not receive any intervention, but due to ethical considerations, we gave a presentation (one
session) about infertility treatment for this group after the research process was completed. We used

couples experience infertility. Infertility is a stressful
event that can give rise to psychological difficulties.
This problem affects multiple areas of
life, including physical, emotional, financial, social,
and psychological (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A common theme in
explaining the stressful impact of infertility is that
it represents a life-crisis, and perhaps due to this
reason people experience grief reactions similar to
those experienced with bereavement (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Wischmann explained that women who have
experienced infertility face psychological disturbances,
including low self-esteem and other mental health problems. For this reason counseling
and psychological intervention could help them
achieve a healthy, high quality of life (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that the anxiety and depression
associated with infertility are similar to those associated
with other serious medical conditions such as
cancers and infection with human immunodeficiency
virus (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Other studies have stressed that psychosocial
elements, including dysfunctional coping strategies
for stress, anxiety and depression may possibly
lower one&#x02019;s chances of becoming pregnan (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the number of clients who seek infertility
treatments is increasing because of women&#x02019;s
interests in delaying pregnancy and their increased
awareness about infertility treatment. Couples who
are aware of the effects of psychosocial treatment
on increasing the chances of pregnancy are quite
motivated to participate in counseling and psychotherapy
sessions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Psychosocial interventions are known to not only
prevent and lessen various mental problems such as
anxiety, depression, and phobias, but also to play a
positive role in physical health and achieving pregnancy
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Psychosocial counseling as an intervention
strategy has a dramatically effect when given
prior to the onset of infertility treatment. These interventions
could increase couples outlooks and guide
them to succeed in achieving pregnancies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) .</p><p>Humans are more susceptible to a variety of illnesses
when they suffer from feelings of meaninglessness
or existential frustration. &#x02018;&#x02018;It has been considered
that some form of the meaning of life does
exist for individuals, although it has to be discovered,
and that the meaning of life for an individual
can neither be given nor created, it has to be found
or discovered&#x02019;&#x02019; (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Infertility can create a sense of
meaninglessness and lack of feeling in spouses. Numerous
psychological and counseling methods and
theories that could be applicable for infertility exist,
however one of the most influential is logotherapy.</p><p>Logotherapy is an existential psychotherapy that
can be used with patients who have psychological
and mental disorders. The center of logotherapy is
self-transcendence, a pathway that increases the
sense of purpose, which in turn enhances the sense
of well-being and the ability to cope with suffering
and stress. This approach is based on the assumption
that fulfillment in life is the best protection
people from emotional instability (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Logotherapy assists those who suffer from mental
disorders, neuroticism, or psychopathic problems
and enables individuals to break through their
high expectations and disappointments (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Frankl created logotherapy, which came from his
life experiences. He has stated that human beings
search for the meaning of life and they are motivated
to discover and elaborate on that meaning.
According to Frankl human existence has three
components: soma, psychological, and spiritual.
These aspects comprise the &#x0201c;self&#x0201d; and they are related
to each other. Frankl suggested that" the most
difficult psychological issue facing modern people
is existential emptiness due to a lack of meaning in
life, and developed logotherapy to overcome this
most challenging hurdle" (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Meaning in life is described as an important goal
that adds purpose to life. It is a powerful forcein
humans and is taken into consideration in logotherapy
treatments. Logotherapy includes the following
techniques of paradoxical intention: dereflection,
hyper-reflection, attitude modification,
Socrates talks, and self-transcendence (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>According to Farankel the process of analyzing
the meaning of life follows a few fundamental philosophical
elements that include: i. life has meaning,
ii. We derive motivation from this meaning, iii. we
have freedom to search for our own meaning and iv.
the components of human being self are-consists of
soma(physical), psyche, and truth (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>A human being does not consist of just somatic
health and environmental forces, but is free to take
a stand toward inner conditions and outer circumstances
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Health services could be considered as
possible sources of the relationship between mental
and physical health. Kang and Kim developed a
logotherapy intervention and investigated how this
program affected patients with end-stage cancer in
terms of their suffering, meaning in life, and spiritual
well-being. This study has proposed that logotherapy
can be a useful program for patients with terminal
cancerin addition to decreasing distress and improving
quality of life (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Many studies place emphasis
on logotherapy as an important approach to chronic
diseases. One of the studies has researched the effect
of this approach on adolescents with cancerand
identified emotional care as a necessity for optimizing the care for young cancer patients (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Infertile
people suffer greatly due to their condition.
&#x0201c;People who faced a problem of one or more in normal
or usual physiological, psychological, social,
and/or spiritual functioning they might try to finding
the meaning among their suffers&#x02019;&#x02019;(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). No previous
study has examined the effectiveness of logotherapy
for infertile individuals.The aim of this study is the
unique impact of group logotherapy on the concerns
of infertility and its perceived stress, defined as both
suffering and psychological stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial that included
all infertile couples who attended the Maternity
and Gynecological Clinic at Jahrom University
of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran. Infertility was
defined as at least one year of unprotected coitus
without conception. Among 800 women or couples,
80 met the following inclusion criteria: history of primary
infertility, no somatic or psychiatric problems,
residents of Jahrom, between 20-40 years of age, had
a personal mobile phone, were literate, and expressed
interest in participating in regular group meetings.
At the onset of the study, we enrolled the 80 females
who met the inclusion criteria.</p><p>Study participants were randomly divided into
two groups (experimental and control) according to
their file numbers. During the first two sessions, 15
people were absent or did not complete the questionnaire
in its entirety and therefore they were excluded.
The duration of the study was conducted
with 65 participants, 33 in the experimental group
and 32 in the control group who regularly attended
the meetings after the end of study. Participants in
the experimental group received group logo therapy
for 12 weekly sessions. All participants elaborated
on their own positive meaningful messages in the
sessions, and a brief summary of each session was
sent to each person at the end of every two sessions
in order to achieve maximum performance. The
control group did not receive any intervention, but
due to ethical considerations, we gave a presentation
(one session) about infertility treatment for this
group after the research process was completed.
Participant consent was acquired and the research
project was approved by the Ethics Committee at
Jahrom University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>The logotherapy educational program is an intervention
program. The executive package has
been used by various researchers in both chronic
and severe diseases (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The main objective of the
sessions according to previous research was considered
and then adjusted to meet the objectives of
the current study.</p><sec><title>Objectives of the sessions</title><p>The objectives of the sessions are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Identify the goals and rules of the meeting, the
familiarity of members with each other, and the
expression of the meaning of life, which are steps
that aim to create trust within the group and promote
group dynamics (1 session).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gather information from patients' characteristics
and capabilities as the center of self-consciousness
and reflection into anxiety-related factors and determining

helping charities, organ donation, etc.) (1 session).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understanding the empirical values of the meaning
of life and its value in addressing nature, the
deepening of life through interaction with nature, and
pursuing art. (Seeing the beauty that exists in nature
and art to coping with -the - challenges) (1 session).</p></list-item></list><p>In one session, we have included trend values
that discuss situations where people are powerless
to deal with and are forced to accept that situation (i.e., living without a child).</p><p>Data were gathered from two questionnaires, the
PSWQ and the PSS. The PSWQ investigates clinical
and non-clinical groups of adults and consists of
16Likert items. This questionnaire has excellent internal
consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent
and discriminative validities. In a clinical group
study by Brown et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the PSWQ displayed high
reliability and validity. The PSWQ has been previously
normalized to the Iranian society (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The PSS is a 14 item self-report questionnaire
that measures a person's evaluation of the stressfulness
of situations during the past month of their
lives. This questionnaire is the most widely used
psychological tool for measuring the perception of
stress.&#x02018;&#x02018;It is a measure of the degree to which situations
in one&#x02019;s life are appraised as stressful. Items
were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable,
and overloaded respondents find their lives.
The scale also includes a number of direct queries
about current levels of experienced stress&#x02019;&#x02019;. Subjects
responses are measured on a five-point scale,
0 (never), 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (fairly
often), and 4 (very often). This self-report test
is from Cohen et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), who have established its
reliability and validity (r=0.85) and internal reliability
in American (r=0.60) and Iranian (r=0.81)
populations. These tests have been used by numerous
Iranian researchers, and have been normalized
in the Iranian community (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We used descriptive
analysis as a frequency and percentage
of data distribution; analytic statistics was used
as the paired t-test and student t test compared the
mean of data within a group and between groups.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) compared the
significant mean of data in the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The current study included 33 infertile women in

group reported decreased worry and stress perception.
The relationship between logotherapy
and medicine has been the focus of considerable
interest in recent years. Studies have suggested
that many patients believe spirituality
plays an important role in their lives, that there
is a positive correlation between one's spirituality
and health outcomes, and that patients would
like physicians to consider these factors in their
medical care (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Logotherapy is an educational program to activate
comprehensive human critical power. This
process stimulates and activates human brain
function (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). One study has described the use
of logotherapy (healing through meaning) for the
treatment of combat-related post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). This study showed that logotherapy
offers the combat veteran who struggled with
existential issues hope for the "meaning of life".
This study has also emphasized that, when veterans
express higher levels of fulfillment, they were
more accepting of stress and life events, and less
deterred by their symptoms (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Recent results have also shown that this approach
decreases worry from infertility symptoms. Others
have studied the impact of this approach on treatment
of serious diseases. Logotherapy, according
to one study, was an effective approach that supported
adolescent cancer patients to find meaning
in their lives and successfully reduced their suffering.
As spiritual intervention in a medical center,
logotherapy has demonstrated effective promotion
of the quality of life and prevented hopelessness
caused by illness for patients under somatic
stressful events (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Research has confirmed the
psychological impacts of logotherapy on chronic
diseases. Another study on non-clinical patients
by Lee has shown that the experimental group had
a significant difference in their meaning of life
and ego integrity compared to the control group.
Therefore, logotherapy can be recommended as an
effective approach for adolescents, adults and the
ageing population (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). According to research, clinicians
can facilitate healing by helping their patients
find meaning in their illness (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>It has been argued by Koenig et al. that meaning
of life is purely a measure of emotional well-being
(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Finding the meaning in life is strongly correlated
with functional well-being (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>&#x02018;&#x02018;Spirituality intervention plays in the patient&#x02019;s
ability to cope with the illness. Although the spirituality
may be a source of support but in some
cases may be a source of emotional turmoil and
stress&#x02019;&#x02019;(<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In one of study, 90% of women with
spontaneous premature ovarian failure reported
that spiritual intervention played an important role
in helping them adjust to the emotional response
to the infertility diagnosis and invasive procedures
(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Numerous evidence support the positive
impact of logotherapy on patients&#x02019; psychological
symptoms.</p><p>One study of group logotherapy on life expectation
in cancer patients has shown that this therapy
increased life expectation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Another has indicated
that the logotherapy approach could be a
useful, vital approach for reducing psychological
disturbance in people who suffer from chronic
physical illnesses (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Other research in patients
undergoing peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis
has aimed to investigate the personal abilities of
self-distancing, self-transcendence, freedom, and
responsibility in dialysis patients compared toa
control group. The results have indicated that logotherapy
caused improvements in daily activities
among people who had dialysis treatment (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>As with our results, evidence has confirmed the
positive impact of other approaches, specific stress
management intervention, and group therapy on
the mental health of infertile couples and other important
effects of these approaches on pregnancy
rates (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have stated that group therapy and
other approaches did not improve pregnancy rates,
but rather they noted decreased rates of depression
and anxiety (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Psychological interventions can be used as appropriate
methods for infertile women who are
not undergoing medical treatment (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Stress
management techniques should be offered to patients
before, during, and after they undergo assisted
conception treatments (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Some studies
agree with recent results that confirm the impact
of group therapy in decreasing stress, depression,
and anxiety in infertile women (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Studies have
shown that psychological intervention can often
help in reducing stress, but they rarely increase
the rate of pregnancy (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The findings of the
present study regarding the impact of logotherapy
on reduce worry and perceived stress on infertile
women (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Logotherapy can be a sufficient method to reduce
stress, worries, and other symptoms. This approach
may of benefit for infertile couples' mental
health. Thus, it can be concluded that logotherapy and attention to the spiritual aspect of patients who
suffer from infertility may be a sufficient intervention
during all stages of the infertility treatment.
Further research is needed to understand whether
other psychological approaches have the same
consequences on infertility.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Research Department
