The primary objective was to demonstrate that clinically significant hypoglycemia (blood glucose &#x02264;54&#x02009;mg/dL [3.0&#x02009;mmol/L] or symptoms of severe hypoglycemia) occurred less frequently within 84&#x02009;h after a double dose (DD) of BIL than a DD of GL.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This was a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) previously treated with insulin (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68).

Then, during a 7-day inpatient stay with frequent blood glucose monitoring and standardized meals, one DD of study insulin was given.

There are no published data on the frequency of double dosing errors in particular, but recent publications have documented other types of insulin-related dosing errors that occur frequently in patients with diabetes, such as not eating soon enough after dosing or mixing up insulin products.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The consequences of any insulin dosing error can be severe: overdose of insulin can induce complications of hypoglycemia, including nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and death.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>In cases of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, hepatic glucose production is reduced, while glucose uptake is stimulated. This study defined hypoglycemia events in a manner consistent with American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) standards<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, focusing primarily on documented symptomatic events. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a hypoglycemic episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. In alignment with a very recent article in <italic>Diabetes Care</italic> (position article of ADA)<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, events with blood glucose (BG) &#x0003c;54&#x02009;mg/dL (3.0&#x02009;mmol/L) were labeled as &#x0201c;clinically significant.&#x0201d; Events with BG &#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dL (3.9&#x02009;mmol/L) were also analyzed in this study.</p><p>Counter-regulatory responses are triggered when BG is low and result in release of glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone. Acute recovery depends on the effects of glucagon and epinephrine to stimulate hepatic glucose release, while no counter-regulation acutely mitigates the increase in glucose disposal.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, excess peripherally-acting insulin may not be countered, whereas the hepatic effects can be mitigated through stimulation of glucagon and epinephrine secretion, suggesting a potential benefit of a hepato-preferential insulin. Hypoglycemia recovery has been reported to be normal with basal insulin peglispro (BIL) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>BIL is distinguished from existing basal insulins such as insulin glargine (GL) by a peripheral-to-hepatic distribution that is more like endogenous insulin.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> BIL has a prolonged duration of action with a flat pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile at steady state.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> These characteristics may help minimize hypoglycemia risk versus GL even in circumstances like dosing errors leading to administration of a DD. BIL was extensively studied in phase III (in patients with T1D or T2D) and showed superior efficacy with less glucose variability and less nocturnal hypoglycemia than GL.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref></sup> BIL is a full insulin agonist, but, like some analogs, has reduced potency, resulting in higher concentrations to compensate.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>This study simulated an inadvertent DD administration of long-acting insulins, evaluating the safety of a DD of BIL versus a DD of GL in patients with reasonably well-controlled T2D. The analyses tested the hypothesis that BIL, with its flatter PK/PD profile, might be beneficial in avoiding hypoglycemia in the case of insulin overdose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="s002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind two-period crossover study in patients with T2D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; Supplementary Data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.liebertpub.com/dia">www.liebertpub.com/dia</uri>).

In this double-blind randomized study of hypoglycemic safety in insulin-treated patients with T2D, a significantly smaller proportion of BIL-treated patients had hypoglycemia (clinically significant [with BG &#x02264;54&#x02009;mg/dL (3.0&#x02009;mmol/L)] or with BG &#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dL [3.9&#x02009;mmol/L]) compared to GL-treated patients when carefully monitored for up to 84&#x02009;h following a DD. Fewer episodes of hypoglycemia during the 12&#x02009;h immediately following a DD of BIL would be expected to reduce the number of emergency room visits or urgent interventions required during the night for patients at home, a clinically important benefit.</p><p>The pharmacologic properties of BIL are felt to be responsible for the lower incidences of hypoglycemia observed in comparison to GL during this study. The long half-lives of these basal insulins may intuitively predict prolonged durations of effects, especially if larger-than-usual doses are administered. However, at steady-state conditions, the insulin concentrations in the body are expected to fluctuate minimally; therefore, it is notable that a surprising difference in incidence of hypoglycemia was observed even after administration of a standard dose of study drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that while the incidence of total hypoglycemia after the DD of BIL was increased compared to the relatively low incidence after a standard dose, the absolute incidence remained lower than that with GL for the 3 days following the DD. The relative increases in hypoglycemia after the DD were consistent with increased insulin concentrations, although the magnitude of the changes in insulin concentrations did not fully explain the increases in hypoglycemia. We hypothesize that the advantage in the observed incidence of hypoglycemia with BIL compared to GL, both before and after a DD, may have been due to the BIL mechanism of action of reduced peripheral action.</p><p>The primary difference observed between the study insulins was that after a DD, both the concentrations and glucose effects of BIL marginally fluctuated, whereas GL concentrations doubled. A crossover euglycemic clamp study of BIL versus GL in patients with T1D demonstrated that the suppression of glucose production by the liver is similar at equipotent doses of BIL and GL, but a markedly lower glucose disposal rate occurs following BIL.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>The hepato-preferential activity of BIL may explain the lower occurrence of hypoglycemia with BIL versus GL following the DD. Insulin concentrations following the DD peaked more quickly with GL than with BIL and were elevated for up to 2 days with GL and up to 3 days with BIL following a DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The serum concentrations, as well as the incidences of hypoglycemia within the first 3 days following the DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), were consistent with the known profiles of the study insulins. The 84-h observation period was thereby sufficient to assess hypoglycemic risks.</p><p>Medication errors occur frequently in insulin-treated patients with T2D,<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and patients with diabetes who receive insulin are frequently hospitalized for a variety of reasons, which may include dosing errors.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The general incidence of patients affected by inadvertent insulin dosing errors is unknown, but one study found increasing incidences of unintentional insulin dosing errors that were attributed primarily to the rapidly rising prevalence of T2D and the growing use of insulin among these patients.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The fact that patients with T2D tend to have relatively poor compliance with medications over the long term,<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> as well as the possibility that patients may misdose insulin, may affect a clinician's approach to insulin therapy for individual patients with T2D.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Our study was reflective of patients accidentally taking an extra dose of long-acting insulin during their usual course of care. The use of inpatient hospital stays ensured patient safety under study conditions intended to mimic accidental DD administration. We believe that the inpatient setting was also less confounded by the variability introduced in ambulatory settings, such as meal delays, skipped meals, or increased physical activity, each of which would independently contribute to the incidence of hypoglycemia.</p><p>Koehler et al. reported on insulin overdoses in patients with T1D under continued fasting and hypoglycemic clamp conditions.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In contrast, our design incorporated standardized meals, more closely replicating everyday life for patients with T2D. By maintaining patients on once-daily insulin regimens before and after the DD, we simulated patients unknowingly misdosing. Safety precautions were sustained through protocol-mandated intervention to prevent glucose levels below 54&#x02009;mg/dL (3.0&#x02009;mmol/L).</p><p>Because the insulin doses were fixed for each patient, glucose levels could not be targeted, resulting in an imbalance between the treatment groups in FBG preceding administration of the DD. However, correcting for this imbalance in post-hoc analyses did not change the conclusions of the analyses of hypoglycemia. Due to the very long half-life of BIL, the inpatient periods allowed patients to be observed following the DD for up to 2 days after Tmax,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but not until BIL concentrations returned to pre-DD levels (&#x0223c;1 week). On inpatient day 5, which was 2 days after the DD, BIL concentrations remained elevated compared to those measured after standard doses, while GL concentrations had returned to those measured after standard doses; despite this, the incidence of hypoglycemia (BG &#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dL [3.9&#x02009;mmol/L]) with BIL was lower than with GL.</p><p>While mean 24-h glucose profiles by treatment group would have been informative, data collected during individualized inpatient glucose monitoring prevented investigation of differences between the treatment groups. Finally, patients with T1D are more likely to adjust eating patterns and prandial insulin dosages than are patients with T2D. Hence, in patients with T1D, the analyses of the basal insulins would be confounded by these interventions, and because our study was conducted in patients with T2D, the findings may not be applicable in patients with T1D.</p><p>Based on these study results, we believe that among patients with T2D accidentally administered an extra dose of basal insulin, the incidence of clinically significant hypoglycemia would be significantly lower with BIL than with GL. These findings are likely attributable to the prolonged, flat PK/PD profile and/or the reduced peripheral activity of BIL compared with GL. Our data also suggest that if an extra dose of basal insulin is administered, BG monitoring should be extended through the second night after dosing with GL and at least through the third night after dosing with BIL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Fig1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1117" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Fig2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1122" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1127" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Fig3.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1132" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1137" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table3.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1142" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s013" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of Mary Re (inVentiv Health Clinical, Ann Arbor, MI) for writing support.</p><p>From Profil, Mainz, Germany, the authors acknowledge the contributions of Stephan Diessel, Ernestos Anastassiadis, Johannes Jahnke, and Christine Hess Labs.
