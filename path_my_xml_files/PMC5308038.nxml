HoLEP introduced by Gilling <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and seems to be an attractive alternative to standard TURP, because of its shallow penetration, excellent hemostatic property, and can be applied to prostate irrespective of size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized study performed in the Department of Urology, King George's Medical University, India, after obtaining institutional review board approval from August 2012 to July 2015. Informed written consent was taken from all included patients. A total of 164 patients were randomized either into HoLEP or TURP using computer-generated randomization table. Inclusion criteria were age younger than 75 years after failed or poor response to medical therapy, Qmax &#x0003c;15 ml/s, prostatic size of more than 60 g, gross hematuria secondary to BPH, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), acute urinary retention, postvoid residual (PVR) more than 150 ml, and Schafer Grade II or more in pressure flow study. Exclusion criteria were patients of BPH with associated neurogenic bladder, stricture urethra, and carcinoma prostate, or previous history of intervention. Group 1 comprises patients who underwent TURP and Group 2 comprises who underwent HoLEP. Data include duration and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms, including the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF5) questionnaire, prostate volume, and serum prostate-specific antigen. All men underwent preoperative hematological and biochemical workup. A urine sample was also sent for routine examination and culture sensitivity. Men with UTI were treated with appropriate antibiotics preoperatively. Transrectal ultrasound was performed to assess the size of prostate by a single well-experienced radiologist, and renal ultrasound was done for the evaluation of upper tracts. The urodynamic study was performed in all included patients for the study purpose. All patients were underwent TURP and HoLEP with the standard technique.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Follow-up was done at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), PVR, Qmax (ml/s), were assessed as the primary outcome and sexual function score and complication as a secondary outcome. The urodynamic study was performed at 6 month follow-up.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>All procedures were performed under spinal/general anesthesia. HoLEP performed by end firing holmium laser fiber (550 &#x000b5;m, versa power suit) with power setting (2 J at 40&#x02013;50 Hz, 80&#x02013;100 W). A 26 F continuous flow resectoscope was used the standard 3 lobe technique (median lobe resected first followed by lateral lobes). Endoscopic morcellation of enucleated lobes was performed with the help of morcellator (VersaCut tissue morcellator, swivel technique). After achieving hemostasis, cystoscopy was done to assess the integrity of bladder. During the procedure, 0.9% normal saline solution was used as irrigant. TURP was performed with a tungsten cutting wire loop with settings, current 160 W, and coagulations at 80 W (Mauermayer technique) with glycine as irrigating fluid. Postoperatively, bladder irrigation was done until hematuria settled sufficiently.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics, pre- and post-operative parameters were compared in two groups.

According to the latest AUA guideline, TURP is considered as the gold standard procedure for the management of BPH. In the last two decades, lasers have been included in the urological armamentarium for the management of BPH. HoLEP is now accepted and recommended internationally as a minimally invasive alternative to TURP (level 1 evidence),[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] because of its shallow penetration, low morbidity, low blood transfusion rate, short hospital stay, suitable for patients on anticoagulants, and can be applied to wide range of prostate size.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] HoLEP has been shown to be as effective as open surgery in generating cavity, since the tip of the fiber mimics that of the surgeon's index finger during OP.</p><p>Many studies reported HoLEP better postoperative and perioperative results (Qmax, IPSS, PVR) with lower complication rates.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There are some studies reported a significant difference in operating time between HoLEP and TURP, favoring TURP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In this study, we also observed statistically significant difference in operating time between TURP and HoLEP (73.10 &#x000b1; 10.49 and 89.56 &#x000b1; 13.81 min respectively) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). It seems reasonable due to additional time required for morcellation. In a recently conducted meta-analysis, it has been shown that HoLEP required more time than TURP, mean difference was 15.9 min.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, some studies in English literature reported that with increasing prostate volume tissue ablation by HoLEP become more effective than by TURP leading to shorter operating time for HoLEP and also with the increasing number of HoLEP procedure performed.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Similarly, significantly more irrigation fluids required for HoLEP as compared to TURP, 33.27 &#x000b1; 7.77 versus 40.08 &#x000b1; 8.83 L, respectively, (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). This is directly related to the length of operation, wherein longer the operating time more irrigant is used. Gupta <italic>et al</italic>. reported significantly more resection of prostatic tissue in HoLEP procedure as compared to TURP.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a similar study, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. also observed similar finding. In this study, we also found more tissue resected in HoLEP group than TURP, which is in accordance with the studies reported earlier. Some trials reported the reduction of hemoglobin level but did not observed statistically significant difference between TURP and HoLEP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Rebecca <italic>et al</italic>. observed that rates of perioperative and postoperative blood transfusion were comparatively low in HoLEP as compared to TURP. Similarly, in this study, we also observed more drop of hemoglobin level in TURP group but this observation was statistically insignificant. However, 3 (4.1%) patients in TURP group required blood transfusion in postoperative period due to drop in hemoglobin level below 8 g/dl. None of the patients in HoLEP group required blood transfusion. This might be due to the excellent hemostatic property of holmium laser.</p><p>Gilling <italic>et al</italic>. observed longer duration of postoperative irrigation in TURP group as compared to HoLEP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Das <italic>et al</italic>. another study reported a similar observation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study, we also observed the same finding (12.20 &#x000b1; 3.38 h in TURP vs. 8.40 &#x000b1; 2.29 h in HoLEP, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001).</p><p>Gilling <italic>et al</italic>. observed shorter postoperative catheterization duration in HoLEP as compared to TURP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Tan <italic>et al</italic>. also reported shorter postoperative catheterization duration in HoLEP group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Similarly, in this study, we also observed shorter duration of catheterization postoperatively in HoLEP group when compared to TURP group (48.06 &#x000b1; 13.36 h vs. 30.9 &#x000b1; 5.49, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). This might be due to less blood loss in HoLEP group as the duration of catheterization may be a surrogate indicator of blood loss. Kuntz <italic>et al</italic>. did not observed any statistically significant difference in serum sodium level between TURP and HoLEP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, this is in contrast to our study; wherein we observed statistically significant difference in reduction of serum sodium level between both groups (2.61 &#x000b1; 3.51 vs. 0.8 &#x000b1; 1.77 mmol/L, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) but none of the patients developed clinical hyponatremia. None of the patients in our study had any major complication related to procedures such as subtrigonal dissection, capsular perforation, and TUR syndrome. Many trails reported shorter hospital stay in HoLEP group as compared to TURP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We also observed statistically significant shorter hospital stay in HoLEP group (54.58 &#x000b1; 12.36 h vs. 41.81 &#x000b1; 9.17) <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001. This might be due to better hemostatic property, less postoperative irrigation, and duration of catheterization. Some studies reported no significant difference in IPSS score between TURP and HoLEP at 3 and 6 months, but they observed significant decrease in IPSS score at 12 months of follow-up and favoring HoLEP.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, in this study, we observed a significant difference in IPSS score in both modalities from baseline but did not observed any statistically significant difference in IPSS score until 24 months of follow-up. Some trials reported results which showed (random effect model) significant difference in Qmax between both the modalities and favoring HoLEP.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We also observed the difference in Qmax between TURP and HoLEP at all follows up and significantly at 12 months afterward. PVR also decreases in both groups significantly from baseline, but our results favor HoLEP although no statistically significant difference observed. Very few studies reported on postoperative urodynamic parameters. Gilling <italic>et al</italic>. in their study reported postoperative better urodynamic pattern favoring HoLEP (Schafer grade was 1 grade lower than TURP). Similar results were also reported by Tan <italic>et al</italic>. In this study, we did not observed any significant difference between TURP and HoLEP, which is in contrast to other studies reported earlier. However, urodynamic pattern improved significantly in both modalities from baseline at 6 months follow-up. There are trials which reported stress urinary incontinence and transient dysuria and showed no significant difference between HoLEP and TURP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We also observed stress urinary incontinence and transient dysuria more in HoLEP group, which was managed conservatively and resolved after 6 months of follow-up. This might be due to transient mild thermal injury to external urinary sphincter. Madersbacher and Marberger in a randomized study between TURP and other minimally invasive procedures for BPH reported mean stricture rate of 3.8% in TURP group.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Rassweiler <italic>et al</italic>. also reported 3.1&#x02013;5.6% stricture rate in TURP.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] We also observed 2.7% stricture rate in TURP group and none in HoLEP group. Data on sexual function after HoLEP and TURP are indeed lacking. Very few studies emphasize on sexual function after TURP and HoLEP. Briganti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] observed a slight postoperative nonsignificant increment in IIEF score and significantly higher retrograde ejaculation rate in each group. In our study, the sexual function score (IIEF5) remains unchanged postoperatively in either group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>HoLEP is associated with less blood loss, lower transfusion rates, and a shorter hospital stay in comparison to TURP.
