stimulation (TENS) of theTE5 (waiguan) and PC6 (neiguan) acupoints on cold-induced pain.
[Subjects and Methods] Forty-eight subjects were divided by convenience into three groups:
TENS with electrodes of 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> area, TENS with electrodes of area
15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and a placebo group. The study consisted of three phases: cold-induced
pain without electroanalgesia, cold-induced pain with electroanalgesia or placebo, and
cold-induced pain post-electroanalgesia or placebo. [Results] Acupuncture like TENS
increased the pain threshold latency during treatment (45.7 &#x000b1; 11.7s) compared to
pre-treatment (30.9 &#x000b1; 8.9s) in the TENS group with 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes. In the
TENS group with 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes, the pain threshold latency increased at
post-treatment (36.2 &#x000b1; 12.9s) compared to pre-treatment (25.5 &#x000b1; 7.4s). The placebo group
showed no significant changes. The group with 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes showed a
significantly higher pain threshold latency (45.7 &#x000b1; 11.7s) than the other two groups. At
post-treatment, the pain threshold latencies of both the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> (39.4 &#x000b1; 11.5s)
and 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> (36.2 &#x000b1; 12.9s) TENS group were higher than that of the placebo group
(22.4 &#x000b1; 7.4s). [Conclusion] Acupuncture like TENS applied to PC6 and TE5 acupoints
increased the pain threshold latency. The pain intensity was reduced by TENS with an
electrode area of 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>TENS</kwd><kwd>Acupoints</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the application of an electric
current through the skin to stimulate the nervous system. This type of electrical
stimulation activates spinal afferent pathways that connect to spinal gray matter of the
dorsal horn modulating sensory afferent traffic. The electric current stimulates the
underlying fibers producing painless paresthesias without causing damage to the skin<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Its application technique varies depending on several parameters and can be divided into
high frequency (&#x02265;50&#x02005;Hz) low intensity and low frequency (&#x02264;10&#x02005;Hz) high intensity TENS, both
of which are used to relieve both acute and chronic pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Acupuncture is also widely used in clinical settings for the relief of pain caused by lower
back injury, fibromyalgia, and headache disorders, among others. Uniting the technique of
acupuncture analgesia with electrotherapy, with certain modifications, has created
electroacupuncture which is used as a substitute for conventional acupuncture, and in cases
where clinical acupuncture alone has noeffect<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low frequency TENS is also called acupuncture like TENS, because it interacting with the
peripheral nervous system eliciting a pricking sensation, that is modulated by the frequency
of electrical stimulation, the current intensity and the pulse duration. To present this
kind of sensation, this type of TENS has started being used to stimulate acupoints. The
procedure differs from classical electroacupuncture, as it does not use needles, only
electrodes with a high intensity of the electrical current<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently, several terms are used to describe the transcutaneous
electrical stimulation of acupoint. For example: Acu-TENS (TENS applied to an acupoint) and
TEAS (transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation) that involves any electric current
applied to acupoints<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, two different areas of electrodes, 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>,
TE5 (Waiguan) and PC6 (Neiguan) acupoints. According to Chinese traditional medicine
stimulation of the TE5 acupoint is indicated for arthritis in the wrist and finger joints,
and that of the acupoint PC6 is indicated for pain in the forearm, carpal tunnel, and wrist,
median nerve palsy, and pain and contracture in the elbow and arm. This study analyzed
whether the areas of electrodes elicit different effects. When TENS is applied to acupoints
frequency of 10&#x02005;Hz with sufficient intensity to promote muscle jerks. The latency of the
pain threshold and its intensity in healthy subjects subjected to cold-induced pain was
measured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a single-blind, quasi-experimental study with a control and placebo. Forty-eight
subjects (convenience sample) were recruited from the Departmental Centres of the University
Federal of Pernambuco (UFPE). They were divided into three groups of 16 subjects, composed
of both sexes aged between 18 and 30&#x02005;years. The groups were formed by the allocation of the
subjects who were verbally invited to particpate and sent to the laboratory. All of the
participants provided their written informed consent. After reading and accepting the terms
of the study, subjects were allocated to three groups: the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group,
the 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group, and the placebo group. The subjects were allocated by
raffle in blocks of four to each group in succession. During the period of experimentation
subjects showed no pathological state in the region subjected to cold-induced pain, did not
use allopathic and/or homeopathic drugs, showed no intolerance or phobia at low
temperatures, and the female subjects, were not in a state of pre-menstrual tension or
menstrual flow. None of the subjects had prior knowledge of TENS.</p><p>All experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Electrothermy at the Department of
Physical Therapy of the Federal University of Pernambuco. The first experimental group (8
males and 8 females) was stimulated by acupuncture like TENS on the TE5 and PC6 acupoints
with 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes; the second experimental group (9 males and 7 females) was
also stimulated by acupuncture like TENS on the same acupoints with 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
electrodes; and the placebo group (10 females and 6 males) were told they were receiving
microcurrent stimulation of the deltoid muscle with a 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode. The study
received approval from the University Federal of Pernambuco&#x02019;s Research Ethical Committee,
under the registration of SISNEP FR-294607, CAAE-0315.0.172.000-9 based on resolution 466/12
National Health Council.</p><p>The experimental intervention consisted of three stages (six cycles) which were termed
pretreatment time (cycles 1 and 2), treatment time (cycles 3 and 4) and post treatment time
(cycles 5 and 6). Each cycle lasted ten minutes, making a total of one hour trial.</p><p>In the first cycle, subjects put their non-dominant hand in a container of warm water
(37&#x02005;&#x000b0;C) for five minutes. The temperature was maintained by an electrical water heater and
constant measurement by mercury thermometer INCOTERM-L 212/04. This procedure aimed to
equalize the temperature of the hand of all subjects before the procedure of cold-induced
pain.</p><p>After this, the hands were removed from the container and placed into another with icy
water 0&#x02013;2&#x000b0;C (control performed by the mercury thermometer INCOTERM-L 212/04). The time to
pain threshold from when the individuals put their hands into the icy water to the moment
when they expressed &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d; was measured in seconds by digital stopwatch (CRONOBIO SW2018).
The subjects were asked to keep their hands in cold water for thirty more seconds, during
this time (depending on the tolerance) they were asked to describe the painful sensation
using a visual analog scale (values from 0 to 10, where 0 corresponds to no pain and 10
refers to the maximum tolerable pain) to assess pain intensity. After this they were allowed
to take their hands out of the icy.</p><p>After a rest interval, that varied among the individuals, butwas short enough to complete
half the period of the last five minutes of the first cycle, the subjects again put their
hands for 5 minutes in warm water, beginning the second cycle, followed immersion in cold
water. Procedure was repeated, completing two cycles of cold-induced pain, with pretreatment
time, lasting twenty minutes.</p><p>In the third cycle after wiring for TENS, subjects again put their hands into the warm
water for five minutes, and then into the container with cold water. The time to the pain
threshold and pain intensity were measured, and the procedure was repeated for a fourth
cycle, twenty minutes of TENS application in total. Acupuncture-like TENS (10&#x02005;Hz) was
delivered with a balanced, asymmetrical, biphasic pulsed current (TENSYS ET9771 KLD) of 1&#x02005;ms
(millisecond) pulse duration, with sufficient intensity of electric current to cause muscle
jerks when placed over the TE5 and PC6 acupoints, located two from the wrist crease, on the
posterior and anterior forearm, respectively. To standardize electrical stimulation the
cathode was placed on the TE5 and the anode on the PC6 acupoints. The electrical stimulation
of acupuncture-like TENS was pervormed with 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
electrodes.</p><p>At the end of the treatment period, the subjects were subjected to two more cycles, the
fifth and sixth following the same method described above, to evaluate the effect of TENS
post-treatment (TENS off).</p><p>In the placebo group, subjects were subjected to the same procedure of the cold-induced
pain test (pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment), but the electrodes were placed on
the shoulder (without connection to any acupoint) on the belly of the anterior deltoid
muscle and the individuals were told that they were receiving a microcurrent treatment, in
which they would not feel any sensation. They were told that the microcurrent works with
very low intensities, was imperceptible, and had a painkilling effect. They were connected
to the first channel of the equipment, and the second channel was connected so that the
lights on the device certified that the current was supposedly operating. However, no form
of electrical stimulation was delivered to the site.</p><p>The data of the latency of the pain threshold are presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation (SD). The results of pain intensity are presented as the average scores on the
visual analog scale (VAS). The latency of the pain threshold between cycles within each
group was examined using repeated measures one-way ANOVA and the post hoc Newman-Keuls test.
For the pain intensity, the analysis between cycles within each group was performed using
the Friedman test. The groups pain threshold latencies were compared one-way ANOVA followed
by, post hoc Newman-Keuls test, when necessary. The effect size was calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s
d formula to investigate the clinical significance. Significance was accepted for values of
p &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A acupuncture-like TENS with electrodes with an area of 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> showed effects on

pressure test, also known as the cold-induced pain test. In this model pain is induced
through local hypothermia, since low temperatures (0&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C) cause to painful sensations
through both vasoconstriction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and the activation of thermal nociceptors
(A-&#x003b4; and C fibers) that signal potential tissue damage. This information is sent via the
peripheral and central pathways to the somatosensory cortex<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This information of pain has different representations in the
cerebral cortex, a sensory version and a psychological one, that might be interpreted in
this experiment as the pain threshold latency and pain intensity, respectively<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Acupuncture like TENS is usually used for chronic nociceptive processes. This is due to the
characteristics of electric current, that has low frequency and high intensity, activating
the supra-segmental pathways of &#x003b2;-endorphin and met-enkephalin<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. We found that the low frequency, high intensity TENS was
bearable, and prolonged the pain threshold latency in the acute phase, and that prolongation
of the pain threshold latency was dependent on the size of the electrode.</p><p>A previous study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that
analgesia of 80&#x02005;Hz TENS for pain induced by mechanical which was measured subjectively by
subjects pressure was by increasing the intensity of electrical current. In that study there
was no description the size of the electrodes used. The frequency and pulse duration are
also parameters that influence analgesia<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, it was found that the size of the electrode and its
location affected analgesia. Initially, a high threshold of stimulation was required for
both electrodes at the respective coupled acupoints, that are distal from the muscular motor
points of the forearm, and required high intensities to promote muscle twitch and sting
sensation.</p><p>A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy subjects subjected to cold-induced
pain, and demonstrated that the periaqueductal gray, the superior frontal gyrus, anterior
cingulate cortex, thalamus, left insula, right inferior frontal gyrus and left inferior
temporal gyrus were activated<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
structures are related to the perception of the pain threshold, but not pain intensity.
These structures are also activated when stimuli acupoints, by needles or by transcutaneous
electrical current<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As the action of acupuncture-like TENS with 10&#x02005;Hz was relatively rapid at prolonging the
pain threshold latency, during or after application, it suggests that it acts directly on
A-&#x003b4; and C fiber, promoting action potentials in them. This would have served as a mechanism
of segment concurrence, which is usually seen as fibers A-&#x003b2; mediating the stimulation of
high frequency TENS. When the painful stimulus of low temperature triggered the A-&#x003b4; and C
fibers they were already receiving electrical stimulus, leaving them less responsive to the
cold stimulus. Its influence on the pain threshold latency during and after TENS
application, may be due the concentration of the stimulus in the receptive field of the
nerve endings being stimulated by electrical current, the smaller electrode focused on the
acupoints, while the larger electrodes encompassed this area and most of the surrounding
regions. These acupoints are stimulated by needles, classically, and they have a large
concentration of mechanical stimuli in their areas. Studies have shown that acupoints
located in the areas of dermatomes, myotomes and sclerotomes which are pain afferents, are
more effective than acupoints which are distant from them<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the placebo group,
which received no electrical stimulation, no statistical differences were observed among the
pre-, and during-, and post-treatment periods.</p><p><xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> compares the pain threshold latencies
of the groups. During TENS treatment, the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group showed
significant differences from the other two groups. This result corroborates the hypothesis
that the concentration of eletrical stimulus in a small area is more effective than that
over larger areas.</p><p>Acupuncture points have intrinsic neuronal properties, as well as increased conductance,
low impedance, and high electric potential compared to other locations. It has been
suggested that the meridians are more a functional concept than anatomical, a multiple
system incorporating the physiological, neurological, endocrine and immune systems<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore stimuli with densities of
well-concentrated energy may be more effective.</p><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the mean pain intensities of the
groups. The values show that the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group showed a reduction in pain
intensity during the TENS treatment compared to pretreatment, while the 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
electrode group showed an increase in pain compared to pretreatment. As mentioned above, the
pain threshold latency and pain intensity are mediated differently by the central nervous
system<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Another study<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> applied TENS to the LI4
(He-Gu) and PC6 (Neiguan) acupoints of subjects submitted to cold-induced pain with a
current intensity of 3 mA, pulse duration of 300 &#x003bc;s and frequency of 4&#x02005;Hz, and noted a
reduction in pain intensity relative to a placebo group over periods of 30 to 170 seconds of
cold-induced pain.</p><p>Some other studies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> have also reported significant changes in pain intensity with
electroanalgesia, while, others<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
have reported that the intensity of pain showed no significant change with the use of TENS.
Items that differed in these works were the experimental pain models, parameters of
electrical stimulation, location of the electrodes and the number of subjects involved in
each experiment, as well as the recruitment and randomization methods. Another controversial
point is the measurement of pain using the visual analog scale since, even though it is
widely used and accepted, its results tend to be contradictory.</p><p>The 15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group showed an increase in the sensation of pain
intensity, rather than a reduction, during the TENS treatment, but there was no significant
difference in the timeof the pain threshold latency. We have no explanation for this. In the
case of the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode, the result was consistent. The intensity of pain is
subjective measure which depends on the interpretation and previous experience of each
individual. This may cause some confusion at the time of assessment, making it impossible to
compare the results of pain intensity between groups. We suggest that as well as the
measurement of pain intensity using the VAS scale, some objective form of measurement is
also used, such as the pain threshold latency, measurement of the conduction velocity of
nociceptive fibers.</p><p>The effect size, as calculated by Cohen&#x02019;s d, of the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrode group showed
a percentage ranging from 88% to 98% when compared to the other groups, indicating that the
1-cm<sup>2</sup> group, during the TENS treatment, had this percentage of individuals with
higher values than their respective control. At post-treatment the percentage was 91&#x02013;96%
compared to the placebo group. This demonstrates there was a clinically significant
difference between the 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> group and the placebo group. In the literature, we
could find no other references reporting statistically significant results for this type of
treatment.</p><p>Our findings support the view that acupuncture-like TENS at 10&#x02005;Hz frequency, applied to PC6
and TE5 acupoints with the parameters described above, increases the pain threshold latency
during TENS treatment with 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes and post-treatment with
15&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes. The pain intensity was reduced during TENS treatment when
applied to the acupoints with an electrode area of 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>. The effect size
calculations show that TENS applied to these acupoints were clinically significant. The
combination of acupuncture-like TENS and acupoints is a treatment choice for acute pain in
the hand region.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name><name><surname>Tabasam</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>A double blind placebo controlled investigation into the
