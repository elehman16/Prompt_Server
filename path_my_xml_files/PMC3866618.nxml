Persistence of symptoms adds to the economic burden of PHP and cost-effective solutions are needed. Currently, there is a wide variation in treatment, cost, and outcomes of care for PHP with limited information on the cost-effectiveness and comparisons of common treatment approaches. Two practice guidelines and recent evidence of effective physical therapy intervention are available to direct treatment but the timing and influence of physical therapy intervention in the multidisciplinary management of PHP is unclear. The purpose of this investigation is to compare the outcomes and costs associated with early physical therapy intervention (ePT) following initial presentation to podiatry versus usual podiatric care (uPOD) in individuals with PHP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A parallel-group, block-randomized clinical trial will compare ePT and uPOD. Both groups will be seen initially by a podiatrist before allocation to a group that will receive physical therapy intervention consisting primarily of manual therapy, exercise, and modalities, or podiatric care consisting primarily of a stretching handout, medication, injections, and orthotics. Treatment in each group will be directed by practice guidelines and a procedural manual, yet the specific intervention for each participant will be selected by the treating provider. Between-group differences in the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure 6&#x000a0;months following the initial visit will be the primary outcome collected by an independent investigator. In addition, differences in the European Quality of Life &#x02013; Five Dimensions, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Global Rating of Change (GROC), health-related costs, and cost-effectiveness at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months, and 1&#x000a0;year will be compared between groups. The association between successful outcomes based on GROC score and participant expectations of recovery generally, and specific to physical therapy and podiatry treatment, will also be analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first pragmatic trial to investigate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of ePT and uPOD in individuals with PHP. The results will serve to inform clinical practice decisions and management guidelines of multiple disciplines.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01865734">NCT01865734</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cost</kwd><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Musculoskeletal manipulations</kwd><kwd>Plantar fasciitis</kwd><kwd>Podiatry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Plantar heel pain (PHP), or plantar fasciitis, is a common condition that approximately 1&#x02013;2 million Americans receive treatment for each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Individuals with PHP commonly have prolonged and recurrent symptoms that cost from $192 to $396 million to treat annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Actual healthcare costs for PHP management are likely higher because this estimate reflects only 818,000 of the 1&#x02013;2 million individuals estimated to have PHP annually and does not include indirect costs, such as loss of work productivity or costs associated with treatment provided by podiatrists and physical therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The etiology of PHP is multifactorial including inflammation, chronic tendinopathy, foot posture or mobility dysfunction, lower leg inflexibility, mobility impairments of the foot, ankle, knee and hip, and neurodynamic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Due to the multifactorial nature of PHP, many terms such as plantar fasciitis, plantar fasciopathy, and plantar fasciosis have been used to describe the condition. Furthermore, there are a number of different treatments proposed to be effective in PHP and multiple healthcare providers that offer primary care for PHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Providers within the healthcare system that manage PHP include podiatrists, physical therapists, chiropractors, primary care physicians, and orthopedic surgeons. Prevalence estimates for individuals with PHP that seek care from non-physician providers who manage PHP is not available. However, approximately 1 million visits for PHP were made each year to office or hospital-based physicians between the years 1995 and 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; 62% of visits were made to primary care physicians and 31% to orthopedic surgeons, with physical therapy ordered or provided at 19% of these visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to physicians, there is evidence to suggest that individuals with PHP also visit podiatrists and physical therapists frequently as primary providers for this problem. It has been estimated that up to 15% of patients seeking care from a podiatrist have a chief complaint of PHP and a survey of podiatrists indicated that PHP was the most prevalent condition in podiatry practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A survey of physical therapists in orthopedic practice indicated that PHP was the most common foot condition seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. While physicians, podiatrists, and physical therapists each see a significant number of individuals with PHP, the primary role of several different disciplines may contribute to the observed variance in PHP management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Clinical guidelines can provide direction in the presence of practice variation and multiple treatment options. Currently there are two clinical guidelines on PHP provided by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (ACFAS) and the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both guidelines are intended for use by podiatry and physician specialties, although the APTA guidelines are also intended for use by physical therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. While there are many common recommendations between the two guidelines, including foot and lower leg stretching, taping, orthotics, and night splints, there is an apparent difference in recommendations for the timing of referral to a physical therapist and inclusion of common physical therapy interventions for PHP. ACFAS guidelines recommend 6&#x000a0;weeks of unresponsive treatment and testing to include imaging (e.g., radiographs), corticosteroid injections, orthotics, taping, oral anti-inflammatories, and an unsupervised home program before referral to a physical therapist. In contrast, APTA guidelines do not indicate a timeline for certain interventions as described in the ACFAS guidelines. Additionally, recommendations for iontophoresis, manual therapy, and supervised exercise are included in the APTA guidelines without specific mention in the ACFAS guidelines. Since the APTA guidelines were written in 2008, additional evidence has been published supporting the use of manual therapy interventions in the management of PHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The conflicting recommendations of the ACFAS and APTA guidelines may result in different healthcare utilization patterns. Following the ACFAS recommendations, there is likely to be greater utilization of corticosteroid injections, oral medication, and radiographs in the first 6&#x000a0;weeks whereas a greater utilization of manual therapy and exercise procedures may result from following the APTA guidelines and recent manual therapy evidence. The discrepancies between guidelines and discipline-specific practice patterns for PHP contribute to uncertainty in the best management strategy of primary providers for PHP. An important factor to clarify is the role of physical therapy intervention within the first 6&#x000a0;weeks that a patient presents to a provider for PHP.</p><p>Early physical therapy intervention versus a delayed referral has demonstrated improved outcomes, decreased likelihood of surgery and injections, fewer office visits, and reduced advanced imaging and medication in individuals with low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. No investigations were found on the impact of early physical therapy intervention in PHP. If physical therapy intervention provided early after initial presentation to a provider for PHP can reduce utilization of healthcare while improving outcomes, this would be a significant contribution to the economic and disability-related burden of PHP. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to compare the outcomes and costs associated with usual podiatric care (uPOD) versus early physical therapy intervention (ePT) in patients with PHP.</p><sec><title>Specific aims</title><p>Aim 1: Compare the difference in outcome between ePT versus uPOD. The null hypothesis that no difference in the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) between ePT and uPOD in individuals with PHP at the 6-month follow-up will be tested using a randomized clinical trial.</p><p>Aim 2: Compare the difference in secondary outcome measures using the 3-item (average, worst, least) numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and global rating of change (GROC) scale. These measures will be taken concurrently with the FAAM in the randomized clinical trial to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in NPRS and GROC between ePT and uPOD.</p><p>Aim 3: Compare the cost-effectiveness of ePT versus uPOD. Costs and quality of life measures will be captured concurrently in the randomized clinical trial to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in cost-effectiveness between ePT and uPOD.</p><p>Aims 1 and 2 will be the focus of this paper although Aim 3 will also be considered in the planning of this project and is included here for clarity of the entire project&#x02019;s scope.

This study has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval from Des Moines University (IRB identification, 04-13-02) and Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (IRB identification 131034&#x02013;02). Within the Des Moines University IRB approval, agreements regarding review of protected health information in preparation for research, and extraction of data from electronic health records were made between the Des Moines University Clinic and the principle investigator.

Participants will be included if they have a primary clinical diagnosis of PHP determined by having tenderness to palpation of the plantar aspect of the heel and pain associated with first step after waking in the morning or with progression of weight-bearing during the day. Eligible participants will be between the ages of 18&#x02013;60 and demonstrate a score of less than 74/84 on the FAAM activities of daily living (ADL) subscale to allow for improvement of at least the minimum clinically important difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Participants will be excluded if they had prior surgery of the foot, ankle, or lower leg; clinical signs of radiculopathy; contraindications to manual therapy interventions (i.e., tumor, fracture, rheumatic inflammatory disease [rheumatoid, reactive and psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus], osteoporosis, prolonged history of steroid use, severe vascular disease, etc.); clinical indication of plantar fascia rupture; are unable to complete questionnaires; unable or unwilling to comply with treatment recommendations of either treatment group; or had prior treatment for PHP in the past 6&#x000a0;weeks. In addition, individuals who have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or symptoms for longer than 1&#x000a0;year will be excluded due to the greater risk of chronic symptoms and poor response to conservative management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The number of participants for this study is based on the power needed to detect between-group differences in the primary outcome measure, the FAAM, at 6&#x000a0;months. In the absence of research comparing physical therapy and podiatry interventions or podiatry interventions using the FAAM as an outcome measure, sample size calculations are based on achieving a clinically meaningful difference between the groups and details from a recent clinical trial by Cleland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that used similar methods to this investigation. Sample size estimate was made using G*Power 3.1.5 based on detecting a difference between groups greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (i.e., 9 point change) of the FAAM at 6&#x000a0;months with an alpha level of 0.05, 80% power, and pooled sample variance of 14.5 from Cleland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This resulted in an effect size of 0.62 and 42 participants needed per group. To account for participants who drop-in or drop-out of treatment, in addition to the possibility of some participants not returning the FAAM questionnaire, the sample will be increased by 33% resulting in 56 participants per group. The focus, and consequently the power analysis of this investigation is on functional outcome (based on FAAM scores) and therefore may result in underpowered analysis of secondary variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcomes will be collected at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months, and 1&#x000a0;year after initial presentation.

The proposed work builds on emerging evidence indicating the benefit of early physical therapy intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which has not been established in a population of individuals with PHP. In addition, previous investigations have analyzed the outcome associated with individual or 1&#x02013;2 combined interventions for PHP. This is the first pragmatic study, as far as we are aware, that investigates the role and cost-effectiveness of impairment-based physical therapy intervention early in the multi-disciplinary management of PHP. The implications of this work address national concerns about rising healthcare costs in the American healthcare system, will help inform clinical guidelines, and benefit multiple healthcare providers involved in PHP management. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT01865734 to increase transparency of trial. The results of this investigation will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at local and national meetings regardless of the outcome. The Orthopaedic Section, APTA, Inc. will be credited for monetary support provided for this work in all publications and presentations.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study will be the first to compare uPOD and ePT and this investigation will be conducted at one location, the Des Moines University Clinic. As a result, the findings may have limited generalizability to other settings. In addition, treatments provided by both groups will be done at the discretion of the provider. There will be six Podiatrists and four Physical Therapists providing treatment, which may result in variation of treatment within each group. Efforts will be made to reduce variation by providing a guide based upon current best evidence for the physical therapy intervention (Tables&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), but the intent of this trial is to capture the value and differences of pragmatic clinical approaches used to manage PHP. This may result in difficulty describing specific details about treatment beyond reporting of Current Procedural Terminology codes used when treatment is billed, but general aspects of treatment will be described in as much detail as possible.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in this investigation will help to reduce the likelihood of confounding factors but will also limit the generalizability of results. The results of this investigation may not apply to individuals with a BMI greater than 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, PHP symptoms for longer than 1&#x000a0;year in duration, older than 60&#x000a0;years of age, or comorbid conditions that were excluded in this trial (e.g., osteoporosis, rheumatic inflammatory diseases, severe peripheral artery disease).</p><p>All participants in this study will be seen by a podiatrist first and therefore the results of this investigation will apply to clinical scenarios when an individual presents first to podiatry with PHP. Preliminary unpublished investigation at the Des Moines University Clinic indicates that a significant majority of patients present first to podiatry than to any other specialty for PHP, but no other investigations were found to describe the prevalence of patient presentation to the primary providers for PHP. Therefore, the design of this trial is based upon local patterns of patient entry to the healthcare system for PHP. The results of this investigation may be limited in clinical scenarios where the patient may present to another provider first or does not receive an evaluation and treatment from a podiatrist initially.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACFAS: American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons; ADL: Activities of daily living; APTA: American Physical Therapy Association; BMI: Body mass index; ePT: Early physical therapy; EQ-5D&#x02122;: European quality of life-five dimensions; FAAM: Foot and ankle ability measure; IRB: Institutional Review Board; MCID: Minimum clinically important difference; NPRS: Numeric pain rating scale; PHP: Plantar heel pain; uPOD: Usual podiatric care.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SMM is the principle investigator and will be responsible for the study design, IRB applications, participant recruitment, ePT treatment delivery, training of independent examiner who will collect data and compensate participants, and training of office and professional staff at the study location including analysis of baseline tests/measure reliability.
