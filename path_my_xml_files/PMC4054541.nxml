One of the reasons for low treatment rates is the relatively high cost of imported antidepressant medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>Compare the efficacy and safety of the generic form of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitory (SSRI) antidepressant escitalopram to the proprietary form of escitalopram (Lexapro) in the treatment of major depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled 260 patients with depression and randomly assigned them to receive eight weeks of treatment with either generic escitalopram (<italic>n</italic>=130) or Lexapro (<italic>n</italic>=130). Efficacy was assessed by the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD-17). Safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events reported by patients, regularly recording vital signs, and conducting laboratory tests and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 35 (27%) dropouts during the 8 weeks of treatment in the generic escitalopram group and 32 (25%) in the Lexapro group. In the intention-to-treat analysis (i.e., including all patients) the mean (s.d.) drop in the HAMD total score at the end of the 8th week of treatment was 13.9 (8.2) in the generic escitalopram group and 14.3 (8.1) in the Lexapro group (<italic>t</italic>=0.44, <italic>p</italic>=0.664). The proportions of patients responsive to treatment (i.e., &#x0003e;50% drop in total HAMD score) were 69% and 67% in the generic escitalopram group and Lexapro group, respectively (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.16, <italic>df</italic>=1, <italic>p</italic>=0.690; and the proportions that achieved remission (i.e., final HAMD &#x0003c;7) were 51% and 49% (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.06, <italic>df</italic>=1, <italic>p</italic>=0.804). The most frequently reported adverse events were dry mouth (12.3%), nausea (9.2 %) and dizziness (6.2%) in the generic escitalopram group and nausea (10.8%), fainting (7.7%) and drowsiness (6.9%) in the Lexapro group. During the first 35 days of treatment, one suicide and two suicide attempts occurred in the generic escitalopram group and one suicide occurred in the Lexapro group (Fisher exact test, <italic>p</italic>=0.314).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Generic escitalopram is as effective and safe as Lexapro in the initial treatment of patients with moderate to severe episodes of major depression who seek treatment in the outpatient departments of psychiatric hospitals in China. Careful monitoring of the risk of suicidal events is an essential component of the treatment of depressed patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><bold>NCT00866593 (clinical.trails.gov)</bold></p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="zh"><sec><title>&#x080cc;&#x0666f;</title><p>&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x05df2;&#x065e5;&#x076ca;&#x06210;&#x04e3a;&#x05f71;&#x054cd;&#x056fd;&#x04eba;&#x05065;&#x05eb7;&#x07684;&#x0516c;&#x05171;&#x0536b;&#x0751f;&#x095ee;&#x09898;&#x0ff0c;&#x04f46;&#x053ea;&#x06709;&#x05c11;&#x090e8;&#x05206;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x083b7;&#x05f97;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x03002;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x07387;&#x04f4e;&#x07684;&#x0539f;&#x056e0;&#x04e4b;&#x04e00;&#x05728;&#x04e8e;&#x08fdb;&#x053e3;&#x06297;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x0836f;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x082b1;&#x08d39;&#x09ad8;&#x06602;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x076ee;&#x07684;</title><p>&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x09009;&#x062e9;&#x06027;5-&#x07f9f;&#x08272;&#x080fa;&#x0518d;&#x06444;&#x053d6;&#x06291;&#x05236;&#x05242;&#x0ff08;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, SSRIs&#x0ff09;&#x0827e;&#x053f8;&#x0897f;&#x0915e;&#x0666e;&#x05170;&#x056fd;&#x04ea7;&#x0836f;&#x08349;&#x09178;&#x04f9d;&#x05730;&#x0666e;&#x04ed1;&#x07247;&#x04e0e;&#x04e13;&#x05229;&#x0836f;&#x06765;&#x058eb;&#x0666e;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x07684;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x06027;&#x0548c;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x065b9;&#x06cd5;</title><p>&#x091c7;&#x07528;&#x0968f;&#x0673a;&#x053cc;&#x076f2;&#x03001;&#x09633;&#x06027;&#x0836f;&#x05e73;&#x0884c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x03001;&#x0591a;&#x04e2d;&#x05fc3;&#x04e34;&#x05e8a;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x0ff0c;&#x05165;&#x07ec4;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x075c5;&#x04f8b;260&#x04f8b;&#x0ff0c;&#x05176;&#x04e2d;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff08;&#x08349;&#x09178;&#x04f9d;&#x05730;&#x0666e;&#x04ed1;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff09;&#x0548c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff08;&#x06765;&#x058eb;&#x0666e;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff09;&#x05404;130&#x04f8b;&#x0ff0c;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;8&#x05468;&#x03002;&#x04e3b;&#x08981;&#x07597;&#x06548;&#x06307;&#x06807;&#x04e3a;17&#x09879;&#x06c49;&#x05bc6;&#x05c14;&#x0987f;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x091cf;&#x08868;&#x0ff08;Hamilton rating scale for depression, HAMD-17&#x0ff09;&#x08bc4;&#x05206;&#x03002;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x05305;&#x062ec;&#x04e0d;&#x0826f;&#x04e8b;&#x04ef6;&#x03001;&#x05b9a;&#x0671f;&#x04f53;&#x068c0;&#x03001;&#x05b9e;&#x09a8c;&#x05ba4;&#x068c0;&#x067e5;&#x0548c;&#x05fc3;&#x07535;&#x056fe;&#x068c0;&#x067e5;&#x07b49;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;</title><p>&#x04e3a;&#x0671f;8&#x05468;&#x07684;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x04e2d;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec4;&#x06709;35&#x0540d;&#x0ff08;27%&#x0ff09;&#x053d7;&#x08bd5;&#x08005;&#x08131;&#x0843d;&#x0ff0c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x04e3a;32&#x0540d;&#x0ff08;25%)&#x03002;&#x0610f;&#x05411;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x05206;&#x06790;&#x0ff08;intention-to-treat analysis, ITT&#x0ff09;&#x053d1;&#x073b0;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;8&#x05468;&#x0540e;&#x0ff0c;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec4;&#x07684;HAMD&#x091cf;&#x08868;&#x08bc4;&#x05206;&#x051cf;&#x05206;&#x0ff08;&#x06807;&#x051c6;&#x05dee;&#x0ff09;&#x04e3a;13.9&#x0ff08;8.2&#x0ff09;&#x05206;&#x0ff0c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x04e3a;14.3&#x0ff08;8.1&#x0ff09;&#x05206;&#x0ff08;<italic>t</italic>=0.44, <italic>p</italic>=0.664&#x0ff09;&#x03002;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec4;&#x0548c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x07684;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x07387;&#x0ff08;HAMD&#x051cf;&#x05206;&#x07387;&#x02265;50%&#x0ff09;&#x05206;&#x0522b;&#x04e3a;69%&#x0548c;67%&#x0ff08;&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=0.16, <italic>df</italic>=1, <italic>p</italic>=0.690&#x0ff09;&#x0ff1b;

The total duration of observation was eight weeks. Both generic escitalopram (10 mg/tablet, batch number, 20071001) and Lexapro (10 mg/tablet, batch number, 2163474) were taken orally once a day. (These medications were all provided by the Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited.) The initial dosage for both groups was 10 mg/d. At the end of the second week the dosage was increased to 20 mg/d if the patient tolerated the medication well but the treatment effect was considered poor (i.e., a score of &#x02265;3 on the improvement Subscale of the Clinical Global Impression scale [CGI-I]<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) or if the treating clinician thought it necessary to increase the dosage. Alternatively, the dosage was maintained at 10 mg/d after two weeks of treatment if the treatment was considered effective (e.g., CGI-I &#x0003c;3), if the treating clinician did not think it necessary to increase the dosage, or if the patient did not tolerate the medication well.</p><fig id="sap-25-02-107-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the study</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="sap-25-02-107-g002"/></fig><p>During the trial, sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, midazolam, alprazolam, clonazepam, and estazolam) at usual dosages were allowed before the patient went to sleep.

The magnitude of the mean drop in the total HAMD score after 8 weeks of treatment of 13.9 (8.2) in the study group was similar to that found in other studies of escitalopram.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> The proportions of subjects in whom the treatment was effective (69% in the study group and 67% in the control group) and the proportions who achieved clinical remission (51% in the study group and 49% in the control group) were also in line with the findings of other studies.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Our results indicate that both the generic and trade name forms of escitalopram are efficacious antidepressants and that there are no significant differences in the efficacy of the two forms of the medication.</p><p>Some studies from other countries have found that escitalopram has a good treatment effect on anxiety symptoms.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> This is supported by findings from the current study. After 8 weeks of treatment, the HAMA score decreased significantly in both groups. The magnitude of the reduction in anxiety symptoms was not significantly different between the two forms of escitalopram.</p><p>Common adverse events in both groups were dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness and decreased appetite; this pattern of adverse effects is similar to that reported in other studies of escitalopram.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref></p><p>The occurrence of four suicidal events (two fatalities and two attempts) in the 260 enrolled subjects (1.5%, 95% <italic>CI</italic>=0.4, 3.9%) during 8 weeks of treatment despite excluding patients considered at high risk of suicide from the study was concerning. Three of the four suicidal events occurred in the first month of treatment and two of them occurred in the first week of treatment. Suicidal behaviors are rare, but depressed persons are certainly at elevated risk of suicide and there is some evidence that suicidal risk is highest during the first month of antidepressant treatment, so this relatively high rate could be a statistical outlier.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> Nevertheless, larger studies in which subjects are followed over longer periods are needed to determine whether the rates of suicidal events are higher in those treated with escitalopram than in those treated with other antidepressants. And further efforts are needed to better identify and effectively intervene with the minority of depressed patients who are at high risk of suicide.</p><p>A meta-analysis comparing effectiveness and safety of 12 commonly used antidepressants found that generic escitalopram was one of the antidepressants with the best treatment effects and one of the highest rates of treatment adherence.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Results from this study confirm this finding in Chinese patients with moderate to severe episodes of major depression who seek treatment in psychiatric outpatient services.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study is a multi-center study that enrolled outpatients with depression from six psychiatric hospitals in China. It is unclear how many patients were screened at the centers to identify the 286 potential participants so it is not possible to be certain of the extent to which recruited patients were representative of all depressed individuals in China who receive psychiatric treatment. Moreover, the results could be different in a sample of patients treated at non-specialty hospitals, who typically have less severe forms of depression than those treated at psychiatric hospitals. The sample size, though sufficiently large to assess the main hypothesis about the similarity of the two forms of the medication, was not large enough to conduct stratified analysis (e.g., by gender, age group, number of previous depressive episodes, etc.) so there may be some differences in the outcomes of the two forms of the medication in subgroups of subjects that were not identified. The follow-up period was only 8 weeks, so it is not possible to say anything about the comparability of the two forms of medications during prolonged usage or during the maintenance phase of the treatment of depression. The dropout rate of 27% in the study group and 25% in the control group was relatively high but not out of line with what is seen in similar studies. Additional work is needed to identify biological markers that can identify which patients will respond best to which antidepressants.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><label>4.3</label><title>Significance</title><p>This study compared the efficacy and safety of generic and brand name escitalopram. In summary, the efficacy and safety of the generic form of escitalopram (produced by Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited) during the first 8 weeks of treatment of a depressive episode are not significantly different from the efficacy and safety of the brand name form of escitalopram (Lexapro, produced by Xi'an Janssen Pharmaceutica) when used at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per day in moderate to severely depressed patients treated in the outpatient departments of psychiatric hospitals in China. Both forms of the medication are effective and safe and they are also both relatively effective in alleviating the anxiety symptoms that commonly co-occur with depression. The occurrence of 4 suicidal events (2 deaths and 2 attempts) in the 260 patients (1.5%) treated with escitalopram during the first 35 days of treatment may be a statistical outlier, but the rates of suicidal events should be re-assessed in larger studies with longer follow-up times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> The authors report no conflict of interest related to this manuscript.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Funding for this study was received from three sources: (a) the National Science and Technology Major Project for Investigational New Drugs subproject titled &#x02018;Clinical Technological Platform for Evaluation of New Drugs in Psychiatry&#x02019; (CPEP number 2012ZX09303-003); (b) the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine 985 Project titled &#x02018;Standardized Platform for Clinical Testing of Neuropsychiatric Medications&#x02019;; and (c) the Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e36"><p><graphic xlink:href="sap-25-02-107-g001.gif" position="float"/></p><p>Dr. Yimin Yu graduated from the Shanghai Second Medical University in 2001 and received a Master's of Medicine degree from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in 2009.
