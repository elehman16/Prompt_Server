The pathogenesis may be due to inflammatory responses that trigger pregnancy-induced hypertension consequently. This condition increases burden of disease in developed and developing countries. Preeclampsia complicates up to 5&#x02013;10 and 3% of pregnancies in developed and developing countries, respectively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The prevalence of preeclampsia is 3% in Iran. In addition, eclampsia happens in 0.1% of pregnancies in Iran.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It plays an important role in occurring prenatal and perinatal events including premature delivery, severe hypertension, increasing the risk of stroke, maternal death. Mothers with the medical history of preeclampsia are predisposed to for cardiovascular diseases due to endothelial dysfunction may be persistent after delivery.</p><p>Several studies reported the role of endothelial cells in endothelial-dependent diseases including preeclampsia and it is recently proved that endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The endothelial function should be evaluated by measuring brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography after triggering shear stress. Bujold <italic>et al</italic>. reported that low-dose aspirin, as an antiplatelet, in early pregnancy decrease the risk of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Another study represented that low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of preeclampsia in healthy nulipar pregnant women but has no impact on prenatal morbidity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although there are lots of surveys on preeclampsia, a few studies evaluate the effect of ASA in preeclamptic patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on endothelial dysfunction in preeclamptic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient setting</title><p>This trial has been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir/">http://www.irct.ir/</ext-link> Registration with ID number IRCT2016040527135N2 and has been approved by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Ethical Board.

Endothelial function assessed by FMD. Our results showed that daily oral administration of low-dose ASA increase FMD significantly which means it can improve endothelial function.</p><p>Several experimental studies approved the effect of ASA on platelet function as a potent antioxidant. These surveys showed ASA can affect endothelial function through oxidative stress pathway in vascular inflammation process.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Shechter <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Platelet activation occurs in an endothelium-dependent FMD impairment environment. FMD is inversely correlated to platelet reactivity in both controls and acute myocardial infarction patients. This study showed that platelet adhesion and aggregation in inflammation state lead to endothelial dysfunction and platelet reactivation decrease endothelial dilation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In support of this study, Raghavan <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that antiplatelet treatment can reduce vascular dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Magen <italic>et al</italic>. in a study at 2005 showed that addition of low-dose aspirin to antihypertensive treatment and statins in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patient can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure through improved NO-mediated endothelial function.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similar effects of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure and reduce risk of preeclampsia were seen in a study on pregnant women in Houston, and suggest that aspirin administration in pregnancy are useful for high-risk mothers and are safe for fetus.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction due to inflammation process and imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator modulates are known pathophysiology of preeclampsia. In endothelial disorders, such as preeclampsia, poor placental perfusion leads to activation of platelets and the clotting cascade, resulting in an imbalance among prostacyclin (vasoactive modulates in blood flow and inhibit aggregation) with thromboxane A2 (acting as a vasoconstrictor and promoting platelet aggregation). Increased thromboxane and reduced prostacyclin levels are associated with infarction and thrombotic vasculopathy, which caused preeclampsia and its adverse features outcomes.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Schramm <italic>et al</italic>. in a study on aspirin effect for the prevention of preeclamsia in lupus pregnant patient reported that low-dose aspirin (60&#x02013;80 mg/day) may prevent preeclampsia by modulating the thromboxane A2/prostacyclin ratio to optimize placental blood flow and prevent placental thrombosis. While aspirin will not eliminate all cases of preeclampsia, it is currently the best and safest available drug for influencing the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of preeclampsia. In this study, aspirin treatment had a risk reduction of up to 20% for preeclampsia development in lupus patient.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furuno <italic>et al</italic>. in a survey about the effects of various doses of aspirin on platelet activity and endothelial function indicate that aspirin at any daily dose over 81 mg suppressed platelet activity, and the optimal dose of endothelial function was 162 mg/day. However, 660 mg/day of aspirin worsened endothelial function. This study explains aspirin plays an important role in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and it has remained the most cost-effective clinical drug for over three decades. Higher doses of aspirin can cause bleeding complication and also impair endothelial function. A high dose of aspirin achieves both platelet inhibition and vasodilation, whereas a low dose spares endothelial cyclooxygenase activity and vasodilatation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Park <italic>et al</italic>. in a study at 2015 on high-risk pregnant women reported prescription of aspirin (60&#x02013;150 mg/day) to this group, appears to be effective in reducing the prevalence of early PE. Aspirin also can reduce the risk of preterm delivery, IUGR, and prenatal death.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Roberge <italic>et al</italic>. study showed similar effects and suggested that low-dose aspirin initiated at &#x02264;16 weeks of gestation is associated with a greater reduction of perinatal death and other adverse perinatal outcomes than when initiated at &#x0003e;16 weeks.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Study limitations</title><p>First and most important limitation of our study is small sample size due to difficulties to diagnosis pure preeclamptic patients who met inclusion criteria. In addition, cultural difficulties limited our study. The last but not least was an unequal period of drug administration by participants due to emergency indications for cesarean section which some of the participants did meet.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrated an association between low-dose aspirin and increase flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery in preeclamptic patient. Increase mean of FMD in groups who took regular daily oral 80 mg aspirin starting right at the initiation of diagnosis until 2 months after delivery shows that this drug through biological pathway can improve endothelial function and can be significantly affected maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and some endothelium-dependent disease such as preeclampsia and its associated adverse outcomes.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran (Grant No. 394649).
