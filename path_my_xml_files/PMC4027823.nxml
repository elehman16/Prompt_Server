Bowel preparation with mannitol has several side effects such as fluid and electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramp [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bowel preparation using mannitol may be associated with abdominal infection [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Today, polyethylene glycol as a standard method for bowel preparation is widely used in countries with high economic status. But in countries with low economic states, polyethylene is expensive and may not be available [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our country due to some limitations, mannitol is widely used for bowel preparation.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare bowel preparation with mannitol and without mannitol regarding wound infection and electrolyte disturbances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0003"><title>Material and methods</title><p>This case control study was carried out in Imam Khomeini hospital. Sixty cases were included in this study. Indications for colorectal surgery were pull-through, colostomy closure, and anorectoplasty. All subjects in case and control groups underwent enema for preparation. Oral antibiotics were prescribed for cases and controls in 3 doses preoperatively. A systemic antibiotic was prescribed for all subjects 30 min preoperatively. Subjects were randomly placed in the case or control group. Surgeons were blind to the type of preparation. Emergency cases, patients with proximal colostomy, and patients who received antibiotics for intra-abdominal infection were excluded from our study. Normal saline enema (10 cc/kg) was used for both groups. Mannitol 10% (10 cc/kg) with Ringer serum was prescribed orally for the case group. Infection, electrolyte disturbances, fever, and leukocytosis were recorded. Wound infection was determined when there was erythema that needed antibiotic treatment, and a wound with an indication for exploration for drainage. White blood cells &#x0003e; 10,000 was considered as leukocytosis. Anastomotic leakage was determined using radiologic investigation or drainage of fecal material. Patients were examined daily until discharge and then 1 week after that. Multivariate analysis was done using PRISM. Odds ratio was calculated with CI = 95%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0004"><title>Results</title><p>Fourteen boys and 16 girls were included in group I.

Sodium concentration was significantly higher among patients who underwent bowel preparation with mannitol. The level of potassium was significantly lower in patients who underwent bowel preparation with mannitol. Mannitol causes osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and has the risk of eliciting explosion with diathermy [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In our study wound infection showed no significant difference between the two groups. This may be due to limitation in sample size. In another study, wound infection was significantly higher in patients who underwent bowel preparation with mannitol [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the study by Zmora <italic>et al.</italic>, there were no significant differences between the prep and non-prep group regarding complications except for diarrhea [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the study by Scabini <italic>et al.</italic>, who compared polyethylene glycol with a group without mechanical bowel preparation, the authors concluded that colon and rectal surgery may be safely performed without mechanical bowel preparation [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This finding supported our finding, because polyethylene glycol is safer than mannitol bowel preparation.</p><p>In the study by Balogh <italic>et al.</italic>, the rate of septic complication was higher in colon preparation using the conventional method than preparation with mannitol [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our study, the rate of infection was similar in both groups. However, sample size in our study was smaller than in the Balogh <italic>et al.</italic> study [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Most studies have shown that colorectal surgery without mechanical bowel preparation has fewer side effects, even with newer agents [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, in a recent study on 190 patients who underwent colorectal surgery due to diverticulitis, there were no significant differences between groups in septic complication and mortality [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rectal bowel preparation without mannitol is safe and is associated with less complications than bowel preparation with mannitol.
