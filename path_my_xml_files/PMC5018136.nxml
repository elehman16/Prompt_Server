Background</title><p>Pain has been a major concern for all people at one time or another, and has been the object of many pervasive efforts to understand and control it. Postoperative pain is an acute form of pain which begins with surgical trauma and usually terminates with tissue healing. Even with the recent advances in the knowledge, skill, and sophisticated technology that characterize most modalities of treatment, patients continue to experience pain during the postoperative period.</p><p>Postoperative analgesia results in faster recovery and hence reduces medical costs. The current predominant approach of multimodal postoperative analgesia is mostly based on a combination of opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, and perioperative administration of local anesthetics. Each of these approaches comes with its own set of complications (<xref rid="A34591R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For instance, the use of opioids may be limited by adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, excessive sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus, and urinary retention (<xref rid="A34591R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). NSAIDs have adverse gastrointestinal effects such as gastritis and upper gastro intestinal ulceration (<xref rid="A34591R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Furthermore, interventional techniques such as epidural analgesia require additional work and carry the potential risk of further complications such as hypotension and local anesthetic toxicity (<xref rid="A34591R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Pregabalin is a structural analogue of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). It acts through presynaptic binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage gated calcium channels that are widely present in both the spinal cord and the brain. Therefore, it modulates the release of many excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, norepinephrine, substance-P, and calcitonin gene related peptide. It causes inhibitory modulation of overexcited neurons and restores them to a normal state. Centrally, pregabalin is able to decrease the hyper excitability of the dorsal horn neurons that is caused by tissue damage (<xref rid="A34591R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec154044"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Several studies have reported pregabalin as an effective post-operative analgesic with opioid sparing effects (<xref rid="A34591R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="A34591R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, there have been contrary reports of pregabalin having no significant post-operative analgesic effects (<xref rid="A34591R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Against this background, it was hypothesized that preoperative use of pregabalin may reduce the requirement of post-operative analgesics. Hence, the primary objectives of the present study were to compare the efficacy of two doses (75 mg or 150 mg) of pregabalin against the administration of a placebo for post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing hysterectomy under spinal anesthesia, and to study the adverse effects (if any) due to pregabalin use.</p></sec><sec id="sec154045"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>After obtaining ethical committee clearance, a prospective randomized control study was conducted on 135 patients scheduled for vaginal hysterectomy under spinal anesthesia during the period of January 2013 to August 2014. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. The visual analogue scoring (VAS) system was explained to the patients. Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: 1) age 30 - 65 years old, 2) American society for anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of 1 - 3, and 3) body mass index (BMI) of 18 &#x02013; 35 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) refusal to participate in the study; 2) use of anti-anxiety drugs (or having anti-anxiety drugs given preoperatively); 3) history of drug/alcohol abuse; 4) history of headache, dizziness, or significant post-operative nausea or vomiting after any previous surgery; 5) history of chronic pain and daily intake of analgesic drugs; 6) history of epilepsy; 7) failed spinal anesthesia; and 8) any contraindication to spinal anesthesia.</p><p>The study subjects were allocated into 3 groups of 45 patients each using a computer generated random number table:</p><p>Group 0 (control): all patients belonging to this group were administered a placebo orally one hour before being shifted to the operation theatre.</p><p>Group 1 (75 mg pregabalin): all patients belonging to this group were administered a 75 mg capsule of pregabalin orally one hour before the patient was shifted to the operation theatre.</p><p>Group 2 (150 mg pregabalin): all patients belonging to this group were administered a 150 mg capsule of pregabalin orally one hour before the patient was shifted to the operation theatre.</p><p>The pre-operative baseline blood pressure and heart rate (before premedication, at 30 minutes after premedication, and at 1 hour after premedication) were recorded. The Ramsay sedation score (1 to 6) was assessed 1 hour after administering the drug. A score of 3 or more was taken as implying that adequate sedation had been obtained.</p><p>All of the patients were administered spinal anesthesia in the sitting position, between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> lumbar intervertebral space with a 25-gauge Whitacre needle (0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine at 0.3 mg/kg intrathecally). For post-operative pain analgesia, intravenous paracetamol of 1 g 8<sup>th</sup> hourly was given to all patients. Rescue analgesics were administered if VAS &#x0003e; 4. The first rescue analgesic was intravenous tramadol of 50 mg, and intravenous diclofenac of 75 mg was given if VAS &#x0003e; 4 persisted for 30 minutes after the first rescue analgesic.</p><p>The following parameters were assessed: 1) VAS was assessed for pain at rest and on cough at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post-operatively. The number of doses of rescue analgesics required and the time to first or second rescue analgesic was noted on post-operative day one; 2) post-operative sleep quality was assessed on a grade of 1 to 5, where grade 1 meant &#x0201c;could not sleep at all,&#x0201d; grade 2 meant &#x0201c;difficulty in falling asleep,&#x0201d; grade 3 meant &#x0201c;woke up two or more times during the night;&#x0201d; grade 4 meant &#x0201c;woke up once during the night,&#x0201d; and grade 5 meant &#x0201c;did not wake up even once during the night. A grade of 4 or 5 was considered as adequate post-operative sleep; 3) Other adverse effects such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting were also noted.</p><p>A study carried out by Kohli and colleagues (<xref rid="A34591R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) on the &#x0201c;optimization of subarachnoid block by oral pregabalin for hysterectomy&#x0201d; with 3 groups, group 1 was the control group, group 2 was administered 150 mg pregabalin, and group 3 was administered 300 mg pregabalin, all of which was given orally one hour before surgery. It was observed that the time required for the first rescue analgesia with pregabalin 150 mg as premedication was 178.38 &#x000b1; 4.80 minutes post-surgery, and with the placebo group, it was 131.38 &#x000b1; 5.15 minutes post-surgery. The study had a power of 80% and a confidence interval of 95%. For the present study, in order to obtain the same power of 80% and confidence interval of 95%, 43 patients needed to be included in each group. Thus it was proposed to include a total of 135 patients with 45 patients in each group.</p><p>Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was carried out. The results of the continuous measurements are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD (minimum - maximum), and the results of the categorical measurements are presented as numbers (%). The significance level was assessed at 5%. The following assumptions about the data were made: 1) dependent variables should be normally distributed; and 2) samples drawn from the population should be random.</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significance of study parameters between three or more groups of patients. A post-hoc Tukey&#x02019;s test was used to find the group significance for the pairs. Chi-square and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used to determine the significance of the study parameters on a categorical scale between two or more groups. Statistical software, namely SAS 9.2 and R environment ver. 2.11.1 were used for the analysis of the data. A P value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was taken as significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec154046"><title>4.

Discussion</title><p>Surgery produces tissue injury with consequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters which activate peripheral nociceptors causing pain (<xref rid="A34591R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Continuous release of inflammatory mediators in the periphery sensitizes functional nociceptors and activates dormant ones. The intensity of acute postoperative pain is a significant predictor of chronic postoperative pain (<xref rid="A34591R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, control of perioperative pain and the fashion in which it is implemented is important in facilitating short and long term convalescence after surgery. A number of drugs like NSAIDs, opioids, ketamine, gabapentinoids, and a variety of regional anesthesia techniques have been used in multimodal approaches to achieve postoperative analgesia (<xref rid="A34591R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="A34591R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Pregabalin (S-[+]-3-isobutylgaba) was designed as a lipophilic GABA (&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid) analog. Pregabalin, like gabapentin, has been shown to be effective in several models of neuropathic pain, incisional injury, and inflammatory injury. It is also effective in the treatment of anxiety and as a sleep-modulating drug. Pregabalin has been shown to increase slow-wave sleep in healthy volunteers. Slow-wave sleep has been correlated with the restorative aspects of sleep, and is therefore important for the post-operative healing process (<xref rid="A34591R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Vaginal hysterectomies constitute a major part of gynecological surgeries. This study compared the effects of two doses of pregabalin (75 mg and 150 mg) with a placebo as pre-operative medication on post-operative pain relief in patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. In our study, VAS scores were significantly lower (P &#x0003c; 0.05) in the pregabalin groups with respect to placebo at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours post-operatively. When comparing group 1 and group 2, it was observed that the pain scores were significantly lower (P &#x0003c; 0.05) in group 2. These differences may be attributed to higher doses of pregabalin (150 mg) in group 2, which produced a prolonged effect. The pain scores were comparable at 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post-operatively both at rest and on coughing. This is in accordance with the pharmacokinetic profile of pregabalin, which has an elimination half-life of 4.6 to 6.8 hours after a single dose, which could be the reason for the comparable VAS score at 6 hours. Similar results of lower VAS at rest and upon movement were reported by Jokela and colleagues (<xref rid="A34591R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and Agarwal et al. (<xref rid="A34591R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) with the administration pre-operative single doses of pregabalin. Similarly, a lower pain intensity was reported by Alimian et al. in their study of laparoscopic gastric bypass patients receiving pregabalin premedication (<xref rid="A34591R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, Paech et al. (<xref rid="A34591R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found no such reduction in VAS in their study.</p><p>The results of this study have revealed that the time for first rescue analgesic was significantly increased (P &#x0003c; 0.001) in the pregabalin group. Post-operative rescue analgesic requirements were also significantly lower in the pregabalin groups (group 2 &#x0003c; group 1 &#x0003c; group 0). Similar studies have been reported by others (<xref rid="A34591R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These results signify that pregabalin premedication provides significant postoperative analgesia. Furthermore, sedation has been described as a significant effect in the pharmacology of pregabalin (<xref rid="A34591R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). We found that pregabalin patients were adequately sedated (RSS &#x0003e; 3) one hour after administration. They also had better sleep profiles postoperatively. Dizziness has been described as the most common adverse effect after a single dose (<xref rid="A34591R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, despite these advantages, dizziness was found to be significantly high in the study group (group 2 &#x0003e; group 1 &#x0003e; group 0) which was observed in other similar studies (<xref rid="A34591R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="A34591R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Agarwal et al. (<xref rid="A34591R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) also reported significant nausea and vomiting in the pregabalin group, but none of the patients in our study had such occurrences. Therefore, it can be said that the advantages clearly outweigh the potentially adverse side effects.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that the total duration of surgery was not variable in the final results. Longer surgery would have involved more tissue handling and subsequently more post-operative pain. To keep the surgical time comparable, only those cases which could be completed within the duration of spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine were included. We excluded those cases where the surgical time exceeded the duration of spinal anesthesia and required additional intravenous opioids/local infiltration at the surgical site or those converted to general anesthesia.</p><p>The present study clearly reveals the analgesic and sedative efficacy of pregabalin given administered premedication in patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy under spinal anesthesia. This was shown through the lower post-operative VAS scores, the decreased need of rescue analgesics, and the greater time before the first rescue analgesic. Pregabalin 150 mg had a better analgesic profile but its use may be limited by the increased incidence of dizziness. Thus, pregabalin 75 mg may be the optimal pre-emptive dose for vaginal hysterectomies under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="afn47851" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contribution:</bold>All authors have contributed as follow: 1- study concept and design; 2- acquisition of data; 3- analysis and interpretation of data; 4- drafting of the manuscript; 5- critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content; 6- statistical analysis; 7- administrative, technical, and material support; 8- study supervision.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="A34591R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cashman</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Dolin</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Respiratory and haemodynamic effects of acute postoperative pain management: evidence from published data.</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth.</source><year>2004</year><volume>93</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/bja/aeh180</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15169738</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="A34591R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dolin</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cashman</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tolerability of acute postoperative pain management: nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, and urinary retention.
