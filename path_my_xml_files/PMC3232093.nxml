Among different reasons and mechanisms, volume loss and hypovolemic shock secondary to hemorrhage is one of the major causes of death of traumatized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). Although fluid therapy and blood transfusion play an essential role in correction of blood loss but, transfusion has its drawback such as infection transmission, acid-base disequilibrium, hypothermia, electrolyte disturbance, deep vein thrombosis, and also decrease patient survival. Blood loss, nutritional deficiency, and endocrine, renal and hepatic insufficiencies are some of the reasons for anemia in traumatized and critically ill patients. Erythropoietin a secreted glycoprotein by kidney through augmenting of hematopoietic remarkably improve anemia and blood oxygen supply in critically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>).</p><p>Production and release of free radicals following traumatic injury is one of the underlying mechanisms leading to cell injury and subsequent organ failure and it has been reported that excess free radicals overwhelmed antioxidant defense of body. Many research have been performed with antioxidant drugs including N-acetylcysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>), vitamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>), vitamin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>) and even iron chelators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>) for prevention of oxidative stress following trauma, but results are not convincing. In addition to the obvious role of EPO for treatment of anemia, several clinical reports have shown that it has also antioxidant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>).</p><p>EPO by increasing hemoxygenase-1 within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>), degrade hem and release iron for subsequent utilization in hematopoisis. Metal ions especially iron by production of powerful hydroxyl radicals play an important role in oxidative stress process and it seems that EPO mobilizes iron in blood cell production cycle and decrease oxidative stress. Moreover, increasing numbers of circulating young red blood cells indirectly reduce cellular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). This study assesses the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of EPO on key systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) mediators in traumatized patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This study was an open label randomized clinical trial (Registered under government ID number NCT00622934), conducted at Intensive Care Unit of &#x0201c;Sina&#x0201d; teaching hospital (Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran). Traumatized patients within 24 hrs after trauma referring to the hospital from October 2008 to October 2009 were enrolled in the study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained from patients or their closest relatives. The study procedure and protocol were approved by the ethical committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services. Randomization was stratified by utilizing a computer-generated random numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>All patients had been admitted to either a medical, surgical, or a medical/surgical ICU. Inclusion criteria were; staying in the ICU for 3 days, hematocrite less than 28%, and provision of signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, renal failure with dialysis, new onset or uncontrolled seizures, acute burns, pregnancy or lactation, acute ischemic heart disease, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, prior treatment with EPO, participation in another research protocol, and expected ICU discharge within 48 hrs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to two groups.

The cytoprotective mechanism of EPO is not completely understood but a probable explanation has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>).</p><p>Our recent investigations have revealed remarkable results on the role of cytokines such as IL, growth factors and oxidative stress mediators in the pathology or prognosis of many chronic and acute diseases and these issues led us to study the effect of EPO on these variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the ICU scores including APACHE II, ISS showed insignificant discrepancy between the study groups; therefore further comparison of clinical and para-clinical (inflammatory biomarkers) wee made between groups irrespective of the severity of trauma.</p><p>Results showed that IL-1 as an inflammatory reactant significantly decreased after administration of EPO for 3 days and this effect lasted to the 9<sup>th</sup> day after the treatment was started. Concerning the TNF-&#x003b1;, there was a remarkable decrease in the relevant levels after 9 days treatment with EPO in comparison with EPO control group; and TNF-&#x003b1; level also significantly decreased in the days of 3, 6 and 9 after treatment compared to the baseline level in the EPO group.</p><p>In agreement with reports that EPO has a variety of direct anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>), results of this study showed that EPO significantly diminished synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This indicates that the observed inflammatory effects of EPO were not mediated by an increase in the principal regulatory cytokines, but were either cytokine independent or mediated by a different cytokine(s). Inhibition of apoptosis has been suggested as a fundamental mechanism of EPO-mediated tissue protection. However, in an invitro model it was found that EPO rescues only a small number of cytokine-producing cells from apoptosis (data not shown).</p><p>The cytokine inhibitory properties of EPO likely represent an important mechanism by which its tissue-protective effects are mediated and evidence suggests that cytokine-mediated cell injury plays an essential role for end-organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with findings of this study, it seems that PAI-1 was affected strongly and remarkably by EPO administration because its level fell significantly from the third day after treatment and remained low during the study period. PAI-1 is the major physiological inhibitor of tissue type plasminogen activator. PAI-1 is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis and increase in its levels are considered to contribute to the pro-coagulant state associated with thrombotic diseases.</p><p>In the past study it was found that PAI-1 level decreased in both intensive insulin therapy and /or combined with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>). Consistent with these results it has been reported that glucose control and insulin treatment improved fibrinolysis by reducing PAI-1 concentration/ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>) and impaired fibrinolysis during sepsis has been associated with widespread activation of coagulation through the release of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>).</p><p>Nitrotyrosine was significantly lower in the EPO treated patients at the days of 3, 6 and 9 after treatment compared with control patients; in addition its level decreased significantly at the days of 3 and 6 in the EPO group in comparison to their baseline values.</p><p>EPO may exert its anti oxidative effects directly by exploiting intracellular anti oxidative mechanisms. Increase in the red blood cells by EPO may also indirectly reduce cellular oxidative stress, as red blood cells are loaded with a substantial amount of antioxidative enzymes.A comparison of SOFA scores on the first, third and seventh day showed that EPO group had lower SOFA score which at least indicate that EPO has anti-inflammatory activity.SOFA score was selected as a quantitative tool to judge this matter to some extent because it represents the dynamics of illness including the effectiveness of therapy.</p><p>Among critically ill patients, erythropoietin uses appears to be associated with increased thrombotic events. This is consistent with the results of recent trials involving non- critically ill patients with either cancer or chronic renal failure. In these studies, when erythropoietin, was used to achieve higher target hemoglobin concentrations (i.e.,&#x0003e;120 g/l), the risk of thrombotic complications and death were increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>). Importantly, patients with past thromboembolic complications had to be strictly excluded, and therefore patients who are prone to bed should not be included in a chronic treatment study. However findings of this study did not show any thromboembolic complications because Platelet counts and other related factors had been carefully and continuously monitored at all times of EPO treatment and even in weeks thereafter.
