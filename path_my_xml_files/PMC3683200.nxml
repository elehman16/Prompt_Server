All patients were diagnosed as papillary carcinoma of thyroid on histopathological examination. Patients with any signs of metastases, previous cardiac problems, and chronic disease were excluded. All patients had undergone total thyroidectomy and then received about 100 mci RIT and subsequently 200 &#x003bc;g LT4 daily for initial 2 months. Age, weight, height, body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), and life style-matched 23 healthy euthyroid volunteers were also recruited as the control group.

LT4 replacement protocol differs among institutes of different countries considering the different recommendations of international guidelines.

Patients with DCT were consecutively recruited from the younger age group. Other reasons to select the younger age groups were to avoid any existing cardiac problems and also to avoid chronic diseases and any kind of disability affecting the different parameters of the present study. Biondi, <italic>et al</italic>., (1993), also recruited the patients of the younger age group having mean age of 36 &#x000b1; 11 year.

This dose pattern does not consider age, sex, body weight of patients, and classification of DCT. This dose appears higher in the low-risk group of DCT, especially young patients having relatively low body weight. In our neighboring country India, physicians have been practicing 300 &#x003bc;g/day dose of LT4 as initial dose, however, 100 &#x003bc;g dose reductions (200 &#x003bc;g/day) is advised for older patients with DCT having cardiac problems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] There are several recommendations about requirement of daily dose of LT4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] However, LBM measurement is superior to other measures of body size descriptor for dosage of many drugs, especially for those which are hydrophilic and used for lifelong. Pharmacokinetic parameter such as clearance is mostly dependent on LBM of an individual. Success rate of drug administration increases when given considering LBW rather than TBW.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] LT4 is water soluble and its pharmacokinetics is dependent on lean portion of body. LT4 is deiodinated to T3 (active form of hormone) in muscle, kidney, and liver. T4 is deiodinated to rT3 (reverse T3, inactive form) in skin. Fatty tissue has no role in metabolism of LT4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Comparative TBW and LBM were shown in patients of Group-I [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Regarding dose of LT4, it was optimized on the basis of LBM of each patient of Group-I at the first visit. After 3 months, the repeat hormone assay of Group-I patients were done. The dose of LT4 131&#x000b1;23 &#x003bc; gm/day (ranging from 120 to 220 &#x003bc;g/day) i.e., 3.5 to 4 &#x003bc;g/kg/LBM was found optimum to obtain normal thyroid hormone levels and expected TSH level (0.1 &#x000b1; 0.01 mIU/L) in this group. This dose was comparable to LT4 dose calculated depending on LBM by DXA in a previous study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Daily dose of LT4 based on TBW ranged from 2.2 to 3.0 &#x003bc;g/kg in different previous literatures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Regarding dose of LT4 calculation depending on TBW, arbitrarily it would have varied from 111 to 210 &#x003bc;g/day (mean, 156 &#x000b1; 27 &#x003bc;g/day) in patients of Group-I of the present study, if 3 &#x003bc;g/kg/TBW/day were considered. This mean dose of LT4 is quite high compared to daily dose depending on LBM used in the present study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] and also in a previous study by Santiny, <italic>et al</italic>., (2005), in which daily dose of LT4 was calculated on the basis of LBM. The dose of LT4 based on TBW increases linearly with the increment of TBW[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] shown arbitrarily in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> in patients of Group-I. BMI always depends on fat accumulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] LBM does not increase linearly with the increase of body weight rather depends mainly on muscular activity and individual body build.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Dose of LT4 increased linearly with the increase of TBW/BMI, but calculated dose based on LBM did not increase linearly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, remarkable nonlinearity/fluctuations of doses of LT4 were noted in LBM based dose pattern with a small difference of TBW. If 25 &#x003bc;g/day have been minimized from the daily total dose of LT4 based on LBM, several adverse effects would have been avoided.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] If 2.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/TBW of LT4 were considered for patients of Group-I, then dose would have varied from 93 to 175 &#x003bc;g with a mean dose 130 &#x000b1; 22 &#x003bc;g/day, which also has increased linearly corresponding with body weight. A study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] recommended that patients with higher body weight comparatively are to be prescribed low dose (1.8 &#x003bc;g/kg/TBW) compared to patients with low body weight (2.56 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/TBW) considering high fat accumulation in obese patients (analyzed by DXA whole body composition). Patients having different TBW may need the same dose of LT4 to attain same TSH value because of having same LBM.

These findings of the current study were comparable to Biondi, <italic>et al</italic>., (2000), where the study population was in endogenous subclinical hyperthyroid state for at least 6 months. This study is also in agreement with another study by the same author.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Excessive LT4 replacement produce signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism and patients continually suffer from impairment of emotional and physical health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] It is now clear from previous published data and from the present study that TSH suppressive dose of LT4 inevitably deteriorates patients condition worsening their quality of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>Strength of the present study includes selection of young, low-risk group of patients with DCT who had comparable BMI along with healthy volunteers without having any cardiac problems. DXA has been found as a precise and reproducible method to measure body composition including measurement of LBM.</p><p>Limitation of the present study was comparatively short follow-up time after administration of high LT4 dose and optimization of dose of LT4 in one group of patients with DCT.</p><p>Further studies are recommended by consuming extended period of time for evaluation of quality of life in patients with DCT. Patients with DCT of the low-risk group are recommended to give replacement of LT4 depending on measurement of LBM (dose, 3.5-4 &#x003bc;g/kg/LBM). This will ensure expected replacement of LT4 especially in young patients with DCT. It will also cover the low-risk group and patients with diverse ethnicity irrespective of weight and BMI. Thereby, untoward side effects from chronic exposure to mild overdose can be avoided. This study documents that suppressive dose of thyroxine following thyroid carcinoma could be different in other ethnic groups with variations in body mass index. Therefore, the dose requirement obtained in the present study can be employed as a guide for determining comparable doses in individuals with similar body structure and weight.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Expected therapeutic suppression of TSH with LT4 replacement in athyrotic patients with DCT of the low-risk group requires optimization of LT4 dose. LBM-based LT4 therapy (3.5-4 &#x003bc;g/kg/LBM/day; 131 &#x000b1; 23 &#x003bc;g/day) keeps the TSH in desired level. LT4 replacement used in the present study improves quality of life by reducing signs and symptoms of hyperthyroid state in patients with DCT. It prevents chronic exposure of mild overdose of LT4. Thereby statistically significant improvement of HSS of patients initiated among those who received optimized dose of LT4 compared to patients with DCT on conventional dose of LT4.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This research work was approved and funded by Committee for Advanced Studies and Research (CASR) of
