Since the rationale for rehabilitation of curved walking in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease is not fully known, we tested the hypothesis that repeated PKS favors the production of curved walking in these patients, who are uneasy with turning, even when straight walking is little affected. Fifteen patients participated in 10 training sessions distributed in 3&#x02009;weeks. Both counterclockwise and clockwise PKS were randomly administered in each session. PKS velocity and duration were gradually increased over sessions. The velocity and duration of the following PKAR were assessed. All patients showed PKAR, which increased progressively in peak velocity and duration. In addition, before and at the end of the treatment, all patients walked overground along linear and circular trajectories. Post-training, the velocity of walking bouts increased, more so for the circular than the linear trajectory. Cadence was not affected. This study has shown that parkinsonian patients learn to produce turning while stepping when faced with appropriate training and that this capacity translates into improved overground curved walking.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gait rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>curved walking</kwd><kwd>circular treadmill</kwd><kwd>podokinetic after-rotation</kwd><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Italian Ministry of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">RF-2011-02352379</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Italian Ministry of University and Research</funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">2009 JMMYFZ and 2010 MEFNF7 006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="13"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="99"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="12413"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gait disturbances are a critical issue in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Of note, increased risk of falling during transitions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and gait asymmetry (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) become more evident when walking along circular rather than linear trajectories (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). During normal curved walking, muscle synergies account not only for the obligatory propulsion but also for the equilibrium constraints connected to body rotation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Turning involves complex orientation of head, trunk, pelvis, and feet (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and is accompanied by trunk inclination to the inner part of the trajectory to counteract the centrifugal acceleration acting on the walking body (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Also, motion of the lower limbs is asymmetric, whereby the leg inside the trajectory travels a shorter path than the outside leg (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These subtasks are normally performed unconsciously, but PD is associated with impaired gait automaticity, such as reduced arm swing, decreased stride length, overall instability (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and trunk rigidity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Not unexpectedly, given the complex coordination and multisensory integration underlying curved walking (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), studies requiring patients with PD to travel both linear and circular pathways have detected additional abnormalities during curved walking (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Dopaminergic treatment does not always provide substantial improvement of gait (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and long-term treatment carries increased risk of episodes of freezing of gait (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Even deep brain stimulation may not provide significant improvement (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, gait rehabilitation seems to be a valuable treatment for these patients (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), also for coping with changes in walking direction to negotiate corners and avoid obstacles. Thus, rehabilitation of curved walking has been advocated by several investigators (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition to the linear treadmill, the circular treadmill could become a crucial adjunct to the armamentarium of gait rehabilitation, since it induces an aftereffect called podokinetic after-rotation (PKAR), which causes subjects to involuntarily turn around their vertical axis when asked to step-in-place without vision.</p><p>While stepping-in-place eyes open on the rotating treadmill, the stance foot repetitively turns relative to the stationary trunk, inducing a novel relationship between foot and trunk position during stepping (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This stimulation produced by the rotating treadmill has been called podokinetic stimulation (PKS) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Most interestingly, following exposure to extended periods of PKS, individuals inadvertently rotate around their vertical axis when stepping eyes closed on a stationary surface, reflecting adaptation of the foot-trunk system. This aftereffect PKAR is induced in healthy adults across a range of stimulus durations and amplitudes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The similarity of PKAR to voluntary turning suggests that PKAR may depend on the same neural networks used for voluntary turning (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Of note, the PKS compels subjects to lift their feet and rotate their legs with an appropriate cadence and amplitude of leg rotation, because subjects are asked to maintain an invariant orientation of their trunk with respect to space. This rhythmic stimulation to step and turn might be relevant regarding treatment, since both rhythmogenesis capacity of the spinal circuitry (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and stepping in response to perturbations (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) seem to be compromised in patients with PD.</p><p>Preliminary data on the potentially positive effect of circular treadmill training in PD have recently appeared (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The improvement of the velocity of curved walking in these patients after training would possibly rest on the engagement of the neural circuits subserving the complex synergies for turning mentioned above, and on increased strength of the muscles related to turning (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). When administering the PKS to people with PD, Hong et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) found no obvious differences in the PKAR between patients with PD and neurologically healthy older adults (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). On the one hand, failure to detect differences between both groups may have been due to small sample size, or to testing participants on dopaminergic medication that may affect motor adaptation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), or else combining freezers and non-freezers into a single PD group. On the other, that finding is in favor of an overall capacity of patients with PD to exhibit this type of motor adaptation. This is not unexpected, both because elderly subjects largely retain locomotor adaptability (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and because basal ganglia damage from degenerative diseases largely leaves adaptation intact (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesized that having patients with PD stepping-in-place repeatedly on the rotating treadmill would induce adaptation to turns, witnessed by gradual PKAR enhancement. An adapted, dynamic training protocol would be necessary, since patients with PD, tested under different conditions, require a larger number of trials to adapt than age-matched controls (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In turn, this training would possibly improve overground curved walking. If the ability to adapt to PKS is present in people with PD and does transfer to curved walking, then the rotating platform may potentially serve as a helpful rehabilitative tool for difficulties of turning and curved walking.</p><p>The main goal of this study was to determine the features of PKAR in PD patients after PKS. We assumed that PKAR features would be abnormal in PD (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and that PKAR would increase in velocity and duration across days by incremental training administered with the rotating treadmill. We also tested the hypothesis that the adaptation to PKS would produce an improvement in the velocity of the spontaneous overground walking along circular trajectories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen parkinsonian patients participated in the study. This sample was chosen based on preliminary data from this laboratory (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The prospective power calculation had shown that a sample size of 15 would have 80% power to detect a mean difference in gait velocity of 11&#x02009;cm/s, with a SD of 14&#x02009;cm/s, using a one-sided paired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test with alpha of 0.05. Patients were recruited from the local association of PD and from our laboratory database. All patients had a diagnosis of idiopathic PD based on defined criteria (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and all were on stable dopaminergic medication. They did not change their pharmacological therapy during the study. No patient had orthopedic conditions restricting exercise, or had deep brain stimulation surgery or evidence of dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination &#x0003c;26) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). All patients could walk independently. Hoehn and Yahr scores (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) ranged between 2 and 2.5.

We used the motor section (III) of the UPDRS (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). This is composed of 14 items, which assess specific disorders such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, balance, and functional mobility (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Patients were identified as tremor-dominant (TD) or postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) based on Stebbins et al. (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Right vs left differences on the UPDRS III scale were examined. The criteria for excluding asymmetry were those reported in Ref. (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In most patients, the severity of the motor symptoms was comparable in the right and left sides of the body. Five patients were asymmetric, having a left vs right difference score &#x0003e;5 points (two were more severely affected on the right and three on the left side).</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-2"><title>Linear and Curved Overground Walking</title><p>Each patient underwent gait assessment twice: on the day before the onset of the first training session and on the day following the last training session (as described below). Patients walked at their comfortable speed under three different conditions: linear (LIN) and circular walking, clockwise (CW), and counterclockwise (CCW). The order of these conditions (LIN, CW, and CCW) was randomized across patients. The linear path was obtained by asking the patients to walk down a corridor (2.5&#x02009;m width). The curved path (1.2&#x02009;m radius) was drawn with a continuous tape stuck on the floor of a large room (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Before data acquisition, each patient performed one short trial for each condition (LIN, CW, and CCW) in order to familiarize with the task. Then, patients executed two 20-m length walking trials for each trajectory, making a total of six trials. Patients were instructed to walk looking forward, head erect, without gazing constantly to the tape but walking along it as smoothly as possible. Gait speed, cadence, and stride length were computed.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-3"><title>Stepping-in-Place</title><p>Before each training session, the patients stepped-in-place for 60&#x02009;s in the center of the motionless circular treadmill, blindfolded. The purpose of these &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; stepping-in-place trials was to assess that patients had no preferential sense of rotation. Repetition of &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; stepping before each training session ensured that the preceding training session did not affect the orientation in space during stepping-in-place in the following session. Patients were never made aware of their possible rotation and the only indication given was to step-in-place naturally at their own pace. Degrees traveled in the 60&#x02009;s period, sense of rotation, and cadence were measured.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>PKS Administration and PKAR Evaluation</title><p>Patients underwent 10 training sessions, each in a different day. Sessions were repeated two or three times a week in different days over four successive weeks. At the beginning of each PKS trial, the patients entered the rotating platform and put on a security harness (no weight unloading), which they wore during the entire session on the platform. Their arms were free to move, but they were asked not to reach out for support, or use upper limb movements to maintain stability.</p><sec id="S2-3-1"><title>Structure of the Training Sessions and PKAR Evaluation</title><p>Each training session was divided into three parts (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Part 1 started with the PKS phase that consisted in stepping-in-place eyes open on the center of the platform rotating in CW or CCW direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). PKS was followed by the PKAR phase that required stepping-in-place with a blindfold on the same platform, motionless (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). PKS had a variable duration, which was set by each individual patient&#x02019;s tolerance and the judgment of the physiotherapist, who had planned in advance to have patients repeat the same two phases shortly. In any case, the duration of both PKS or PKAR phase did not exceed 600&#x02009;s, because this was the maximum time allowed based on <italic>a priori</italic> deliberation considering ethical (patient&#x02019;s fatigue) and practical (total duration of the session) reasons. After Part 1, patients performed a stretching exercise program with the assistance of a physiotherapist that included three bouts of lower limb muscle stretching: quadriceps, hamstring, and calf, bilaterally. The stretching period lasted about 15&#x02009;min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, middle panel). Part 2 was also composed by two phases: PKS in the opposite direction with respect to Part 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), followed by PKAR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). The order of the CW and CCW PKS was alternated across patients and across days according to a fixed scheme such that, ultimately, patients performed five sessions of the CW and five sessions of the CCW PKS. These conditions were balanced in order to train turning in both directions in all the patients, with the purpose of providing a functional and ecological exercise appropriate to cope with any changes in walking direction.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme of the protocol</bold>.

A brushless motor (220&#x02009;V) was controlled by a custom-made software written in LabVIEW. For all trials, patients were wearing the following equipment: step counter, mask (only during PKAR), and safety harness. A hula hoop gently maintained the patients in the center of the platform. It was loosely fixed at pelvic height by elastic straps secured to the platform outer railing and prevented patients&#x02019; displacement from the platform rotation center while stepping-in-place eyes closed. Lightly touching the hoop with the pelvis occurred from time to time, but gave no cue regarding the body position in space, during either the PKS or the PKAR, as from the patients&#x02019; report at the end of the experiments. All patients used the same types of rubber-sole shoes (Superga 2521) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Drawing of the experimental set showing a patient ready for the training session on the rotating platform</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneur-08-00053-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="S2-3-3"><title>Podokinetic Stimulation</title><p>The platform rotated at the angular velocity imposed by the physiotherapist (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C). Angular velocity varied from 0 to 55&#x000b0;/s (maximum), in compliance with the actual capability of each patient to tolerate the imposed rotation. During each training session, the physiotherapist encouraged the patients to maintain a constant orientation of the body in space, facing the target (patient&#x02019;s eyes were open in this phase), and avoid rotating together with the platform. The physiotherapist adjusted the velocity and duration of the platform rotation with the aim of obtaining a medium-high level of perceived effort, in order to induce a true training effect. Because stepping-in-place requires about the same energy expenditure as walking (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), we considered this task a sort of aerobic exercise and checked exercise intensity by monitoring the rate of perceived exertion by using the Borg scale (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This was administered every few minutes during each PKS session. In order to try to maintain the same intensity of training (Borg score around 12&#x02013;13) (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), the platform angular velocity was progressively increased during the same session and across the 10 sessions. Hence, angular velocity and duration were progressively updated according to the actual ability of each patient, as long as the performance improved. The speed of the platform was not increased when it appeared that the patient was not able to maintain the requested body orientation while stepping. PKS was stopped when the Borg score reached 14 points. As said above, we imposed a maximum duration of 600&#x02009;s for each PKS task, to allow patients performing the two parts of the session (PKS in CW and CCW direction, and corresponding PKAR) in the same day.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3-4"><title>Podokinetic After-Rotation</title><p>At the end of each PKS phase, patients stepped-in-place on the motionless platform, blindfolded (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,D). The aftereffect appearing in this period consisted in involuntary turning while stepping-in-place, in the direction opposite to that of the preceding platform rotation. This phase was set to last for a maximum duration of 600&#x02009;s. The acquisition was stopped before that time in the case of an actual shorter duration of the PKAR (rotation was considered concluded by the absence of turning for at least 10&#x02009;s), or when the patient declared cramps at the leg muscles or fatigue. All in all, 300 PKAR events were captured in this study: 10 trials after the PKS in the CCW and 10 after the PKS in CW for each of the 15 patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3-5"><title>Step Counter</title><p>We used an automatic pedometer. The hardware consisted in an insole with a microswitch connected to a wireless interface in communication with the PC. The software was a mini-APP for Windows developed with Visual Basic 6 SP6 able to count the number of steps and measuring real time and average cadence.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3-6"><title>Data Acquisition</title><p>The features of the PKAR were measured by filming the complete sessions and by the step counter. No metronome was used during the tasks to set cadence. The data from the step counter gave the instantaneous cadence in the different stages of the session, not only for PKAR but also for the &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; stepping trials and for the PKS. At the end of each session, a physiotherapist analyzed the video recordings. When watching the video, she recorded the time taken for the patient to make 45&#x000b0; of rotation. The mean angular speed for every completion of 45&#x000b0; was calculated, until the PKAR finished. Then, the maximum angular velocity reached and total degrees traveled by the patient were noted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Results are reported in the tables as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD and in the text and figures as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE.</p><p>A test for normality (Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk) was performed prior to statistical comparison of the differences in all recorded variables. The gait characteristics (speed, stride length, and cadence) were normally distributed. Comparison of their mean values at baseline between LIN, CCW, and CW was made by one-way repeated-measure ANOVA tests, separately for speed, stride length, and cadence. Then, to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the spatiotemporal variables of gait (for both linear and curved walking), a repeated-measure ANOVA with 2 within-subject factors was run (direction of rotation: LIN, CCW, and CW; pre- and post-training: T1 and T2), separately for gait speed, cadence, and stride length. For the &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; stepping phases, we used a one-way ANOVA to assess differences in degrees rotated and cadence (both variables were also normally distributed) across the 10&#x02009;days of training. When the ANOVAs gave a significant result (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), the <italic>post hoc</italic> Fisher&#x02019;s test was conducted to assess differences between variables.</p><p>The distribution of the variables of PKS (duration and velocity of platform rotation, cadence) and PKAR (duration, degrees covered, maximum angular velocity, cadence) proved to be non-normal.

Since there was no statistical difference between directions in each of the 10 sessions for all variables, differences in velocity and duration of platform rotation and cadence across days of PKS training were tested by three separate non-parametric statistics (Friedman&#x02019;s ANOVA) with directions of rotation collapsed. Similarly, Friedman&#x02019;s ANOVA was conducted for duration, maximum speed, degrees rotated, and cadence of PKAR, across the 10 sessions of training, with directions of rotation collapsed.

Preliminary findings (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) have shown that a short training session consisting in walking along the border of a circular treadmill was sufficient to decrease freezing episodes in parkinsonian patients. We decided to train optimally medicated patients as suggested by Roemmich et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), who conjectured that dopaminergic pathways enhance aftereffect storage in walking rehabilitation.</p><p>Here, we advanced the approach described in Ref. (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and embarked on a complex study aimed at verifying the hypothesis that parkinsonian patients can improve their production of curved walking by learning the basic features of turning while stepping and can transfer their newly acquired pattern to overground walking along a circular trajectory. To this aim, we exploited a paradigm described long time ago in Ref. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). After prolonged stepping-in-place on the center of a rotating platform, subjects asked to walk normally on firm floor straight-ahead without vision unknowingly generated a curved path. Moreover, when subjects were asked to step-in-place without vision after having stepped on the rotating platform for a prolonged period, they continued to rotate around their vertical axis for a while after the stop of the platform (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>This aftereffect had been named PKAR (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It is evidence that the PKS induced by the rotating platform prompts the nervous system to produce body rotation during stepping. Interestingly, the overall pattern of body turning (with respect to platform) while stepping during the PKS is superimposable to voluntary turning while stepping and is in turn superimposable to the inadvertent turning during the PKAR (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The similarity of PKAR to voluntary turning and to its aftereffect suggests that PKAR may depend on the same neural networks responsible for voluntary turning. These neural networks are those that control intra- and extra-rotation of the trunk on the legs, therefore those active during the turning phases of walking normally occurring in the activities of daily living.</p><sec id="S4-1"><title>PKAR Is Present in PD Patients and Is Enhanced by Circular Treadmill Training</title><p>We have shown that patients with PD were able to exhibit a clear-cut PKAR. Compared to normal young subjects (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), their PKAR was initially erratic, short-lasting, and attained a pretty low rotation velocity, in spite of the patients being medicated. This is in keeping with recent findings by Nemanich and Earhart (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), who have shown that patients with PD, off-medication, exhibited smaller PKAR peak velocities compared to age-matched healthy people. Not unexpectedly, among their patients, those with freezing of gait had the smallest PKAR.</p><p>In our patients, however, with the repetition of the training sessions (accompanied by the systematic increase of platform angular velocity), the aftereffect increased in both duration and velocity, so that improvement in the turning velocity during PKAR progressively and gradually increased from the 1st to the 10th day of training. The increasing intensity in the PKS training appears to have been appropriately dosed in each patient. In our case, the improvement in PKAR velocity might have probably approached the turning velocity found previously in a cohort of healthy subjects (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), if each PKS session was not limited to 600&#x02009;s duration and the maximal mean velocity of the rotating platform was not limited to 57&#x000b0;/s.</p><p>Overall, the stepping cadence was remarkably constant during all tasks that were included in the study. Cadence was not different among &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; stepping on the motionless platform performed at the beginning of each day&#x02019;s training and stepping during the PKS on the platform rotating either CW or CCW, and stepping during the following PKARs. These findings are in keeping with those recently obtained in a population of young subjects (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Moreover, cadence showed no changes across the training sessions. Cadence appears to be a remarkably constant variable, so that no changes in body angular velocity during PKS or PKAR can be attributed to &#x0201c;improvement&#x0201d; in the frequency of the rhythmic output of the central pattern generator of stepping. Also in other studies, cadence appears to be the variable least affected by gait training (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>In our hands, the parkinsonian patients definitely showed a progressive adaptation of their motor output in response to stepping-in-place on the rotating platform (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Patients learned to step at higher rotation velocities as a function of the increase in the velocity of the platform rotation. Since cadence was excluded as a cause of increased angular velocity, the circular treadmill training did necessarily increase their capacity to improve activation of the pelvic muscles responsible for leg intra- and extra-rotation and produce a progressively larger foot intra- and extra-rotation. PKAR also increased in duration, so that in some patients PKAR was still detectable when the platform rotation had reached the predetermined maximal duration (600&#x02009;s). Interestingly, the ratio of the velocity of the PKAR to that of the PKS was consistently close to 1/3 in the different subsequent sessions, in spite of the progressive increase in PKS angular velocity. It was previously shown in normal subjects that for rotating treadmill velocities ranging from 10 to 60&#x000b0;/s, a normal PKAR response has a peak velocity approximately 1/3 the velocity of the treadmill (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Potential Mechanisms Responsible for Stepping Improvement</title><p>The rotating treadmill must trigger a collection of afferent information, at the same time as it forces the buildup of descending commands, conveyed across space and time to the body muscles responsible for turning. Most likely, these events require attention and control by the participants, particularly during the initial stepping movements on the rotating platform when the appropriate rhythm and leg rotation amplitude is being defined. Then, the repetition of the stepping and leg rotation tasks becomes automatic, to the point that, when stepping continues on the motionless platform, subjects exhibit a fully involuntary and unperceived turning that can last several minutes. In this light, the administered training seems to be more than appropriate for patients known to suffer from both somatosensory abnormalities (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) and distal motor deficits (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The process whereby this automaticity and involuntariness was reached required different time intervals across the patients, and probably was not complete in all patients at the end of the treatment. In this regard, our analysis fell short of identifying potential sources of interpatient variability.</p><p>Both afferent input and central circuits likely cooperate in sustaining stepping and turning [see Ref. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for a brief discussion]. Sort of a &#x0201c;Kohnstamm phenomenon&#x0201d; would ensue, similar to the production of a curved locomotion trajectory after an intense voluntary trunk rotation effort (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). While we are not in the position of drawing on this point, we would remind that spindle feedback, enhanced by both descending fusimotor drive and continuous, rhythmic lower-body spindle activity would be one factor responsible for building-up adaptation during PKS and for sustaining rotation during the PKAR in these patients. Other lines of research have shown that muscle contraction and vibration (both adequate stimuli for spindles) can produce long-lasting effects on central circuits controlling the perception of self-motion (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). If the continuous afferent discharge from the spindle plays a major role in adaptation, then the duration of this long PKAR imitates the action of neck muscle contraction and vibration on perception of whole-body rotation around the body axis (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Repeated PKS would enable the spindle input to gradually access the central pattern generators (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), overcoming rigidity (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) and help normalizing the production of coordinated pelvis and leg muscle activity. On top of that, one would also consider that PKS requires a non-negligible mental/motor effort. On the one hand, motor imagery <italic>per se</italic> can increase spinal reflex excitability (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>), on the other, it is known from a normal elderly population study that motor effort improves muscle strength and descending command, even with training at low exercise intensity (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p><p>The role of descending influences on leg muscle reflexes has been addressed in PD patients (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). With PKS, these reflex modulations might contribute to the enhancement of the stepping pattern as training continues. Solopova et al. (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) showed that MEPs and H-reflex elicited in the lower limb muscles were significantly smaller during vibration-induced than voluntary cyclic leg movements. Their findings highlight the facilitatory effect of voluntary control of stepping on spinal motor circuits and support the idea of active engagement of supraspinal motor areas in developing central pattern generator-modulating strategies [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>), for a study during normal development]. The fact that patients are forced to voluntarily step and cyclically rotate their legs and feet during the imposed PKS may train the supraspinal circuits responsible for the task (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). More pathways might contribute, like cutaneous reflexes (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>), present and effective in PD (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). These reflexes might be further enhanced and incorporated into a functional pattern as long as PKS training continues. Training-induced increased strength of the muscles producing rotation of the trunk on the stepping foot would also contribute to enhanced angular velocity of podokinetic adaptation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It is remarkable here, however, that PKS can produce PKAR and increase its duration over time in the initial sessions already (even if repetition further improves PKAR), emphasizing nervous adaptation rather than increased muscle force.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Does PKAR Transfer to Overground Curved Walking?</title><p>At the end of the training period, gait speed increased during both linear and curved paths. The mean changes were of 2 and 7&#x02009;cm/s (i.e., about 2 and 8% compared to baseline), respectively. These changes are due to increased stride length (significant for curved but not linear walking), since cadence did not change significantly. It seems therefore that PKS by the rotating platform increases the performance of walking trajectories in these PD patients, without negatively affecting linear walking. On note, the values of the observed increments are larger than the changes considered significant for a PD population in a recent Cochrane revision (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Most likely, the progressive increment in PKS intensity was responsible for the improvement. Resistance training seems to be superior to non-resistance training or no intervention on strength and physical function on muscle, even if it may not be as effective for improving gait as it is for balance (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). This might depend on the target of the intervention. Targeting curved walking seems to be appropriate, because it can indirectly favor everyday locomotion, in which good control of stepping <italic>and</italic> balance is critical.</p><p>We note that PKS is certainly effective in favoring the active extra-rotation of the trunk on the stance foot (in the direction of the induced body rotation during stepping) and the consecutive intra-rotation of the swing leg with regard to trunk, observed during the PKAR. However, stepping at the center of the rotating platform does not expressly exercise the mediolateral control of equilibrium, crucial during walking, and turning (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). This might explain the ultimately not too large increase in walking velocity post-training along the overground curved path in this group of patients (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Not unlikely, associating sessions of stepping on the center with sessions of walking on the border of the circular treadmill might produce even larger curved walking improvement.</p></sec><sec id="S4-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>This is the first study that examines the ability of PD patients to improve walking along a curved path in response to long-term stepping adaptation on a rotating platform without external cues. However, several limitations should be highlighted, and new experiments suggested.</p><p>The sample size of the parkinsonian patients&#x02019; population is limited. Perhaps, with a larger cohort, we could have traced the differences in improvement exerted by PKS to individual characteristics, like among others age, medication, PD severity scoring, rate of disease progression (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), in addition to clinical phenotype (TD vs PIGD). Further, our patients had largely different levels of physical fitness, but these were not assessed by appropriate cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Moreover, the absence of a control population of age-matched healthy subjects, or of patients affected by turning difficulties of a different nature (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>), does not allow to assess whether the positive effects obtained by PKS training are specific to parkinsonian patients.</p><p>We would also note that the PKS training was limited to 10 sessions and 600&#x02009;s per session. Progressive-resistance exercises are known to improve motor performances in parkinsonian patients in the long run (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Hence, it is not unlikely that more numerous, longer periods of circular treadmill rotation and higher angular velocities of imposed rotation would have produced larger improvements in overground circular walking (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Previous studies have shown that angular velocity of treadmill rotation during PKS influences PKAR velocity (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). PKAR velocity is also dependent on the amount of time spent on the treadmill, with longer PKS durations resulting in higher PKAR velocity (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Actually, the protocol employed here did not allow to assess whether a ceiling effect would be reached in PKAR. Furthermore, no reiterated assessment of walking velocity along circular trajectories has been made in the weeks/months following the rotating treadmill training. This prevents arguing on the duration of the improvement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Training by stepping in the center of a rotating platform, implying continuous and coordinated intra- and extra-rotation of the lower limbs, is performed relatively easily by parkinsonian patients. Repetition of such training sessions definitely improves the capacity of coping with the task. Besides, a true adaptation to the task ensues, attested by the progressive development of an aftereffect consisting in an involuntary rotation while stepping on firm ground. Moreover, the velocity of overground walking along a curved path increases after the training period. On the one hand, the new finding of a progressively increasing posteffect induced by the rotating treadmill training (the inadvertent &#x0201c;podokinetic adaption&#x0201d;) speaks for a definite capacity of learning to turn while stepping in parkinsonian patients (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). On the other, the rotating platform is proposed as a new tool for rehabilitation of curved walking in PD patients, a critical task in these patients, hardly addressed by current rehabilitation treatments (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Possible advantages of the rotating platform with respect to overground curved walking training may depend on the possibility that this type of exercise might contain subtasks comparable to those contained in dance exercise, which has been used with success in rehabilitation training in parkinsonian patients (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Further, and importantly so as far as the rehabilitation design is concerned, the rotating platform offers continuous stimulation, standardized training, safety setting, and no provocation of dizziness.</p><p>In order to recommend a comprehensive approach to the issue of curved walking in parkinsonian patients, the results of further experiments would be necessary, in which patients would be asked to also walk along the edge of the rotating treadmill. This latter task does not promote much the rotation of the legs relative to pelvis, but challenges the control of balance along the frontal plane (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>) and the production of the appropriate centripetal force for a given angular velocity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This second option of the use of the circular treadmill, and the potential advantage of combining stepping at the center and at the edge of the rotating platform, will be tested in a following investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS, MGo, and AN designed the study; AN and FP performed the neurological evaluations; MGo, MGi, and AT performed the experiments; MGi, AT, and MC collected and processed the data; MS, MGo, and MGi wrote the manuscript; AN revised the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S8"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported in part by a &#x0201c;Ricerca Finalizzata&#x0201d; grant (RF-2011-02352379) from the Italian Ministry of Health and by &#x0201c;PRIN&#x0201d; grants (2009 JMMYFZ and 2010 MEFNF7 006) from the Italian Ministry of University and Research.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Huxham</surname><given-names>FE</given-names></name><name><surname>McGinley</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Iansek</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>
