A further aim was to investigate whether there were any differences in change over time in these variables between an intervention group that was introduced to SBAR and a comparison group. Still another aim was to study whether there was any change in the proportion of incident reports due to communication errors. We hypothesised that implementation of the communication tool SBAR would improve staff members&#x02019; perception of communication within and between different professions as well as their safety attitudes, thereby decreasing reports of incidents caused by communication errors as well as increasing staff members&#x02019; perception of psychological empowerment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A prospective intervention study with comparison group using preassessments and postassessments was used. The study involved one intervention group in which the SBAR was implemented (staff at an anaesthetic clinic at one hospital) and one comparison group (staff at another hospital's anaesthetic clinic). Questionnaires were delivered at baseline and at follow-up 6&#x02005;months after implementation, and the proportion of incident reports at the two hospitals was measured during a 1-year period prior to and after implementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004268F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004268F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outline of design (SBAR, Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004268f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample and procedures</title><p>A total of 316 questionnaires, and 2 reminders, were delivered to all staff (licensed practical nurses (LPNs), registered nurses and physicians) working in the operating theatres, ICUs and postanaesthesia care unit at anaesthetic clinics in the two hospitals during spring 2011. The two hospitals were located in the same county council and thus the clinics shared the same top management.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The decision to implement the communication tool SBAR at the clinic was taken by the management. Strategies to facilitate the implementation were: modifying a SBAR card, in-house training course, information material and observations during 7&#x02005;months of the implementation period. A pocket SBAR card was slightly modified prior to implementation by a local interprofessional workgroup to adapt it to needs at the clinic. The intervention included an in-house training course (2.5&#x02005;h of instruction and role playing) and implementation of the communication tool SBAR. During the introduction period May to September 2011, 155 of 194 (80%) staff were trained and the rest were offered continuous training. Informational material describing SBAR was distributed to all staff in the intervention group, who received the pocket card describing the SBAR structure to be used. At the postanaesthesia care unit, the SBAR card was also attached to the patients&#x02019; tables, where most handovers were conducted, and on the wall in the room where the physician's handovers were conducted. At the ICU, a printed SBAR template was used for the receiver's notes during handovers. All staff members in the intervention group were encouraged to take part in the training course and to use the communication tool SBAR in their daily work. The period with an in-house training course was followed by a 7-month monitoring period, which consisted of 168 structured observations of handovers carried out by four members of the local interprofessional workgroup. The observations were used by management to monitor the intervention process and as a feedback to the intervention group. In the comparison group, no structured communication system was used.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Manipulation check</title><p>A careful control of the implementation is required for interpretation of the findings.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> To check whether SBAR was implemented as intended, measures were made during a 7-month period to follow the implementation. In the intervention group, structured telephone interviews were conducted by one author (MR) with a random sample of 10 staff each month, except for 1&#x02005;month when only 6 staff members were reached. In total, 11 physicians, 17 intensive care nurses, 10 anaesthesia nurse, 8 operating theatre nurses and 20 LPNs were interviewed. Results showed that the majority of staff had taken the in-house training course and had used the SBAR tool during the past seven working days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data collection</title><p>Questionnaire data were collected prior to implementation of SBAR in April 2011 and at follow-up 6&#x02005;months after completion of the implementation period in October 2012. To measure communication within and between different professions, the ICU Nurse&#x02013;Physician Questionnaire<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> was used, and the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> was used to measure staff members&#x02019; attitudes towards six patient-safety-related domains. Spritzer's empowerment scale<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> was used to measure psychological empowerment. Incident reports were collected from the hospitals&#x02019; registration systems during a 1-year period prior to (1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011) and after implementation of SBAR (1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013).</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>The <italic>ICU Nurse&#x02013;Physician Questionnaire</italic> (short version, section 1)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> consists of five factors: within-group communication openness (4 items); between-group communication openness (4 items); within-group communication accuracy (4 items); between-group communication accuracy (3 items) and communication timeliness (3 items). The original questionnaire was created to address the relationship between nurses and physicians only, but because LPNs are a common staff group in Sweden, the questionnaire was adapted for LPNs and thus to suite Swedish working conditions. The term within-group communication means communication within the same profession (eg, physician's perception of communicating with physicians) and the term between-group communication means, for example, physician's perception of communicating with nurses and physician's perception of communicating with LPNs and so on. The items are answered in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;Strongly Disagree&#x02019; to &#x02018;Strongly Agree.&#x02019; Negatively worded items are reversed before factor scores are averaged. The ICU Nurse&#x02013;Physician Questionnaire has shown satisfactory psychometric properties. Cronbach's &#x003b1; values (&#x003b1;) for the five factors have been 0.64&#x02013;0.88.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Translation of the questionnaire was conducted forward by the research team and back-translation was carried out by a bilingual translator.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the present study, &#x003b1; values were between 0.68 and 0.88 at baseline and

Thus, in the intervention group, safety reporting seemed to improve but the proportion of incident reports due to communication decreased significantly.</p><p>The improvement in staff members&#x02019; perceptions of between-group communication accuracy after implementation of the communication tool SBAR seen in the present study is similar to findings from a study by De Meester <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> where nurse&#x02013;physician communication also improved. In a study by Manojlovich and DeCicco,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> between-group communication was shown to be a significant predictor of perceived medication error.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Nurses and physicians are trained to express themselves in different ways,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and communication between different professions is known to be a contributing factor in surgical malpractice claims.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As staff members&#x02019; perceptions of between-group communication accuracy improved, it would seem that SBAR was able to bridge differences in style of communication.</p><p>Safety climate also improved, and the proportion of incident reports due to communication errors decreased in the intervention group, which may indicate that safety performance improved. One study<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> of 91 hospitals found that a higher level of safety climate was associated with higher safety performance at the hospital level. Furthermore, Huang <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> studied 30 ICUs in the USA using SAQ and found that lower safety climate was associated with patient outcomes such as increased hospital length of stay. However, another study by Rosen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> failed to show a relationship between safety climate and hospital safety performance. As in the present study, improved perception of safety climate has also been found in studies<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> of rehabilitation settings in which SBAR had been implemented. Verbal communication errors were found to be an important cause of severe patient safety incidents.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, there was a decrease in the proportion of incident reports due to communication errors. According to the present results, one can assume that SBAR made communication safer, resulting in a decrease in incident reports due to communication errors. This interpretation is also in line with our hypothesis. We also hypothesised that a secondary outcome of implementing SBAR could be an increase in staff members&#x02019; perception of psychological empowerment. In the present study, it would seem reasonable to assume that SBAR training should have increased staff members&#x02019; empowerment, but no such effect was found during the study period.</p><p>In the comparison group, there were no significant changes in staff members&#x02019; perceptions of communication accuracy or safety climate. However, the factors between-group communication openness, perception of management at the unit and working condition improved significantly over time. During the period between baseline and follow-up, there were work-related changes in the comparison group that may have affected the results. The staff in the operating theatre had increased in size, and there had been discussions of the importance of collaboration at the ICU. When working condition is improved one can expect that communication also improves.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>The strengths of the present study were that measures of safety culture and the number of incident reports related to communication were included, as previously recommended,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and that a comparison group was used. Furthermore, during 7&#x02005;months of the implementation period, we followed the implementation using a manipulation check involving randomised structured telephone interviews. An additional support in the implementation was observations of handovers conducted by the local interprofessional workgroup. In a simulation study, low adherence was found for use of SBAR during a 1-year period after implementation in a hospital.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the present study, the manipulation check and observations showed that SBAR was in use at the clinic. One other strength is that the questionnaires used have shown satisfactory psychometric properties, and Cronbach's &#x003b1; values in the present study for all instruments, total scale and factors were over 0.68. Although the two groups were different in size, there were no significant differences in the demographic data. The distribution was not normal and a limitation was that it was not possible to carry out multivariate analysis to correct for the differences at baseline in some variables as &#x02018;between-group communication openness&#x02019;, &#x02018;perception of management unit&#x02019; and &#x02018;working conditions&#x02019;. The response rate was satisfying, exceeding 70% at baseline and follow-up in the two groups. When interpreting the present results, possible threats to internal validity should be considered. First, the very nature of the quasi-experimental design entailed selection biases: the participants were not randomly assigned and there were statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the comparison group at baseline. Although the comparison group had higher baseline levels on the five factors that could have affected the results, there was still room for improvement. Second, the loss of subjects poses another threat to internal validity, in that the dropouts had statistically higher scores on the factor Teamwork climate and statistically lower scores on the factor Competence than the participants did. On the other hand, the number of dropouts was moderate. There were also differences in incident reporting. The comparison group had an overall lower frequency of registered incident reports. There may be several reasons for this, for example, that the frequency of incidents was actually different or that there was a difference in the tendency to report incidents. Third, an additional threat to internal validity was that there may have been some diffusion of the intervention to the comparison group, which could have affected the results. Further research dealing with these methodological issues is needed to confirm our results.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Implementing the communication tool SBAR in anaesthetic care can improve communication between professionals, improve the safety climate and reduce incidents caused by communication errors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e180" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004268.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004268.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors (MR, GM, CLS and ME) contributed to the design, interpreted data, drafted and revised the article critically.
