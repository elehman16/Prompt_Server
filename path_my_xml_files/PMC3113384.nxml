Although investigators have used various prostaglandin analogues to initiate uterine expulsion, misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue) is currently favored because of its safety, low cost, availability, stability at room temperature and oral route of delivery. Addition of mifepristone to misoprostol makes the myometrium more sensitive to the stimulatory effects of prostaglandin, which aids in uterine evacuation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Use of medical method with mifepristone and misoprostol has been evaluated in several studies, but there is still a dilemma in the available literature regarding side effects and acceptability with these routes of misoprostol administration. The present study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of oral and SL misoprostol in the management of early fetal demise.</p><p>Primarily, Tang <italic>et al</italic>. explored a new route of administration of misoprostol, i.e. SL route. Recently, it has been established by several studies that SL route of administration of misoprostol demonstrated a great potential to be developed into a method of medical abortion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>This study gives an insight into the safety profile of these routes, which was always an area of focus for clinicians before its clinical application.</p><p>In the present study, difference in the hemoglobin level was found to be statistically significant in the oral group. Number of cases having higher degree of blood loss was more in the oral group. In both the groups, there was no significant change in the hemoglobin level, while only one case had severe blood loss with a hemoglobin difference of 3.1 g/dl and required blood transfusion and surgical evacuation. Possible explanation of excessive blood loss was type 2 pregnancy (missed abortion), longer period of gestation (72 days) and requirement of higher doses (1800 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g).</p><p>Although pain is inherent with the process of abortion and has been found to be most common complaint by the patients in various studies, tolerability was variable from patient to patient. Cramping pain in the abdomen was the most common side effect of mifepristone-misoprostol regimen but could be managed with oral analgesics. Lower abdominal pain was tolerable to most of the cases in both the groups. However, cases requiring analgesics were more in the oral group. None of the cases in either group required parental analgesics.</p><p>Lesser occurrence of nausea and vomiting in the present study appears to be due to the fact that maximum cases (86%) in this group aborted with a single dose (600 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) of misoprostol, while most of the previous studies used higher doses (600-1800 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] When the frequency of GI side effects was compared in both the groups, it was found to be higher in the oral group, as the dose requirement of misoprostol for complete abortion was more in the oral group. In the present study, none of the cases in group 1 had fever more than 1000&#x000b0;F, while 8% (four cases) in group 2 had fever &#x0003e;1000&#x000b0;F, which appears to be due to due to the requirement of higher doses to abort (four doses in three cases and three doses in one case). Higher occurrence of fever in the other mentioned studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] appears to be due to the use of higher doses of misoprostol.</p><p>In the present study, 92% cases were satisfied and 8% cases were dissatisfied with the regimen in the SL group. Complete abortion and failure rate of the regimen was 92 and 8%, respectively. Thus, acceptability of the regimen was solely dependent on the success of the treatment as side effects were tolerable to all cases. However, in group 2, 72% cases (36 out of 50) were satisfied while 28% cases (14 out of 50) were dissatisfied. Among these 14 cases, failure of treatment was the reason for dissatisfaction of 8 cases; remaining 6 cases were dissatisfied with the regimen due to intolerable side effects, especially bleeding and GI side effects. Therefore, efficacy of the regimen is the determining factor for the acceptability of the method in most cases in both the groups. Rate of acceptability in the present study is the same as reported in earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, it can be concluded that SL route of administration of misoprostol is better in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability than the oral route.</p><p>Many studies have been performed earlier on this, but are few in number to come to any conclusion. The present study with more clear selection criteria and study method tries to lay the platform to carry out further studies.</p><p>Small sample size and open label were the limitations of the study. Further double-blind studies are needed with a large sample population to elucidate the safety and optimal dosage of misoprostol.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>My deep sense of gratitude to Zeashan
