The incidence of the use of HRAs was highest in discharge prescriptions and dispensing records (72.7%) followed by prescriptions from in-patient wards (47.3%). After the intervention, the overall incidence of HRA was significantly reduced by 52% (ie, 53.6% vs 25.5%; p=0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of HRAs across all three settings: the pharmacy department (72.7% vs 39.3%), inpatient settings (47.3% vs 23.3%) and emergency wards (40.9% vs 10.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pharmacist-led educational interventions can significantly reduce the use of HRAs by healthcare providers.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In hospitals, prescription and administration errors are major threats to patient safety, with an estimated incidence of 18.9&#x02013;58.4%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref> There are many reasons why medication errors occur, but in most cases the errors can be linked to poor communication or transcribing of the physician's message. A contributing factor in poor communication is the use of shorthand or ambiguous abbreviations when writing prescriptions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although the use of abbreviations is time saving, it does not promote patient safety.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the USA, it has been estimated that &#x0223c;5% of medication errors reported in medical care are associated with the use of unsafe abbreviations leading to patient harm.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Using shorthand or abbreviations in prescriptions tends to become habitual practice if not discouraged. On-the-job training or educational activities have been shown to be a significant help in the eradication of this habit, with several studies having confirmed that educational interventions are an effective tool for the improvement of prescribing skills and, consequently, patient safety.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref> The Institute for Safe Medical Practices (ISMP), together with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), launched a nationwide educational campaign in 2006 to prevent the use of unsafe and error-prone abbreviations in healthcare facilities and developed a list of abbreviations, symbols and dose designations that should be avoided while communicating all sorts of medical information.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Subsequently, many countries have followed suit. For instance, the New South Wales Therapeutics Advisory Group (NSWTAG) developed quality indicators according to the ISMP and FDA recommendations to discontinue the use of abbreviations in Australian hospitals.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Another concept that has been the focus of attention in this regard is the increased emphasis on promoting a safety culture during the teaching and training of medical students and residents.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Pharmacist-led educational interventions have been shown to improve safe prescribing practices as well.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Like any other country, medication errors are of great concern in Saudi Arabia. Although the overall incidence of medication errors in the Kingdom is not available, studies have reported a prescribing error incidence of 8&#x02013;56 per 100 medication orders in hospitalised patients.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In Saudi Arabia, the healthcare workforce largely consists of expatriates educated and trained in different countries including, but not limited to, the UK, the USA, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia and the Philippines. In addition, Saudi Arabia attracts more than 10 million pilgrims across the globe to visit holy mosques each year who receive free medical treatment, if required. Therefore, given the high number of patients and diversity of healthcare workforce (in terms of culture, language, clinical education and training), healthcare providers may use high-risk abbreviations (HRA) that could in turn lead to prescribing, transcribing and administration errors, especially in acute care facilities dealing with pilgrims. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the extent of use of HRAs in an acute care setting and impact of a pharmacist-led educational intervention to reduce the use of HRAs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led educational intervention to reduce the use of HRA by healthcare professionals (ie, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and relevant assistants) in an acute care setting.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Method</title><p>A quasi-experimental study using a single group before-and-after intervention design<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> was conducted from 1 February 2011 to 1 July 2011. Although randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are best suited to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we were unable to design an RCT due to the unavailability of a suitable control group. The limitations of using a quasi-experimental design are further discussed in the limitations section. The primary outcome was reduction in the incidence of HRAs, as a proportion of all prescriptions, from the preintervention to postintervention period.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Settings</title><p>The study was conducted at an acute care facility specially designated for pilgrims visiting Majsid-Al-Haram (The Grand Mosque), Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The hospital on average provides emergency care to more than 5000 pilgrims a year. In addition to the outpatient department and the pharmacy department, the hospital has a 10-bed Coronary Care Unit (CCU) and 10-bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p><sec id="s1b1"><title>Identification of prescriptions with HRA</title><p>During the study period, electronic prescribing was limited to inpatient physician orders only. All handwritten physician orders, medication administration records (MRAs) and pharmacy dispensing sheets from the inpatient (ICU and CCU), outpatient (male and female emergency wards) and pharmacy departments were reviewed for HRAs by six senior pharmacy students, who had received formal training in clinical research and data collection, under the direct supervision of the first author (AH). For the purpose of this study, HRAs referred to &#x02018;medical abbreviations, dose designations, drug names, or symbols considered unsafe and likely to result in misinterpretation.&#x02019; These were identified on the basis of the ISMP's list of error-prone abbreviations by a team of experienced pharmacists based on hospital usage.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> At first, 62 abbreviations were selected, but these were later narrowed down to 32 items, based on the frequency of use and severity of the consequences.

Another study conducted in a large university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia reported a 65% decrease in use of unsafe abbreviations following the implementation of an educational intervention.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The ISMP recommends that reduction of HRAs is one of the most effective strategies to improve standards of medication safety.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is especially because HRAs are closely linked to medical errors and life-threatening consequences but can be easily avoided when prescribing.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In routine practice, the pharmacist occupies a key position where errors can be identified before medication is dispensed to patients or dispatched to a ward. It is vital, however, to educate the healthcare team to adopt a safety culture that aims to avoid or minimise the use of HRAs. In this study, it was seen that the overall incidence of HRAs was 53.6%, which is higher than that reported by other studies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The educational interventions led by the pharmacist have been shown to have a positive effect on the behaviour of physicians with respect to the use of HRAs and significantly reduced the overall incidence, which is in line with the findings of other studies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

Of these, three items were also identified in our study as well: &#x02018;U for units&#x02019;, &#x02018;&#x003bc;g for microgram&#x02019; and the lack of a leading zero before a decimal. A possible explanation might be that these abbreviations are widely accepted; many prescribers have used them for decades and are reluctant to change.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Although only 14 of 32 surveyed items were actually identified as occurring in this study, this does not imply that the remaining abbreviations are unimportant, as they might nonetheless be occasionally used by healthcare professionals.</p><p>Since the highest incidence of HRAs was noted in the discharge prescriptions and dispensing records kept in the Pharmacy department, pharmacists, as the last point of contact, are the key professionals for the prevention of medication errors. Meyer suggested that ongoing educational programmes, follow-up reminders and feedback to prescribers can greatly improve prescribers' prescription-writing habits.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Accordingly, pharmacists should participate in an educational programme to help improve their prescription-writing skills with the use of acceptable abbreviations and feedback any medication errors on a regular basis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>There are a number of clinical implications for this study. First, the incidence of using HRAs in an acute care setting is alarmingly high, which may lead to medication errors, necessitating an action plan to discourage the use of HRAs. Second, a pharmacist-led educational intervention can potentially reduce the use of HRAs in clinical practice. Third, the use of handwritten prescriptions should be discouraged as they are sometimes illegible and prone to misinterpretation. Finally, healthcare professionals in Saudi Arabia are predominantly expatriates with a diverse educational, cultural and linguistic background, so it is important to develop safe prescribing guidelines at the local and national levels to ensure patient safety. In the USA, many organisations<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> dealing with patient safety have tried to discourage the use of error-prone abbreviations and dose expressions in healthcare settings over two decades, but the prescribing practice is only decreasing slowly. Similarly, in the UK, prescribers are encouraged to use English in place of Latin abbreviations.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Interestingly, &#x02018;o.d. or OD for every day&#x02019; and &#x02018;o.n. or ON for every night&#x02019; are considered unsafe but are nonetheless commonly used in routine clinical practice. Educational interventions on a periodic basis can be one of the ways to modify prescriber behaviour and limit the use of HRAs.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitation</title><p>The findings of this study should be considered in the context of the study design limitations.

Owing to the lack of randomisation and control groups, several threats to the internal validity of before-and-after quasi-experimental studies have been reported in the literature including maturation, the Hawthorne effect, regression to the mean, dropout and testing.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Second, the number of prescriptions reviewed during the post-intervention phase was about 25% less than that during the preintervention phase. As mentioned above, the study site is specifically designated for pilgrims and there are seasonal variations in the number of pilgrims. The decrease in patient numbers may have contributed to the decrease in the incidence of HRAs observed in the post-intervention phase. However, the incidence of using HRAs was reduced by 52%, which is significantly more than the decrease in the number of prescriptions seen in the post-intervention phase, suggesting a positive intervention effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Educational interventions led by pharmacists can be effective in reducing the use of HRAs by physicians and other healthcare providers, leading to a decrease in medication errors. In this study setting, the use of HRAs was noted to be high, which can compromise patient safety; therefore, it is essential for the regional and national Saudi health authorities to devise and implement policies and protocols to discourage the use of HRAs. Future research should explore the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions in reducing the use of HRAs in emergency and other settings using well-designed randomised controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Pharmaceutical Research Centre, Deanship of Scientific Research, Umm Al-Qura University for funding this project.
