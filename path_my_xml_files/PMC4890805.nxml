Of those, the straight leg raise (SLR) test is the most widely used, reliable and valid in detecting intervertebral disc herniations verified at surgery [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>It is generally accepted that the SLR tests the mechanosensitivity of the L5 and S1 nerve roots by means of lifting the patient&#x02019;s lower limb with an extended knee which applies tension to the related neural structures. However, the precise mechanical effects on the nerve roots in response to this test are still a matter of debate between researchers.</p><p>It is known that, even though in varying amounts, the lumbosacral nerve roots move distally (between a minimum of 0.5 mm and a maximum of 10 mm) depending on the study and methods, which include cadavers and patients at surgery [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It appears that the neuromechanical effects are due to distal application of tension through the hip, knee and ankle producing elongation of the nerve bed in the lower limb [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also, contributing to this elongation, knee extension produces distal movement of the sciatic nerve in the thigh [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although the SLR is popular and with it there exist small variations in the amount of movement of the nerve roots between studies, there is consensus in the direction of movement which is caudal [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Even though the magnitude of nerve root excursion with the SLR is not entirely consistent between studies, it has become important for measurements of spinal cord excursion to be made. This is because, now that normal baseline measurements have been made [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we are in a position to measure any deviations from normal in symptomatic populations, hence potentially contributing to radiological diagnostic efficacy.</p><p>Rade and colleagues demonstrated conus medullaris caudal displacement of 2.33&#x000b1; 1.2 mm with the unilateral SLR and 4.58&#x000b1;1.48 mm with the bilateral SLR, both tests to 50&#x000b0; hip flexion [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, at 60&#x000b0; SLR the conus caudal displacement was shown to increase, with 3.54 &#x000b1; 0.87 mm of caudal displacement with unilateral SLR and 7.42 &#x000b1; 2.09 mm with bilateral SLR [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In both studies it emerged that the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement with unilateral SLR was doubled with the bilateral SLR. This phenomenon was explained by the &#x0201c;principle of linear dependence&#x0201d; in which, due to the structural continuum of neural tissues in which the lumbosacral neural roots are directly connected via the cauda equina to the spinal cord, and in which the tensile forces can be transmitted throughout these neural structures and the dura, the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement is proportional to the displacement of L5 and S1 nerve roots and dependent on the number of nerve roots involved into the movement (i.e. unilateral and bilateral SLRs).</p><p>However, in their original investigation, Rade and colleagues did not provide a conclusive answer to the question of whether it is the conus medullaris that displaces caudally within the spinal canal in response to a SLR, or it is actually the spinal canal that adjusts around the spinal cord in response to the pelvis motion during SLR.</p><p>In 1978 Breig documented significant differences in mechanical responses of L5 and S1 nerve roots when the SLR was performed with the knee flexed [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nearly no displacement was found with a Sham SLR, with the accepted explanation being that, as the knee flexion movement did not allow the sciatic nerve to be tensioned and pulled distally by the maneuver, tensile forces were not transmitted along the nerves [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155927.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0155927.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0155927.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Breig&#x02019;s cadaver investigations showing the effects on L5 and S1 nerve roots within and outside the foramina with A) SLR and B) Sham SLR with hip and knee flexion.

It is easily noticeable that the paper marks are drawn further from the foramina as a result of transmission of tensile forces distally along the sciatic nerve (A).

cord displaced caudally by an average of 3.54 &#x000b1; 0.87 mm in response to the genuine SLR test with 60&#x000b0; of hip flexion, and by an average of 0.32&#x000b1;1.6 mm with the Sham SLR to the same range of hip flexion as with the genuine unilateral SLR, indicating that the conus displaces significantly less in absence of tensile forces transmitted through the lumbosacral nerve roots and dura, as with the Sham SLR.</p><p>Interestingly, contrary to what was measured with unilateral SLRs, the mean values collected during Sham SLR showed minimal conus medullaris displacement which was in the proximal direction instead of distal. It is of interest to highlight that, in this study, conus medullaris displacement in response to Sham SLR occurred indiscriminately in both caudal and proximal direction relative to the adjacent vertebral body, and showed to be very consistent in terms of direction and magnitude within subjects, but not between subjects. This means that in some subjects the conus displaced always proximally and in some always distally by the same magnitude every time the maneuver was performed.</p><p>On a mechanisms level, this may be explained by the spinal cord remaining in its original position in the absence of tensile forces transmitted through the lumbosacral nerve roots and dura, while the spinal canal is adjusting around the spinal cord, as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155927.g006">Fig 6</xref>. It might be hypothesized that the conus displacement during Sham SLR actually indicates the magnitude of adaptation of the vertebral canal around the static conus, quantifiable in 0.32&#x000b1;1.6 mm. Following this, the conus displacement in response to unilateral SLR may be due both to i) transmission of tensile forces throughout the nerves and dura inducing free neural sliding and due to ii) reciprocal movements between the spinal cord and the surrounding vertebrae. These two components can be easily discerned by mathematical subtraction so that:

Image copyright: Ivan Barun, MD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0155927.g006"/></fig><p>So out of 3.54 mm of conus displacement (absolute values) recorded during standard unilateral SLR, 3.22 mm may be attributable to pure neural sliding relative to the adjacent vertebral body and 0.32 mm to adaptation of the vertebral canal around the conus in response to pelvis movement during a SLR (3.54mm&#x02013; 0.32mm = 3.22mm).</p><p>These values would be summing up (3.54mm + 0.32mm = 3.86mm) if the reference point was located outside the subject&#x02019;s body, as in that case both conus and vertebrae would move in the same direction relative to and external reference point. As it is possible that pain is provoked when there is a restricted range of motion of neural structures relative to their interface mostly due to tensile stress acting upon those neural structures, in our opinion it is more relevant and clinically meaningful to quantify the sliding of neural structures relative to their adjacent interfacing musculoskeletal structures. With these results, the authors expect that the sliding of neural structures in the vertebral canal may indeed represent a protective mechanism which preserves the spinal cord and neural roots from excessive strain. If this were true, the preservation of free sliding of the neural structures in the vertebral canal, along with the associated meninges, might indeed be an essential condition for maintaining an asymptomatic spine.</p><p>Moreover, on statistical power calculation emerged that 2621 subjects would be needed to be scanned to achieve statistical significance for conus medullaris displacement with a right Sham SLR, and 78 with a left one. This suggests that the observed power of the measured phenomenon is extremely low. From these results, it may be said that the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement with a Sham SLR is possibly irrelevant (&#x0003c;0.5mm).</p><p>The high correlation values presented in this study show that these movements in response to both Standard and Sham SLRs were consistent and reproducible but, as the magnitude and direction of the movements during the Sham SLR seem to be consistent within subjects, but not between subjects, it seems that they cannot be predicted generally.</p><p>Three relevant points emerge from the presented data: i) reciprocal movements between the spinal cord and the surrounding vertebrae are likely to occur during SLR, ii) conus medullaris displacement in the vertebral canal with SLR is primarily due to transmission of tensile forces through the neural tissues, iii) when tensile forces are transmitted through the neural system as in the clinical SLR, the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement prevails over the amount of bone adjustment.</p><p>The notion that during the clinical SLR the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement prevails over the amount of bone adjustment due to transmission of tensile forces throughout the neural system indicates that SLR is indeed prevalently a neural test.</p><p>Moreover, it might be that unrestricted reciprocal motion between neural and interfacing musculoskeletal structures inside the spinal canal and possibly foramina may be the conditio sine qua non for maintaining an asymptomatic spine [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore possibilities relating to measurement of such displacement may have future diagnostic value. Efforts are currently taken by the authors of this study to investigate such responses in patients with radiologically proven intervertebral disc herniation causing sciatica.</p><p>Transmission of tensile forces along the sciatic nerve and L5 and S1 nerve roots with SLR has been shown to occur by Gilbert and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In their experiment, SLR with ankle dorsiflexion was shown to increase tension in the L5 and S1 nerve roots compared to the genuine SLR.</p><p>They also quantified neural excursion during the unilateral SLR to be 0.48&#x000b1;0.55mm for L5 and 0.51&#x000b1;0.73mm for S1, which is much less that presented in our actual paper and in the existing literature. The authors&#x02019; explanation was that the lesser amount of neural root displacement was primarily attributed to the preservation of intact foraminal ligaments in the investigated cadavers, however it seems that further reasons for such differences may lie in i) the old age of the cadavers donors (average 78.2 years) which can warrant for age-related degenerative changes that may have altered the normal biomechanics of the investigated region, ii) the lack of full knee extension in two of the five explored cadavers and iii) the fact that pelvic and spinal motion were limited with lag bolts screwed into the Ilium bilaterally, which did not allow to replicate completely the clinical SLR [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The points i) and iii) were discussed also by Gilbert and colleagues in their paper.</p><p>Also Smith and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] prevented pelvic motion while measuring lumbar nerve roots displacement with SLR in cadavers by fixing the pelvis with a metal spike driven through the anterior iliac wings and into the underlying wooden board. However, they presented results showing caudal sliding of 1.4 mm for L4, 2.1 mm for L5 and 2.5 mm for S1 nerve roots which is in agreement with previous works [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this case, neural sliding may have been aided by their posterior unilateral laminectomies and facetectomies which may have impaired the function of foraminal ligaments.</p><p>A relevant notion that emerges from these two studies is that both foraminal ligaments integrity and natural pelvic motion should be preserved when attempting to replicate the clinical SLR performance in cadaver investigations. Performance of those investigations in in-vivo and structurally intact human subjects helps fulfill this requirement.</p><p>Intact foraminal ligaments and natural pelvic motion were maintained in our study. However, it is possible that hamstrings muscles might have had a different impact on pelvis movement between genuine SLR and Sham SLR. Unfortunately we were not able to quantify this effect as the MRI field of view was limited to the thoracolumbar spine. This point represents a possible limitation to our study and suggestion for future improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From the data presented in this investigation it emerges that i) reciprocal movements between the spinal cord and the surrounding vertebrae are likely to occur during SLR, ii) the conus medullaris displacement recorded with SLR is primarily due to transmission of tensile forces through the neural tissues, iii) when tensile forces are transmitted through the neural system as in the clinical SLR, the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement prevails over the amount of bone adjustment.</p><p>It appears that, even though both spinal canal adjustments and neural tension contribute, the neural tension mechanism dominates the process.</p><p>These results are similar to those presented by Breig in his cadaver investigations [<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
