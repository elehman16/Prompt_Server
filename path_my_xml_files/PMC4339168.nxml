rehabilitation education program for caregivers on patients who underwent lung resection
surgery. [Subjects] Subjects who underwent lung resection by visual assisted thoracotomy
(VATs) were selected and divided into a control group of 19 and an experimental group of
22. [Methods] The experimental group received a pulmonary rehabilitation education program
for caregivers, while the control group received typical care for 4 weeks. This study
assessed the subjects 2 weeks (baseline) and 6 weeks after surgery (4 weeks). The forced
vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) were measured to
evaluate pulmonary function. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was utilized to evaluate pain.
[Results] Pulmonary function (FVC and FEV1) increased more in the experimental group
compared with the control group. Furthermore, VAS scores were lower in the experimental
group compared with the control group. [Conclusion] A pulmonary rehabilitation education
program for caregivers had a positive effect on pulmonary function in patients with lung
cancer after lung resection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Caregiver</kwd><kwd>Lung resection</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lung resection is an important treatment option for patients with lung cancer. However,
many such patients, particularly those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
have a high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is growing interest in the use of non-pharmacological
interventions after lung resection or during cancer care, such as radiation therapy and
chemotherapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been proposed to decrease the risk of
postoperative pulmonary complications<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is necessary to develop a home-based exercise program to improve the function of patients
and prevent postoperative pulmonary complications because the out-patient period is longer
than the in-patient period. However, previous studies have focused mainly on PR for
in-patients or only hospital workers, such as doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and
respiratory therapists, provided the PR. Few studies on education programs for caregivers,
which are the main supporters of home-based exercise programs during the outpatient period,
have been conducted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a PR education
program for caregivers on pulmonary function and pain in patients with lung cancer after
lung resection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects comprised patients hospitalized within the Department of Thoracic Surgery of a
National University Hospital between March and November 2013 who had not previously partaken
in a pulmonary rehabilitation education program for caregivers and were scheduled for lung
resection. This study was approved by the National University Hospital of Health Science
Human Ethics Committee; all subjects provided written informed consent prior to
participation. During the hospital stay for the surgery, all 50 subjects received the same
general management (typical care) and were randomly divided into an experimental group (n =
25) and a control group (n = 25). Three subjects dropped out of the experimental group, and
six dropped out of the control group during the 4-week study due to application of the
exclusion criteria. Therefore, the study was completed with 22 subjects in the experimental
group and 19 in the control group. Patients with other cardiopulmonary diseases, a
congenital chest deformity, or rib fractures were excluded. After surgery, patients who
received additional chemotherapy that weakened their body function were also excluded, as
were those who did not attend the weekly PR education program. The assessments of subjects
were performed by a physical therapist who was blinded to any information about the groups.
The control group received the entire typical care program, including pain management,
general education for postoperative care, incentive spirometer use training, mobilization of
the upper limbs and trunk, and nebulizer use instructions from the Department of Thoracic
Surgery. The experimental group partook in the PR education program for caregivers once per
week for 30&#x02005;min, under the direction of a physical therapist instructor. The PR education
program included instruction regarding splint cough, airway clearance techniques, diaphragm
breathing, segmental breathing, exercises for upper and lower extremities, walking
exercises, and stair exercises. The instructor demonstrated the procedures to caregivers,
and then the caregivers practiced with their patients while the instructor observed.
Pulmonary function was assessed by MicroLab (Micro Medical Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Forced
vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) were measured in
accordance with the American Thoracic Society guidelines<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain after lung resection was evaluated using a visual analogue
scale (VAS)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Data were encoded and
analyzed using SPSS for Windows ver. 12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical
significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. The homogeneity of the general characteristics
between the two groups was analyzed by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and independent t-test. The
differences in the changes between the two groups before the experiment and at 2 weeks
(baseline) and 6 weeks after surgery (4 weeks) were assessed by repeated-measures analysis
of variance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The average age, height, weight, and BMI of subjects were 60.22 &#x000b1; 10.89, 163.01 &#x000b1; 8.77&#x02005;cm,

FEV1/FVC ratio did not change, but the inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume decreased
rapidly by ~40% in the acute stage after lung resection in 31 patients with lung cancer
(mean age, 59 &#x000b1; 10&#x02005;years). Varela et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that FEV1 decreased rapidly 1 day after surgery and then recovered slowly during the
next 6 days, but it did not reach the previous level. Our results were similar, as the
FEV1/FVC ratio at baseline was 0.86 in the control group and 0.90 in the experimental group.
However, the change in FVC differed before and after the experiment, as that in the
experimental group increased by 21.1% compared with 5.8% in the control group. This was
believed to be caused by the short study period (4 weeks) and the fact that each group
received a different intervention. In contrast, a pilot study by Spruit et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, applied an 8-week PR exercise program to
inpatients who had undergone lung resection for lung cancer: all pulmonary functions, with
the exception of FEV1, differed significantly, including functional exercise capacity. It
would appear that the PR education program for caregivers, designed to improve pulmonary
function (FVC and FEV1), was responsible for these differences: the previous study had
focused on strengthening and aerobic exercises, such as walking. The pulmonary
rehabilitation education program for caregivers had a positive effect on pulmonary function
in patients with lung cancer following lung resection. In a previous study, the pain score
(VAS) of patients who had undergone lung resection was 3.3 immediately after surgery, 2 at 2
weeks, and 1.5 at 6 weeks after surgery<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In our study, the VAS revealed significantly decreased pain in both groups, but no
difference was observed between the two groups.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Licker</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Widikker</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Operative mortality and respiratory complications after
