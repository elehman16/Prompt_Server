Ideally, the same dose of a given product would achieve comparable aesthetic outcomes regardless of the injection technique used. However, there is a paucity of literature concerning the impact that different injection techniques might have on the aesthetic outcome achieved and any safety considerations related to one or both techniques.

The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee of Vallex M Clinic, Moscow. All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Women between 40 and 65 years of age, with a score of 1-4 according to the validated Merz Aesthetics Hand Grading Scale (MAS; a 5-point scale for assessment of hands; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>])[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible for inclusion in the study. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy; any cosmetic procedures or injections in the treatment area within the last 6 months; previous injections of permanent fillers in the treatment area (including fat transplants); previous surgery or scars on the dorsal area of the hands; and excess of subcutaneous fat or hypertrophy of muscles in the hand.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The validated 5-point MAS for assessment of age-related skin changes of the hands.

Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated at 0, 30 and 60 minutes after injection. Thereafter, assessments took place at Day 14, Month 2, Month 3 and Month 5 post-injection. At each assessment, standardized digital photographs (9 &#x000d7; 12 cm) were taken using a NIKON D100 camera, with the same hand position, background and lighting conditions used for each hand. Assessments of hand skin quality from the photographs were carried out by one of two independent evaluator physicians blinded to the treatment procedure. Participants completed two questionnaires that assessed skin condition of the hands and treatment satisfaction. A final follow-up was performed by telephone call at Month 6. Given that the efficacy and safety of Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has been demonstrated elsewhere, the study duration of 5 months was deemed sufficient to meet the objectives of comparing the efficacy and safety of two different injection techniques using Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Treatment efficacy endpoints firstly comprised improved score on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] assessed by both participant and evaluator at Day 14, Month 2, Month 3 and Month 5, and secondly comprised responder rates defined as the proportion of women with an improvement versus baseline of &#x02265;1 and &#x02265;2 points on the MAS.</p><p>Satisfaction with treatment was assessed using a questionnaire titled &#x02018;Satisfaction with results of the procedure&#x02019;, which participants completed at Day 14, Month 2, Month 3 and Month 5.

Results showed that subcutaneous injection of Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the dorsal aspect of the hands was effective and well tolerated for the rejuvenation of aging hands. The study period was deemed sufficient for valid comparison of the two injection techniques; longevity of treatment effect was not an objective of this study. Our study supports the findings of Marmur and colleagues, who reported high patient satisfaction and no AEs in five women who received dermal fillers for hand augmentation over 24 weeks.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In addition, a report by K&#x000fc;hne and Imhof described the efficacy of a single bolus injection technique for Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment to rejuvenate the appearance of the hands.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Both injection techniques used in the current study achieved similar cosmetic results with Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The responder rates for both techniques were comparable over time, and mean scores on the MAS at each time point were similar for both techniques. Participant-assessed data show that, at Day 14, better results were noted for the C hand than the <italic>N</italic> hand. It is likely that this was due to slight swelling that persisted after the more invasive fanning technique, creating the impression of a successful correction of age-related changes (less pronounced atrophy, visualization of the veins and tendons). Indeed, after the period when swelling might reasonably be expected to resolve, there were no significant differences in GAIS score as assessed by either the independent evaluator or study participant. Participant-assessed GAIS scores indicated a high level of satisfaction with both injection techniques, which is an important finding for an aesthetic procedure.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the small number of participants.</p><p>Both injection techniques were generally well tolerated and associated with mild tenderness, edema and ecchymosis. None of the AEs reported post-injection were serious, and all events resolved spontaneously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy of two different subcutaneous injection techniques with Radiesse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for the correction of age-related changes in the hands, whether administered by cannula or needle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the statistical assistance provided by Maria Y.
