composition, health-related physical fitness, and serum lipids as part of efforts to
encourage middle-aged people to participate in walking as a regular and sustainable
exercise. [Methods] This study was conducted as a pretest-posttest control group study.
The study period was for 12 weeks from January to March 2010. The participants were 43
middle-aged women (age range: 40&#x02013;55&#x02005;years) with body fat rates over 30%. Subjects in the
experiment group participated in the walking exercise (n = 38), the control group did not
participate in the exercise (n = 23). [Results] In the exercise group, statistically
significant reductions in weight and body fat were observed among the body composition
measurement variables, and statistically significant increases in flexibility and
cardiopulmonary endurance were observed among the physical fitness measurement variables.
TC, TG, and LDL-C levels in the serum lipid measurement variables showed a statistically
significant reduction in the exercise group. [Conclusion] The results of this study showed
that 12 weeks of walking exercise influenced middle-aged women in a positive way by
effecting changes in their body composition, physical fitness, and serum lipids. We
believe that these positive changes result in positive effects on the factors for
prevention of various adult diseases that can occur in middle-aged women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Walking exercise</kwd><kwd>Physical fitness</kwd><kwd>Middle-aged women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The decreases in the fertile and pregnant populations and birth rate have accelerated the
aging of Korean society, resulting in an increase in the elderly population. With the
increase in the elderly population, increased attention should be given to the middle-aged
population, which includes people in the stage prior to the old age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical, psychological, and mental factors of middle age directly or indirectly affect the
quality of life in old age. Unhealthy middle age is the precedent step to unhealthy old age.
Improperly managed middle age can cause unexpected unhappiness in old age. Therefore, a
healthy old age life can stem from a well-managed and balanced middle age life. Moreover,
health in middle age is being emphasized in South Korea aging society.</p><p>Middle-aged women experience gradual weakening of physical functions with aging and show
decreased physical activities. This decrease increases the obesity rate, causing middle-aged
women to be susceptible to various musculoskeletal problems such as osteoporosis and other
degenerative diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
postmenopausal middle-aged women have reduced ovary functions due to estrogen deficiency,
and the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood increases due to
reduced estrogen stimulation and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activities. In
addition, they are susceptible to adult diseases such as coronary diseases because of a
rapid increase in the lipid concentration in the blood and subsequent decrease in the
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regular aerobic exercises are suggested for middle-aged and older women to help them
overcome their physical and physiological changes and stabilize their mental and
psychological status through participation in society activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the aerobic exercises, walking is the most popular
physical activity, and it can be done easily without the use of any devices. Physical and
physiological improvements through walking exercise have been shown in a number of studies,
and positive influences are observed in most cases. Hence, walking can be an effective
exercise from the perspective of preventive medicine. Yet studies on the effects of walking
on blood and physical factors in obese middle-aged women have not been conducted
sufficiently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was conducted to identify the effects of walking on the body composition,

Body
composition was evaluated by measuring body weight, muscle mass, and body mass index (BMI).
Physical fitness was evaluated by measuring muscle strength, flexibility, muscle endurance,
and cardiopulmonary endurance. Muscle strength was determined by measuring the maximum grip
strength by using the dominant hand (pf/kg). Flexibility was measured by a sit-and reach, in
which the subject sat with the knees completely straight and reached forward slowly using
both the hands together (unit: cm). Muscle endurance was measured through and exercise test
using sit-ups, and the maximum number was recorded for 30&#x02005;s after a beep (unit: number).
Cardiopulmonary endurance was measured using a treadmill and a gas analyzer (QMC 5000, USA).
The Bruce protocol was used for the exercise test, and the maximum exercise point of the
participant was set at the maximum heart rate and a respiratory exchange rate of over 1.15
for each age range. The indicator for cardiopulmonary endurance was the point where oxygen
intake did not increase even with an increase in exercise intensity. For serum lipid test,
the participants fasted from 10:00 (am) of the previous day, and 5&#x02005;mL of blood was collected
from the brachial vein the following day between 08:00 and 10:00 am. After blood collection,
the vials were centrifuged, and TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels were analyzed in the
hemanalysis department.</p><p>The walking program was designed such that the number of calories burned was gradually
increased to 150&#x02005;kcal/hr by reducing the weight and increasing the walking speed. The
initial exercise duration was 20&#x02005;min, which was gradually increased to 40&#x02013;55&#x02005;min; the
initial frequency was 3 times a week, which was increased to 5 times a week. Details of the
walking durations and frequencies are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table

the heart and blood vessels improves so cardiovascular diseases such as coronary diseases
are prevented or delayed, thereby preventing various health problems in middle-aged
women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study results showed a significant decrease in weight and body
fat in the exercise group that participated in the 12-weeks of walking exercise.</p><p>In the study by Nindel et al. (2000), weight and body fat were significantly decreased as a
result of 24 weeks of aerobic exercise 5 times a week<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jang (2009) reported that the weight, body fat, and muscle mass
decreased significantly in middle-aged women who participated in boxing aerobics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the studies of Park (2009) and Park
(2011) on body composition, significant decreases in weight and body fat were shown, which
implies that aerobic exercise and walking affects the body composition of participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This result is considered to be due to the high breakdown rate of lipids through exercise;
lipid usage is increased through an oxidation process, resulting in the reduction of weight
and body fat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cholesterol (TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C) is a serum lipid found in the blood along with neutral
fat and phospholipids. An increase in serum lipids expedites arteriosclerosis and is one of
the main reasons for cardiovascular diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, this lipid is a risk factor for adult diseases in
middle-aged women having reduced female hormone levels and physical fitness because of
decreased physical activities caused by aging. Significant decreases in TC, TG, and LDL-C
levels an increase in HDL-C level, although not significant, were observed after the 12-week
walking program in this study.</p><p>In the study of Ju (2010) on the influence of a 12-week-walking Pilates program in
middle-aged women, the serum lipid, TC, TG, and LDL-C levels reduced significantly, and the
HDL-C showed no significant increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
On the other hand, in the study Kim (2009), significant decreases in TC, TG and LDS-C and
significant increases in HDL-C levels were observed in obese women after a 24-week walking
with running exercise program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. We
assume that a significant increase in HDL-C was not observed in this study because of a
difference in the exercise period and intensity. Both this study and the study of Ju (2010)
were conducted for 12 weeks, whereas the study of Kim (2009) was for 24 weeks and was a
combination program of walking and running exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, tHDL-C might have increased because of high&#x02013;intensity
exercises and exercising for long periods. Therefore, further studies are required to assess
differences in these factors.</p><p>Generally, significant changes in serum lipid levels are observed because aerobic exercise
blocks the LDL-C from accumulating on the arterial walls and facilitates the TC removal
mechanism in various cells, including smooth muscles in arteries, through increased HDL-C
levels, anti-arteriosclerosis, and catabolism during the transport of cholesterol to the
liver. The results of this study could be interpreted as a proof of this theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">2012 Year, Aged Population
