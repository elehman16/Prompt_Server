KO has multiple causes that produce similar biological, morphological and clinical symptoms. The major clinical features of KO are pain with physical activity, restricted ability to walk and stand, and a progressive deformation of the knee joint. KO is frequently accompanied by obesity/overweight (90%), hypertension (40%), depression (30%) and diabetes (15%). These comorbidities contribute to a decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Globally, it is estimated that 24% of the general adult population suffers from osteoarthritis. Symptomatic osteoarthritis affects 9.6% men and 18% women 60&#x000a0;years or older and its prevalence increases with age, up to 80% in people over 65&#x000a0;years of age in high-income countries. The increase in life expectancy will raise the number of patients affected by osteoarthritis. In the USA, 19% of the general population has a radiographic diagnosis of KO and 7% present knee symptoms. The prevalence of osteoarthritis is 17% and 16.6% in the general Spanish and Catalan populations, respectively, while the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis is 10.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Osteoarthritis is responsible for the loss of 1.9 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in people between 50 and 84&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The loss in obese individuals can reach 3.5 QALYs. According to Hunter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], mortality rates in patients with osteoarthritis are higher compared with the general population (Standardized Mortality Ratio 1.55: 95% CI: 1.41-1.79). Osteoarthritis generates high costs (&#x020ac;1,502 per patient yearly), most of which (86%) are direct costs derived from medical care and dependency, such as help at home and at work. Indirect costs refer to loss of productivity and include help at home for affected housewives. It is, therefore, a condition with a high social impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies carried out in Norway and Spain show that the national cost for osteoarthritis can reach &#x020ac;3,528 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and &#x020ac;4,700 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], respectively.</p><p>Clinical guidelines for osteoarthritis recommend a non-pharmacological first-line treatment for patients with osteoarthritis which should include weight loss, healthy eating habits, physical activity, self-management of pain, information-education and orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In particular, they recommend the education of patients even if the current evidence remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, non-pharmacological recommendations frequently lack precision regarding contents, duration, intensity and frequency and might result in the suboptimal care afforded to osteoarthritis patients observed in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A great diversity of educational interventions takes place in primary care. Most of them are based on brief advice as recommended in the clinical guidelines and in primary care journals. Accordingly, the recommendations related to osteoarthritis within the &#x0201c;<italic>Health Plan for Rheumatological and Musculoskeletal Conditions</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] aim to encourage all measures that enhance quality of life through health promotion, prevention and self-care, with a particular emphasis on modifiable risk factors such as obesity, optimal use of orthoses and exercise. The recommendations also underscore the need to minimize variability in clinical outcomes by improving the efficiency of diagnosis and therapy through a specific training of primary care doctors and nurses.</p><p>Self-management education programmes targeting patient education and behaviour modification were not more effective than usual clinical practice, information or other alternative therapies according to Kroon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the authors conclude that clinical trials that assess other self-management educational programmes for osteoarthritis might be warranted. Our study is based on the behaviour change framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which takes into account Argyris&#x02019; theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the links between change processes and determinants of behaviour such as Prochaska&#x02019;s stages of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Some interventions that focus on the promotion of healthy habits include two essential aspects: complexity and use of health coaching. The complex, multimodal and multidisciplinary design results in an intervention better suited to its context which therefore achieves better results and greater sustainability. The Medical Research Council has established a methodology for complex interventions that consists of several phases that can be repeatedly implemented and that use qualitative and quantitative methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Health Coaching originates within the conceptual framework of behaviour change and specifically in Argyris&#x02019; Action Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Health Coaching is a behavioural intervention to facilitate patients adopt and sustain their own health related goals, change attitudes, decrease unhealthy habits, improve the management of chronic conditions and generally increase health related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Health coaching can improve treatment adherence in chronic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], is effective towards glycemic control and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], oncological pain, self-management of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], moderate weight loss and the improvement of healthy habits that result in weight loss and the promotion of a healthy diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Several research protocols currently include coaching-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyles in elderly people at moderate risk of suffering from cardiovascular conditions, diabetes and depression, and also for patients on low incomes and poorly-controlled diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Coaching is conducted by a medical assistant as a health coach and with telephone support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These interventions can be carried out by different health professionals and even by people suffering from the same condition (peer health coaching); in this last instance, these patients must receive coaching training. In the study of Thom and colleagues, the researchers themselves were the coaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], whereas in Thomas et al. the trainer was a psychologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>No studies on the application of health coaching to osteoarthritis of the knee have been published to date. Moreover and to our knowledge, clinical guidelines for osteoarthritis of the knee are not implemented in primary care when the treatment of choice is non-pharmacological. Since most guidelines recommend non-pharmacological treatment for pain self-management, weight loss and increased physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], our study aims to provide evidence on the effectiveness of health coaching on KO by developing a complex intervention that will focus on the patient and will encourage participation, to promote the patients&#x02019; knowledge of their condition and to facilitate the achievement of their therapeutic goals in accordance with their own resources. Telephone support will ensure that the patient manages the osteoarthritis with the highest possible independence and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to implement a flexible, complex intervention adapted to the people with osteoarthritis and that is feasible, effective and sustainable in primary care centres. The intervention aims to promote healthy behaviour, decrease unhealthy habits and improve quality of life and the control of osteoarthritis. Ultimately, it should encourage a healthy and active ageing process by preventing also other prevalent diseases. Indeed, health promotion behaviours contribute to a less dependent and a more satisfactory older age.</p><p>In line with the WHO recommendations for active ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], to remain socially and mentally active the coaching intervention of our study will encourage the use of the patient&#x02019;s own strategies to: 1. promote healthy habits and physical exercise to reduce risk factors of disease; 2. promote cognitive vitality; 3. promote a positive approach to problems and emotions; 4. promote social participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>If the study proves the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the intervention, a local adaptation could be incorporated into the clinical guidelines and implemented in primary care centres. In our study the health coach is a psychologist who will also train primary care professionals to integrate coaching in everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Main objective</title><p>To analyze effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an intervention based on health coaching and telephone support on quality of life, pain, overweight/obesity and physical activity in patients from Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) of the Barcelona province suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee, compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To identify the barriers and facilitators of an intervention based on health coaching with a qualitative study that includes individual interviews to patients suffering from osteoarthritis and group interviews with primary care professionals, with the aim to design an intervention adapted to primary care patients and professionals.

In this phase we will specify the different components of the intervention and determine the factors related to patients, professionals and other that facilitate or restrict the intervention (acceptability, adequacy, feasibility, integration within other programmes, location, schedule and duration).</p><p>The qualitative study will use a socioconstructivist perspective and theoretical sampling. Ten semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients suffering from osteoarthritis to identify their beliefs, knowledge and perceptions on the components and conceptual model of the intervention.</p><p>We aim to reach discourse saturation through interviews to men and women of different ages and literacy levels. The four discussion groups will include 8&#x02013;12 primary care professionals working with patients with osteoarthritis to identify their attitudes, opinions, motivation and to verify their competence on coaching, knee osteoarthritis and information and communication technology (ICT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Operationalization of the intervention</title><p>The results of the qualitative study will provide information towards the operationalization of the intervention, so that it adapts to the needs and reality of the PHCCs patients and professionals.

Masked, anonymized literal transcriptions of the recorded sessions will be produced. After consecutive readings of the transcriptions and the formulation of preanalytical intuitions, we will analyse the social status of patients and professionals. Next, we will analyse the discursive fractions, determined by their positioning in relation to the subject discussed (discursive positioning). Then, we will generate a global interpretation of the text in relation to the objectives of the research to organize the whole discourse and to link it to the context (symbolic configuration). Next, we will carry out the internalist analysis of the text looking for semantic attractors and associative chains (semantic configuration) with the assistance of the Atlas-Ti programme.

The variables will be measured in both groups between 5 and 10&#x000a0;days before the intervention, immediately after the intensive phase (1&#x000a0;month) and after 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months of recruitment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). During the first interview we will measure the height (in meters). The same scale of the PHCC will be used to measure weight. During the follow up phase of the study, the nurse will measure weight and record physical activity for the intervention group. Participants from both groups will receive reminders before follow up visits. For each assessment, one of the study researchers will call up to three times during the day to make the appointment. During the visit, he/she will fill out the questionnaires by interviewing the participant; other clinical data will be extracted from the electronic medical records by the general practitioner or nurse. Empathic communication with study participants will be sustained during all phases. Two independent investigators will enter the data in a centralized database; data quality will be assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Randomization</title><p>To avoid contamination between study groups, the PHCC will be the randomization unit.

In order to achieve a power of 80% (beta: 0.2) and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 for a two-tailed comparison, 124 participants will have to be recruited in each group to detect differences equal or higher than 5 units in the Womac index. An estimated standard deviation of 14, a correlation between the first and second measurement of 0.6 and 20% loss to follow-up have been assumed for these calculations. To take into account the randomization by PHCC, we consider a design effect of 1.45 with a mean number of patients per intervention group of 10 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The required sample size has been estimated at 180 patients per group: 9 primary care teams with 20 patients each will be recruited for each study group. The statistical package GRANMO v7.12 (IMIM, BCN, Spain) was used for sample size calculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis following CONSORT CLUSTER criteria to avoid bias by incomplete datasets.

According to the distribution of the variables, descriptive analysis will be carried out using the mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) or frequency (percentage).</p><p>For comparisons within and between the intervention and control groups we will use Student t-tests for independent and paired data, McNemar, Chi-Square, Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test, analysis of variance and the corresponding non-parametric tests when appropriate.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention between both groups during follow up, the change in the intervention group minus the change in the control group, as well as the standardized effect size (SES) will be calculated. SES will be calculated as the mean difference between both groups divided by the standard deviation of the control group. To detect differences within each group, the difference between the means at baseline and at each follow up time and the effect size or standardized response mean (SRM) following Kazis&#x02019;method will be calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The SRM will be calculated as the mean change divided by the standard deviation of the change. To evaluate SRM and SES we will use Cohen&#x02019;s rule, which classifies effect size as small (0.2-0.5), medium (0.5-0.8) and large (&#x0003e;0.8).</p><p>We examined the effects of intervention over all time points using mixed-effects models on repeated measures.</p><p>Multilevel ordered logistic regression will be used for the response variable &#x0201c;physical activity&#x0201d;, in which patients are categorized in three levels: low: &#x0003c;600 METs. min/week; moderate: &#x0003e;&#x02009;=&#x02009;600 and &#x0003c;1500 METs min/week; high: between 1500 and 3000 METs min/week.</p><p>The PHCC will be considered a random effect.

To this end, effective strategies are required to assist people in the modification of their lifestyles. People with established chronic conditions or at risk of developing them need to change behaviors to improve their health, quality of life and to make a better use of health services.</p><p>Clinical practice of knee osteoarthritis in primary care is not standardized. Most guidelines agree on the need to start with a non-pharmacological approach and to focus on lifestyle changes that will also prevent adverse effects of treatments and reduce costs. Since health coaching has been effective in lifestyle changes, our study aims to influence the lifestyle of patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis, most of them over the age of 60 and with comorbidities.</p><p>In the introduction we mentioned Argyris&#x02019; Action Theory. Argyris differentiates between the chosen theory, the theory we verbalize when we are asked about the motivations and approaches to our tasks, and the Theory-In-Use inferred from the observation of our actions; these theories do not always coincide. People do not always express what they actually do, the main reason being the lack of consciousness on how we really act in a situation. If we focus on explaining the patients what we must do (education) it is very likely that we change the words of the chosen theory without changing what we actually do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Our study aims to empower participants after they have observed their actual behaviour and understood its undesired consequences. Next, the contexts where that behaviour has been learned will be analyzed (meta-reflection). Finally, new practices to replace past behaviours will be rehearsed. Accordingly, during the development of the study professionals and patients will reflect on their own practices and behaviours. This will directly impact on patients by enhancing their quality of life and promoting healthier lifestyles and on professionals by improving the results of their practice. It will also generate novel communication strategies between patients and professionals.</p><p>This study contains the following limitations: (1) the participants are patients in the PHCCs, which could affect the external validity of the results. However, our health system has universal coverage and over 70% of the population attends yearly the PHCCs; (2) patients with knee osteoarthritis present comorbidities and generally visit the PHCC more often; (3) despite the high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis, clinical practice is highly heterogeneous and the clinical guidelines are barely followed. However, the variability in clinical practice should affect equally the intervention and control groups and the multilevel analysis will take into account and quantify this variability.</p><p>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex intervention conducted in primary care centres through a Health Coaching Programme on patients with knee osteoarthritis, most of whom are over 60&#x000a0;years of age. The improvements on society and on the patients&#x02019; quality of life are in accordance with the WHO tenets for active ageing. Consequently, with this intervention we aim to: 1. achieve a significant improvement of health; 2. assist in changing and maintaining healthy lifestyles and improve the clinical management of patients with knee osteoarthritis; 3. promote active ageing; 4. prevent other conditions thanks to lifestyle changes; 5. provide strategies to remain physically active; 6. provide strategies to remain socially active; 7. provide strategies to remain mentally active; 8. if the study shows the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the intervention the results could be transferred to the clinical guidelines and implemented in the primary care centres; 9. allow the professionals and the patients to voice their opinions and their experience of the study; 10. maintain healthy lifestyles through asset mapping; 11. inform primary care professionals via Newsletter; 12. disseminate the results in international journals; 13. disseminate the results through a manual for health professionals; 14. disseminate the results to the general public; 15. disseminate the results in national and international meetings.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p>Western ontario mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALYs</term><def><p>Quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KO</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis of the knee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p>Primary care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHCC</term><def><p>Primary health care centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical research council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICT</term><def><p>Information and communication technology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IG</term><def><p>Intervention group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p>Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Standardized effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRM</term><def><p>Standardized response mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p>Metabolic equivalent</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AB, EP, JM, TR and VC contributed to the conception and design and methodology of the study.
