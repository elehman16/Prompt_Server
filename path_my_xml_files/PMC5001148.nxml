Despite improvements in risk factor profiles and robust treatment recommendations aimed at preventing diabetes-related complications, CVD remains the leading cause of death among individuals with type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and increased risk of CVD is a major health concern.</p><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its follow-up the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study demonstrated the beneficial effect of intensive therapy on atherosclerosis and major CVD events (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The analyses demonstrated that hyperglycemia was a major risk factor for CVD in type 1 diabetes. However, there have been few studies with robust long-term data published evaluating the influence of levels of hyperglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes on changes in established CVD risk factors, such as lipids or blood pressure. The DCCT/EDIC study provides the opportunity to explore the interrelationships of traditional CVD risk factors and glycemia in a carefully studied cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes over an extended period of time.</p><p>Herein we describe the long-term changes in CVD risk factors observed over a 30-year period of follow-up in the DCCT/EDIC study. The aims are to evaluate the association of glycemic exposure with CVD risk factors and their coprogression, and to describe differences in CVD risk factors between the original DCCT intensive treatment and conventional treatment groups. Delineating the relationship between glycemia and traditional CVD risk factor progression over time may prove beneficial to understanding macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetes as well in providing insight for preventive treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the DCCT intervention and the EDIC observational follow-up study have been published previously (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Briefly, 1,441 subjects with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in the DCCT between 1983 and 1989. Approximately half of the cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 711) was randomized to receive intensive therapy with a goal of safely maintaining blood glucose levels within a near-normal nondiabetic range. The remainder (<italic>N</italic> = 730) were assigned to conventional therapy with a goal of clinical well-being and freedom from symptoms related to both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The following two parallel cohorts were recruited: the primary prevention cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 726), with diabetes duration of 1&#x02013;5 years, no retinopathy (microaneurysms or worse), and a urine albumin excretion rate (AER) &#x0003c;40 mg/24 h; and the secondary intervention cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 715), with diabetes duration of 1&#x02013;15 years, mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and an AER of &#x02264;200 mg/24 h. Subjects with a history of CVD or with hypertension (blood pressure &#x0003e;140/90 mmHg or receiving medication) or hyperlipidemia (fasting serum cholesterol level &#x02265;3 SDs above age- and sex-specific means) were not eligible to participate.</p><p>After an average of 6.5 years (range 3&#x02013;9) of follow-up, 1,422 subjects completed a closeout visit (99% of the original cohort). Subjects who were originally assigned to receive conventional treatment were encouraged to adopt intensive therapy, and subjects in both groups were returned to receive care from their own health care providers. In 1994, 96% of the surviving DCCT cohort enrolled in the EDIC observational study, and after an additional 20 years of follow-up, 1,251 participants (94% of the surviving cohort) continue to be followed.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Evaluations</title><p>Although more frequent medical visits occurred during the DCCT, the present analyses focus only on the data obtained at annual visits during both the DCCT and the EDIC study. In longitudinal analyses, study years 0 through 9 represent the DCCT, and years 10 through 30 the EDIC follow-up study. Owing to staggered entry into the DCCT and the fixed DCCT duration, the numbers evaluated decline over DCCT years 5&#x02013;9.</p><p>Each annual visit included a detailed medical history including demographic and behavioral risk factors, medical outcomes, and a physical examination, which included measurements of height, weight, sitting blood pressure, and pulse rate (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Pulse pressure was defined as the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. Blood samples were collected at each annual visit and were assayed centrally for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, using high-performance ion-exchange liquid chromatography. Fasting lipids (triglycerides, total, and HDL cholesterol) were measured annually during DCCT and in alternate years during the EDIC study, and were evaluated centrally (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Concurrent medication usage was collected during the EDIC study, but not during the DCCT. However, the current cardiorenal protective agents were either unavailable (statins, angiotensin receptor blockers) or not prescribed according to protocol (ACE inhibitors) during the DCCT.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Classification of CVD Risk Factors</title><p>For this analysis, risk factors were classified into the following four major categories: protocol dictated (DCCT treatment group, primary prevention vs. secondary intervention cohort); demographic (sex, age, weight, BMI, smoking, drinking alcohol, physical activity, family history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, type 1 and type 2 diabetes); traditional (blood pressure, pulse pressure, pulse rate, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL and LDL cholesterol); and diabetes related (diabetes duration, stimulated C-peptide level, estimated glucose disposal rate, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> level) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Weight and BMI were evaluated separately in men and women. In addition to the current HbA<sub>1c</sub> value, the DCCT updated mean was used to reflect the cumulative glycemic exposure from baseline up to and including the HbA<sub>1c</sub> at each visit throughout the DCCT. The DCCT/EDIC study time-weighted arithmetic mean was calculated using the quarterly DCCT values and the annual EDIC study values weighted by 3 and 12 months, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics of the DCCT/EDIC study cohort by treatment group assignment at DCCT baseline (1983&#x02013;1989) and by the 30th year of DCCT/EDIC study follow-up (2013)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left" scope="col" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="2" align="left" scope="col" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1">DCCT baseline (1983&#x02013;1989)<hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1">Average over DCCT/EDIC<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1">Intensive treatment(<italic>N</italic> = 711)</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conventional treatment(<italic>N</italic> = 730)</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t1n1">*</xref></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensive treatment(<italic>N</italic> = 711)</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conventional treatment(<italic>N</italic> = 730)</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t1n1">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protocol</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cohort (% primary prevention)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t1n2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2818</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Physical</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (% women)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t1n2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3169</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t1n3">&#x02021;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 &#x000b1;

Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess covariate effects on the mean of each quantitative risk factor over repeated time points, and generalized estimating equation models were used to assess effects on the prevalence of each binomial risk factor. The DCCT/EDIC study year (time 0&#x02013;9 years representing the DCCT, and 10&#x02013;30 years representing the EDIC study) was included as a class effect. The models assumed an unstructured covariance structure, or, in cases where the model did not converge, a heterogeneous compound symmetry structure. Covariates measured repeatedly over time entered the models as time-dependent covariates. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the associations among each of the protocol-dictated, demographic, traditional, and diabetes-related risk factors at the DCCT baseline. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of collinearity was completed (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The signed <italic>t</italic> statistic was used as a measure of the magnitude and direction of the association between an outcome and a covariate.

Over the course of the entire 30-year study period, subjects in the conventional treatment group had a higher overall mean pulse rate (73 &#x000b1; 7 vs. 72 &#x000b1; 7 bpm, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0094) over all visits combined, a higher triglyceride level (77 &#x000b1; 27 vs. 72 &#x000b1; 27 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002), and higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> level (8.5 &#x000b1; 1.0% vs. 7.8 &#x000b1; 1.0%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

The pulse pressure (systolic &#x02212; diastolic) also increased from a mean of 42 mmHg at DCCT baseline to 52 mmHg by year 30, mainly due to the decrease in diastolic blood pressure beyond year 17 rather than to the increase in systolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

These reports also demonstrated that hyperglycemia is a risk factor for CVD in individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, it is not known to what extent glycemic exposure influences the magnitude and direction of long-term changes in established CVD risk factors among patients with type 1 diabetes. The ongoing long-term follow-up of the DCCT/EDIC study cohort provides an opportunity to answer this question.</p><p>In the present report, we have examined the coprogression of CVD risk factors and their interactions with glycemic exposure among DCCT/EDIC study participants over a 30-year period of follow-up. Although age is a major risk factor for an increased risk of clinical CVD events in the general population, it was not strongly associated with increases in many risk factors in the DCCT/EDIC study cohort, with the exception of a positive association with BMI in men, systolic (but not diastolic) blood pressure, and pulse pressure. Likewise, sex was not strongly associated with lipid profile. These results suggest that the well-known influence of age and sex on clinical CVD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes is not predominantly driven by their effects on traditional risk factors. The lack of an association between the duration of diabetes and traditional CVD risk factors (notably, blood pressure and lipid levels) should be interpreted with caution, as an increasing proportion of participants received medications for the control of hypertension and dyslipidemia during the EDIC study period.</p><p>Although ambient HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in the intensive and conventional group came together at the beginning of the EDIC study follow-up period, the DCCT/EDIC study time-weighted mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> values continue to be significantly higher in the conventional group. We found that the strongest longitudinal associations were among the current HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and lipid measurements, although other significant associations also emerged. The strong association among higher current HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and higher triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels is consistent with the known effect of poorly controlled diabetes on lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Triglyceride concentration during the DCCT years, when glycemic control differed markedly between groups, was lower among subjects in the intensive treatment group, despite their higher weight gain, which reflects the impact of intensive insulin therapy and improved glycemic control in regulating triglyceride levels.</p><p>The robust association of current HbA<sub>1c</sub> level with blood pressure and heart rate is concordant with known clinical associations between diabetes and hypertension, and is likely mediated by autonomic mechanisms (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The pulse pressure of study participants has widened progressively (from &#x0223c;40 to &#x0003e;50 mmHg) during the nearly 30-year follow-up period. Because a wide pulse pressure range may be a stronger predictor of heart disease than blood pressure, the latter observation is of some concern (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The traditional etiology of elevated pulse pressure is arterial stiffness, as occurs in aging, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. In this study cohort, the increasing pulse pressure resulted from a combination of rising systolic blood pressure with relatively level diastolic blood pressure during the DCCT period to EDIC study year 17, and decreasing diastolic blood pressure with stable systolic blood pressure from EDIC study year 17 onward. Among subjects without diabetes, systolic blood pressure tends to increase progressively with age, and diastolic blood pressure also rises with age until &#x0223c;60 years of age, and then decreases thereafter, most likely due to arterial stiffness and decreased vascular compliance (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Notably, the proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment increased from 6% at year 10 to 60% at year 30. The effective treatment of hypertension usually also restores pulse pressure toward more normal values. Thus, the persistent widening of the pulse pressure is not fully explained by exposure to antihypertensive agents, and could well be related to diastolic dysfunction and accelerated arterial aging associated with diabetes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The negative association between current HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and BMI could be due to glycosuria-induced weight loss secondary to poorly controlled diabetes. Other interesting observations in the longitudinal cohort include corroboration of several physiologically congruent interactions, as follows: weight was predictive of blood pressure, heart rate, and lipid profile; smoking was associated with lower BMI, lower HDL cholesterol level, and higher heart rate, and triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); and physical activity was associated with lower BMI, heart rate, and triglyceride levels, and higher HDL cholesterol levels.</p><p>The present report has several strengths, including the fact that the data were obtained from a well-documented population that has been observed for 30 years. Previous reports from the DCCT/EDIC study (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) have established an association between blood pressure and AER that was significantly modified by treatment group and glycemia. The current study extends that observation by assessing the interaction of time-averaged glycemic exposure with an array of clinical, biochemical, and biobehavioral CVD risk factors. The findings indicate that these risk factors are significantly interrelated and coprogress in a time-dependent manner. The demonstration of strong longitudinal associations among HbA<sub>1c</sub> level and traditional CVD risk factors argues strongly for a clinical directive to optimize control of blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia in the management of patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The DCCT/EDIC study has established that the updated weighted mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level over the DCCT and the EDIC study combined is a stronger determinant of the risk of progression of complications over time than is the current HbA<sub>1c</sub> value. However, herein, the current HbA<sub>1c</sub> value has a stronger association with the current value of other risk factors than does the updated mean HbA<sub>1c</sub>. This indicates that the current HbA<sub>1c</sub> value has a short-term association with these other risk factors. It would also be expected that the updated mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level would have a stronger association with the updated mean of these CVD risk factors.</p><p>Among the limitations of the study, the exclusively type 1 diabetes cohort and the lack of ethnic diversity (96% non-Hispanic white) diminish the generalizability of the findings. Also, study participants had a mean BMI of &#x0003c;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at study enrollment and &#x0223c;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> averaged over the DCCT/EDIC study period, which is not representative of the current predominantly overweight U.S. general population. Furthermore, by focusing on the interactions among glycemic and nonglycemic predictors of traditional CVD risk factors, the present report does not consider the possible contribution of nontraditional risk factors.</p><p>In conclusion, we have reported the longitudinal coprogression of glycemic and nonglycemic predictors of traditional CVD risk factors during an extensive, &#x0223c;30-year follow-up of the DCCT/EDIC study type 1 diabetes cohort. The interrelationships we observed among the predictors and the CVD risk factors are pathophysiologically congruent, and are in the same direction as prior observations based on the more definitive clinical CVD events. Over time, there were significant treatment group differences in a number of CVD risk factors and substantial associations with measures of HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Although the significant association with current HbA<sub>1c</sub> level dominated, it did not completely mediate the treatment group differences for all factors. The greater understanding of the relationships among diabetes-related risk factors and established CVD risk factors may provide insight into the design of individualized comprehensive interventions for the control of comorbidities and the reduction of CVD risk in persons with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Appendix</title><p><bold>Writing Group for the DCCT/EDIC Research Group.</bold> The members of the Writing Group for the DCCT/EDIC Research Group are as follows: Barbara H.
