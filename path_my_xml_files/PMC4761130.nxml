In this context, relatives are particularly vulnerable and prone to post-ICU syndrome, in the form of high levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief. Grieving families suffer from a feeling of abandonment and evoke the need to get back in touch with the team to ask questions and remove doubts, but very few actually do. Aiding families during the grieving process is an important aspect of palliative care. A condolence letter represents an opportunity to recognize the pain of the family member and the strong tie that linked the family member to the ICU team, and to offer additional information if necessary. The goal of the study is to measure the impact of the condolence letter on the experience of bereaved families after a death in the ICU. Our hypothesis is that a post-death follow-up in the form of a condolence letter sent by the ICU physician who was in charge of the patient may help to reduce the risks of presenting symptoms of anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Research will compare two groups of bereaved family members: one group that does not receive a condolence letter (control) and one group that receives a condolence letter 15&#x000a0;days after the death (intervention). Each of the 22 participating centers will include 12 relatives. Participating relatives will be followed up by phone with a call at 1&#x000a0;month and one at 6&#x000a0;months to complete questionnaires, permitting evaluation of post-ICU burden. The main outcome is anxiety and depression measured at 1&#x000a0;month. Other outcomes include evaluation of quality of dying and death, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will allow us to assess if sending a condolence letter can reduce the risks of presenting symptoms of anxiety and depression, complicated grief, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after the death of a loved one in the ICU.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials registration number: Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02325297">NCT02325297</ext-link> (23 December 2014).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1212-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intensive care</kwd><kwd>End of life</kwd><kwd>Condolence letter</kwd><kwd>Grief</kwd><kwd>Post-ICU syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Context</title><p>As ICU mortality is high, end of life is a subject of major concern for intensivists. With a mortality rate of 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], end-of-life care has become a daily responsibility. Many deaths follow a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment, situations where physicians, nurses, and relatives must work together towards the most consensual decision. In the ICU, relatives are no longer simple visitors: they play active roles both at the patient&#x02019;s bedside and with the team, thus creating a complex and unprecedented experience. A recent qualitative study showed that, after the loss, grieving families suffer from a feeling of abandonment by the ICU team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]: &#x0201c;<italic>During the end-of-life process you are cared for and then they sort of drop you</italic>&#x0201d;. Indeed, the way families are cared for in the ICU is &#x0201c;intense&#x0201d;: daily contact with the nursing staff and physicians, precise information, phone calls, units that are open 24&#x000a0;hours a day. When the patient dies, families do not always have the opportunity to say goodbye to the team that cared for the patient, no longer receive attention from them, and therefore feel abandoned. Furthermore, for many family members, a few months after the death questions surface, incomprehension arises, doubts accumulate, and these questions remain without answer, provoking significant suffering and sometimes guilt. Many families evoke the need to get back in touch with the team to ask questions and remove doubts so as to ease the grieving process, but very few actually do.</p><p>A recent study from the Famir&#x000e9;a research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] shows that after the death of the patient in the ICU 52&#x000a0;% of family members present complicated grief symptoms at 6&#x000a0;months and 53&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months (using the ICG scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) as well as a high risk of presenting post-traumatic stress symptoms (43.6&#x000a0;% at 6&#x000a0;months and 36.2&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months). The follow-up offered by the study (phone calls) was received as real support by the majority of families, a way of feeling not abandoned, the feeling that their pain counted, and that the ICU team continued to worry about them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Famir&#x000e9;a research group received numerous thank you letters. This brought us to consider the question of post-death follow-up and the interest of sending grieving family members a condolence letter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Condolence letters, a rare practice</title><p>Literature on follow-up with grieving families essentially concerns deaths in oncology units and in hospice care. These studies focus above all on the follow-up practices of oncology and hospice care physicians for grieving families: participation in rituals (funerals, for example), home visits, phone calls or condolence letters. Three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] highlight heterogeneous and also very unpredictable practices: condolence letters written in 30&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% of cases, few phone calls, little participation in grieving rituals. These three studies also highlight the barriers to condolence practices: lack of time or resources, the importance of maintaining professional distance, fear of professional burn-out, the difficulty of identifying which family member to contact, and, finally, the lack of recommendations for writing condolence letters. A literature review on the subject of interventions proposed to bereaved families demonstrates that many interventions are tested (from grief support groups to drug treatments to psychotherapy) without significant conclusions and that the majority of these studies suffer from significant methodological weaknesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some studies ask the question of the identity of the person who could participate in the follow-up of grieving families: most often the doctor is cited and sometimes the nurse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to note that most studies focus on the practices of clinicians (oncologists and hospice care), but no study measures precisely the impact of these strategies on grieving individuals themselves. Two studies address this point, without it being the subject of the study, and demonstrate that a good interaction with the referring doctor of the dying patient, before and after his death, reduces complications in the grieving process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and, in the case of a phone call, diminishes the feelings of abandonment and solitude of family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Caring for family members after the death of a patient is one of the pillars of a good palliative approach. In its <italic>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care</italic>, the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] puts forward that among the nine points defining palliative care, one is dedicated to aiding families during their loved one&#x02019;s illness and after death, during the grieving process. In the practical recommendation section on psychological care of patients and families, one section is dedicated to post-death follow-up and aiding grieving families during the first year of bereavement: after the patient&#x02019;s death, family members may need help and follow-up allows them to be referred to professionals, if that is judged necessary, allows their pain to be recognized, and allows them to express themselves and to get back in touch with the care team if necessary. Therefore, contact with bereaved family members in the form of a condolence letter could be part of the care recommended by these guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Condolence letter, whose responsibility?</title><p>The question of the physician&#x02019;s responsibility is posed: When does the physician&#x02019;s responsibility to his patient end? When the patient dies? Doesn&#x02019;t care of the family constitute part of the physician&#x02019;s responsibility to his patient? This reflection has fed some debates and publications, notably in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and <italic>Chest</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Throughout these papers, a consensus appears: care doesn&#x02019;t end at the death of the patient; it continues beyond with a last act of care, notably in the form of a condolence letter. &#x0201c;<italic>A physician&#x02019;s responsibility for the care of a patient does not end when the patient dies. There is one final responsibility &#x02014; to help the bereaved family members. A letter of condolence can contribute to the healing of a bereaved family and help achieve closure in the relationship between the physician and the patient&#x02019;s family</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The condolence letter not only allows family members to feel recognized and comforted but it also allows the caregiver who writes it to express his feelings and bring closure to a relationship. Finally, the practice of writing a condolence letter allows hospital units to orient their unit&#x02019;s culture towards a more humanist approach to care and to paying attention to details in the relationship with the patient, the patient&#x02019;s family, or even between the family and the patient: this is important for training young physicians and young nurses. Therefore, the condolence letter can be seen as a &#x0201c;<italic>professional responsibility of the past that is important to revive</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recommendations</title><p>The literature allows us to better understand how to construct a condolence letter. Several points should be highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]: the condolence letter should be short and handwritten; it should recognize the death and the pain of the loved one and bring him comfort; it should refer to the patient, or, if the physician didn&#x02019;t know the patient well, to what the loved one did for the patient during his hospitalization (for example, his presence, participation in the care); there should be a reminder that the medical team remains available to answer questions and give the contact information of the referring physician; finally, the physician closes the letter with the presentation of his condolences, without being too formal: a &#x0201c;personal touch&#x0201d; is recommended.</p><p>The condolence letter, an obsolete practice these days in most medical specialties, appears to be the object of renewed interest. It is recommended both for bereaved family members and for the medical care team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Justification of the research project</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that make reference to condolence letters (or any other practice used to follow up with bereaved family members) in the context of the ICU. Yet many studies have demonstrated the fragility of family members during the patient&#x02019;s stay in the ICU and after discharge, notably if the patient dies. During the patient&#x02019;s stay family members suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as well as difficulty in understanding medical information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The impact of the ICU stay on family members is real and long-lasting; a multicenter study done on 284 family members three months after the discharge or death of the patient demonstrates an important risk for family members. In fact, one-third of families show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The predictive factors are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] the quality of the information (the more the family members are dissatisfied, the greater the risk that they will present PTSD symptoms), and the death of the patient (the more the families feel they were implicated in the decision-making process for their loved one, the higher the risk of presenting symptoms of PTSD).</p><p>Strategies have been tested to reduce these long-term consequences, notably an end-of-life family conference that improves the experience of bereaved family members by reducing the risk of presenting PTSD 3&#x000a0;months after the patient&#x02019;s death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Finally, studies show on the one hand a higher risk of complications in the grieving process and a significant risk of PTSD and on the other hand that bereaved family members in this context need help, need to be recognized, need to be supported during their bereavement. A strategy must be developed to recognize both the pain of the family member and the strong tie that linked the family member to the ICU team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p>The goal of the study is to measure the impact of the condolence letter on the experience of bereaved families after a death in the ICU: Does the condolence letter to bereaved family members reduce their risk of presenting symptoms of anxiety and depression and, later, symptoms of PTSD and complicated grief?</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Post-death follow-up in the form of a condolence letter sent by the intensive care physician who was in charge of the patient&#x02019;s care may help to reduce the risks of presenting symptoms of anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Population</title><p>Bereaved family members after the death of an adult patient in the ICU, fulfilling all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.</p><p>Inclusion criteria<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Death of an adult (age &#x02265;18) patient</p></list-item><list-item><p>Death of a patient whose family has met the ICU team at least once before the death</p></list-item><list-item><p>An ICU stay of at least two days</p></list-item></list></p><p>Non-inclusion criteria<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Death of a pregnant woman</p></list-item><list-item><p>Family member who doesn&#x02019;t speak French</p></list-item><list-item><p>Refusal of the family member</p></list-item></list></p><p>As in previous Famir&#x000e9;a studies, only one family member is included: the &#x0201c;family representative,&#x0201d; that is, the designated health care proxy and, in his (her) absence, the family member most involved in the relationship with the ICU team, or by default the spouse (or partner), then the parents or children of the patient, then another member of the family.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methodology</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study.

Reducing rates of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief after a death in the ICU is important as a public health issue: people suffering from these symptoms require medical care, follow-up, and treatment.
