Unfortunately, most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an intermediate to advanced stage, with few effective therapies available at this point. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment modality for intermediate-stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Postembolization syndrome (PES), characterized by a series of symptoms, including fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and liver function impairment, is the affiliated complication of TACE. The incidence of PES after TACE ranges from 60% to 80%.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> PES usually has a manifestation and duration of action of approximately 1 to 2 weeks. It is widely considered as self-limited; however, it still remains the major reason for hospitalization and reduction in the quality of life (QOL) of patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although antipyretic analgesics, antiemetics, and cytoprotection agents may relieve these symptoms, the combination of too many drugs will exacerbate the metabolic load of the liver. Thus, a systematic approach to preventing and treating the PES is necessary.</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine Jian Pi Li Qi (JPLQ) decoction is one of the most commonly used prescriptions in our hospital. A previous study has indicated that JPLQ decoction improved the liver function and immune function impairment in vivo caused by chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A retrospective study also showed that JPLQ decoction could improve the efficacy and relieve the side effects of TACE for patients with unresectable primary liver cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, we designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to confirm whether JPLQ decoction could prevent and treat the PES caused by TACE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-1534735415617020"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-1534735415617020"><title>Patient Eligibility</title><sec id="section4-1534735415617020"><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><list list-type="order" id="list1-1534735415617020"><list-item><p>Patients with histologically or cytologically documented or radiographically diagnosed unresectable primary HCC who were candidates for TACE were included.

Eligible patients enrolled by the investigators received a patient number and were randomly assigned to receive neither herbal medicine nor placebo (group A), placebo treatment (group B), or JPLQ decoction treatment (group C). Random assignment was generated by a statistician via a computer-generated random number (using SPSS 19.0 statistical software for Windows). The statistician made up a series of sealed envelopes with random numbers that specified group assignment. Every eligible participant obtained an envelope from the statistician before admission to the treatment groups. The envelope was then opened by a nurse. After that, the nurse telephoned the statistician for group assignment. The details of the assignment and administration were unknown to any of the investigators. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment during the study. Only the study statistician could see unblinded data but could not have any contact with study participants. The study protocol was evaluated and approved by the Human Research and Ethics Committee for Clinical Studies of Fudan University Cancer Center.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1534735415617020"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="section8-1534735415617020"><title>TACE Procedure</title><p>The TACE procedures, using the Seldinger technique, were performed by the same group of doctors in the Department of Integrative Medicine, University Cancer Center on all the patients. Guided by arterial angiography, the tip of a 4F catheter, or a microcatheter with 3F outer diameter in some cases, was inserted selectively into the left or right hepatic artery or the tumor-feeding artery if technically possible. Oxaliplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was then infused through the catheter followed by a mixture of iodized oil (Lipiodol Ultrafluide; Guerbet, France) and epirubicin (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The dose of Lipiodol is calculated based on the maximum diameter of the tumor. Tumor embolization was terminated on appearance of the portal vein around the tumor. Occasionally, a gelatin sponge was used to enhance the embolic effect. If arterioportal shunts were detected on angiography, the gelatin foam particles or strips would be used to block the arteriovenous shunt.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1534735415617020"><title>Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment</title><p>Patients in groups A, B, and C were medicated as follows: with no herbal medicine taken, 200 mL decoction of raw hawthorn taken twice daily as placebo; or 200 mL of JPLQ decoction with twice daily administration, respectively.

The MDASI-GI is a psychometrically validated 24-item questionnaire containing 13 core items representing important symptoms common to all cancer types, 5 GI items, and 6 questions for the measurement of how much the symptoms have interfered with daily activities. Every item is rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. The higher the score, the greater the severity of symptoms and more interference with the patient&#x02019;s daily activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735415617020" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Armpit temperature was taken daily.

On the whole, the symptoms shifted during the treatment course in terms of symptom severity in each group.

There was no statistical difference among the 3 groups except for fever at that time, which was lower in group C, the patients assigned to receive the JPLQ formula. However, in the following days, 6 of the symptoms, including pain, fatigue, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, and constipation, were found to be relieved more significantly in patients receiving JPLQ decoction than in the other 2 groups. However, on the second day and the third day after TACE, there were no statistical differences in fever among the 3 groups, possibly because of the use of indomethacin suppository, even though fever incidence was lower in group C than in groups A and B. On the second and third day after TACE, the percentages of patients experiencing severe levels of the 7 symptoms (including fever, pain, fatigue, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, and constipation) were lower in the JPLQ group than in others. However, there were no statistical differences in severe levels of the 7 symptoms among the 3 groups during the 3 days after TACE except for drowsiness and dry mouth on the first day after TACE. Nausea, vomiting, disturbed sleep, distressed, and feeling bloated did not differ among the 3 groups. The reasons for this may be as follows: (1) before TACE, we usually used antiemetics such as tropisetron hydrochloride to prevent the reaction of nausea and vomiting; (2) disturbed sleep may be a psychological reaction to TACE; (3) during TACE, chemotherapeutic agents and Lipiodol may enter the gastric supplying arteries, causing gastric bloating, which needs more time to subside; (4) distress could be a psychological problem, which can be self-healing.</p><p>Liver function damage and renal injury were also related to the TACE procedure. The main reasons are as follows: (1) Lipiodol-induced embolization may result in ischemia, hypoxia, and necrosis in some normal hepatic cells; (2) chemotherapeutic drugs have toxicities in the liver and kidney; (3) the procedure itself can lead to considerable releasing of inflammatory factors. In our study, we found that TB level and AST/ALT ratio increased in the 3 groups after TACE, whereas there were no significant changes in AKP and renal function. After TACE, TB level and ALT/AST ratio in the herbal medicine group were markedly lower than in the control group, indicating that JPLQ decoction can relieve the liver function damage caused by TACE.</p><p>However, there are some study limitations in our trial. First of all, in our study, we did not use stratified randomization, which may be the better choice in this trial. Second, the decoction may not be the best pharmaceutical dosage form in our trial; the capsule may be more reasonable. Last but not least, the results of our study may have been more accurate and generalizable if we had conducted this trial in multiple centers with a larger population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section18-1534735415617020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, JPLQ decoction may be used to relieve PES, improve the QOL of patients after TACE, and repair liver function damage, based on this randomized controlled clinical trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> Litao Xu and Shiying Wang are first authors.
