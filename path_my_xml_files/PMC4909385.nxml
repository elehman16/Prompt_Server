However, if a website is poorly designed, difficult to navigate, and has technical bugs, it will not be used as intended. Usability testing prior to evaluating a website&#x02019;s benefits can identify barriers to user engagement and maximize future use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>We developed a Web-delivered intervention called Diabetes Medication Adherence Promotion (Diabetes MAP) and used a mixed-methods approach to test its usability prior to evaluating its efficacy on medication adherence and glycemic control in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We recruited English-speaking adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from an academic medical center who were prescribed diabetes medications. A trained research assistant administered a baseline survey, collected medical record information, and instructed participants on how to access Diabetes MAP. Participants were asked to use the site independently for 2 weeks and to provide survey and/or focus group feedback on their experience. We analyzed survey data descriptively and qualitative data thematically to identify participants&#x02019; favorable and unfavorable experiences, characterize usability concerns, and solicit recommendations for improving Diabetes MAP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Enrolled participants (N=32) were an average of 51.7 &#x000b1; 11.8 years old, 66% (21/32) female, 60% (19/32) non-Hispanic White, 88% (28/32) had more than 12 years of education, half had household incomes over $50,000, and 78% (25/32) were privately insured. Average duration of diagnosed diabetes was 7.8 &#x000b1; 6.3 years, average A1c was 7.4 &#x000b1; 2.0, and 38% (12/32) were prescribed insulin. Of enrolled participants, 91% (29/32) provided survey and/or focus group feedback about Diabetes MAP. On the survey, participants agreed website information was clear and easy to understand, but in focus groups they reported navigational challenges and difficulty overcoming user errors (eg, entering data in an unspecified format).

Very few interventions improve medication adherence, and among those that do, effects are generally small [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, most efficacious interventions have been delivered face-to-face, making them more labor-intensive and less feasible in busy clinic settings [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An estimated 84% of adults in the United States use the Internet [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], so the automated nature of Web-delivered interventions makes them a more feasible alternative to face-to-face approaches [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Web-delivered interventions have mixed effects on health behaviors [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and varied effects on glycemic control [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Wide variability in both the time spent using websites and how they are used may explain their mixed effects on health behaviors and outcomes [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Website engagement varies widely between studies [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and more engagement is often associated with greater improvement in outcomes [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A fundamental determinant of website engagement is a website&#x02019;s usability [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or how easy a user interface is to use.</p><p>The evaluation of a website&#x02019;s usability is necessary before testing its potential efficacy on health behaviors and outcomes [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Website usability is the extent to which users can effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily interact with a website [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Six factors determine a site&#x02019;s usability, including (1) an intuitive design (ie, the site is easy to understand and navigate), (2) its ease of learning (ie, how quickly a user can learn basic site tasks), (3) its efficiency of use (ie, how quickly a user can complete site tasks), (4) its error frequency and severity (ie, how often users make errors, the seriousness of the errors, and how users recover from errors), (5) its memorability (ie, how well a user can remember the site to use it effectively in the future), and (6) its subjective satisfaction (ie, how much the user enjoys using the site) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Usability testing focuses on measuring a website&#x02019;s capacity to excel in each of these 6 areas.</p><p>Usability testing ensures a Web-delivered intervention works as intended, so the target audience uses it to the degree needed to reap its potential benefits [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Usability testing studies often employ quantitative surveys, but a qualitative approach can reveal more usability problems and concerns than surveys alone [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A mixed-methods approach includes both and provides a comprehensive assessment of website usability. Therefore, we used a mixed-methods approach focused on the 6 usability areas [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to: (1) identify the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the Diabetes Medication Adherence Promotion (Diabetes MAP) website, including its usability challenges, and (2) solicit ideas for improving the site&#x02019;s usability prior to evaluating its impact on medication adherence and glycemic control in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Diabetes MAP Intervention</title><p>Diabetes MAP is a self-guided, Web-delivered intervention designed to promote medication adherence among patients with T2DM. Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s content is grounded in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model of medication adherence [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Studies in diabetes [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and other chronic disease contexts (eg, HIV) [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] suggest a patient&#x02019;s medication adherence depends on his or her adherence-related information, motivation to take medications, and adherence-related behavioral skills. Therefore, Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s intervention content addresses user-specific barriers to adherence in each of these domains. Upon registering for an account and logging in to the Diabetes MAP site, users are asked to create a medication list by searching for RxNorm-generated medications. Next, they are asked a series of questions to assess their medication adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills barriers. Entered medications and responses to these questions populate a separate page titled, My Tailored Tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>, Top Panel). This page responds to a user&#x02019;s early inputs (eg, medications entered, barriers to adherence) with a toolbox of tailored regimen-specific and IMB-model based intervention content.</p><p>My Tailored Tools houses 30 educational videos and 11 pieces of static content to enhance user-specific adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. Informational content is both medication class-specific (eg, a video on the key facts about metformin and how it works in the body for patients prescribed metformin, a video of how insulin works in the body for patients prescribed insulin) and conveys the importance of adherence for glycemic control and preventing complications (eg, a video showing the complications that can occur from not taking medications as prescribed). Motivational content is intended to enhance patients&#x02019; personal and social motivation for adherence (eg, a video on how to overcome one&#x02019;s fear of needles, static content presenting strategies for soliciting social support for adherence). Finally, behavioral skills content provides practical &#x0201c;how to&#x0201d; advice to ensure successful adherence (eg, a video with step-by-step instruction on how to inject insulin, a video on how to store insulin).</p><p>The Diabetes MAP website has additional capabilities. Its features (ie, functionality built into the site to enhance the user experience) allow users to perform various tasks (ie, clearly defined assignments to complete within a website). For example, upon creating a medication list, users can print and email this list, learn about each medication listed, set up medication dosing and refill reminders sent as text messages to their mobile phone (Figure 1, Bottom Panel), and connect to a patient portal account (ie, My Health at Vanderbilt) to communicate with healthcare providers about medication side effects and prescription reauthorizations via secure messaging. As noted above, users can also complete an IMB model-based barriers-to-adherence assessment and view user-specific educational videos and content to address users&#x02019; IMB model-based barriers. Finally, the website includes navigational videos explaining the site&#x02019;s features and giving instructions on how to complete tasks. Diabetes MAP was not designed for a specific user, but we made design choices to account for potential literacy, visual, and auditory limitations of all users. Such choices include presenting simplified language in large font, the option to watch and/or listen to videos or read video scripts, and a full-screen option to improve video visibility.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Top Panel: Diabetes MAP screenshot of the My Tailored Tools page presenting videos and content to address a user's barriers to adherence.

Recruitment strategies included advertisements about the study, referrals from healthcare providers, medical center listserv announcements, and approaching patients waiting in an adult diabetes specialty clinic or adult primary care clinic. The total number of participants enrolled (N=32) reached the target enrollment for qualitative (at least 5) and quantitative (at least 20) usability testing [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center approved all study procedures prior to participant enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>A trained research assistant (RA) scheduled interested and eligible participants to meet individually in a private room at the medical center. The RA administered (1) informed consent, (2) a survey by reading survey items and response options out loud or by distributing one available in paper-pencil format or electronic format via Research Data Capture (REDCap&#x02122;) [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that could be completed independently, and (3) a 1-page instruction guide on how to locate and access the Diabetes MAP website, which each participant was asked to independently use for 2 weeks. With permission, the RA also reviewed each participant&#x02019;s medical record to collect clinical data.</p><p>We used Mouseflow ApS&#x02122; to measure participants&#x02019; use of Diabetes MAP. After 2 weeks, the RA invited participants to provide feedback on the site&#x02019;s usability by completing a 20-minute survey and attending a 60-minute focus group session. The survey could be completed in REDCap&#x02122; via an email link or in-person immediately before the focus group session. A trained focus group facilitator used semistructured a priori questions to assess participants&#x02019; experiences with Diabetes MAP, demonstrate the site on a projector screen, and elicit responses and impressions of the site. This method is consistent with the pluralistic walkthrough approach to usability testing that involves stepping through a system with users to understand their perceptions of and experiences with a system [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The pluralistic walkthrough approach reveals users&#x02019; uncertainty with a system&#x02019;s features and tasks better than other usability methods [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We asked participants if they had challenges with using the site, their most and least favorite aspects of the site, their perceived benefits of using the site, and any recommendations they had for improving it. All sessions were audio-recorded. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and de-identified prior to analyses. We compensated participants up to $155 for completing a survey at enrollment ($25), using Diabetes MAP ($8 per hour, up to 10 hours), completing the follow-up survey ($15), and participating in a focus group ($35).</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Demographic Characteristics</title><p>Demographic information included participants&#x02019; age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, annual household income, and health insurance status. We asked participants whether they owned a mobile phone and used text messaging with their phone to better understand participants&#x02019; reasons for setting up or not setting up medication dosing and refill text message reminders in Diabetes MAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Characteristics</title><p>Participants self-reported duration of diagnosed diabetes in years and months, and the number and type of diabetes medications prescribed, including insulin. The RA reviewed each participant&#x02019;s medical record to confirm a T2DM diagnosis and the quantity and type of prescribed medications, and to collect participants&#x02019; most recent glycated hemoglobin A1c test result to characterize the sample&#x02019;s glycemic control.</p></sec><sec><title>Website Usage</title><p>We assessed participants&#x02019; website usage with data logged by Mouseflow ApS&#x02122;. Specifically, we assessed the total number of days users initiated a session by logging into Diabetes MAP, the total number of minutes users were logged into Diabetes MAP (ie, from the time they created an account until the study was over), and the average number of minutes logged in per days logged in. We also captured whether users set up text message reminders to take their medications or refill prescriptions.</p></sec><sec><title>Usability</title><p>We assessed Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s usability with 10 items adapted from the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Because the CSUQ assesses the subjective usability of a general computer system, we adapted its items to specify the subjective usability of Diabetes MAP. Example items include: &#x0201c;Overall, it was easy to learn to use Diabetes MAP&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;When I make a mistake in Diabetes MAP, I recover easily and quickly.&#x0201d; Response options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with higher scores indicating more favorable usability ratings.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data Analyses</title><p>We used SPSS version 21.0 to summarize quantitative data using means and standard deviations (SD), or frequencies and percentages as appropriate. We used selective coding [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to identify focus group comments and conversations [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] addressing the 6 areas of website usability: (1) intuitive design, (2) ease of learning, (3) efficiency of use, (4) error frequency and severity, (5) memorability, and (6) subjective satisfaction [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, we read focus group transcripts in their entirety, highlighting participant comments related to opinions about, experiences with, and suggestions for Diabetes MAP. Next, we integrated similar comments into categories. After an iterative process of integration and refinement, we mapped categories of responses onto each usability area. Units of analysis included single participant comments and multi-participant conversations reporting similar or different experiences with the site and suggestions for improving the Diabetes MAP user experience (eg, strategic placement of instructions, features and Web content).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The sample (N=32) was on average 51.7 &#x000b1; 11.8 years of age.

The memorability of Diabetes MAP was primarily hindered by its confusing URL. The Web address was lengthy, unintuitive, and included different types of punctuation and acronyms. Several participants mentioned difficulty with accessing the site specifically because of the URL. It was common for participants who forgot or mistyped the URL to search for the words &#x0201c;Diabetes MAP&#x0201d; in a search engine or in the search bar on the medical center&#x02019;s homepage. These troubleshooting techniques led users to incorrect websites and information. For example, participants who searched &#x0201c;Diabetes MAP&#x0201d; within search engines were often misdirected, leading some to online geographic maps of diabetes treatment facilities rather than the intended website intervention. Similar issues occurred when searching for the site on the medical center&#x02019;s homepage, as described by this participant:</p><disp-quote><p>I searched for Diabetes MAP on the medical center&#x02019;s site and got directions for how to get to the Diabetes Center.</p><attrib>55-year-old NHW male</attrib></disp-quote><p>Despite being both told about the website&#x02019;s intent and receiving an instructional handout with this information, participants in nearly half of the focus group sessions felt the website&#x02019;s purpose was confusing.

While discussing participants&#x02019; overall experience with using Diabetes MAP, a few participants mentioned concerns with the site&#x02019;s user interface. These participants said Diabetes MAP was difficult to operate and understand, and therefore unenjoyable to use. One participant expressed his frustration with Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s user interface:</p><disp-quote><p>I&#x02019;m not an IT person, but I&#x02019;m a supervisor in my department, and I do not have a problem [with computers]....

Common across all suggestions was a request for more simplicity and flexibility within the site. To improve the site&#x02019;s ease of learning and efficiency of use, participants wanted more straightforward methods for accessing the site&#x02019;s components. They suggested strategically placing instructions, features, and Web content in easily recognizable ways. Some participants wanted specific features to be accessible on every page, or clearly designated on their own page. For example, participants liked the idea of a page dedicated to setting up text message reminders. On this page, previously entered medication information (ie, name, dosage) would appear and users could set up reminders for when to take specific medications and order prescription refills.</p><p>To improve the site&#x02019;s intuitive design, participants recommended the navigational videos be minimized or eliminated entirely.</p><disp-quote><p>[The navigational video] is a distraction for me because if I have to scroll down for whatever I have to do, it would be better for me if the video came up once you click it, and is then minimized.</p><attrib>43-year-old Asian male</attrib></disp-quote><p>Additionally, in reference to the site&#x02019;s memorability, participants recommended using a simple and recognizable URL that is easy to locate with an online search. They also wanted Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s purpose to be clear while using it (eg, spelling out the Diabetes MAP acronym and including images of diabetes medications throughout the website).</p><p>Participants wanted a simplified, streamlined Diabetes MAP user experience. In order to improve the site&#x02019;s error frequency and severity, participants recommended increasing compatibility across multiple browsers, including older versions of commonly used Web browsers. Additionally, they requested the ability to use Diabetes MAP across multiple digital devices without loading time delays. They also stressed the importance of clear and accessible resources for user support (eg, the ability to contact study staff directly if they had issues or questions, an accessible and searchable help resource on the website itself). Finally, participants wanted functional, useful, and easy to recall navigational videos to further facilitate learning how to use the site.</p><p>Those who reported some dissatisfaction, but generally endorsed the utility of Diabetes MAP, felt it might be more appropriate for certain types of patients with diabetes. For example, some users diagnosed with diabetes for a longer period of time felt the website might be particularly helpful for newly diagnosed patients. Other users suggested the website might be more useful for younger, more technology-proficient patients who prefer technology-delivered information as opposed to more traditional print materials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Results</title><p>Usability testing is issue-focused and designed to assess the extent to which users can easily, efficiently, and effectively perform tasks with a technical system.

For example, participants rated the understandability and clarity of the site&#x02019;s information and the pleasantness of interacting with the site most favorably on surveys, yet, in focus groups, several participants expressed frustration with understanding how to complete tasks and navigate the website (ie, issues with the site&#x02019;s ease of learning and intuitive design). Alternatively, many positive statements about the value of the site&#x02019;s information and features (ie, subjective satisfaction) support these high ratings. Participants rated the ease and quickness of recovering from mistakes least favorably on surveys; focus group comments about error frequency and severity align with this low rating. In reconciling these inconsistencies and consistencies, it appears that while some participants had issues with understanding, navigating, and accessing Diabetes MAP, participants who successfully accessed the site, said it was enjoyable and helpful.</p><p>Recent usability studies of Web-delivered interventions for T2DM self- management yield results comparable to ours. In their evaluation of a Web-based dietary intervention, Ramadas et al found positive ratings of a website&#x02019;s usability based on survey items; however, this study did not use qualitative assessments [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Alternatively, Yu et al used focus groups to examine the usability of their self-management website [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and identified several of the same usability concerns we did with Diabetes MAP. Namely, participants mentioned issues with the website layout and organization, navigation, data entry, and language [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although these issues can be applied to Web-delivered interventions generally, usability testing also reveals issues specific to a certain website [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for usability testing. Had we relied on only survey data, we would have incomplete information on Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s usability. Collecting qualitative data as part of usability testing reveals insights on unanticipated challenges and ideas for improving a site [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, involving members from the target audience is critical to understanding any unique needs of users for whom the site is intended [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The total time logged into Diabetes MAP during the 2-week period varied considerably across users<italic>.</italic> In a similar usability study, Heinrich et al had participants use a diabetes education site for 2 weeks, and participants visited the site an average of 3.6 &#x000b1; 2.7 times and spent an average of 58.0 &#x000b1; 56.1 total minutes on the site [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Compensation for time spent on the site was not reported. In our study, the more time spent using Diabetes MAP may reflect compensating participants per hour of use. Despite this, our qualitative results suggest some participants were discouraged from logging in more often because of the usability issues they encountered.</p><p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has set forth peer-reviewed guidelines for improving the design and usability of websites [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Taking into consideration these guidelines and the results of our usability study, we identified key principles for website creation to promote an optimal user experience. First, it is crucial to employ both simplicity and clarity in Web design. Diabetes MAP users were often confused about how to complete tasks and navigate the site both because they encountered user errors and the layout was unintuitive. HHS suggests standardizing tasks to be performed in a similar way so tasks can be reliably repeated [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When requesting users to enter information, a standard entry format should be used across tasks (eg, drop-down boxes). Additionally, to account for working memory limitations, content from 1 page that need be remembered on other pages should carry over to those pages [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, using simplified and familiar terminology for a URL and website features will minimize user confusion and frustration.</p><p>Our second principle is to design websites with the goal of keeping users informed and aware of website processes. As a general observation from our focus groups, users became frustrated with unanticipated incidents (eg, long downloading times, automatically being logged out). In some cases, it may not be possible to reduce the size of a page to minimize the time it takes for a webpage to load [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, a website can notify users of the time required to download an image and/or supply progress indicators (eg, an hourglass) to communicate a waiting period and its duration [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In either case, the user expects additional time instead of wondering how long to wait. HHS also recommends warning users if a page is going to &#x0201c;time out,&#x0201d; so they can request extra time if needed [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Websites should also provide assistance to users who need additional help and ensure users are aware of this assistance. Resources should be easily accessible on the site, such as links providing more information about site content and a section for frequently asked questions [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are limitations to our study. Because we recruited our sample from a single academic medical center, our findings may not generalize to other patient populations. However, our sample characteristics map onto the academic medical center&#x02019;s patient population for whom Diabetes MAP was designed for. Additionally, although we were able to track time spent using Diabetes MAP, we were unable to track how participants used their Vanderbilt patient portal account because the two websites are not integrated. Considering the recent advancement of patient-provider communication in Web-delivered interventions, it will be valuable to track usage with this type of feature in future studies<italic>.</italic> Another limitation is the reliance on retrospective self-reports of users&#x02019; experiences with Diabetes MAP. Furthermore, the range from when a participant used Diabetes MAP to when he/she participated in a focus group session was 14-88 days. Other usability testing methods, such as think-aloud protocols, cognitive walk-throughs, and remote user testing facilitate real-time data collection of user interactions with a system [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. No single usability evaluation method can capture all usability problems [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While think-aloud studies combat the limitations of retrospective studies, they are limited by an unnatural situation in which users may feel uncomfortable talking to themselves and the possibility many statements will be filtered (ie, not reflective of users&#x02019; actual experience) [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although user feedback in our study was retrospective and the time between participants&#x02019; website use and focus group feedback ranged widely, we presented Diabetes MAP on a large projector screen and re-oriented participants to its pages, functions, and features to solicit real-time feedback and prompt recall of users&#x02019; experience. This method is similar to the pluralistic walkthrough approach that reveals users&#x02019; uncertainty with a system&#x02019;s features and tasks better than other usability methods [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, the number of participants in each focus group allowed for the majority (over 80%) of concerns to be reported after only 2 focus group sessions. Moreover, the use of a mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive evaluation of Diabetes MAP&#x02019;s usability. Finally, because usability feedback is system-dependent and the current study is based on a specific website, our findings may not generalize to other Web-delivered interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating a website&#x02019;s usability prior to testing its efficacy. For Web-delivered interventions to be used as intended, researchers, Web designers, and developers must plan sufficient time to perform usability testing [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Ideally, they should begin with design thinking to allow for experimentation, creation and prototyping, and feedback and redesign prior to final product presentation [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An understanding of the target group&#x02019;s needs paired with iterative idea generation and development helps ensure the final website appeals to users and supports their using it [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Usability evaluation methods, including user-driven approaches, ensure users can optimally engage with and benefit from Web-delivered interventions [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Without ensuring a website&#x02019;s usability, critical design and functionality issues may go unnoticed and unaddressed, thereby preventing a site&#x02019;s benefits from being realized [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded with support from the Center for Diabetes Translational Research (NIDDK P30 DK092986) and CYO&#x02019;s Career Development Award (NIDDK K01 DK087894).
