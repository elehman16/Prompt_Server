Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernia has several advantages over open repair like less post-operative pain and morbidity, early recovery, rapid return to work and usual activities, low recurrence rate and better quality of life (QOL).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Efficacy of the mesh repair is based on strengthening of weakened native tissue by a strong mesh aponeurotic scar tissue (MAST) complex.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Inflammatory processes beyond the optimum foreign body reaction may entrap the contiguous structures leading to complications such as chronic groin pain.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the early and mid-1990s, increasing number of case reports reporting mesh related complications after conventional polypropylene mesh based hernia repair, prompted the investigators to develop better meshes. As a consequence, today two major mesh concepts are distinguished, the classical concept of heavyweight (HW) meshes having small pores (&#x0003c;1 mm), high tensile strength and a larger surface area and the lightweight (LW) meshes having larger pores (&#x0003e;1 mm), and high flexibility.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Lightweight meshes are supposed to have many advantages over HW meshes like decreased incidence of chronic groin pain, early return to work and better patient comfort.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] But most of the studies are small studies with very short follow-up.</p><p>In recent years, attempts to evaluate the outcome of different health care interventions have increased dramatically.

Few studies have also raised concerns about increased risk of mesh displacement and recurrence with the use of LW mesh due to soft texture and tendency of these meshes to fold easily.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Various studies have also reported a longer operative time in LW mesh group due to difficulty in laying out the mesh as it has a soft texture with a tendency to get folded easily.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, although the mean operative time was 3.7 min longer in the LW mesh group, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09).</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of any procedure is important because healthcare resources are scarce, and they must be allocated judiciously. Not many studies in literature have compared the cost-effectiveness of LW and HW meshes. Chui <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] mentioned that in their study that the mean cost that incurred to the patient in LW mesh group was higher. The cost of LW mesh (Dynamesh) used by them was 6 times higher than the HW mesh (Surgipro). However, in our study, the total cost was significantly less in LW mesh group as compared to HW mesh group. This is because we used Prolene Soft (Ethicon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) as the LW mesh, which is costlier than the conventional Prolene mesh but cheaper than the pre-shaped 3D max mesh (Bard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) which was used as the HW mesh in this study.</p><p>Studies have also reported decreased early post-operative pain in LW mesh group because of less acute inflammatory response.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, the mean pain score was comparable between the two groups at 6 h, 24 h and 1-week post-operatively. However, the mean VAS score was significantly higher in patients in LW mesh group in TAPP repair at 1-week while the mean VAS score was comparable between the two groups in TEP repair at same follow-up visit. This may be because of the increased pain associated with TAPP as compared to TEP repair, due to suturing of peritoneum in TAPP.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] On the contrary, Bittner <italic>et al</italic>., in a randomised trial of 600 patients reported higher incidence of pain in LW mesh group compared to HW mesh group in the early post-operative period.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This may indicate that the extent of acute inflammation in the early post-operative period is unrelated to the type of mesh used and depends more on the operative technique and extent of dissection.</p><p>Recovery time is an important issue in terms of the degree of disruption to a patient's life and the cost to society calculated by days missed from productive work. In the current study, patients in LW mesh group returned to walking and driving significantly earlier than patients in HW mesh group (<italic>P</italic> value 0.002 and 0.05 respectively). However, on separate analysis in TEP and TAPP repair, we found significantly earlier return to normal activities in LW mesh group only in patients undergoing TEP repair and not in TAPP repair. Hence, the probable reason for early return to normal activities in TEP repair may be due to less pain associated with TEP as compared to TAPP repair in the early post-operative period,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] rather than the mesh itself. These results are in accordance with the randomised trial reported by Chowbey <italic>et al</italic>., of 402 patients undergoing TEP repair in which there was significantly earlier return to normal daily activities in LW mesh group compared to HW mesh group (1.82 days vs. 2.09 days, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001), while there was no significant difference in return to work in either group (7.2 vs. 7.5 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.6).</p><p>The major advantage of the LW mesh is claimed to be reduction in chronic groin pain as compared to HW mesh due to the optimal amount of MAST formation after implantation of LW meshes. Nienhuijs <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in their systematic review of 29 studies of groin hernia mesh repair reported that chronic pain had an incidence of 11%. They identified two risk factors for the development of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair: Open surgical technique and the use of HW meshes. Bittner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported more pain in midweight mesh group at 6 months compared to other three groups, HW, LW and titanised mesh group. However, at 12 months follow-up they did not find any significant difference in chronic pain among the four mesh groups. Shah <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] conducted a retrospective analysis of 67 patients who undergone LIHR with either HW polypropylene mesh or LW polyester mesh and they reported a 3 times higher rate of chronic pain (18.7% vs. 5.7%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 in polypropylene mesh group as compared to LW mesh group at 1-year follow-up. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in a prospective double-blind randomised controlled study comparing LW and HW polypropylene mesh in TEP repair of inguinal hernia, showed that LW polypropylene mesh was associated with significantly better pain scores, patient comfort, and sexual functions.</p><p>However, we did not find any significant difference in the incidence and severity of chronic groin pain between the HW mesh and LW mesh groups at 3 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.9), 6 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.4) and 12 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.6). Most of the patients reported mild pain (VAS 1-2). Moderate to severe chronic groin pain (VAS &#x02265;3) was seen only in 3.9% of patients, with no difference between the two groups. We also compared both the meshes in TEP and TAPP repair separately and we did not find any significant difference in the incidence or severity of chronic groin pain between the two mesh groups. In our study, the mesh was not fixed and hence pain caused by nerve damage or tissue compression produced by fixation devices can be excluded completely as a confounding factor. Chowbey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that the short-term advantage of LW mesh with regards to chronic pain was lost after 3 months.</p><p>Khan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also found no difference between LW and HW mesh group at 4 and 15 months follow-up in a retrospective study conducted by telephonic conversation of 250 patients.</p><p>In our study, we did not find any correlation between incidence of pain with age, occupation of the patient or with various co-morbidities like constipation, smoking, and lower urinary tracts symptoms. However, pre-operative pain, duration of symptoms and post-operative pain at 6 weeks had a significant correlation with the incidence of chronic groin pain on multivariate analysis. In contrast, a large randomised study[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] of 994 patients found no significant relation between the development of chronic groin pain and pre-operative pain (<italic>P</italic> = 0.2). The MRC study[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that 30% of patients reported no change in pain from before to after surgery, but that 5% felt worse than before the herniorrhaphy.</p><p>The incidence of foreign body sensation after 3 months in our study was 18.3%, 15.4% in LW mesh group versus 21.2% in HW mesh group, but the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.38). This is in accordance with the randomised trial by Bittner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in which there was no significant difference in this parameter between LW and HW mesh groups. While, Chui <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported significantly less foreign body sensation at 3, 6 and 12 months with LW mesh. The incidence after 3 months was 8% in LW mesh group as compared to 24% in HW mesh group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05).</p><p>Lightweight meshes are thought to be associated with higher rate of hernia recurrence as compared with HW mesh.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, some studies have shown that there was no difference in recurrence rate between the two groups of meshes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These studies had small cohorts and shorter follow-up.</p><p>Chowbey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported higher recurrence rate with Ultrapro mesh (1.3%) as compared with the Prolene mesh (0.2%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). Although it failed to reach the statistical significance, the difference in percentage of recurrence with LW mesh was over 6 times higher compared to HW mesh. They also reported that all five recurrences in the LW mesh group were in those with large defects.</p><p>Akolekar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported recurrence rate of 4.3% (16/371 patients) with LW mesh and 2.82% (12/425) recurrences with HW mesh after TEP hernia repairs during median follow-up of 14.5 months and 22.5 months respectively. The difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.2). They reported that recurrence depends on adhesions between the mesh and abdominal wall, which prevents retraction of the mesh into the abdominal wall defect. As the hernia defect increases in diameter, the adhesions strength between mesh and abdominal wall is insufficient to prevent displacement of mesh into the defect. Using a larger LW mesh or properly fixing the mesh could prevent this. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the LW and HW mesh group in studies by Chui <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Bittner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Langenbach <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, there was one recurrence at mean follow-up of 10.1 &#x000b1; 3.7 months, which was in the LW mesh group. On reoperation, the mesh was found to have migrated into the dilated internal inguinal ring and was forming part of the sac. This may be related to the soft texture and resultant displacement of mesh. We also did not fix the mesh, and since it was a large direct defect, it may have contributed to the recurrence.</p><p>A measure of QOL is being used increasingly to evaluate the outcome of surgical care. Patients after inguinal hernia surgery want to return to work at the earliest in an accepted state of health. Many of the analyses of laparoscopic versus open hernia repair focused on outcome in terms of recurrence and pain. There are very few studies, which had included QOL outcomes as study end points.</p><p>Post <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Peeters <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed significantly improved QOL after both LW and HW mesh repair following Lichtenstein and laparoscopic repair respectively. However, there was no difference in QOL scores at any study point.</p><p>Similarly, in a randomised trial of LW versus HW mesh in open Lichtenstein repair by Nikkolo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] there was no detectable difference in any dimension of QOL according to the SF 36 between the two treatment groups. However, after 6 months, there occurred a considerable improvement in the QOL in both study groups, which indicates the importance of elective hernia repair.</p><p>In our study, there was significantly earlier return to walking and return to driving vehicles in LW mesh group compared to HW mesh group; however, both the groups showed significant improvement in QOL from the pre-operative period to 3 months post-operatively in 6 of the 8 domains and there was no significant difference in post-operative SF-36 scores in any of the domains between the two mesh groups.</p><p>The major strength of this study is that it is a randomised clinical trial with an adequate sample size, with low dropout rates. However, the limitation in our study is that the patients underwent both TEP and TAPP repair which could alter the pain scores, and the follow-up duration is relatively small. TAPP in few studies has been shown to have a higher incidence of early post-operative pain but the incidence of chronic groin pain is reported to be similar in both the techniques,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which should not influence our results since the primary endpoint in our study was chronic groin pain. We have performed a per protocol analysis rather than an intention to treat analysis, because we had to exclude patients on whom we did not have data on chronic groin pain which was our primary endpoint and three patients in whom operating surgeon felt the need to use tacker because tacker in itself is one of the major reasons for higher chronic groin pain. Since the number of these patients is very small, we feel that it may not influence the overall result so much.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernia using HW and LW mesh are comparable in terms of both short-term and long-term outcomes. The two procedures are equally effective in terms of acute and chronic groin pain, QOL, recurrence rates, QOL and resumption to work with LW mesh having the advantage of earlier return to walking and returning to driving vehicles. Chronic groin pain had a significant correlation with duration of symptoms, pre-operative pain and post-operative pain at 6 weeks. Though the operative time was slightly higher in LW mesh group, there was no significant difference. The overall cost was significantly less in LW mesh group. However, flat plain polypropylene mesh can be used to keep the cost of HW mesh low.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
