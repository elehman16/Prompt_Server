But, due to higher side effects with haloperidol, newer atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine) are increasingly being used in the treatment of delirious patients. The aim of the current research was to study the efficacy and tolerability of haloperidol and olanzapine in the treatment of delirium.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was an open-label, randomized controlled study carried out in a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh, India. A total of 100 patients admitted in medicine, surgery, and orthopedic wards and diagnosed as having delirium on Confusion Assessment Method scale were included in the study. Patients were given either haloperidol (1&#x02013;4 mg/day either orally or by nasogastric tube) or olanzapine (2.5&#x02013;10 mg/day either orally or by nasogastric tube). Severity of delirium and pattern of symptom improvement were assessed by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS).

Mean daily dose of antipsychotics (olanzapine and haloperidol) in terms of chlorpromazine equivalents was 109.8 mg and 105 mg, respectively. This is in accordance with the previous studies where lesser than usual antipsychotic doses are required to treat delirium. Our study results are in concordance with the earlier studies where mean daily doses in the range of 37.5&#x02013;169 mg chlorpromazine equivalent are sufficient to treat delirium.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Mean duration of treatment was calculated as the mean time taken by each patient from the start of treatment to resolution of delirium. Mean duration of treatment in our study was 3.47 &#x000b1; 0.82 days. Mean duration of treatment in olanzapine group was 3.57 &#x000b1; 0.92 days. Mean duration of treatment in haloperidol group was 3.37 &#x000b1; 0.71 days. The results between the two groups were not statistically significant from each other. Our results match with the previous studies where mean time to improvement was 3.8&#x02013;4.8 days.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, there was 54.7% reduction in mean MDAS scores (54.4% in olanzapine group and 55% in haloperidol group).

Moreover, there was no significant difference in the final scores in any domain between both groups.</p><p>However, the earlier improvement of few symptoms such as impaired attention and disorganized thinking in one group over the other can be explained in terms of pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs.</p><p>Both inability to maintain and shift attention and disorganized thinking are cognitive phenomenon. Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine substantially block cortical serotonergic receptors (5HT2A). Serotonin inhibits the release of dopamine. Hence, when serotonin is blocked, dopamine concentration is increased at mesocortical pathway which is associated with cognition and socialization. However, haloperidol, being a typical antipsychotic, nonselectively blocks dopamine at D2 receptors in mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal pathways. Hence, increase in dopamine at mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the early and better improvement in ability to maintain and shift attention and disorganized thinking in olanzapine group than haloperidol group.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Half-lives of haloperidol and olanzapine are 12&#x02013;36 h and 21&#x02013;54 h, respectively. Time taken to reach peak plasma concentration after oral dose is 1&#x02013;4 h for haloperidol and 2&#x02013;6 h for olanzapine. Any drug usually needs up to 5 half-life to reach a steady-state plasma concentration. Steady-state concentration is reached within 3&#x02013;5 days in haloperidol due to short half-life and it takes even up to 7 days in case of olanzapine to reach steady-state concentration. Effect on psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) and psychomotor activity depends on effective blockade of dopamine in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways. Haloperidol attains steady-state concentration earlier, so it acts faster and hence leads to earlier improvement in perceptual and psychomotor disturbances than that of olanzapine group. Overall, five patients had minor adverse effects related to antipsychotics (2 out of 47, i.e., 4.25% in olanzapine group and 3 out of 53, i.e., 5.6% in haloperidol group). Sedation can be explained in terms of more anticholinergic effects of olanzapine and Extra Pyramidal Symptoms (EPS) due to blockage of nigrostriatal pathway by haloperidol.</p><p>None of the side effects were of such severe intensity that required stopping the drugs or any change in the doses of the drugs. This can be understood in terms of low doses of antipsychotics used as well as the short duration of treatment required in the treatment of delirium. Our results correlate with that of the earlier studies where side effect prevalence between 0% and 40% has been reported depending on the drugs used, its dosages, and duration of treatment of delirium.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Strengths and limitations of study</title><p>It was a randomized controlled study. Randomization was done using a computer-generated random number table. A total of 100 patients were included in the final analysis. Hence, the number of cases studied was higher than most of the earlier studies. Active case finding was done in medicine emergency using CAM. This prevented any bias in the study sample. Valid scales with high specificity and sensitivity, i.e., CAM, MDAS, and SAS were used in the study. Patients were followed up every 24 h till resolution of delirium.</p><p>However, certain limitations need to be considered while interpreting the results. It was a single-blind study and interviewer was not blind to the treatment given. Hence, it could lead to interviewer bias in the study population. Placebo arm was not included. Patients who were more severely ill, unable to speak, mechanically ventilated, and who could not consume oral medicines were excluded from the study. This possibly resulted in the inclusion of more mild-to-moderate cases in our study. This possibly resulted in bias in our results, i.e., higher response rate and less mean duration of treatment in our study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Overall, patients with delirium responded well to low doses of both haloperidol and olanzapine. Patients tolerated both drugs equally well that can be expected due to low mean daily doses of drugs as well as shorter duration of treatment required in delirium.</p><p>At the end of the study period, there was no significant difference in response to both drugs in all the domains, i.e., consciousness, memory, attention and concentration, thinking, perception of psychomotor activity, and sleep&#x02013;wake cycle.</p><p>Hence, we can conclude that both olanzapine and haloperidol can be safely used in the treatment of delirious patients, and low doses of antipsychotics for short duration are usually sufficient.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Trzepacz</surname><given-names>PT</given-names></name><name><surname>Meagher</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Levenson</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Delirium</article-title><source>Textbook of Psychosomatic Medicine</source><year>2005</year><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Psychiatric Association</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>RI</given-names></name><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Fahs</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A prospective study of delirium and prolonged hospital stay.
