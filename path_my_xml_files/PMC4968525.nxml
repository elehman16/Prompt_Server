level ground and stairs after restricting the movement of the spine and the trunk of the
body by using a spinal orthosis. [Subjects and Methods] Forty healthy males in their 20s
were selected as the sample, which was randomly and evenly divided into two groups: (1)
the WT group (with a thoracolumbosacral orthosis group) and (2) the WOT group (Without a
thoracolumbosacral orthosis group). The spinal orthosis used in this study was a
thoracolumbosacral orthosis called a plastic body jacket. [Results] In walking on level
ground, step width showed a significant difference, but no statistically significant
difference was found between the WT group and the WOT group with respect to the other
variables. In walking on stairs, the double stance phase showed a statistically
significant difference during stair descent in the WT group compared with the WOT group.
[Conclusion] It was proven that wearing a TLSO increased walking stability in the case of
walking on level ground and stairs. Hence, it is believed that proper use of a spinal
orthosis can play an ancillary role in daily life and therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Thoracolumbosacral orthosis</kwd><kwd>Motion analysis</kwd><kwd>Spatiotemporal variables</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The spine functions usefully during walking as a tool for maintaining upright posture and
balance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. If deformation of the spine
occurs, the ability to compensate for the posture change is lost, and the resulting
imbalance of the trunk of the body induces clinically recognizable walking deviation. Due to
the influence on the stability of the trunk of the body and the general musculoskeletal
system, dysfunction in them can also induce pain and spinal disability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO), a brace that extends from the spine to the pelvis,
has a direct impact on the movement of the spine during walking and hence has a significant
influence on the movement of the pelvis and the lower limbs. Spinal bracing is used in a
variety of acute and chronic conditions. The efficacy of bracing of the lumbar spine is
thought to be the result of a complex interaction of several factors, including but not
limited to motion reduction, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and pressure feedback on
the musculature<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study
attempted to examine the impact on the pattern of walking on both level ground and stairs
after restricting the movement of the spine and the trunk of the body by using a spinal
orthosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 40 healthy males in their 20s were selected as a sample, which was randomly
and evenly divided into two groups: (1) the WT Group (with TLSO group) and (2) the WOT group
(Without a TLSO group). The inclusion criteria included (1) no neurologic disease history,
(2) capability of maintaining independent standing, walking, and landing, (3) no surgical
history that could affect walking or landing, and (3) no inborn deformity or disease in the
relevant areas, including the foot, pelvis, spine, etc.</p><p>For the WT group, the average age was 24.9 &#x000b1; 2.4&#x02005;years, the average height was 173.3 &#x000b1;
4.2&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 70.6 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x02005;kg. For the WOT group, the average age was
25.3 &#x000b1; 2.7&#x02005;years, the average height was 175.6 &#x000b1; 4.4&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 69.1 &#x000b1;
6.8&#x02005;kg. Using Levene&#x02019;s variance homogeneity test and a normality test on the general
physical characteristics, no statistically significant difference was found between the two
groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). All of the patients included understood the purpose of this study and
provided their written informed consent prior to participation in accordance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The spinal orthosis used in this study was a TLSO called a plastic body jacket. It is made
of lightweight polypropylene that has thermoplasticity, and it is designed so that it is
easy to put on and take off. It is a ready-made product that comes in four sizes
(extra-large, large, medium, and small), and the appropriate size was used for the body
figure of the research subjects. The plastic body jacket is known to restrict the movement
in three 3-dimensional planes more effectively than any other TLSO, including (1) flexion
and extension of the body&#x02019;s trunk in the sagittal plane, (2) lateral flexion in the frontal
plane, and (3) rotation of the trunk of the body in the horizontal plane. It is also known
to be most effective in maintaining the body&#x02019;s alignment.</p><p>The steps of the staircase fabricated and use in this study had a height of 17&#x02005;cm, width of
28&#x02005;cm, and breadth of 61&#x02005;cm and were fabricated according to the housing construction
standards; four steps were installed for this study. A motion analysis system composed of
six infrared cameras (Vicon motion capture system, Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK)
was used for measurement of spatiotemporal variables and for the kinematic variables of
walking, with the sample collection rate of the infrared camera set at 120&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>The subjects were told to walk comfortably and naturally down a 10&#x02005;m long straight walking
lane drawn on firm, even ground at their usual speed while looking straight ahead. Walking
on level ground was performed after oral instruction, and this was followed by ascending and
descending the stairs. The measurement interval was not mentioned so that the subjects would
not recognize when the measurements began. Walking was measured after the first five
footsteps, and a 30-second rest period was given after each motion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean and average values of the spatiotemporal variables of the WT group and the WOT

lower limbs during walking. Spatiotemporal variables were compared and analyzed in the cases
of walking on level ground and stairs, which are frequently performed in daily life.</p><p>With respect to the spatiotemporal variables, the measurements differed between walking on
level ground and walking on stairs as a result of the spatiotemporal characteristics of
walking, which can change due to step height, step width, and grade of the staircase. For
walking on level ground, there was no significant difference in cadence, step length, stride
length, or walking speed between the WT group and the WOT group. It is believed that BOS
(base of support) for maintaining balance decreased as walking stability improved as a
result of wearing the spinal orthosis, as was also reported by Schmidt et al<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, Konz et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that cadence remarkably increased when wearing a
plastic body jacket, although walking speed and step length did not display any difference.
Moreover, step length was also shortened overall, although the difference was not
statistically significant. It can be interpreted that the walking speed remained constant
because the cadence increased due to the decreased rotation angle of the pelvis in the
parallel plane, but that the step length decreased to compensate for other factors.</p><p>In a comparison of the spatiotemporal variables during walking on stairs, there was no
significant difference in the case of stair ascent, but the double stance phase
significantly decreased in the case of stair descent. Walking on stairs also reduces
stability by increasing head and neck movements<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because restricting movement of the trunk of the body during stair
descent can cause the upper body to remain straight and enable the center of weight to be
maintained toward the back of the basal area, it can ensure walking stability. Meanwhile,
the level of tilt of the upper body can be checked by looking at the change in pelvic tilt
during walking. During stair ascent, the body not only moves forward but also simultaneously
moves upward.</p><p>To explain these differences, Kim et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
argued that the pelvis tilts forward when walking up stairs because tilting of the upper
body forward from a straight standing position should shift the center of weight forward. On
the contrary, in the case of stair descent in this study, stability was best maintained by
preventing the upper body from leaning forward and maintaining the center of weight on or
behind the basal area while keeping the upper body straight and minimizing rotating body
movement. Clark and Phillips<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that
the double stance phase can be an indirect index for checking lower limb stability and body
balance. Stair ascent and descent demand more effort compared with walking on level ground,
since upward and forward forces are required to support the body&#x02019;s weight and the continuous
ability to control limits of stability is also required<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that the TLSO used was a commercial product. This
means that the restriction range for the trunk of the body could be different if a custom
orthosis is used or the material is changed. Moreover, the sample size was small, and it
does not adequately represent those with spinal lesions, as the research subjects consisted
of young, healthy males only.</p><p>In conclusion, it was proven that wearing a TLSO increased the walking stability in the
case of walking on level ground and walking on stairs. Hence, it is believed that proper use
of a spine orthosis can play an ancillary role in daily life and therapeutic
interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant in 2013.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Feipel</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>De Mesmaeker</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine during
