<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocols were reviewed and approved for all study sites by a central institutional review board, and all patients provided written informed consent. In brief, adult patients with SLE who were autoantibody positive (antinuclear antibody titre &#x02265;1&#x02009;:&#x02009;80, or antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies &#x02265;30&#x02005;IU/ml) and had active disease (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score &#x02265;6) at screening were enrolled, having received a stable regimen of standard SLE therapy for &#x02265;30&#x02005;days, including prednisone, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, antimalarial and immunosuppressive drugs. Exclusion criteria included severe active SLE nephritis or severe central nervous system manifestations of lupus. In addition to standard therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, or belimumab 1 or 10&#x02005;mg/kg. These studies were designed to compare belimumab with placebo, as all patients were receiving active therapy prior to enrolment and during the trials. Treatments were administered intravenously on days 0, 14 and 28, and every 28&#x02005;days thereafter through week 48 in BLISS-52 and week 72 in BLISS-76. The primary efficacy endpoint was SLE Responder Index (SRI) rate at week 52.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To be considered an SRI responder, a patient had to have a &#x02265;4-point reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A and &#x0003c;2 new B scores, and &#x02018;no deterioration&#x02019; (eg, &#x0003c;0.3-point increase) in Physician's Global Assessment score at week 52 compared with baseline.</p><p>A major secondary endpoint was mean change in SF-36v2 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores at week 24.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Additional prespecified secondary endpoints included mean changes from baseline in SF-36 PCS, Mental Component Summary (MCS), and domains, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) V.4, and EQ-5D scores at weeks 12, 24, 52 and 76 (BLISS-76 only). Additional posthoc analyses were performed using data from these measures.</p><p>The SF-36 is a generic, validated questionnaire that assesses HRQOL during the previous 4&#x02005;weeks in 8 domains, including physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It has been validated and tested in many SLE trials and across cultures.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Raw domain scores are converted to a 0&#x02013;100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health. These scores are Z-transformed and weighted to yield values used to calculate PCS and MCS scores, which are norm based with a mean of 50 and SD of 10. Minimum clinically important differences (MCID) for improvement and deterioration, respectively, in summary scores are +2.5 and &#x02212;0.8, and +5.0 and &#x02212;2.5 for domain scores.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> SF-36 also includes a transition question&#x02013;&#x02018;Compared to 1&#x02005;year ago, how is your general health today?&#x02019;&#x02013;which includes five response categories from &#x02018;much worse&#x02019; to &#x02018;much better&#x02019;.</p><p>Spydergrams present data for each SF-36 domain along individual spokes, ranging from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and have been used to visualise HRQOL changes in response to treatment in patients with autoimmune diseases; gridlines represent 10 points, for instance, 2&#x000d7; MCID.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Mean SF-36 domain scores in patients at baseline and week 52 in both BLISS studies were compared with age-matched and sex-matched healthy US subjects. With the innermost polygon representing baseline SF-36 domain values for SLE patients in the BLISS studies, and the outermost polygon representing domain scores of comparable healthy subjects, mean improvements from baseline with treatment are illustrated by the intermediate rings.</p><p>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is based on a 13-question questionnaire that assesses fatigue during the previous 7&#x02005;days, scored from 0 to 52 (worst); MCID is 4.0. The FACIT-Fatigue scale has been validated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The EQ-5D questionnaire provides a profile of five dimensions (ie, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), with three responses for each: &#x02018;no&#x02019;, &#x02018;some or moderate&#x02019;, and &#x02018;severe&#x02019; problems.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A summary index is calculated by weighting the answers based on health states in a population sample. In the present study, EQ-5D scores were calculated using US and UK value sets.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The index ranges from 1 (perfect health) to &#x0003c;0, which represents the worst imaginable state of health. The EQ-5D includes the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), a vertical 20 cm VAS used to score the patient's health perception, with 100 representing the best and 0 the worst health.</p><p>The SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, and EQ-5D were administered at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 52 in both trials, and additionally at weeks 20, 32, 40, 48, 68 and 76 in BLISS-76 and week 36 in BLISS-52.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Primary analyses were evaluated by individual study. Changes from baseline in SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, and EQ-5D scores were analysed using a covariance model, with covariates for baseline value and the three stratification factors, including baseline SELENA-SLEDAI score (&#x02264;9 vs &#x02265;10), baseline proteinuria level (&#x0003c;2&#x02005;g/24&#x02005;h vs &#x02265;2&#x02005;g/24&#x02005;h equivalent), and race (African descent or indigenous American descent vs other). The trial was also a covariate for the prespecified pooled analyses. The last observation was carried forward to account for missing data in SF-36 and FACIT-Fatigue analyses, whereas only observed values were included in the EQ-5D analysis. Where baseline data are presented as combined for all treatment groups, significance testing was based on change from baseline within each treatment group. Nominal p values are from pairwise comparisons of active treatments versus placebo, and a value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Due to the similar study designs of BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, data from both trials were pooled by treatment group for analyses in HRQOL measures.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There were, however, some differences between the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 study populations in race, age, disease duration and activity, and types of background standard therapies used that can, in part, be attributed to the varied geographic locations of the studies. Patients in BLISS-76 had a longer duration of SLE and more damage, as measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index, whereas those in BLISS-52 were more serologically active. The proportions of patients taking prednisone, and mean prednisone (or equivalent) doses were higher, and immunosuppressant use was lower in BLISS-52 than in BLISS-76. Baseline SF-36 scores in both study populations were lower than those of an age-matched and sex-matched US population.</p><table-wrap id="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202865TB1"

Posthoc analysis of pooled data, therefore, shows a more consistent HRQOL and patient-outcome benefit in patients treated with belimumab than in the individual trials, where favourable effects on patient outcomes did not always reach statistical significance. The wide variety of standard therapies, progressive restriction on concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, and variable organ system manifestations may have confounded interpretation of the data. Further study of patient-outcome measures in future belimumab randomised controlled trials in general SLE and lupus nephritis are needed to validate the findings reported in the present analysis.</p><p>In summary, the improvements in patient-reported outcomes evident in these phase 3 trials were consistent with other reported clinical benefits of belimumab treatment, such as reduction in severe flares and corticosteroid use, in patients with autoantibody-positive SLE who were also receiving standard SLE therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support (writing assistance, assembling figures and tables, collating author comments, grammatical editing and referencing) was provided by Eleanore Gross and Geoff Marx of BioScience Communications, New York, NY , USA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 Study Groups.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have read and approved the manuscript.
