injury. During the early stage of the injury, the internal layer of the rectum and the anal
sphincter muscle are in a stage of complete incontinence. The voiding reflex is restored
through recovery of the central lumbosacral spinal cord after the acute stage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Peristalsis of the intestine and right side
of the colon is maintained by innervation from the vagus nerve so that feces are transported
to the large intestine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. After a spinal
cord injury, patients suffer from several types of problems such as decreased muscle power
and sensation as well as impairment of the respiratory system and other functions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, spinal cord injury causes
paralysis and high spasticity of the anal sphincter, or results in voiding dysfunction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most patients with spinal cord injuries
choose drug therapy to treat their bowel dysfunctions. A study published in 2013 adopted
manipulation therapy to improve bowel function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, increasing attention has been paid to the treatment of
bowel function, although relevant studies in this field remain rare.</p><p>According to studies on walking function, rhythmic and circulate ambulation training of the
lower limbs can stimulate intestine peristalsis and bowel function, and several methods of
walking training, such as body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and
robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAT) can be adopted to help patients with spinal cord injury.
Currently, RAT is widely used during the recovery process. The biggest difference between
the body weight-supported treadmill robot training and the existing supported ambulation
training is the addition of a mechanical assistant in the former so that alternative steps
with both feet can be achieved by the patients. Besides, simulation of the normal walking
pattern facilitates input from the peripheral nerve endings; in this manner, the remaining
the central nervous system can be stimulated so that the nerve regeneration of the nerves of
traumatic spinal cord injury can be completed. Recently, some studies have shown that this
method has a significant effect on the improvement of response time<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of BWSTT and RAT on bowel function in
spinal cord injury patients with respect to defecation time and defecation drug dose
(enema).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four patients with spinal cord injury participated in the study. All subjects had an

all subjects gave their informed consent for participation in the study. The study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of China Rehabilitation Research Center, and the
IRD number for this study is 2014-8.</p><p>The subjects were randomly divided into BWSTT and RAT groups. The BWSTT group consisted of
12 subjects (7 males, 5 females), and the RAT group consisted of 12 subjects (9 males, 3
females). Both groups had undergone defecation management training to ensure adequate daily
intake of water and dietary fiber. Additionally, manual therapy was also adopted to
stimulate the patients&#x02019; intestines.</p><p>The BWSTT group, in addition to standard rehabilitation training, underwent BWSTT. In the
RAT group, the same rehabilitation training was carried out with the treadmill training
team, and walking training was carried out with a rehabilitation training robot (MBZ-CPM1,
ManBuZhe [Tian Jin] Rehabilitation Equipment Co., Ltd. China).</p><p>In the BWSTT and RAT groups, the initial training speed was 1.5&#x02005;km/h, which was
progressively raised to 1.8&#x02005;km/h as quickly as possible while maintaining gait quality. The
body weight system was initiated at 35%, and 70% guidance force was provided for the
participants.</p><p>Both groups underwent walking training for 20 minutes, four times a week, for one month.
The experimental measures were the defecation time and enema dose in both groups before and
after the experiment.</p><p>Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to test statistically significant differences and
the factors were intervention and group. If a significant interaction was found, the paired
t-test was used for a before and after intervention comparison. Data were analyzed using
SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the BWSTT and RAT groups in terms of subject

defecation periods were shorter, and the enema dose was decreased.</p><p>The reason for this result is that compared with standard walking training and BWSTT, the
robotic walking training enabled the bilateral lower limbs to perform an alternative and
circulatory movement, which can effectively adjust abdominal pressure and improve intestinal
peristalsis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; in this manner, the bowel
function can also be improved.</p><p>In future studies, changes in the thickness of the transversus abdominis muscle during the
training need to be evaluated, and changes in the intestinal peristalsis frequency should be
measured.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Research on Design Theory and Compliant Control for
