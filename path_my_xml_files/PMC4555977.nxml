These claims are mostly unsubstantiated by research other than claims by &#x0201c;users&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;clients&#x0201d; of the purported products.</p><p>Veisalgia describes the sum of unpleasant physiological effects following the consumption of substances such as alcoholic beverages. The word originated from the Norwegian word &#x0201c;kveis&#x0201d; (meaning uneasiness after debauchery) and the Greek root &#x0201c;-algia&#x0201d; (meaning pain, grief).<xref rid="b1-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most commonly reported characteristics of veisalgia (&#x0201c;hangover&#x0201d;) include headache, nausea, sensitivity to light and noise, lethargy, dysphoria, and thirst. Alcohol overindulgence is a global phenomenon with a significant number of people suffering from the consequences &#x02013; ie, hangover to addiction, the latter often associated with serious legal, social, and health sequelae.<xref rid="b2-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Ethanol (EtOH) in the blood affects the brain and other tissues until it is metabolized by the liver through oxidation, detoxifying the substance, and rendering it harmless to tissues and organs. A small amount of EtOH is excreted unchanged via the lungs and urine.<xref rid="b3-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The rate at which the liver can metabolize EtOH depends on the amount of alcohol dehy-drogenase.<xref rid="b3-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the oxidation reaction, which detoxifies the EtOH. If the rate of EtOH consumption surpasses the rate of EtOH metabolism, it results in an excessive increase in blood alcohol concentration due to zero-order kinetics.</p><p>Factors that could influence the rate of EtOH absorption and metabolism during such alcohol studies, include food consumption, as well as the sex of the individual. The presence of food and also the type of food present in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) influence EtOH absorption.<xref rid="b4-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The rate at which EtOH is absorbed in the GIT depends on the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine (timing after consumption), where most of the consumed EtOH is then absorbed. Foods that are high in dietary fat will delay emptying of the stomach and will therefore lower the rate at which EtOH is absorbed. Furthermore, research has shown that that subjects consuming alcohol with food containing protein, carbohydrates, and fat absorbed the alcohol three times slower than subjects ingesting alcohol on an empty stomach.<xref rid="b6-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><sec><title>Absorbatox&#x02122;</title><p>Absorbatox&#x02122; falls under a family of natural and/or synthetic hydrated aluminosilicates. These are molecules with well-defined, microporous, crystalline structures, which carry an excessive negative charge, usually compensated for by cations.<xref rid="b7-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Void spaces within the frameworks are capable of hosting cations, water, or other organic molecules that, in turn, can be selectively exchanged for other species.<xref rid="b8-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The porous structure allows hydrated aluminosilicates to have a unique &#x0201c;molecular sieving&#x0201d; ability.<xref rid="b9-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Absorbatox&#x02122; is mined in a specific geographical region where the deposits are known to be contaminant free. Absorbatox&#x02122; is an authigenic mineral or sedimentary rock, which has been processed and potentiated via a patented process to exhibit a pronounced negative molecular charge. Many known processes to potentiate clinoptilolites have been described, and may include saturation in brine.<xref rid="b10-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Absorbatox&#x02122; is a mineral (clinoptilolite) with the simplified formula (Na, K)<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>30</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>O<sub>72</sub>&#x02013;nH<sub>2</sub>O (hydrated clinoptilolite), and it is one of the many zeolites most commonly found in sedimentary rock.<xref rid="b15-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It belongs to the aluminosilicate species. There are 108 different zeolites. Absorbatox&#x02122; is a specific zeolite, with a particular Mohs hardness and cation exchange capability. Zeolites are hydrated natural microporous crystals with well-defined structures containing AlO<sub>4</sub> and SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra linked through the common oxygen atoms. Most common natural zeolites are formed by alteration of glass-rich volcanic rocks (tuff) with fresh water in playa lakes or by seawater. The structures of zeolites consist of three-dimensional frameworks of SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. The aluminum ion is small enough to occupy the position in the center of the tetrahedron of four oxygen atoms and the isomorphous replacement of Si<sup>4+</sup> by Al<sup>3+</sup> produces a negative charge in the lattice. The net-negative charge is balanced by the exchangeable cation (sodium, potassium, or calcium). It is also known that silicates and aluminosilicates possess biological activity, either positive or negative. Well-defined structures and catalytic activity make aluminosilicates an attractive model system for protein and enzyme mimetics. Natural zeolites are characterized by the ability to lose and gain water reversibly and to exchange constituent cations (positively charged particles) without a major change of structure.</p><p>When this &#x0201c;molecular sieving&#x0201d; ability is used in combination with hydrophobic principles to produce a physiologically inert hydrophobic molecular sieve material with a pore size that may permit the absorption of the EtOH molecule into the structure, it can be speculated that this substance would absorb a percentage of consumed EtOH before it can be absorbed by the GIT, which might result in lowered blood alcohol levels or slow absorption, as well as veisalgia symptom reduction.<xref rid="b17-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Furthermore, due to their unique physical attributes, aluminosilicates are able to absorb biological active amines such as histamine.<xref rid="b18-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is known that increased plasma levels of serotonin and histamine due to alcohol consumption have been implicated in the pathogenesis of headaches.<xref rid="b19-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>There are many purported claims for over-the-counter products to reduce alcohol absorption and/or to &#x0201c;sober up&#x0201d;. The aim of this study was to test Absorbatox&#x02122; in this regard &#x02013; ie, will it assist in &#x0201c;sobering up&#x0201d; the individual using the product when taking copious amounts of alcohol? To achieve this, the effects of Absorbatox&#x02122; on blood and breath alcohol levels, as well as the signs and symptoms of veisalgia, will be studied. Three different studies featuring treatment with Absorbatox&#x02122; were constructed to test whether it 1) decreases or &#x0201c;slows&#x0201d; blood alcohol concentrations when fasting; 2) decreases expirated alcohol when taken with food; and 3) results in a decreased severity of veisalgia-associated symptoms (ie, GIT-related symptoms such as thirst, nausea, vomiting, and bowel irritation, and central nervous system [CNS]-related symptoms such as fatigue, headache, light- and sound sensitivity, irritability, and alertness).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Three separate studies were conducted. The inclusion criteria for all three studies described in this section were healthy male or female volunteers over the age of 18 years who drink on social occasions.</p><p>Volunteers were excluded if they had a history of drug or alcohol abuse, do not drink at all, suffered from hypertension (140/90 mmHg) or hypotension (90/60 mmHg), and/or had diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, or any other systemic disease at the time of the study. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria. All volunteers provided written informed consent to participate in the study.</p><sec><title>Effect of Absorbatox&#x02122; on alcohol absorption while fasting: determination of peak blood alcohol concentrations</title><p>In this crossover study, volunteers that met the aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized into one of two groups. Each group consisted of nine subjects per group, amounting to a total of 18 volunteers who served as their own controls. One group received Absorbatox&#x02122; and alcohol (40% EtOH; Smirnoff vodka; Diageo plc, London, UK), while the other group received EtOH alone. After a washout period of 72 hours, the treatment was switched. The group that previously received Absorbatox&#x02122; and EtOH were now given alcohol alone, and vice versa. Each person consumed 22 mL of EtOH over a period of 10 minutes, after which 11 mL of EtOH was consumed 20 minutes later (amounting to a total of three drinks [33 mL of EtOH] over a 30-minute period). In the group that received Absorbatox&#x02122; and EtOH, two Absorbatox&#x02122; 2.8 D capsules (1.5 g in total) were given before alcohol consumption. Additionally, two capsules (1.5 g in total) were given after 1 and 2 hours of alcohol consumption, respectively, thus totaling six capsules (4.5 g in total). Blood alcohol levels were measured before alcohol consumption (time =0), immediately after alcohol consumption (time =30 minutes), and at time =60, 90,120, and 240 minutes.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed by means of a two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test with a 95% confidence interval.

Each group consisted of five subjects per group, amounting to a total of ten volunteers who served as their own controls. One group received Absorbatox&#x02122;, food (standardized meal each time), and alcohol (EtOH), while the other group received placebo, food, and EtOH. Volunteers were allowed to select their own drink; however, the volume and type had to be the same each time. This was noted and recorded against time to allow for matching after crossover. After a washout period of &#x0003e;72 hours, the treatment was switched. The group that previously received Absorbatox&#x02122; was now given placebo, and vice versa. A participant received his/her drink of choice in a social environment mimicking real life, amounting to an average of at least two drinks (a total of 20 mL of EtOH) every 1 hour over a 3-hour period, after which three Absorbatox&#x02122; 2.8 D capsules (a total of 2.25 g) were administered. All alcohol, food intake, and times of consumption were documented and repeated in exactly the same manner when the individual returned for the crossover phase. Breath alcohol levels were determined using a breathalyzer (Dr&#x000e4;gerwerk AG, Luebeck, Germany) at 30 and 60 minutes after consumption of three Absorbatox&#x02122; 2.8 D capsules (a total of 2.25 g). CNS and GIT signs and symptoms were recorded the following morning on a standardized score sheet on a scale of 1&#x02013;10 (1= sign/symptom not experienced, and 10= sign/symptom is severe).

Further results demonstrate that treatment with Absorbatox&#x02122; results in an overall significant reduction in CNS and GIT symptoms associated with veisalgia. The exact mechanism of action is not elucidated in this study, but the reported effects on heartburn and gastritis<xref rid="b24-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> may indicate that Absorbatox&#x02122; possibly binds the offending H<sup>+</sup> ions, pepsin, and biologically active amines, such as histamine and serotonin. These studies also acted as dose-finding experiments in that the first group received 4.5 g each, the participants in the second study received 2.25 g each, and those in the confirmation study also only received 2.25 g each, clearly demonstrating the capacity of the manipulated substance in adsorbing the active moieties in the GIT. The initial hypothesis of alcohol &#x0201c;binding&#x0201d; by the sieve is therefore rejected. The lower dose was selected, as this was the dose with anecdotal claims; the higher dosages were also used to demonstrate any mopping effect of alcohol, if at all possible. This further strengthens the argument for the specific binding of active substances, such as histamine and other biologically active amines (in in vitro experiments), as opposed to nonspecific changes in pH and gastric enzymes. The dosages used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and stomach protection against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also similar to the low range &#x02013; ie, 750&#x02013;1,500 mg per dose &#x02013; and demonstrated efficacy.<xref rid="b24-ceg-8-271" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Unpacking the different score charts, it is obvious that the benefits are driven by specific symptoms being significantly reduced. These were in the cognitive domain: headache; light and sound sensitivity; and, to a lesser extent, irritability. Alertness was not at all influenced, demonstrating that the effect of alcohol in suppressing the CNS remained intact. This strengthens the hypothesis that Absorbatox&#x02122; binds to and mops up products such as histamine and serotonin after direct insult to the GIT, with no effect on the true CNS effects of alcohol. The GIT domain was also not uniformly affected, and the symptoms here also related to afferent stimulation of the vagus nerve (nausea and vomiting), which was more inhibited than in those symptoms not related to direct effects and stimulation via autocrine transmitter release in the GIT. Thirst was not affected at all, and this is understandable as thirst is related to absolute or relative dehydration due to the increased diuresis driven by the alcohol ingested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Further evaluation is warranted by the outcomes of these studies. Absorbatox&#x02122; is a nonabsorbable substance with benefits in preventing and reducing veisalgia symptoms without influencing the absorption of alcohol. The possible legal implications of alcohol consumption thus remain.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>JR Snyman is a minor shareholder in Absorbatox Pty Ltd.
