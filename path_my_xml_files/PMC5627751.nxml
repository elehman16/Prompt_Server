The subjects were patients diagnosed with SAC at two institutions between February and March in 2014. To examine the clinical effects of seasonal treatment, 0.05% epinastine and 0.1% olopatadine were administered, and their effects were investigated every 2 weeks (Stage 1). To evaluate the clinical effects of preseasonal therapy, in January 2015, the same eye drop preparations as adopted in Stage 1 were administered to patients who had participated in Stage 1 and provided consent to participate in this study, and their effects were investigated every month (Stage 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In Stage 1, the 0.05% epinastine group consisted of 43 patients, and the 0.1% olopatadine group consisted of 42 patients. There were significant improvements in the total symptom and objective finding scores at each time point after administration in comparison with those before its baseline, but there were no significant differences between the two groups. In Stage 2, the 0.05% epinastine group consisted of 15 patients, and the 0.1% olopatadine group consisted of 14 patients. The rate of change in the total symptom score in comparison with that at the baseline of preseasonal treatment was significantly higher in the 0.1% olopatadine group 1 month after the start of treatment, suggesting symptom deterioration (<italic>P</italic>=0.025). There was no significant difference in the rate of change in the total objective finding score between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Seasonal treatment with 0.05% epinastine or 0.1% olopatadine was equally effective for patients with allergic conjunctivitis. However, for preseasonal therapy, 0.05% epinastine was more effective than 0.1% olopatadine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>0.05% epinastine</kwd><kwd>0.1% olopatadine</kwd><kwd>seasonal allergic conjunctivitis</kwd><kwd>preseasonal treatment</kwd><kwd>seasonal treatment</kwd><kwd>inverse agonist</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ocular allergy occurs in 15%&#x02013;25% of the general population.<xref rid="b1-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In other countries, antigens include grass,<xref rid="b3-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> differing from those that cause allergic conjunctivitis in Japan.<xref rid="b4-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Japanese cedar pollinosis is a common disease with an age-adjusted estimated prevalence of 19.4% in Japan<xref rid="b4-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is considered to be a national affiction.<xref rid="b5-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Cedar pollen is specific to Japan, differing from antigens in other countries; it is important to examine the therapeutic effects on cedar pollen allergy.</p><p>Currently, second-generation antiallergic drugs, which have both anti-histaminic and mast-cell stabilizing activities, are selected as first-choice drugs to treat allergic conjunctivitis.

The study included 85 patients who consulted Mizoguchi Eye Clinic (Nagasaki, Japan) or Ozaki Eye Clinic (Miyazaki, Japan) after February and March in 2014. Fifty-one patients (9 males, 42 females) visited Mizoguchi Eye Clinic and 34 patients (8 males, 26 females) Ozaki Eye Clinic. The following patients were excluded: 1) patients with anterior ocular disease other than allergic conjunctivitis; 2) those receiving oral steroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anticholinergic agents, immunosuppressive drugs, or eye drops; 3) those with severe allergic ocular disease and giant papilla formation; and 4) those wearing contact lenses.</p><p>This study was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committee of Mizoguchi Eye Clinic.

These two actions are showed by 0.05% epinastine and 0.1% olopatadine and are commonly used as antiallergic eye drop preparations in Japan. A conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) test with cedar pollen was conducted to compare the effects of 0.05% epinastine with those of 0.1% olopatadine. It was reported that the latter more markedly reduced pruritus and congestion compared with the former.<xref rid="b12-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, in clinical practice, there is no opportunity for single exposure to a massive amount of antigen, as performed in the CAC test; the results of this test reflect the therapeutic effects under a specific environment. In this study, we reviewed symptoms related to cedar pollen dispersion under a natural environment; it is clinically important to evaluate the effects under this circumstance. Based on the total symptom score, both 0.05% epinastine and 0.1% olopatadine significantly reduced the symptoms after administration, showing an improvement. However, there was no significant difference in objective and subjective symptoms between the two groups at each time point. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the efficacy of 0.05% epinastine, as seasonal treatment, may be similar to that of 0.1% olopatadine.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 2 (preseasonal treatment)</title><p>Histamine H1 receptors are a type of GPCR.<xref rid="b6-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There are two H1 receptor isoforms: an active form and an inactive form. In the absence of agonist stimulation, inactive histamine H1 receptors are predominant, showing an equilibrium.<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Inverse agonists inhibit active histamine H1 receptors before agonist dispersion.<xref rid="b6-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Ophthalmic solutions of 0.05% epinastine and 0.1% olopatadine exhibit inverse agonistic action for histamine receptor. Preseasonal therapy with these eye drop preparations is reportedly effective for allergic conjunctivitis. However, there was a difference in inverse agonist activity between the two drugs. Mizuguchi et al<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reported that the inverse agonistic activity of 0.05% epinastine was more potent than that of 0.1% olopatadine. If eye drop treatment before histamine dispersion increases the number of inactive histamine H1 receptors, this inhibits the receptor expression and decreases the stimulation response threshold on allergic reactions, resulting in a possible reduction of subjective symptoms after dispersion; in particular, this may be important for preseasonal therapy.<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b15-opth-11-1747" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In our patients, eye drop treatment was started 4 weeks prior to cedar pollen dispersion, and the rate of change in the total symptom score in the 0.05% epinastine group was significantly lower than in the 0.1% olopatadine group. In addition, stable effects were obtained for the subsequent 3 months. This suggests that 0.05% epinastine, which has a potent inverse agonist activity, is useful for preventing symptoms and maintaining the effects as preseasonal therapy.</p><p>Among symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, pruritus, discomfort, and eye discharge reduce the quality of life most markedly. It is important to clarify the preventive effects of preseasonal therapy on these symptoms. In this study, eye discharge was significantly reduced in the 0.05% epinastine group 3 months after the start of administration. There were no significant differences in the preventive effects on pruritus or discomfort between the two groups; the effects may have been similar. However, symptom changes were less marked in the 0.05% epinastine group; the symptoms may have been more markedly reduced, and stable symptom-reducing effects may have been maintained.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in this study. In Stage 1 (seasonal treatment), there was a difference in the total objective finding score at baseline between the two groups despite random drug assignment using the envelope method. However, there were no significant differences at any subsequent point of time; therefore, there may have been no difference in the efficacy of eye drop treatment. In the future, a larger number of patients should be reviewed. In Stage 2 (preseasonal treatment), the number of patients was small. Further examination may be necessary in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the efficacy of 0.05% epinastine may be similar to that of 0.1% olopatadine as seasonal treatment. However, as preseasonal therapy, 0.05% epinastine may be more effective than 0.1% olopatadine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>TM received a partial research funds from Santen Pharmaceutical Co..
