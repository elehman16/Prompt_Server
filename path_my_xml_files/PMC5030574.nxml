Endoscopic coagulation of angiodysplasias is the mainstay of treatment, but may be difficult for small bowel angiodysplasias because of the inability to reach them for endoscopic intervention. Some patients are red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent due to frequent rebleeding despite endoscopic treatment. In small cohort studies, octreotide appears to decrease the number of bleeding episodes in patients with RBC transfusion dependency due to gastrointestinal angiodysplasias. This trial will assess the efficacy of octreotide in decreasing the need for RBC transfusions and parenteral iron in patients with anaemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel angiodysplasias despite endoscopic intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Randomised controlled, superiority, open-label multicentre trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>62 patients will be included with refractory anaemia due to small bowel angiodysplasias, who are RBC transfusion or iron infusion dependent despite endoscopic intervention and oral iron supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to standard care or 40&#x02005;mg long-acting octreotide once every 4&#x02005;weeks for 52&#x02005;weeks, in addition to standard care. The follow-up period is 8&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome is the difference in the number of blood and iron infusions between the year prior to inclusion and the treatment period of 1&#x02005;year.

Approximately 90% of haemorrhagic ADs cease spontaneously, but recurrence is high.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The impact on the patient may be large with a need for multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, frequent hospitalisations and surgery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Decreased quality of life and the financial burden on healthcare systems are legitimate concerns.</p><p>There are different treatment options for symptomatic ADs: (1) conservative management with iron supplementation and, when necessary, RBC transfusions, (2) endoscopic intervention with argon plasma coagulation (APC), (3) radiological intervention with artery coiling, (4) pharmacological therapies and (5) surgical resection. Endoscopic APC is the preferred treatment. Recurrent bleeding rates in patients treated with APC remain high, with rates up to 20% over a 2-year follow-up.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> ADs located in the small bowel are associated with an even high rebleeding rate, up to 45%. This could be related to their relative inaccessibility with standard endoscopy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As a result, some of these patients develop refractory anaemia and become dependent on symptomatic treatment with parenteral iron supplementation and RBC transfusions.</p><p>Determining the most effective pharmacological treatment in these patients with small bowel AD-associated refractory anaemia is challenging. Oestrogen and progesterone are not effective and while<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;12</xref> thalidomide has been advocated for bleeding ADs, side effects are considerable.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Therapy with octreotide is promising, because of its antiangiogenic properties, decrease in splanchnic blood flow and enhanced platelet aggregation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Moreover, it is easy to use and has a relative mild side effect profile. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of octreotide in reducing AD bleeding.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;21</xref> A non-randomised study compared 32 refractory AD patients treated with octreotide to an external placebo control group, which showed a significant decrease in rebleeding rate and need for oral iron.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Recently, a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) was performed with the somatostatin analogue pasireotide, with promising results.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, no statistical difference in RBC transfusions was observed. Other cohort studies showed a significant decrease of more than 50% in RBC transfusion requirements.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref> Extrapolation of these results is difficult in view of the very small size of cohorts and absence of control groups.</p><p>We designed a randomised, open-label controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of octreotide. We hypothesise that octreotide decreases the need for RBC transfusions and iron supplementation in patients with refractory anaemia due to small bowel ADs. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of octreotide to decrease the RBC and iron transfusions in patients with refractory anaemia due to small bowel ADs. Also, we determine if octreotide decreases the number of rebleeds and assess safety and cost-effectiveness compared with standard care.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a phase III, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, superiority, multicentre trial of standard care plus octreotide, compared with standard care in 62 patients with anaemia despite endoscopic intervention due to small bowel ADs (OCEAN).

It is known that gastrointestinal AD is mostly a disease of the elderly; younger patients with symptomatic AD might have another aetiology (eg, Rendu-Osler-Weber).

Stratification will be based on two variables with each of the two groups: (1) the use of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors versus no anticoagulant drugs; (2) only iron infusion dependent versus iron and blood infusion dependency. Therefore, block randomisation will consist of block sizes of 4. The trial is not blinded for patients and treating physicians, but the outcome adjudication committee is.</p><p>A web-based patient randomisation service for clinical trials will be used (Castor Electronic Data Collection (EDC)). When the screening visit data are entered in the electronical case record form (eCRF), and information regarding use of anticoagulants and/or platelet aggregation inhibitors is given, randomisation will be performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trial treatments</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Octreotide</title><p>Patients in the intervention group will simultaneously receive two injections of 20&#x02005;mg Sandostatin LAR (octreotide) intramuscular every 28&#x02005;days on top of standard of care. Treatment duration is 1&#x02005;year with 2&#x02005;months follow-up for all patients. Long-acting octreotide (LAR formulation) is chosen for patient comfort to only have injections once monthly and thereby optimise patient adherence. This dose is higher than existing evidence on octreotide for this indication. The reason is that it is still not proven with an RCT that samatostatin analogues (SST) is effective in these patients and this is a proof-of-principle study rather than a dose-finding study. Moreover, for other indications, higher monthly dosages of somatostatin analogues are more effective.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> When patients develop severe but not life-threatening adverse events (AEs; ie, grade 3; hospitalisation required or limitation of patient's ability to care for himself/herself), we will reduce the dosage with 10&#x02005;mg until AEs disappear. When a grade 3 AE persists despite dosage reduction, Sandostatin LAR will be discontinued. Those patients will be followed after discontinuation and will not be excluded from analyses. If patients are unresponsive to octreotide (Sandostatin) LAR 40&#x02005;mg monthly, we will not increase the dose any further. Sandostatin LAR will be administered at the patients' home by experienced nurses from Novanurses, a service provided by Eurocept Homecare.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Standard care</title><p>To align clinical practices in the participating centres, a standard of care protocol is developed to treat patients similarly during the treatment phase of this trial. A summary of this protocol is given below.</p><p>Anticoagulant therapy can be modified after randomisation according to local practice of the attending physician and is registered as adjustment in the standard of care. However, in most patients with such severe AD bleeding, the option of withdrawal antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy would have been considered prior to entry in the trial.</p><p>The first choice of therapy is oral iron supplementation and must be initiated prior to starting parenteral iron as maintenance therapy. When oral iron is insufficient and iron deficiency anaemia persists, parenteral iron may be administered (maximum 20&#x02005;mg/kg bodyweight).</p><p>RBC transfusion is only indicated when anaemia persists despite parenteral iron supplementation.

Data will be collected into an eCRF (Castor) designed to capture all visit information including medical history, results from laboratory analysis and AEs. The study duration for all patients is 60&#x02005;weeks in total, divided into a screening phase, a 52-week treatment phase and a 8-week follow-up phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011442F1">figure 1</xref>). At screening, each participant will be screened for eligibility after written IC is obtained. In women with childbearing potential, a pregnancy test is performed. Within the treatment phase of the trial, patients are seen at weeks 0, 4, 16, 28 and 52. One week after the first injection, the patient will receive a phone call to assess AEs. The follow-up visit takes place 2&#x02005;months after the octreotide concentration is below therapeutic doses, which is 8&#x02005;weeks after the last treatment phase visit. This study visit aims to detect late AEs rather than establish the long-term effect of octreotide after discontinuation. During each visit, medical history, medication use, AEs, tolerability and drug accountability are assessed. In addition, a physical examination is performed and blood samples are drawn. Glucose, liver enzymes and lipid profile are checked to assess the possible side effects of octreotide. Patients have to fill out two questionnaires (SF-36 and PSQ-An) three times, that is, at the start (week 0) and end of treatment (week 52), and at follow-up (week 60).

It is designed to determine whether and to what extent octreotide treatment can decrease parenteral iron and RBC transfusion requirements. This trial has a relevant clinical end point, that is, 50% reduction in parenteral iron and/or RBC transfusions, with an adequate powered sample size. A statistically significant outcome has direct implications for current practice of patients with refractory anaemia due to gastrointestinal ADs. Furthermore, this design provides an opportunity to study the safety of octreotide in a monthly dose of 40&#x02005;mg in patients with ADs. Finally, we incorporate patient-reported outcome measurements to investigate the effect of octreotide on quality of life and cost-effectiveness. A retrospective study suggests that octreotide LAR treatment is cost-effective in these patients,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> but no previous studies evaluated treatment of ADs from the most important perspective: the patient's perspective.</p><p>Some possible concerns need to be addressed. First, although a double-blind, placebo-controlled designed trial would have been superior in minimising the chance of information bias, an advantage of this current design is that it resembles the effect in clinical practice more after implementation of the intervention in comparison to a blinded trial.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Second, the primary outcome at baseline (parenteral iron and RBC transfusion requirements before start of treatment phase) is determined retrospectively in both groups, which could lead to regression to the mean and information bias. However, comparing the outcomes between the two groups should wash out any effect of regression to the mean. We think the risk of information bias as a consequence of the retrospective retrieval is low due to the fact that parenteral iron administration or RBC transfusion must be registered and therefore retrievable in the patient's electronic record. Third, with other somatostatin analogues (eg, pasireotide), intramuscular use could cause haematomas, especially in patients on anticoagulants. This might lead to a reduction in injections compared with the protocol and could influence the results. Fourth, the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria will slow down our inclusion rate with possible delay in gaining the final results. Finally, we did not stratify for any possible differences between centres. Owing to the small number of patient inclusions per centre, centre stratification might lead to more unbalanced randomisation than it would correct for an influence due to differences in practice.</p><p>Despite these concerns, our study will add significant value to the existing body of literature on treatment of patients with refractory anaemia resulting from small bowel ADs bleeds. The rigorous design of the OCEAN trial will address the efficacy of octreotide in therapy-resistant anaemia from small bowel ADs.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen approved the protocol in August 2015.
