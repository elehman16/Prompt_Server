The International Conference on Harmonization of good clinical practice and others recommends that clinical trials should be analyzed according to a pre-specified plan to prevent outcome reporting bias and data-driven analysis results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This paper describes the statistical analysis plan for the PP-Trial. Recruitment, randomization, and inclusion of 90 patients were completed by 7 November 2013. All patients were followed for 90&#x000a0;days and the last 90-day follow-up was completed on 3 March 2014. The main publication of the PP-Trial results will adhere to this statistical analysis plan as approved by the steering group. The statistical analysis plan was amended to on the presentation of the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov before data analysis was commenced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial overview</title><p>The PP-Trial is a randomized, parallel group clinical trial comparing pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion during CPB-dependent cardiac surgery in COPD patients. The patients, the statistician, and conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before inclusion in the trial. The population represents adult patients with COPD receiving coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR), or the two interventions in combination. The trial background, design, and rationale have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The PP-Trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01614951) and is carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Committees on Biomedical Research Ethics of The Capital Region of Denmark (approval number: H-1-2012-024), the Danish Medicines Agency (approval number: 2012024017, EudraCT number: 2011-006290-25, protocol code: 4141), and the Danish Data Protection Agency (approval number: 2011-41-7051).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p>The main comparison will be each of the pulmonary perfusion groups (oxygenated blood or Custodiol HTK solution) compared with no pulmonary perfusion. An exploratory comparison between the two pulmonary perfusion groups will be performed in case the main comparison indicates a benefit of pulmonary perfusion on the primary outcome.</p><p>With three groups and thereby multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To limit the family-wise error rate to 0.05, considering two main comparisons and one exploratory comparison, we adjusted the significance level for the primary outcome to &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025 (0.05/2) for each of the three comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With an acceptable risk of type II error of 0.10, we estimated the necessary sample size. The anticipated intervention effects and variance were based on data from previously randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed mean difference in the PF (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of 55&#x000a0;mmHg and a standard deviation (SD) of 50&#x000a0;mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and an assumed mean difference in the PF ratio of 150&#x000a0;mmHg and a SD of 110&#x000a0;mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The sample size estimation showed that we would need 22 patients in two groups to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 55&#x000a0;mmHg in the PF ratio between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion. It also showed that we would need 15 patients in two groups to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 150&#x000a0;mmHg in the PF ratio between pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion. We therefore estimated that we would need three groups of 30 patients to preserve power in the complete case analysis in case of eventual patient dropouts or loss to follow-up. If we find a positive effect on the oxygenation index for both of the pulmonary perfusion groups when compared with patients who do not receive pulmonary perfusion, the exploratory comparison of the two pulmonary perfusion groups becomes interesting. To calculate a hypothetical sample size for this comparison we set a value for the anticipated mean difference and SD to 30&#x000a0;mmHg and 30&#x000a0;mmHg, respectively. With a significance level for the primary outcome still being &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025 and the power set to 90%, we calculated the sample size for this comparison to be 26 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Stratification and design variables</title><p>We will use preoperative lung function as a stratification variable.

If the result of the primary outcome is not statistically significant, the conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the interventions. The results on all other types of outcomes will be reported for hypothesis-generating purposes. However, we will inspect the confidence interval (CI) to asses if the CI for the group difference contains values of importance, so that we cannot rule out interesting differences.</p><p>The primary analysis will include a modified intention-to-treat population, which is defined as all randomized patients, except patients who did not receive CPB-dependent cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A secondary analysis will include the per-protocol population excluding patients with major protocol violations defined as: 1) patients who were randomized to an intervention but did not receive any intervention; and 2) patients who received an incorrect intervention. The dependent variable will be the oxygenation index measured six times and the covariates will be the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD), design (age, FEV1, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the patient&#x02019;s baseline oxygenation index measured after anaesthetic induction) and intervention-group variable.</p><p>For the modified intension-to-treat population and the per-protocol population two analyses will be performed for primary and secondary outcomes. The first analysis will be on the patients who met the inclusion criteria but did not meet the exclusion criteria, with adjustment for the stratification variable. The second analysis will be an analysis adjusted for both the stratification variable and the design variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The conclusions of the trial will be based on the primary analysis.</p><p>Linear mixed-effects model analysis of longitudinal data will be used to analyze the primary outcome. The linear mixed-effects model approach handles missing data appropriately and we will therefore not use multiple imputation or other methods to handle missing data in regard to the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If data missingness for the remaining outcomes represent less than 5% (five patients), a complete case analysis without input of missing values will be performed. If missing data are more than 5%, a blinded statistician will assess whether missing data are completely at random and may be ruled out based on a rational assessment of the pattern of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and Little&#x02019;s test will be used if doubt remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If it is concluded that missing data are not completely at random, multiple imputation using chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] will be performed by creating 10 input data sets under the assumption of that the missing data are at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We will use the stratification-, design-, and intervention-variables, as well as other known predictive outcomes, in the multiple imputation to estimate the missing values. If multiple imputation is used, then the primary result of the trial will be based on these data. The unadjusted, non-imputed analysis will also be made available. If multiple imputation is used, we use a best-worst worst-best case scenario as a supplement and a form of sensitivity analysis to assess the potential range of impact of the missing data for the trial results. In the &#x02018;best-worst&#x02019; case scenario, it is assumed that all patients lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a beneficial outcome (have survived, had no serious adverse events, and so forth), and all those with missing outcomes in the control group have had a harmful outcome (have not survived, have had a serious adverse event, and so forth). Conversely, in the &#x02018;worst-best&#x02019; case scenario, it is assumed that all patients who were lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a harmful outcome, and that all those lost to follow-up in the control group have had a beneficial outcome. When continuous outcomes are used, a &#x02018;beneficial outcome&#x02019; will be defined as the group mean plus two standard deviation (SD) of the group mean, and a &#x02018;harmful outcome&#x02019; will be defined as the group mean minus two SD of the group mean.</p><p>We will assess the validity of the trial results according to the five-point procedure as suggested by Jakobsen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This procedure will include the mentioned adjustments of thresholds for significance according to the number of primary outcome comparisons. We will use a <italic>P</italic> value threshold for significance of 0.025 (0.05/2 because two primary outcome comparisons are used) and a Bayes factor threshold for significance of 0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial profile</title><p>The flow of trial patients will be displayed in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The oxygenation index is for all patients measured at six time points: (1) after anaesthetic induction, (2) 10 to 15&#x000a0;minutes after CPB, (3) 120 to 125&#x000a0;min after CPB, (4) 240 to 245&#x000a0;min after CPB, (5) 360 to 365&#x000a0;min after CPB, and (6) 24&#x000a0;hours post-anaesthetic induction. The baseline measurement for the primary outcome is the oxygenation index measured after anaesthetic induction. This measurement will be included in the analysis as a covariate.</p><p>Since the time points for measurement of the oxygenation index do not have equidistant time intervals, we will also carry out a sensitivity analysis with time as an ordinal variable where the time intervals are equal. The mixed-effects model results will be presented as <italic>P</italic> values and 95% CI.</p><p>In the mixed-effects model we will use both an &#x02018;unstructured' and a '1. order autoregressive' covariance matrix and choose the matrix resulting in the lowest Bayesian information criterion. To assess, if the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals, standardized residuals, and random effects. If the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are clearly violated then we will use a generalized estimation equation for the analysis.</p><p>Secondly we will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the three groups at the 24&#x000a0;hours after anaesthetic induction time point. The baseline oxygenation index will also be included here in the analysis as a covariate. At this time point the oxygenation index is among others used to evaluate if the patients&#x02019; circulatory and respiratory system is stable enough to discharge them from the intensive care unit to the ward. To assess whether the assumptions for the ANCOVA are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals and residuals versus fitted values.

The fourth figure will be a forest plot of intervention effects stratified for the subgroups defined by the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD) and design variables: age dichotomized around the median, FEV1 dichotomized around the median, left ventricular ejection fraction dichotomized around the median, and the patient&#x02019;s baseline oxygenation index dichotomized around the median.</p><p>The first table will be the baseline characteristics of the modified intention-to-treat population, the second table will be the prevalence of the binary and continuous outcome measures adjusted for the stratification variable, and the third table will be the results of the adjusted (stratification and design variables) complete case and multiple imputation analyses, with a 95% CI and exact <italic>P</italic> values in tabular form. A fourth table showing how many patients in each group had one, two, three, four, and so forth adverse events will also be produced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Deviations from the initial design and method of the trial</title><p>Due to a much lower than expected number of patients receiving transcatheter aortic-valve implantation, we were forced to exclude that intervention as our planned secondary control group and that comparison is therefore deleted in this statistically analysis plan.</p><p>Some of the secondary outcome measures are not completed due to lack in financial support and collaborates not able to fulfill assignments. These are as follows: number and degree of activated alveolar macrophages and T-cells measurement and differentiation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, degree of uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation in the musculus transversus abdominis, and pulmonary tissue mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper presents the detailed statistical analysis plan for the PP-Trial in order to avoid risks of outcome reporting bias and data-driven results. Of the pre-specified results from the trial, we plan to report the primary and secondary outcome measures in the main publication. Due to the complexity of the CPB-induced inflammatory response, considered an exploratory outcome, we have scheduled separate publication(s).</p><p>We will use a pragmatic adjustment for multiplicity described in the following. The primary conclusion of the trial will be based on the result of the primary outcome and if this result lacks statistically significance, the overall conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the compared interventions. We will analyze data in accordance to the modified intention-to-treat principle and, if necessary, use data sets generated by multiple imputations, and a best-worst/worst-best case scenario to assess the potential impact of the missing data on the results.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Strengths</title><p>Our methodological strength is the predefined methodology of the design and statistical analysis plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Also, we take the multiplicity problem into account and use validated analytical methods, including systematic tests, for underlying assumptions. We strengthen our results by use of multiple imputations for missing data and the best-worst/worst-best case scenario to show range of the results&#x02019; uncertainty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p>The statistical analysis plan has limitations. The results on the primary outcome are analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model which can be difficult to interpret with analytical complexity and may be difficult to test for underlying assumption. Further, the sample size estimation was based on a slightly different outcome measure, the PF ratio (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen), which does not include airway pressure as for the oxygenation index, and the estimated sample size does not necessarily comply with what is needed in the mixed-effects model. For some of the oxygenation index measurements the patient will be extubated breathing atmospheric air or receiving oxygen supply by a nasal catheter or oxygen mask. In these cases, the oxygenation index is calculated by first converting the external oxygen supply to an estimated fraction of inspired oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and second by setting the mean airway pressure to 1, removing that parameter from the equation. That leaves us with comparisons of the oxygenation index under different circumstances (intubated or extubated), and calculations which may constitute a source of error in our results.</p><p>We use a number of surrogate outcome measures with questionable clinical relevance, and even though we have classified the trial as a pilot trial, there is a risk that the trial via valid statistical methodology will indicate that the assessed interventions are beneficial, which could be misleading because of the unestablished clinical relevance of the surrogate outcome measures. Further, we have included a number of clinically relevant secondary outcome measures but we are likely not to have sufficient power to reliable access and conclude on these measures. Finally, we use multiple imputation to handle missing data on the remaining outcome measures and it cannot be ruled out that data missing are not at random and multiple imputation may produce biased results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This article describes the principles of statistical analyses used in the PP-Trial for the primary publication of the main outcome measures in order to minimize risk of data-driven results and outcome reporting bias.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2014_2387_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVR</term><def><p>Aortic valve replacement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CABG</term><def><p>Coronary artery bypass graft</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPB</term><def><p>Cardiopulmonary bypass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV1</term><def><p>Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOLD</term><def><p>Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTK</term><def><p>Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP-Trial</term><def><p>Pulmonary protection trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The lead author (KB) is supported by The Lundbeck foundation.
