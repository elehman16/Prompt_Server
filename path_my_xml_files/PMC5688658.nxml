The most common cause of primary PPH is uterine atony. Atonic PPH rates are increasing in developed countries despite routine active management of the third stage of labour. In less-developed countries, primary PPH remains the leading cause of maternal death.</p><p id="Par2">Although the value of routine oxytocics in the third stage of labour has been well established, there is inconsistent practice in the choice of agent and route of administration. Oxytocin is the preferred agent because it has fewer side effects than other uterotonics with similar efficacy. It can be given intravenously or intramuscularly; however, to date, the most effective route of administering oxytocin has not been established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par3">A double-blind randomised controlled trial is planned. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of an intramuscular bolus of oxytocin (10&#x000a0;IU in 1&#x000a0;mL) and placebo intravenous injection (1&#x000a0;mL 0.9% saline given slowly) with an intravenous bolus of oxytocin (10&#x000a0;IU in 1&#x000a0;mL given slowly over 1&#x000a0;min) and placebo intramuscular injection (1&#x000a0;mL 0.9% saline) at vaginal delivery. The study will recruit 1000 women at term (&#x0003e;36&#x000a0;weeks) with singleton pregnancies who are aiming for a vaginal delivery. The primary outcome will be PPH (measured blood loss&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mL). A study involving 1000 women will have 80% power at the 5% two-sided alpha level, to detect differences in the proportion of patients with measured blood loss&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;ml of 10% vs 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Given the increasing trends of atonic PPH it is both important and timely that we evaluate the most effective route of oxytocin administration for the management of the third stage of labour.

Obstetric complications are increasing with the changing profile of labouring women, who are now more likely to be older, to be obese or to have significant medical co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. PPH-associated morbidity includes maternal exhaustion, difficulty breast feeding, anaemia, blood transfusion and the risks associated with receiving donor blood products. In severe cases it may lead to emergency surgery, admission to an intensive care unit or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Recent estimates of global maternal mortality indicate that over 300,000 women, mostly from developing countries, lose their lives during pregnancy and childbirth every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PPH accounts for nearly one-quarter of maternal deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most common underlying cause of PPH is uterine atony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PPH rates have been reported to be increasing in developed countries over the past 15&#x000a0;years including Australia, Canada and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A population-based cohort study conducted in Ireland reported trends in atonic postpartum haemorrhage over 11&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was reported that the overall PPH rate among hospital-based deliveries has increased substantially from 1.5% in 1999 to 4.9% in 2009. The increase in atonic PPH rates were observed across vaginal and instrumental deliveries, as well as Caesarean deliveries. Importantly, there was a significant increase in the incidence of women needing blood transfusion, signalling a rise in more severe atonic PPH, unlikely to relate to prior under-reporting. The study authors advised further evaluation of the active management of the third stage of labour.</p><p id="Par31">The value of routine oxytocics in the third stage of vaginal birth has been well established although the choice of agent and route of administration remain controversial. There are several uterotonics that can be used in the active management of the third stage of labour such as synthetic oxytocin, ergometrine, oxytocin-ergometrine, misoprostol and carbetocin. Several meta-analyses have been performed comparing these agents. Oxytocin is the preferred agent because it has fewer side effects compared with other uterotonics with similar efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Oxytocin reduces the risk of PPH by about 60% and the need for therapeutic oxytocics by about 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Oxytocin can be given intravenously or intramuscularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The intramuscular (IM) route has the advantage of ease of administration and requires relatively less skill to administer. Following IM injection, the effect on the uterus appears within 3&#x02013;7&#x000a0;min and persists for 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min. With the intravenous (IV) route the uterine response is almost instantaneous, within 1&#x000a0;min or less, compared to IM administration which results in a slower onset of action but produces a longer lasting effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is recognised that early rapid delivery of the uterotonic drug may be associated with a lower risk of postpartum haemorrhage; however, this may increase the risk of cardiovascular side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. IV administration is the preferred route at Caesarean section where the risk of haemorrhage is higher.</p><p id="Par33">A recent Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] looked at the effect of prophylactic oxytocin for the management of the third stage of labour and found that it is effective in preventing blood loss&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mL at any dose, in the range of 3&#x02013;10&#x000a0;IU, compared with placebo. The need for additional uterotonics is reduced when a 10&#x000a0;IU dose is used and when given as an IV bolus. The guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) recommend an IM bolus dose of 10&#x000a0;IU of oxytocin following delivery of the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The WHO guidelines recommend oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU intramuscularly or by slow IV injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">In the Coombe Women &#x00026; Infants&#x02019; University Hospital, both methods of administering oxytocin are commonly used. The traditional practice over several decades was to administer oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU intravenously following delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby. A new protocol was implemented recommending the IM route of oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU in keeping with RCOG guidelines. Concerns were raised by established practitioners about a higher risk of haemorrhage with the IM route, which led to variation in practice. This presented the ideal opportunity for a randomised controlled trial (RCT). We chose to compare oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU administered by IV vs IM injection in accordance with international prevention of PPH guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Various trials have compared IV oxytocin slow bolus with placebo and with alternative uterotonics with no undesirable side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Early clamping of the umbilical cord was one of the first routine medical interventions in labour and its role in current practice has been questioned. Weeks, in an editorial, describes how its place in modern births was guaranteed by its incorporation into the triad of interventions that make up the traditional active management of the third stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The earliest references are clear about the other two components of active management&#x02014;oxytocin to contract the uterus and controlled cord traction to prevent retention of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, early cord clamping had no specific rationale and Weeks speculates that it probably entered the protocol by default because it was already part of standard practice. When this package was shown to reduce postpartum haemorrhage in the 1980s early cord clamping became enshrined in the modern management of labour. There are now very strong arguments to support deferred cord clamping for 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min and this has resulted in an amendment to that effect in the RCOG and WHO Postpartum Haemorrhage Prevention guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Deferred cord clamping was implemented as part of the current study protocol.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par36">A search of Medline from 1965 to 2016 and of the Cochrane Library was undertaken for relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, RCTs and other clinical studies.

At the time of drafting the LabOR trial protocol and commencing the study, there were no published RCTs that compare the effect of the two routes of oxytocin administration on blood loss&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mL at vaginal delivery.</p><p id="Par38">We have updated our literature review in preparation for publication of the study protocol and identified two recent RCTs that compare the IM and IV route of oxytocin for preventing haemorrhage in the third stage of labour. Dagderiven et al. compared oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU intravenously in 1&#x000a0;L normal saline infused at a rate of 1&#x000a0;mL/min to oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU intramuscularly.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Survey of current practice</title><p id="Par39">Before undertaking this study, it was important to establish the need for such a trial. A survey was carried out in the UK in the form of a questionnaire looking at current practice during the third stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The questionnaire was sent to fellows and members of the RCOG and to members of the RCM. The questionnaire focused on the frequency of usage of the active management, timing of administration of prophylactic uterotonic agents, type and route of administering uterotonics, timing of clamping the cord (at term and preterm births) and the use of controlled cord traction. The clinicians were also asked if they thought more evidence from RCTs was needed to guide care during the third stage of labour.</p><p id="Par40">A total of 4630 questionnaires were sent. Of these 53% of the fellows and members of the RCOG responded and 71% of midwives responded. Of the respondents 93% of obstetricians and 73% of midwives reported &#x02018;always or usually&#x02019; using active management of the third stage of labour for vaginal births. Syntometrine was the uterotonic agent &#x02018;usually&#x02019; used at vaginal births by 86% of midwives and 79% of obstetricians; 89% of midwives and 81% of obstetricians thought more evidence from RCTs was needed to guide care during the third stage.</p><p id="Par41">The findings of the survey show that active management of the third stage of labour is widely used by obstetricians and midwives in the UK, which is consistent with recommendations by NICE, WHO, Canada and the RCOG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Syntometrine is the most commonly used uterotonic which was a surprise finding given that NICE, WHO and the RCOG guidelines clearly recommend use of oxytocin as the prophylactic uterotonic agent for the third stage. The NICE guideline recommends the IM route for oxytocin while WHO and RCOG guidelines mention both IM and IV oxytocin can be used. Most obstetricians and midwives thought more evidence from RCTs was needed to guide care in the third stage of labour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par42">The aim of this study is to compare the effects of an intramuscular bolus of oxytocin (10&#x000a0;IU in 1&#x000a0;mL) and placebo IV injection (1&#x000a0;mL 0.9% saline given slowly) with an IV bolus of oxytocin (10&#x000a0;IU in 1&#x000a0;mL given slowly over 1&#x000a0;min) and placebo IM injection (1&#x000a0;mL 0.9% saline) at vaginal delivery in a double-blind RCT.

First, it is not possible to pre-prepare syringes due to a lack of stability data for pre-prepared oxytocin syringes. Second, it has not been possible to obtain identically matched placebo ampoules. Third, the research ethics committees required that the midwife caring for the patient observes the drawing up of the oxytocin and placebo so that she has verified the contents of the injections she will be administering, albeit blinded to which syringe contains the active agent.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par60">Women will be informed of the study antenatally in the outpatient clinics and antenatal classes; they will be provided with an information leaflet which has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee in National Maternity Hospital by the research fellow.

This will be checked by the midwife in charge of the woman&#x02019;s care in the labour room, in keeping with the hospital policy of drawing up medications. The randomisation and labelling of the syringes will occur outside the room.

The baby can be positioned either on the mother&#x02019;s chest or abdomen following the birth while the cord is intact and immediate newborn care can be commenced at the same time. The baby should not be raised more than this level with the cord still intact due to the effects of gravity on placental transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The cord will be clamped close to the umbilicus in the usual manner and the timing of cord clamping will be recorded in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes and case report form (CRF).</p><p id="Par70">However, early cord clamping may be necessary in situations of emergency such as postpartum haemorrhage, presence of a tight nuchal cord or if immediate resuscitation is required for an asphyxiated baby. In situations as these, where expedient management is important to minimise complications to the patient or the baby, the obstetrician or midwives who are attending the birth should decide on the timing of clamping the cord, which will be recorded in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes with the reason for early cord clamping.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Placental delivery</title><p id="Par71">The placenta should be delivered by controlled cord traction following cord clamping and cutting, once the signs of separation are apparent (uterine contraction, show of blood and apparent cord lengthening).

Once there is no concern of further active bleeding, the blood loss will be estimated by weighing all the soiled materials (swabs, pads, disposable sheets) on a scale and subtracting the known weights of these materials to determine the blood loss. Women remain on the labour ward for a minimum of 1&#x000a0;h after the birth and are monitored throughout that time period. They are then transferred to the postnatal ward if there are no apparent complications.</p><p id="Par77">For women who have an assisted vaginal delivery, Comfy Guard&#x000ae;, a surgical drape with a pouch for collecting vaginal blood loss, will be placed under the woman&#x02019;s buttocks in preparation for birth and before delivery of the placenta. The bag is transparent allowing continuous monitoring of blood loss. The bag will be left in situ until the birth attendant is no longer concerned about blood loss, such as when a sanitary towel is applied to the vulva. The blood collected in the surgical drape will be weighed. Blood-soaked swabs and additional drapes will also be weighed and the known dry weight of the swabs and drapes will be subtracted. This volume will be added to the measured blood volume from the surgical drape.</p><p id="Par78">Any delayed blood loss occurring within 24&#x000a0;h of delivery will also be recorded. It is possible that there may be a difference in estimates of blood loss based on different durations of blood loss collection for women with early or delayed transfer to the postnatal ward. This potential limitation will be addressed by routinely documenting any additional significant blood loss within 24&#x000a0;h of delivery.</p><p id="Par79">Maternal vital signs will be recorded after delivery and before transfer to the postnatal ward. The occurrence of side effects will be recorded using an observation form (attached with the application). Deviations from the standard procedure will be recorded.

The first stage of analysis will be to use descriptive statistics to describe recruited individuals in relation to those eligible and to investigate comparability of the trial arms at baseline. The primary analyses will involve intention-to-treat comparisons between the two groups for the primary outcomes, with transformation as appropriate after examination of distributions and adjusted for stratification variables (i.e. parity). The study aims to evaluate haemorrhage at vaginal delivery and women who deliver by Caesarean section will be excluded post-randomisation and accounted for in the CONSORT diagram. Secondary analyses will investigate the effects of further adjustment for any variables displaying marked imbalance between the arms at baseline. Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar way. All analyses will use appropriate (that is, logistic or linear) regression models, with results presented as point estimates (odds ratios or difference in means), 95% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic> values. Further secondary analyses will involve planned subgroup analyses and will use multivariable regression models with appropriate interaction terms to ascertain any differential effects in relation to induction of labour, parity and history of previous postpartum haemorrhage.

These estimates are based on observed recording of haemorrhage and it is well recognised that obstetricians and midwives underestimate blood loss. It is therefore likely that the rate of postpartum haemorrhage based on measured blood loss will be higher, consistent with our findings on the ECSSIT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">With 500 patients per group for analysis, the study will have 80% power at the 5% two-sided alpha level, to detect differences in the proportion of patients with measured blood loss&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mL of 10% vs 5% or 15% vs 9%, equivalent to odds ratios of 0.50 and 0.55, respectively. It could be argued that any difference in effect on the primary clinical outcome would be worth detecting. Rather, given the need for timely delivery of evidence, we have specified detectable differences for realistic sample sizes recruited within a reasonable time frame within the constraints of the available funding. The results can be included in future Cochrane systematic reviews and may support funding of a future larger trial if smaller but clinically relevant differences are detected.</p><p id="Par90">Over the course of 18&#x000a0;months we aim to recruit a minimum of 1000 patients representing 20% of the available population; this conservative estimate takes account of eligibility criteria and non-English speaking women.

Obstetricians, obstetric anaesthetists, midwives and pregnant women need high quality evidence on which to base management approaches. The optimal approach to use of oxytocin in the third stage of labour is a poorly evaluated component of maternity care, despite its widespread use.
