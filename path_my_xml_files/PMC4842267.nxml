The objective was to compare the treatment effect on pain intensity, pain related disability and perceived recovery from a) naprapathic manual therapy (spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, stretching and massage) to b) naprapathic manual therapy without spinal manipulation and to c) naprapathic manual therapy without stretching for male and female patients seeking care for back and/or neck pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Participants were recruited among patients, ages 18&#x02013;65, seeking care at the educational clinic of Naprapath&#x000f6;gskolan - the Scandinavian College of Naprapathic Manual Medicine in Stockholm. The patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1057) were randomized to one of three treatment arms a) manual therapy (i.e. spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, stretching and massage), b) manual therapy excluding spinal manipulation and c) manual therapy excluding stretching. The primary outcomes were minimal clinically important improvement in pain intensity and pain related disability. Treatments were provided by naprapath students in the seventh semester of eight total semesters. Generalized estimating equations and logistic regression were used to examine the association between the treatments and the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 12&#x000a0;weeks follow-up, 64&#x000a0;% had a minimal clinically important improvement in pain intensity and 42&#x000a0;% in pain related disability. The corresponding chances to be improved at the 52&#x000a0;weeks follow-up were 58 % and 40&#x000a0;% respectively. No systematic differences in effect when excluding spinal manipulation and stretching respectively from the treatment were found over 1&#x000a0;year follow-up, concerning minimal clinically important improvement in pain intensity (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41) and pain related disability (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85) and perceived recovery (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98).

The costs stem from loss of work and medical expenses, as well as other direct or indirect expenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Life time prevalence of spinal pain has been reported to be 54 to 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To manage these painful and disabling conditions manual therapists (i.e. chiropractors, naprapaths, osteopaths, physicians and physiotherapists) often combine manual techniques as spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, stretching and massage. According to Cochrane reviews, manual therapy appears to be no better or worse than other existing therapies for patients with neck and back pain, and the long term effects are often unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other systematic reviews have suggested manual therapy to be an effective and cost effective treatment option for neck pain and back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] especially if combined with education and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Rubinstein et al. included in a systematic review a few studies showing that spinal manipulation was more effective for low back pain than mobilization in the short term but not in the long term. Other studies that did not find any difference in effect between the two techniques, and no conclusion was drawn regarding this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Stretching has been suggested to be an effective treatment alternative for low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and exercise with combined strengthening, range-of-motion, and flexibility exercises is considered effective for persistent neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>According to recent studies naprapathic manual therapy (NMT) is an effective and cost effective treatment alternative for musculoskeletal pain both in the short and the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Naprapathy in Scandinavia is defined as a system for specific examination, diagnostics, manual treatment and rehabilitation of pain and dysfunction for the musculoskeletal system. NMT is a combination of manual techniques such as spinal manipulation/mobilization, stretching and massage used to treat shortened or pathologic soft and connective tissue that are thought to be common causes to these pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The profession of naprapathy was initiated in 1907 in the United States, and is today practiced mainly in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Since 1994, a naprapath is a registered health professional in Finland and Sweden. Registered naprapaths are overseen by the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health in Finland and by The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden. Naprapathy is the largest registered profession within manual therapy in Sweden, larger than the professions of Chiropractic and Osteopathy.</p><p>NMT is a young area of research and further studies are needed to develop the discipline and to ascertain quality assurance. Aspects of this are the risk of adverse events and if treatment effects and risks differ between different combinations of NMT (with and without spinal manipulation and stretching). We have performed a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) called the Stockholm MINT-trial (the Stockholm Manual Intervention Trial), where these questions are addressed, in order to ease the consideration between risks and benefits in the choice of treatment strategies for these patients. One study is published based on the first 767 included patients seeking care for non-specific back and/or neck pain in which we found no systematic differences in the risk of adverse events between the treatment arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Based on the same trial, now with 1057 included patients, we address the following research question: Are there differences in treatment effect on pain intensity, pain related disability and perceived recovery when NMT (spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, stretching and massage) is compared to NMT without spinal manipulation and, NMT without stretching for male and female patients seeking care for back and/or neck pain?</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and trial registration</title><p>This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the trial was registered in Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN92249294).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p>The treatments were given at the educational clinic of the Naprapath&#x000f6;gskolan - Scandinavian College of Naprapathic Manual Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden. The students, who provided the treatments were in their seventh out of eight total semesters, with experience regularly (twice a week) treating patients over a period of five semesters. These treatments include massage and stretching techniques during five semesters, spinal mobilization techniques during three semesters and spinal manipulation techniques during two semesters under supervision of experienced registered naprapaths. The supervision included regular controls of the compliance of the study protocol. The primary investigator and the research team regularly had meetings and education with the students as well as with the supervising naprapaths/teachers. Senior students that participated in the current trial had passed all practical clinical examinations at this level of the education which includes all the manual techniques used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The participants eligible for this study were patients, 18&#x02013;65 years old, seeking care for neck pain (including neck/shoulders and/or upper back, above the 11<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra, with or without pain in upper extremities and chest) and/or back pain (including pain the area below the 10<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra and/or gluteal area with or without pain in lower extremities) and who had not visited the educational clinic during the previous month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>1) Not mastering the Swedish language, 2) having scored &#x0003c;2 on a numerical rating scale (0&#x02013;10) in two questions regarding pain intensity (pain at the present time and the worst pain during the past 4&#x000a0;weeks) in neck and/or back, 3) pregnancy, 4) current or previous cancer, 5) having received treatments for the current complaint by a chiropractor, naprapath, osteopath or physiotherapist during the past month, 6) duration of the current complaint less than 1&#x000a0;week, 7) patient demand/deny spinal manipulation/stretching, 8) contraindication for spinal manipulation according to the Swedish Board of Social Welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 9) indication for spinal manipulation (hypo mobility in the joints of the spine, with or without pain) not present in the area of complaint, 10) red flags (i.e. previous trauma, inflammatory or rheumatic diseases, drug addict, large rapid weight decrease etc.), 11) specific diagnosis (i.e. ankylosing spondylitis, spinal stenosis, rheumatoid arthritis), 12) sick leave due to planned/completed surgery for neck and/or back pain.</p><p>Potential study participants were marked in a ledger at the clinic by a trained receptionist according to inclusion criteria; age, neck and/or back pain and no visit at the educational clinic during the past month. The inclusion process was handled by the supervised and trained student therapists: information about the study to the patients, obtaining of informed consent, the baseline data collection, the decision about inclusion, and the randomization allocation. The therapists as well as the supervising experienced registered naprapaths were thoroughly trained in different aspects of the study protocol at a number of meetings before the start of the study. Uncertainties and questions were discussed in regular weekly meetings during the inclusion period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization</title><p>A trained research assistant made the randomization in advance and prepared sequentially numbered opaque and sealed envelopes with cards numbered 1, 2 or 3, by drawing these cards from a box. Stratified randomization was used, based on the location of pain: 1) neck and upper back 2) lower back and 3) neck and lower back (pain equally bad in neck and upper back and lower back). For each stratum, randomization in blocks of 99 were performed.</p><p>Potential study participants were informed about the study at the first visit. Informed consent was obtained and patients completed the baseline questionnaire suited for the area of pain before the physical examinations and diagnostic assessment by the therapists. The patient and the therapist were unaware of the group assignment until after all baseline data were collected. Treatment allocation was performed by the therapist after the physical examination and the completion of the baseline questionnaire. The therapists were told not to share the result of the randomization to the patient if possible, however this cannot be considered as blinding the patient to the treatment. Each treatment session was scheduled for 45&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>The interventions in all three arms were conformed to the patients&#x02019; condition, however standardized to the greatest extent possible concerning, for example, the length of treatment sessions and how to perform them in different situations, by several education meetings held in advance.

A modified Chronic Pain Questionnaire (CPQ) was used to assess pain intensity and pain related disability at baseline and at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The original scale that was based on recall of the past 6&#x000a0;months was changed to the past 4&#x000a0;weeks as we have done in previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Follow-up data collection of outcomes</title><p>Information of outcomes was collected by self-administrated postal or web-based questionnaires at follow-up, after seven, 12, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. If a patient did not answer or if the questionnaire was not complete, a trained research assistant contacted the patient by phone, mail or letter to remind them, at a maximum of three occasions.</p><p>Primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain related disability. Patients graded their pain in three pain questions (current pain, worst pain, average pain) measured with a numeric rating scale, 0&#x02013;10 (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;pain as bad it could be) with the modified CPQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Three questions assessed disability and concerned to what degree pain &#x0201c;interfered with your daily activities&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;changed your ability to take part in recreational, social, and family activities,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;changed your ability to work (including housework)&#x0201d; in the past 4&#x000a0;weeks.

To analyze if there were any differences between the treatment arms in MCI in pain and disability and perceived recovery, and to test for confounding, logistic regressions using generalized estimating equations (GEE) were conducted, in all participants and in gender stratified analyses. For further testing if there were any differences in mean pain/disability score, linear regressions using GEE was used taking into account the covariance between repeated measurements of pain and disability, in all participants and in gender stratified analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Neither were there significant differences in effect in gender stratified analyses. Furthermore, there were no clear differences between the treatment arms during the 1&#x000a0;year follow-up regarding care seeking for their back/neck pain; the proportion that had not sought additional care the presiding three months at the 12&#x000a0;months follow-up was the same (61&#x000a0;%) in all three treatment arms. The findings from this study are similar to findings in some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In a recent Cochrane systematic review Gross et al. concluded that manipulation and mobilization provide similar effect for neck pain in mediate/short/intermediate-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One study included in the systematic review by Rubinstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] was a smaller trial by Cleland et al. indicating that there is a better effect on pain and disability in low back pain patients from spinal manipulation than from spinal mobilization in short-term (4&#x000a0;weeks) and in disability in long term (6&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths</title><p>The current study is a large randomized controlled trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1057) which is optimal for the research question addressed. We had a low attrition rate which was equally distributed between the treatment groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore we measured several potential prognostic factors that may have an impact on the prognosis of back and neck pain, and none of these factors were confounders in our study. The distribution of these factors was similar across treatment arms, indicating that the risk for unmeasured and residual confounding is low. A trained research assistant implemented the randomization, the data collection and the data input. She was also responsible for data quality management which was performed regularly during the study. All analyzes were done by a biostatistician who was not involved in the data collection or the randomization process. We therefore claim that the study has high internal validity.</p><p>The outcomes are clinically important and measured longitudinally with 1&#x000a0;year follow-up enabling to compare the long term effects for different treatment modalities. The total number of therapists in this study was 260. This increases the external validity by referring the effect of the treatment to the therapy itself rather than a specific set of therapists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p>The therapists in this study were students at their seventh semester out of total of eight semesters, thus not experienced therapists. This may have an effect on the results. The students had treated patients, 2&#x000a0;days a week, under supervision during six semesters before the study started, but it is possible that the results could have been different if the patients had been treated by registered naprapaths with longer clinical experience and more skills in manual techniques. This may limit the possibility to compare the results from our study to previous studies and it may affect the external validity of the results. To explore this, we have compared the results from this study with one of our previous studies comparing NMT with the advice to stay active for patients with neck and/or back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the current study, the proportion of patients reaching MCI in pain intensity was 64&#x000a0;% and a MCI in disability was 42&#x000a0;% in the NMT-group at the 12&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. In the previous study the corresponding proportions were 69 and 73&#x000a0;% for the index group (NMT). There might be some differences between the two study populations, and the similarities in proportions of MCI in pain but not in pain related disability indicate that the result of this trial cannot be generalized to treatment given by experienced naprapaths.</p><p>This study was completed at an educational clinic. To confirm if the patients in this trial were comparable to patients visiting other naprapath clinics in Stockholm, we conducted a validation study. In this validation study the first included 111 patients in our trial study were compared to 97 patients seeking care for neck and/or back pain during the same time period, in three other clinics in the same geographical area. The result were that the patients in this trial were younger compared to patients visiting the other clinics (35.0 [SD 12.0] years and 42.0 [10.7] years respectively). The mean number of previous naprapathic treatments for the patients in the present study was 1.9 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9) compared to 2.5 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) for those visiting other clinics. Additional parameters like physical activity, pain and disability scores and educational level were equal in the two populations (unpublished data by Joakim Ahlgren).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Implication for clinical practice</title><p>There is an ongoing discussion about if treatment with some of the manual techniques used by manual therapists is associated with a higher risk of adverse events, and if such an increased risk is relevant for the potential benefits in effect of the treatment. The results of this study suggest that exclusion of spinal manipulation or stretching from combined manual therapy do not have a significant effect on improvement in pain intensity, in pain related disability and in perceived recovery in short and long term for patients seeking care for unspecific back and/or neck pain. In our previously published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] based on the first included 767 patients in the same trial, exclusion of spinal manipulation or stretching did not affect the risk of adverse events for patients with non-specific neck and/or back pain.</p><p>These findings might be of importance for patients and for manual therapists when choosing treatment strategies for non-specific neck and/or back pain, even though the result might be limited to treatments given by students. It might not be of importance if we use spinal manipulation and/or stretching strategies when we use combined manual therapy to treat unspecific back and/or neck pain on a group level, and therefore the choice of techniques can be based also on clinical and clinicians indications and patient preferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The effect of manual therapy including spinal manipulation, mobilization, stretching and massage for male and female patients seeking care for neck and/or back pain at an educational clinic is similar regardless if spinal manipulation or stretching is left out as a treatment option.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The trial was approved by the Ethical review board in Stockholm, Sweden, 2009/1848-31/2.
