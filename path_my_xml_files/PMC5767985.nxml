Furthermore, there is little knowledge about oral health practices among caretakers and visually impaired individuals, due to which oral health is often neglected when compared to the general health. Hence, there was a need to educate visually challenged individuals about oral hygiene practices in a customized format so that the comprehension of brushing techniques could be conveyed at its best.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The present study was a randomized control trial of sixty visually impaired adolescents who were divided into three groups of 20 each. In Group 1, Braille was used, whereas in Group 2, audio-tactile performance (ATP) technique and in Group 3, a combination of both the methods were used to teach tooth brushing as a part of oral health education. Pre- and post-plaque index score using Silness and Loe (1967) after health education were calculated and tabulated for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The postintervention mean plaque index score increased in Group 1 from 29.45 to 42.98, whereas the mean plaque score decreased in Groups 2 and 3 from 30.83&#x02013;29.9 to 30.23&#x02013;18.73, respectively.

However, there is still the prevalence of oral diseases. This situation becomes more complicated when it comes to physically challenged population, especially the visually impaired.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This visually handicapping condition makes daily activities, a daunting task. Although their general health is taken care by their parents or caretakers, but the maintenance of good oral health is often neglected.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This stems from the fact that there is no awareness regarding good oral health and this population seek oral health care only when there is pain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Enlightenment of good oral hygiene practices to these adolescents with special health-care needs is hindered due to factors such as fear, lack of time, and unavailability of financial resources.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the visually impaired adolescent also has equal rights and deserves to be educated as their sighted peers. Hence, it becomes obligatory for us as dentists to emphasize the importance of oral health care and provide comprehensive dental treatment to these individuals.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Communication and exchange of knowledge is essential to establish trust between a dentist and the special adolescent.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Furthermore, it is important to inculcate proper oral hygiene habits in these pupils in their formative years, so that they constantly maintain good oral health throughout their life.</p><p>The visually impaired depend on senses such as sound, speech, and touch (tactile perception) to orient themselves to their environment;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] hence, various techniques have to be custom made to teach these individuals, so that they can perform their daily chores.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Acknowledging this fact, Louis Braille, a French educator, presented a tactile method known as the Braille system. Braille is a system of bumps and indentations on a surface to represent letters that can be recognized by touch. Braille characters are coded into small rectangular blocks, known as cells, using raised dots.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This Braille method is used extensively to give education to visually impaired individuals. Various studies on oral health education have indicated that, when tactile aids were used along with the Braille method and proper verbal instructions (audio aids), the visually challenged populations were able to perform oral hygiene techniques more effectively, therefore maintaining good oral hygiene.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>With the vision to improve the knowledge, behavior, and attitude pertaining to oral health an innovative technique known as audio-tactile performance (ATP) technique was introduced to teach Fones technique of tooth brushing in visually impaired adolescents.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Studies have shown that this customized technique is very effective tool to educate these individuals.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Literature is devoid of studies which combine Braille and ATP technique as a method of oral health education for the visually impaired. Hence, the present study was planned to assess and compare the oral hygiene of visually impaired patients before and after oral health education interventions using Braille and ATP technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Institutionalized visually impaired adolescents with the informed consent of their respective guardians in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation from Maharashtra, India, were selected as participants in the study. Students with any other disability or syndrome and uncooperative individuals were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Stage I</title><p>The project was approved from institutional ethical board. The institution in which the study was to be carried out was a registered institute for blind boys. Written consent was obtained from this institute before the study could be performed. Furthermore, a written assent using braille was obtained from the adolescent boys participating in the study. A sample size of sixty was calculated based on a previous study taking 95% confidence interval and 80% power of the study. The sixty study participants ranging from age 12&#x02013;16 years were selected using simple random sampling. Table of random numbers were used to allocate the adolescents into three groups of 20 each.</p><p>On the first day, there was an interactive session which enabled our team to establish a friendly relation with the participants. Cooperation from students and staff was also understood at this stage and was found to be satisfactory. A self-structured questionnaire which was tested and validated by the authors was then used to obtain the personal information, oral hygiene practices and 24 h' diet history of the participants. Oral health status was assessed using Plaque index given by Loe in 1967.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Later, the participants were randomly divided into three groups of 20 each.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Stage II</title><p>Oral health education was given using Braille and ATP technique to the visually impaired adolescents based on the groups they belonged.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Group 1</title><p>In this group, oral health education was imparted using Braille, as it was the standard method used for giving education to the visually impaired.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Braille slate was prepared with the help of blind school staff. Five golden rules (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> brush twice daily with fluoridated toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush (morning and night), <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> rinse mouth after every meal, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> decrease the sugar consumption, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consume more fibrous diet (fruit and vegetables), and <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> regular dental checkup after every 6 months) to maintain good oral hygiene were written on the Braille slate. The golden rules were written in regional language (Marathi). The staff of the school helped to convert it into Braille and also to back translate it in English. Participants were given these slates to read and were informed to maintain oral health following the above rules. The information given to the participants was reinforced on the 7<sup>th</sup> day and after 1 month from the day they were first educated about oral health.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Group 2</title><p>Oral health education was given using ATP technique in this group. The participants were first verbally informed about the importance of the teeth and were made to feel the teeth on a large sized model on which the Fone's method of brushing was taught with assistance. The participants were then asked to feel their own teeth with their tongue and were trained to appreciate the deposits when roughness was felt. The examiner visually inspected and confirmed the ability of the participants to identify deposits on their teeth. This was followed by teaching the participants the Fone's method of brushing teeth with assistance in the oral cavity. The process was continued till they learnt to brush properly.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Staff of the school and caretakers of the school monitored the brushing of all students. Reinforcement of the brushing technique was carried out on the seventh day and after one month from the day the patients were first educated using ATP.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Group 3</title><p>Oral health education using the combination of both Braille method and ATP Technique was used in this group. The participants were given Braille slates and were also taught to brush the teeth by ATP technique as it was taught to participants in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. As mentioned above for the two groups, reinforcement in this group was also carried out on the seventh day and after 1 month.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Stage III</title><p>At the end of the study, oral health status of the study participants was obtained using plaque index.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Furthermore, at the end of the study Group 1 was given oral health education using ATP technique and Group 2 participants were given Braille slates, so that all participants have equal access to both the educational tools.</p><p>The data were processed and analyzed using SPSS software version 19-SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. Comparison of the study groups, before and after intervention was performed based on suitable statistical method. The results were compiled and subjected to Wilcoxon sign rank, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis ANOVA, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After analysis of the self-structured questionnaire, it was found that all the study participants were using toothbrush and a fluoridated toothpaste to brush their teeth regularly, 73.3% brushed once and others twice. Most of the students brushed their teeth horizontally while 15% used circular method. When the sugar score was assessed using sugar score criteria given by Papas;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] 11.7% of the participants scored excellent, 75% scored good while 13.3% were in the watch out zone.</p><p>At the baseline, among twenty study participants of Group 1, 15 participants had scored fair on the plaque index, whereas only five participants had low plaque score to be in the good category. After the intervention using the Braille technique, there was an improvement in the plaque index, in which 9 individuals scored good and 11 scored fair on the plaque index (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).</p><p>Initially, in Group 2, it was observed that only one participant scored poor, whereas 13 were in the fair category and 5 participants scored good.

It therefore, has the potential to prevent wide range of diseases from its inception.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although literature has established the effectiveness of oral health education, very less information is available regarding the oral health of individuals with special health-care needs, especially the visually challenged.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Realizing the scarcity of data and as a social responsibility toward the specially abled, this study was performed.</p><p>This study was done in an institution where the visually impaired adolescents were living a disciplined life. When a self-structured questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge regarding the oral health in these individuals, it was found that they used fluoridated toothpaste and toothbrush to clean their teeth. Availability of the toothbrush and toothpaste was not a problem to the institution due to generous sponsorships. The majority of them brushed once a day and changed the brush only when fraying of bristles was observed. Although the students knew the importance of teeth, but still many of them suffered from oral health problems and lacked knowledge regarding proper brushing techniques. Similarly, a study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>., which compared oral hygiene practices, oral hygiene, and periodontal status between visually impaired and sighted children; concluded that gingival health of blind students was compromised due to their inability to visualize plaque despite excellent oral hygiene aids.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Majority of the students had mixed diet because of the institutional setting and belonged to &#x0201c;good zone&#x0201d; on the sugar score criteria given by Papas. However, few students still belonged to the &#x0201c;watch out zone,&#x0201d; as the parents were allowed to frequent them with sweets.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Visually challenged population depends on audio and tactile sensation to orient themselves to their surroundings.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Taking into account this fact, Hebbal M. <italic>et al</italic>. introduced the ATP technique, which successfully proved that customized techniques with proper training and periodic reinforcement can have positive impact on oral health of these special children. As the study participants were living in a residential school with a regulated lifestyle, it was easy to teach them the ATP technique. Even the staff of the school and caretakers were trained and well oriented with the technique and were instrumental in reinforcing it on the students. In the present study, it was observed that the visually challenged students easily learned Fone's brushing method using the ATP technique. This observation was also seen in a study by Joybell C. <italic>et al</italic>. who compared the Fones and Modified Bass methods using ATP technique in visually impaired children.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Complete oral prophylaxis was performed in all study groups, so as to maintain a common baseline data; as a result of which most of the participants had a score which was fair on the plaque index.</p><p>In Group 1, after the intervention using the Braille technique four more students reached the good score category who were initially classified as fair. The result obtained was found to be similar to a study performed by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., who studied the effectiveness of Braille and fluoridated dentifrices on visually impaired children. They also observed significant decrease in OHI-S scores in fluoridated group when oral health education was given using Braille as a medium.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The ATP technique when used, resulted in a significant improvement in oral hygiene maintenance which was similar to studies conducted by Hebbal and Joybell.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>],[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The plaque scores reduced significantly, therefore, placing eighteen pupils in the good category as compared to only seven students before the intervention. Whereas, in Group 3, where oral health education was given using both Braille and ATP technique, excellent results were obtained when before and after intervention scores were compared. This could be attributed to the combination of Braille and proper customized brushing technique (ATP) which helped the adolescents to learn better.</p><p>As all the study participants underwent oral prophylaxis before the intervention; therefore, score comparison between Group 1, 2, and 3 was not significant initially. When postintervention scores were compared the scores were statistically significant. These findings are in accordance with the study performed by Yalcinkaya and Atalay in which oral hygiene techniques were reinforced three times in 2 months interval.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>When the number of participants who improved their oral hygiene after the intervention was compared between Group 1 and 3; it was statistically evident that the combination of Braille and ATP technique did extremely well. This confirms the fact that when proper instructions regarding oral hygiene maintenance are given, oral health status of this special population is improved. This is in correlation with studies conducted by O'Donnell and Crosswaite [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Schnuth.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Furthermore, the use of an innovative technique such as ATP definitely helps in educating the visually challenged. Although the number of participants having lower plaque scores were less in Group 3 as compared to Group 2 but it was not statistically significant. Although the study included only adolescent boys, it would be important to have interventions which include visually impaired girls and smaller children to establish the effectiveness of Braille and ATP in a wider range of population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although Braille and ATP technique for oral health education were effective tools when used individually, the combination of the two techniques proved to be more effective. More research in the direction of customization of educational and oral hygiene aids for visually impaired is the need of the hour. It is also important to educate the parents, teachers, and caregivers of visually challenged individuals and make them aware of the importance of oral health care and its impact on the general health. There is also a social responsibility of dentists and community as whole to work in unison to improve the life of individuals with special health-care needs.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hebbal</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ankola</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development of a new technique (ATP) for training visually impaired children in oral hygiene maintenance</article-title><source>Eur Arch Paediatr Dent</source><year>2012</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>244</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23043880</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anaise</surname><given-names>JZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal disease and oral hygiene in a group of blind and sighted Israeli teenagers (14&#x02013;17 years of age</article-title><source>Community Dent Oral Epidemiol</source><year>1979</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>353</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">295720</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mahoney</surname><given-names>EK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of visual impairment upon oral health care: A review</article-title><source>Br Dent J</source><year>2008</year><volume>204</volume><fpage>63</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18223579</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Joybell</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Suresh Kumar</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of two brushing methods-fones vs. modified bass method in visually impaired adolescent using THE Audio Tactile Performance (ATP) Technique</article-title><source>J Clin Diagn Res</source><year>2015</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>ZC19</fpage><lpage>22</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aviv</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Listening to Braille.
