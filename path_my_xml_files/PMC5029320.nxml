A total of 46 participants (mean age: 22.3 &#x000b1; 2.3 years) with maxillary dentoalveolar protrusion were randomly distributed into two groups with 23 patients each (1:1 allocation ratio). Either STb (Ormco) or 7<sup>th</sup> Generation (Ormco) lingual brackets were applied. Fricative sound/s/ spectrograms were analyzed directly before intervention (T<sub>0</sub>), one week following premolar extraction prior to bracket placement (T<sub>1</sub>), within 24 hours of bracket bonding (T<sub>2</sub>), one month after (T<sub>3</sub>), and three months after (T<sub>4</sub>) bracket placement.

Records of 512 patients from the waiting list of the Orthodontic Department at UHDS (from January 2012 to January 2013) were reviewed. After clinical, dental cast and radiographic assessment, only 56 patients accurately met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Class II, Division 1 malocclusion; (2) age range of 15 to 30 years; (3) presence of all permanent teeth, except for third molars; (4) first language of participants was Arabic; (5) no previous orthodontic treatment; (6) no anterior crossbite; and (7) no craniofacial syndromes, cleft lip and/or palate (soft and/or hard), or history of speech and hearing disorders. A total of 51 out of 56 subjects gave their informed consent after receiving an explanation about clinical trial design orally and in a written format. A total of 46 patients (mean age: 22.3 &#x000b1; 2.3 years) were randomly selected to construct the primary sample. The other five patients who gave their informed consent, but were not selected in the random selection, were treated at UHDS Orthodontic Department by other MSc students under the direct supervision of a professor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>

A significant drop of the UBF of the consonant /s/ sound was recorded directly after bracket bonding (T<sub>2</sub>) in both groups. However, patients in the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation group showed more reduction and higher degrees of impairment in comparison to those in the STb group. This finding can be explained by the difference in bracket dimensions, since the STb brackets were considerably smaller than the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation ones, bucco-lingually and cervico-incisally. Therefore, less interaction with sound production was noticed. The effect of lingual appliance thickness on speech performance was studied previously by Hohoff et al<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> who assessed articulation semi-objectively employing blinded speech professionals and subjectively using a standardized questionnaire in patients with three types of lingual appliances. The authors concluded that the thinner the appliance, the less interaction with pronunciation. </p><p>The fricative /s/ sound is well known to be sensitive to morphological changes in maxillary incisors and it is common in most languages; therefore, it is well suited for evaluating speech performance.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> investigated the UBF of the fricative /s/ sound after applying 7<sup>th</sup> Generation lingual brackets, and reported less dropped values than what was found in the current study. This can be attributed to variation of voice pattern while pronouncing different words in different languages: Hohoff et al<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> analyzed the articulation of the /s/ sound in the French word "<italic>soleil</italic>" at the end of the sentence "<italic>La brise et le soleil</italic>"; whereas the stressed "s" sound in the Arabic word "<italic>Hassan</italic>" was evaluated in our study.</p><p>According to questionnaire findings, patients in both groups reported highly significant impairment in their articulation until one month of assessment. However, speech difficulty in the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation group was significantly greater than in the STb group at T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. This finding can be explained by the different bracket size between the two groups: 7<sup>th</sup> Generation appliances are considerably thicker than the STb ones, especially in the premolar region. For this reason, they had more interaction with speech production. After three months of appliance wear, a few patients still complained of some degree of speech impairment. These findings are generally in agreement with those of other studies;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> however, the differences in study design, types of brackets and the language of choice have caused variations of intensity and overall duration of oral impairment. Patients in both groups complained of different degrees of tongue space restriction which gradually disappeared with time. Nevertheless, the only significant difference between the two groups was detected one month after bracket placement when the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation appliance, which is considerably thicker than the STb one, caused more narrowing of tongue space. It was confirmed previously that the thinner the lingual appliance, the less intervention with tongue space.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> The different findings between the objective assessment (auditive analysis) and the subjective assessment (questionnaires) was due to the difference between these two methods. The auditive analysis investigated the changes of the fricative /s/ sound only, whereas when patients were asked to assess their speech performance by means of questionnaires, they gave themselves as well as surrounding people, the perception of any noticeable change in the overall speech performance. In addition, this subjective assessment could be affected by patients' emotional circumstances.</p><p>All patients in both groups suffered from different degrees of irritation and soreness of the tongue, which disappeared at the three-month assessment. However, patients in the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation group were insignificantly more often affected than those in the STb group. Stamm et al<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> recorded a significant difference between 7<sup>th</sup> Generation brackets and customized brackets (Incognito, TOP Service, Ormco) with respect to pressure sores and lesions of the tongue. Khattab et al<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> reported higher levels of irritation after the use of lingual brackets. This difference can be attributed to the sharp hooks of the Stealth<sup>(r)</sup> (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI, EUA) brackets that they used in their study.</p><p>Chewing difficulties were observed in both groups, but were significantly more severe in the 7<sup>th</sup> Generation group one month after bracket placement. This finding is in agreement with the results of Stamm et al<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> who found that 7<sup>th</sup> Generation brackets caused significantly more chewing impairment than that caused by customized brackets (Incognito, TOP Service, Ormco). Stealth brackets, which were investigated previously, caused more eating problems than STb and less than 7<sup>th</sup> Generation brackets.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> This difference can be explained by the effect of bracket thickness on oral discomfort, since stealth brackets stand in the middle between STb and 7<sup>th</sup> Generation brackets regarding size. Wiechmann et al<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> reported lower levels of mastication problems when they used customized brackets (Incognito, TOP Service, Ormco), in which the resulted appliance is considerably thinner than that produced by the Hiro technique.</p><p>According to questionnaire analysis, chewing difficulty was the most severe problem caused by lingual bracket placement.

</xref> who found that tongue irritation was the most serious problem with lingual appliances. This may be due to many factors, such as study design, types of brackets, laboratory procedures and the researched populations.</p><p>No harms or severe untoward effects were observed during this trial. On the other hand, there were a number of limitations in the current study. Larger sample sizes are required to investigate the effect of both age and sex which were not considered in this study. Although the current study compared two commonly used different sized lingual brackets, there is still a need for further investigation using other available lingual brackets. The generalizability of the findings of the current study might be limited, since this trial focused on a specific type of malocclusion with only two designs of lingual brackets under consideration. In addition, analysis was based on one single consonant uttered from Arabic speaking patients. An expanded auditive analysis is required in future research work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>
