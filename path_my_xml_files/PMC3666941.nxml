This decision was based on Phase III results, which demonstrate that blocking this immune checkpoint provides a survival advantage in patients with advanced disease.

In the United States, 217,730 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 and 32,050 died from the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While localized tumors can be cured by surgical resection or radiotherapy, and early metastatic disease is frequently responsive to androgen ablation, docetaxel-based chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment in the setting of progression from androgen-sensitive to castrate-resistant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, the majority of these men derive only modest benefit from chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has been shown to remain sensitive to hormonal manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate is now FDA-approved in the post-docetaxel setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The novel anti-androgen enzalutamide (MDV3100) has also completed Phase III testing, with positive data reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Despite these important advances, mCRPC remains incurable in the majority of men, necessitating development of alternative treatment modalities.</p><p>With the landmark FDA approval of sipleucel-T (Provenge), prostate cancer emerged as a valid target for cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Prostate cancer may be especially well-suited to this treatment approach given the non-vital nature of the prostate gland and the existence of a number of well-characterized prostate-restricted antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to sipleucel-T, several other immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer have progressed to Phase II or Phase III clinical trials. One such therapy is GVAX (GM-CSF immunotherapy for cancer), which involves intradermal administration of irradiated, allogeneic tumor cells genetically modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite promising results in preclinical and early clinical testing, two Phase III clinical trials of GVAX for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer were halted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There are a variety of potential reasons for the failure of GVAX immunotherapy to demonstrate clinical benefit in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One possibility is that repeated exposure to high doses of GM-CSF could drive the induction of a regulatory population of cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A second, more intriguing possibility is that persistent exposure to tumor antigens in the setting of advanced disease induces T cell tolerance, thus limiting the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy. Emerging data suggest that this effect may be at least partially obviated by combining immunotherapy (i.e. vaccines) with agents designed to block the immune checkpoints that limit an anti-tumor immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Ipilimumab (Yervoy, BMS Princeton, NJ), a fully human anti-Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic and unresectable melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CTLA-4 is the most extensively studied immune checkpoint molecule, and is expressed on activated T effector cells (Teffs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and T regulatory cells (Tregs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast to CD28/B7 binding, which acts as a co-stimulatory signal to promote T cell activation and proliferation, the binding of CTLA-4 to B7 transmits an inhibitory signal. While CTLA-4 blockade has been shown to have powerful anti-cancer effects in some patients, it has also been associated with a significant risk of autoimmune toxicity. For example, a Phase III clinical trial of ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma reported a survival benefit and an overall response rate of 11% with ipilimumab alone; however, approximately 60% of patients demonstrated immune-related adverse events and 7 patients (1.1%) died from immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These complications may be partially reflected in mouse models as CTLA-4 knockout mice die of multi-organ failure at ~3-4&#x000a0;weeks of age secondary to lymphoproliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in murine prostate cancer models have demonstrated that CTLA-4 blockade promotes anti-tumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and works synergistically with GM-CSF-expressing tumor vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Given the significant rate of IRAEs observed in the recent clinical trials described above, we sought to determine the minimum dose of anti-CTLA-4 required for additive efficacy, as well as the optimal sequence of cell-based immunotherapy (GVAX) and checkpoint blockade. These studies utilized our well-established genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model, in which the model antigen hemagglutinin (HA) is expressed in a prostate-restricted manner on the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We subsequently tested this regimen in models of lung and liver metastasis in wild type mice as well as mice harboring synchronous prostate tumors. Finally, we added low-dose cyclophosphamide to evaluate a potential role for T regulatory cells in limiting the anti-tumor response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Overall, our data confirm the finding that combining GVAX immunotherapy with CTLA-4 blockade is more effective than either treatment alone. Interestingly, we found that CTLA-4 blockade must be administered subsequent to vaccination to produce additive immunologic effects. Low-dose cyclophosphamide provided a benefit when added to this combination regimen, suggesting that CTLA-4 blockade does not completely mitigate Treg function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All studies were completed under an protocol approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Non-transgenic B10.D2 (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Pro-HA transgenic mice express a secreted form of Hemagglutinin (HA) under control of the prostate epithelial-specific Probasin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and are on the B10.D2 (H-2<sup>d</sup>) genetic background.

As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP mice develop autochthonous prostate tumors that express HA as a tissue/tumor-restricted antigen. Otherwise, disease development is indistinguishable from their TRAMP counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Clone 4 transgenic mice express a CD8 TCR which is specific for the K<sup>d</sup>-restricted (MHC Class I) HA peptide (<sup>542</sup>IYSTVASSL<sup>550</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. 6.5 mice are CD4 TCR transgenic animals with a TCR specific for the I-E<sup>d</sup> restricted (MHC Class II) HA peptide (<sup>110</sup>SFERFEIFPKE<sup>120</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For these studies, Clone 4 and 6.5 mice were backcrossed over 12 generations onto a Thy1.1 congenic B10.D2 background.

To construct a HA-targeted immunotherapy, TRAMP-C2 cells were transfected with full-length HA as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution in 96 well plates, and HA expression was confirmed by staining with the HA-specific mAb H18L10-5R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which was graciously provided by Dr. J. Yewdell (NIAID). A single clone expressing high-levels of HA was selected, expanded and used in further studies. B78H1-GM is a GM-CSF secreting cell line utilized in bystander immunotherapy regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. B78H1-GM cells secrete approximately 2500&#x000a0;ng of GM-CSF per 10<sup>6</sup> cells over a 24-hour period, as determined by ELISA.

Immunization was performed a total of three times at 1&#x000a0;week intervals unless otherwise indicated. Mice were euthanized at 18&#x02013;20&#x000a0;weeks of age and the male urogenital tracts were micro-dissected under a stereomicroscope and weighed. Ventral prostate lobes were removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by 70% EtOH. Tissues were then embedded in paraffin, cut into four micron sections using a cryostat, and placed onto poly-lysine-coated slides before being stained with H&#x00026;E.

The proliferation and effector function of these cells reflects the relative efficacy of vaccination in the respective strains. Proliferation of HA-specific CD8 T cells (which represent prostate/prostate-cancer specific T cells in this model) was assessed by dilution of CFSE. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, GVAX immunotherapy resulted in a robust increase in the percentage of divided CD8 T cells specific for HA in both tumor-bearing and non-transgenic recipients. Division peaked approximately 7&#x000a0;days post-vaccine administration in non-transgenic mice, but plateaued on day 4 in tumor bearing mice. As is typical for na&#x000ef;ve CD8 T cells, some background proliferation was detectable in non-transgenic animals. To determine whether expression of the immune checkpoint molecule CTLA-4 could potentially be restraining the vaccine response of prostate/prostate cancer specific cells, we stained the prostate-specific CD8 T cells for CTLA-4 expression. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, CTLA-4 expression in the prostate-draining lymph nodes was noted on day 4, with approximately 16% of divided cells staining positive. By day 7, expression was more robust; at this time point approximately 45% of the HA-specific CD8 cells in the draining lymph node expressed CTLA-4. In the tumor-bearing prostate gland itself, more than half of the specific CD8 T cells expressed CTLA-4. Taken together, these data show that GVAX vaccination induces a detectable, but relatively blunted CD8 T cell response in prostate tumor-bearing mice, and this blunted response correlates with CTLA-4 expression on specific T cells, especially in the target organ.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>GVAX Immunotherapy induces CTLA-4 expression on tumor-specific CD8 T cells. </bold><bold>A</bold>: Blunted CD8 T cell response to GVAX immunotherapy in tumor-bearing mice.

In tumor bearing mice, combination therapy significantly increased the percentage of HA-specific CD8 T cells as compared with GVAX treatment alone, while in non-tumor bearing mice, the addition of anti-CTLA-4 mAb did not significantly increase the percentage of HA-specific T cells beyond the effect observed with GVAX alone.

Administration of 2 doses (5&#x000a0;mg/kg) of anti-CTLA-4 after vaccination increased the relative CTL response as compared to GVAX vaccination alone.

Administration of anti-CTLA-4 before vaccination did not increase the specific CTL response and, in fact, the response appeared to be slightly diminished. In non-transgenic mice, the difference between these two sequences was statistically significant, with checkpoint blockade clearly demonstrating greater efficacy when given after vaccination.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Time-dependent augmentation of anti-tumor CD8 T cell response by the addition of CTLA-4 blockade to GVAX immunotherapy.

Since multiple previous studies by our group have shown that a single dose of GVAX in tumor-bearing mice does not induce a detectable lytic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we gave two doses of vaccine, spaced one week apart, in this study. As in non-transgenic mice, the lytic response in tumor-bearing mice was optimal when anti-CTLA-4 was administered after vaccination. Interestingly, giving anti-CTLA-4 several days post vaccination still augmented the CTL response, as might be suggested by the kinetics of CTLA-4 expression shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. We also evaluated a more extensive anti-CTLA-4 treatment regimen in which three doses of anti-CTL-4 were administered with each GVAX vaccine dose. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, optimal timing of vaccination and checkpoint blockade was not affected by this more intensive treatment protocol; once again maximum lytic function was observed with anti-CTLA-4 administration one day post vaccination. Due to the expected convenience of same-day dosing in a clinical setting, we also examined whether anti-CTLA-4 blockade could be given at the same time as GVAX vaccination. We found no significant difference between administering anti-CTLA-4 on day 1 vs. day 0 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D).

In these studies, we once again tested the effects of a single antibody treatment per vaccine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) as well as a more dose dense regimen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). We found that a dose of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg in a once-per-week dosing paradigm was significantly more effective than 3&#x000a0;mg/kg or 1.5&#x000a0;mg/kg in promoting endogenous CTL function. Although the data approximate a dose&#x02013;response relationship, the difference in CTL function between 6&#x000a0;mg/kg and 9&#x000a0;mg/kg dosing was not significant. In a dose-dense regimen, we found that an intraperitoneal dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg was significantly more effective than 1.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and there was no significant difference between 3&#x000a0;mg/kg and 6&#x000a0;mg/kg (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). After finding that 6&#x000a0;mg/kg/week produced a maximal CTL response, we directly compared once per week and twice per week dosing regimens at this dose (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). A dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg (twice/week) resulted in increased lytic function compared with the same quantity of antibody administered in a single weekly bolus at 6&#x000a0;mg/kg.

Mature data from these trials are not yet available. Combination regimens involving ipilimumab and immunotherapy have also been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials. Recently, Madan et al. showed that ipilimumab could be safely combined with the PSA-targeted vaccine PSA-Tricom, without significantly exacerbating the agent&#x02019;s immune-related adverse event profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, over 50% of the patients in this study who were chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve experienced a PSA decline from baseline levels. Perhaps most relevant to our current data, the Gerritsen group performed a Phase I study to determine whether ipilimumab could safely be combined with GVAX prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Those results were also encouraging, demonstrating the tolerability of the combined regimen and providing early evidence for efficacy. Taken together, these clinical trials highlight a need for preclinical studies that use relevant (immunologically tolerant) animal models to optimize dosing and sequencing.</p><p>We examined the anti-tumor effects of combination therapy with GVAX and anti-CTLA-4 in an autochthonous prostate cancer model expressing HA in a prostate-restricted manner. Although previous preclinical studies have demonstrated that CTLA-4 blockade augments the anti-tumor effects of GVAX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], to our knowledge this is the first study to report extensively on the importance of timing and dosage in this treatment regimen. Our data show that GVAX&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy mitigates peripheral tolerance and promotes the activation and proliferation of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells. While GVAX immunotherapy alone induced proliferation of HA-specific CD8 T cells in non-transgenic animals, this effect was significantly blunted in ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP mice, confirming previous findings that T cells become refractory to tumor antigens in the setting of endogenously arising prostate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, our results indicate that the percentage of T cells comprising the CD8 HA-specific T cell population increased up to day 7 post vaccination in non-transgenic animals, but reached a plateau at day 4 in tumor-bearing mice. Expression of CTLA-4 on CD8 HA-specific T cells in prostate and prostate draining lymph nodes significantly increased between days 4 and 7 in tumor bearing mice. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], these data indicate that ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP mice harbor tumors which induce tolerance that is mediated, at least to some degree, by increased CTLA-4 expression on CD8 T cells, although effects on CD4 T cells, as well as priming stages of the immune response, are likely also involved.</p><p>Administration of GVAX followed by anti-CTLA-4 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of HA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at days 7 and 10. The efficacy of this treatment regimen, however, was highly dependent upon the dose and relative timing of GVAX and anti-CTLA-4 administration. Interestingly, while administration of anti-CTLA-4 at days 1 and 4 post-GVAX resulted in a significant increase in target cell lysis, this effect was not observed when anti-CTLA-4 was administered on day &#x02212;1. There are a number of potential explanations for this effect. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the anti-CTLA-4 mAb migrates to multiple sites of CTLA-4 expression (i.e. the gut), and that expression of CTLA-4 on tumor-specific T cells is not particularly robust until after antigen-specific vaccination. This explanation is supported by our data, which show relatively delayed kinetics of CTLA-4 expression after vaccination (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A second possibility is that the administration of anti-CTLA-4 results in a compensatory expansion of the Treg compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and thus prevents generation of an effective anti-tumor response when GVAX vaccine is administered later. While additional studies might be helpful in elucidating the underlying mechanism, it is clear from our data that administration of GVAX prior to anti-CTLA-4 was superior in stimulating anti-tumor CD8 T cell activity as compared with upfront administration of anti-CTLA-4 or either therapy alone. This finding has clear clinical significance. In addition, our data demonstrate that there was no difference in administration of anti-CTLA-4 mAb on day +1 vs. day +4 in once-per-week or twice-per-week dosing regimens. Anti-CTLA-4 mAb dose-escalation studies demonstrated the greatest effects between 3&#x000a0;mg/kg and 6&#x000a0;mg/kg in the once per week dosing regimen and, correspondingly, 1.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 3&#x000a0;mg/kg in the twice per week dosing regimen. In a direct comparison of dosing regimens at 6&#x000a0;mg/kg/week, we found twice per week dosing to be superior to once-per-week dosing. Based on these data, we concluded that the treatment regimen that produced optimal CD8 T cell anti-tumor activity was day 0 GVAX followed by twice per week anti-CTLA-4 mAb at the dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg.</p><p>After determining the optimal treatment regimen for GVAX&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-CTLA-4 in our ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP model, we sought to more thoroughly explore the underlying immunologic mechanisms. Our data clearly demonstrate an increase in the absolute number of HA-specific CD8 T cells as well as an increase in the number of IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells in the prostate gland and prostate draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, there was also a trend toward decreased numbers of HA-specific CD8 T cells in the prostate draining lymph nodes with combination therapy as compared with GVAX therapy alone. Given that this effect was not observed in prostate tissue, it is reasonable to speculate that treatment with anti-CTLA-4 mAb may increase trafficking of tumor antigen-specific T cells into tumor tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Although combination therapy with GVAX and CTLA-4 blockade increases tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cell proliferation and activation, this has not been consistently shown to correspond with tumor eradication or improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], so we used tumor score and weight of the genital tract as direct measures of effectiveness in a relevant preclinical model. We found that the tumor score was significantly lower for animals receiving combination therapy as compared with control animals or animals receiving either therapy alone. Of note, 3 of the 10 mice receiving combination therapy had no histologic evidence of disease, while tumors were identified in every mouse in the other treatment arms. The weight of the urogenital tract corroborated these findings as the urogenital tracts of animals receiving combination therapy weighted significantly less than animals in the other treatment arms. These data support the potential clinical utility of the combination regimen.</p><p>In addition to expanding the CD8 T cell compartment, CTLA-4 blockade has been shown to affect various CD4 T cell populations, including Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the response of these cell populations to our treatment regimen. Combination therapy resulted in skewed local and systemic expansion of the HA-specific CD4 T cell compartment toward an anti-tumor, IFN- &#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> phenotype. Our data further suggest that this expansion may include other CD4 T cell subtypes as there was a non-statistically significant trend toward increased numbers of HA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>/IL-4<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>/IL-17<sup>+</sup>, and CD4<sup>+</sup>/FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Expansion of the Th17 compartment is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and, although these cells have been traditionally considered pro-tumorigenic, there is some evidence to suggest that they may play a role in anti-tumor immune responses as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The finding that the numbers of HA-specific and total Tregs are increased is also consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our data suggest that, while combination treatment induces Treg expansion, treatment also increases tumor antigen-specific CD4 Teff/Treg and CD8 Teff/Treg ratios.</p><p>Since depletion of Tregs may be associated with improved survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer responding to vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], we sought to determine whether the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide further augments the GVAX&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-CTLA-4 treatment effect in models of pulmonary and hepatic metastasis. Analogous to our previous finding that GVAX alone failed to induce HA-specific CD8 T cell proliferation in ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP mice, combination therapy increased survival in non-transgenic animals with pulmonary or hepatic metastases, but failed to do so in ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP animals harboring autochronous prostate tumors. The addition of cyclophosphamide (50&#x000a0;mg/kg) to this treatment regimen, however, resulted in improved survival in the non-transgenic animals and rescued the survival advantage in ProHA &#x000d7; TRAMP animals. Mechanistically, these results generally support the notion that the Teff/Treg ratio correlates with anti-tumor immunity in immunotherapy regimens; however, these data should be interpreted with some caution, since low-dose cyclophosphamide has favorable effects on several other immune cell populations. In particular, this regimen promotes DC secretion of type I IFN, affects DC turnover, and modifies DC phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, there are a number of plausible, competing explanations for the observed effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These experiments corroborate recent clinical data, which suggest that the combination of CTLA-4 blockade and cell-based, GM-CSF-secreting vaccines may have significant anti-tumor effects in men with prostate cancer. Our data indicate that the therapeutic window of such an approach may be maximized through meticulous study of various doses and dosing regimens. Furthermore, Tregs appear to be a limiting factor in this treatment regimen such that depletion of this cell population enhances anti-tumor immunity. Based on these data, clinical studies may find that the addition of cyclophosphamide to this treatment regimen allows for reduction in the dose of anti-CTLA-4, potentially limiting autoimmune toxicity. Since recently reported trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], show that ipilimumab can safely be administered in combination with immunotherapy to men with prostate cancer, it seems logical to consider the initiation of future trials in which anti-CTLA-4 is combined with GVAX immunotherapy and low-dose cyclophosphamide, most likely in the earlier stages of metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>CGD has consulted for BMS (Princeton NJ) and Pfizer (San Diego, CA), both of whom have developed anti-CTLA-4 antibodies clinically.
