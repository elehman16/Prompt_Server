In a sex- and age-matched control group (n=15), the same questions were answered. Data were collected before and after intervention. An open-ended question about experiences of the intervention was included in the last questionnaire. The intervention consisted of a first meeting with health professionals and additional five self-care telephone calls. The control group did not receive any intervention or attention except for the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study group. To compare the intervention group and control group on nominal and ordinal levels, the McNemar test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively, were chosen.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty individuals (14 females and 16 males) participated in the study, ranging in age between 75 and 93 years. A significant difference was obtained in the intervention group regarding mental health. Mental health improved significantly in the intervention group (<italic>P</italic>=0.037). In the control group, mental health, sense of coherence, self-care ability, and self-care agency showed worse outcome results after the intervention (19 weeks).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Self-care telephone talks improved mental health significantly in our sample, and mental health focus could be understood as a possible condition for health promotion to take place. Structured self-care telephone talks have proved to be successful and a relevant method to use in practice.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>case-control study</kwd><kwd>changes</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>older people</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Self-care might be considered a health-promoting activity for the purpose of maintaining, restoring, or improving health and well-being.<xref rid="b1-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Studies on self-care show a health decline in people older than 75 years.<xref rid="b4-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Results from these studies, combined with ongoing research on population aging internationally,<xref rid="b6-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> as well as political discussions on future health policy for older people,<xref rid="b9-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> highlight the necessity to develop an intervention that promotes self-care in older people that enables them to live their lives in their own homes as long as possible.<xref rid="b3-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a Norwegian context, however, there were no such studies found that encompass the aim of this study.</p><sec><title>Aim and hypothesis</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a telephone-based self-care intervention among urban-living individuals 75+ years of age by comparing self-reported perceived health, mental health, sense of coherence, self-care ability, and self-care agency before and after the intervention.

Most of the participants were in good mental health, as measured by Goldberg&#x02019;s General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30). However, some experiences in life can hardly be covered in an instrument. Mental health in old age might be influenced by life changes or losses of former roles, such as being a husband or wife or being gainfully employed, as well as physical or mental changes that occur as people age.<xref rid="b3-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>To have good mental health is an important issue in older people&#x02019;s abilities to handle their everyday lives in their own homes. For the participants 75+ years of age, in the quantitative study on ability for self-care in older home-dwelling people in urban areas, promoting factors for self-care ability were self-care agency, perceived good health, being active, being frequently physically active, and being satisfied with life. Perceived helplessness, being anxious, advanced age, and receiving home nursing were negative factors for self-care ability. One of the strongest factors for lower self-care ability among people 75&#x02013;84 years of age was reduced mental health, measured by the GHQ-30.<xref rid="b4-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>A study on lived experiences of self-care among older physically active urban-living individuals<xref rid="b3-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> revealed findings of concern for what self-care might bring forth. The participants in that study lived active everyday lives and were frequently physically active. They were part of a supportive, inclusive, and promoting fellowship, and they had the opportunity to travel. They utilized their competence, and experienced making themselves useful. It was a privilege to be part of a family life as a husband, wife, parent, and/or a grandparent.

Some data were missing in some questionnaires. That appeared to be completely random, ie, questions were forgotten or not noticed or maybe participants did not want to answer one particular question. When up to five values were missing in the SASE, ASA, or SOC-29 instruments, a neutral score was put in the place of the missing values.

Mean age in the randomly selected intervention group was 80.73 years (standard deviation 3.24), and in the age- and sex-matched control group was 80.73 years (standard deviation 4.20). There were no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group regarding self-reported perceived health or scores on SASE, ASA, SOC-29, and GHQ-30 at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-9-095">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome of the intervention</title><p>In the intervention group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-9-095">Table 2</xref>), there were no significant differences before and after intervention regarding self-reported health and scores on the SASE, ASA, and SOC-29 instruments. On the GHQ-30, a significant difference was obtained in the intervention group between baseline and intervention. The GHQ-30 score improved from a median of 24 to a median of 20 (<italic>P</italic>=0.037).</p><p>According to the open-ended question about the experience of the self-care telephone talks, all the participants were satisfied, and the majority experienced a change in their attitude and adjustment towards their self-care in everyday life. Through the self-care talks, how they thought about self-care as well as how they managed their daily life was acknowledged. They received support and encouragement for their self-care action.</p><p>The participants appreciated the confidentiality and anonymity of the talks, knowing they could talk freely about their concerns. In addition, the predictability of the phone calls was explained, in that every week there would be a nice talk with a health care professional. The participants obtained advice and suggestions about physical activity and food and meals, as well as practical adjustments for the future. The phone calls were described as pleasant and good-humored.</p><p>In the control group, no significant differences emerged between baseline and the assessment after intervention. However, all instruments &#x02013; SASE, ASA, SOC-29, and GHQ-30 &#x02013; showed worse outcome figures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-9-095">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that in this sample, self-care telephone talks improved mental health significantly. These results support research from previous studies that reported mental health as an inevitable factor in older people&#x02019;s self-care.<xref rid="b3-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b59-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="b60-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Although this study was meant to have more participants, the results clearly show the importance of good mental health in relation to self-care actions.</p><p>Good mental health, measured by the GHQ-30, was one of the strongest factors for higher self-care ability among older people aged 75+ years of age in two previous studies.<xref rid="b4-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It seems that emotional reactions become less strong in older people and that they adapt more easily to changes in the environment than do their younger counterparts. In addition, they are better at adjusting goals and opportunities.<xref rid="b59-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p><p>The promotion of older peoples&#x02019; health and well-being should take into account their mental health and adjustment to changes in life. The results might indicate that the first change this intervention puts into effect is related to better mental health, and therefore could be understood as most likely being a condition for health promotion to take place in this study group. Why the control group had worse outcomes after intervention might be questioned. It is reasonable that a more or less natural decrease in self-care has taken place, although the time period was short. Maybe the participants also felt abandoned for not receiving any intervention. However, there were no differences between the groups at baseline, and they belonged to different geographical areas, which should indicate there was no connection between the two groups during intervention.</p><p>When testing their self-care talk method, Teel and Leenerts<xref rid="b26-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> found that the participants acknowledged an increased awareness about self-care as the most important factor in promoting self-care practices. These results are in line with the experiences in the present study. The participants were acknowledged on how they thought upon self-care as well as how they managed their everyday life. During the self-care talks, they received support and encouragement on how to handle their coming years. They also experienced changes in their way of thinking about self-care, health, and well-being, and in their opportunity to live independent lives. Maybe it is reasonable to believe that those experiences, together with the contact with the professionals in the intervention, were important mechanisms for improvement in mental health. In addition, the self-care talks introduced suggestions for the participants according to physical activity, food and meals, as well as the importance of social fellowship and interaction. However, it seems that the most important message, according to the effect of self-care telephone talk intervention, is the improvement in the participants&#x02019; adjustment to self-care and their experiences of living healthy and good lives overall.</p><p>An initial meeting between the participants and the health professionals was important, and included an introduction to self-care telephone talks and conversations about content, as well as appointments being scheduled. Another essential feature was the expertise of the health professionals, comprising their health education and clinical knowledge, as well as practicing in health-promoting conversation, inspired by the idea of motivational interviews.<xref rid="b52-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b53-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>In this intervention, there were five repeated phone calls. Each self-care telephone call had a special pattern, consisting of themes and goals for the week to come, as well as an evaluation of the last week&#x02019;s achievements. This pattern might have had a positive influence on the participants, and thus one might assume it made their mental health improve. Both the participants and the health care professionals used the information folder. These guidelines seemed to be easy to use as well as providing a health-promotion attitude.</p><p>As previously mentioned, this study was meant to have more participants. Participating in research using self-reported questionnaires, as well as talking on the telephone, might be difficult for older adults with age-related changes in functions, such as vision and hearing losses.<xref rid="b61-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Using a less comprehensive questionnaire and fewer telephone calls might have increased the number of participants in the intervention group. On the other hand, questionnaires can be too simplistic for capturing the complexity of older persons&#x02019; views of a phenomenon.<xref rid="b61-cia-9-095" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> However, we believe that our questionnaire revealed important issues regarding the complexity in older persons&#x02019; lives. Fewer telephone calls could be required in a later study on self-care talks as a health-promotion intervention.</p><p>According to the relationship between the consequences and costs of a study, one might assume that the improvement in mental health in this study was high for a reasonable cost, compared to the control group. No cost&#x02013;benefit analyses were implemented, but in future studies this would be interesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The hypothesis of this study was confirmed in that improved mental health was the effect of the self-care telephone talks. It could be assumed that improved mental health is critical for establishing self-care ability and self-care actions in older home-dwelling people.</p><p>The arrangement of the self-care telephone talks has proved to be successful, and a relevant method and tool to use in practice, where it should have an important role in plans for the upcoming older generation&#x02019;s health and well-being, as well as their ability to live independent lives in their own homes. The next step in developing this intervention should be to identify possible barriers and facilitators, as well as to develop an implementation plan involving a larger group of participants in different counties in Norway. Future research may also include older participants living in sheltered housing facilities, as well as older people being in need of health care services. It is reasonable to assume that this kind of research and interventions are sensitive to local contextual factors, like physical and psychosocial issues in the population in focus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to all participants.
