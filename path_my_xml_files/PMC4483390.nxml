performed cervical range of motion exercises, and changes in their pulmonary and coughing
functions were examined. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve stroke patients who were intubated
with tracheostomy tubes participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to
either the control group (n=6), which did not perform cervical range of motion exercises,
or the experimental group (n=6), which did perform exercises. [Results] With regards to
forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume at one second, and peak cough flow rate
before and after the exercises, the control group did not show any significant differences
while the experimental group showed statistically significant increases in all three
parameters. [Conclusion] The results indicate that cervical range of motion exercises can
effectively improve the pulmonary function and coughing ability of stroke patients
intubated with tracheostomy tubes, and that cervical range of motion exercises can help in
the removal of tracheostomy tubes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Cervical range of motion exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Changes in the respiratory activity of stroke patients on the paralyzed side affect the
forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>),
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR); changes in these
pulmonary function indicators bring about a decline in the peak cough flow rate (PCFR), an
indicator of coughing function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakened pulmonary function restricts the performance of
daily living activities by making patients easily fatigued, and decreased coughing function
causes serious problems in the respiratory system due to the inappropriate removal of
secretions in the airway; it can also trigger complications such as pneumonia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
previous studies, inspiratory muscular training, feedback respiratory training, and other
forms of muscle training exercises have been used to improve the respiratory activity of
stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, studies have reported that intubated patients show restricted cervical spine
motion<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal head and cervical
postures cause persistent abnormal physical stress due to muscle imbalance, and this
abnormal stress brings about restrictions on lung ventilation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent reports indicating that cervical mobilization exercises
improve pulmonary functions have been published<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in this study, brain-damaged patients intubated with
tracheostomy tubes performed cervical range of motion exercises. The aim was to analyze the
changes in pulmonary and coughing functions in order to present appropriate training methods
that can improve respiratory activity in such patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The present study was conducted in stroke patients who were intubated with tracheostomy
tubes in the D rehabilitation hospital, Ulsan, Korea. All patients understood the purpose
of this study. And this study&#x02019;s subjects provided their written informed consent prior to
their participation according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
subjects were 12 patients with no history of respiratory system disease or damage, no
findings of lung disease on radiography or breast examinations, and no cognitive
impairments that would make the patients uncooperative, such as high levels of dysphasia
or dementia (MMSE-K score of 24 points or higher). The subjects were randomly assigned to
either a control group (n=6) that did not perform cervical range of motion exercises or an
experimental group (n=6) that did perform cervical range of motion exercises. Random
assignment was carried out by an individual not involved in data collection, using a
computer-generated randomized table of numbers created for each participating site before
the beginning of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To measure pulmonary function, the FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio
were measured using the pulmonary function calculator of a micro spirometer (Micro Medical
Ltd., UK). To measure coughing ability, the PCFR was measured using a peak flow meter
(Cardinal Health 232 Ltd., UK). After the initial measurements, the control group did not
perform cervical range of motion exercises, and these patients&#x02019; pulmonary and coughing
functions were then measured a second time, 8 weeks later. The experimental group
performed cervical range of motion exercises 5 times per week for 8 weeks after the
initial measurements, and then these patients&#x02019; pulmonary and coughing functions were
measured for a second time.</p><p>The exercises performed by the patients in the experimental group were those described by
Cleland et al. In each session, the physical therapist manually stretched the patient&#x02019;s
upper trapezius, scalene, sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, and pectoralis major and
minor muscles. Each stretch was held for 30 seconds and repeated twice<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercises were performed within a
cervical range of motion in which patients intubated with tracheostomy tubes would not
feel uncomfortable: 10&#x000b0; for flexion, extension, and lateral flexion and 20&#x000b0; for
rotation.</p><p>The three physical therapists who participated in the study and worked with all of the
patients had at least 5&#x02005;years of clinical experience. The physical therapists all
underwent a standardized training regimen, which included studying a manual of standard
procedures with the operational definitions of each examination and treatment
procedure.</p><p>Paired t-tests were conducted to compare changes in the measured pulmonary and coughing
function values over time in each group. Statistical analyses were conducted using PASW
17.0 for Windows, and the significance level was set to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects (number or mean&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=6)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n=6)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (left/right)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.2&#x000b1;10.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.5&#x000b1;10.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since stroke (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.5&#x000b1;14.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.2&#x000b1;21.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.3&#x000b1;8.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.0&#x000b1;10.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.7&#x000b1;11.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.15&#x000b1;16.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> shows the general characteristics of the subjects.

the outside of the body through mucociliary clearance; this prevents complications such as
pneumonia. Stroke patients have a reduced ability to cough due to their weakened respiratory
muscles and show a decreased PCFR, which is an indicator of coughing ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the case of patients with tracheostomy tubes due to severe brain damage, these tubes can
be removed successfully only when the patients&#x02019; coughing ability has been recovered. The
normal PCFR is at least 300 L/min. If the rate is within the range of 160&#x02013;270 L/min, viral
infections can occur easily. If the rate drops below 160 L/min, mucociliary clearance
ability declines remarkably<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stroke
patients intubated with tracheostomy tubes who participated in the present study had
remarkably decreased coughing ability, demonstrated by PCFRs of lower than 160 L/min. Thus,
the patients&#x02019; ability to remove secretions was lost. While the control group did not show
any change in PCFR after 8 weeks, the experimental group,who performed cervical range of
motion exercises, showed significant increases in PCFR after intervention. This indicates
that cervical range of motion exercises are effective for improving the coughing function of
stroke patients intubated with tracheostomy tubes. However, Bach reported that tracheostomy
tubes could be removed only when the PCFR was at least 160 L/min. The experimental group in
the present study had a PCFR of 160 L/min. Therefore, longer training periods may be
necessary to remove tracheostomy tubes in stroke patients.</p><p>Chalmers et al. reported that patients with FVC values of lower than 300&#x02005;mL needed
continuous mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy tubes, patients with FVC values in the
range of 300&#x02013;700&#x02005;mL needed mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy tubes at night and when
necessary during the daytime, and patients with FVC values within the range of 700&#x02013;1,000&#x02005;mL
could be helped to breathe by mechanical ventilation with nasal masks instead of
tracheostomy tubes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients in the
present study had FVC values lower than 700&#x02005;mL, and the patients in the experimental group
had increased FVC values that exceeded 700&#x02005;mL after they had performed cervical range of
motion exercises. These results indicate that these exercises can help in removing the
necessity for tracheostomy tubes.</p><p>Abnormal head and cervical postures cause persistent abnormal physical stress due to muscle
imbalance. This abnormal stress brings about restrictions in lung ventilation and pulmonary
functions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cervical muscle
strengthening and stretching exercises correct abnormal postures, thus reducing the abnormal
stress caused and improving restricted ventilation function, so that effective ventilation
can occur<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Han et al. reported that
these effects were the result of cervical muscle function recovery, and that reduced airway
resistance resulted from postural changes<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is assumed that the cervical range of motion exercises performed
in the present study relaxed tense cervical muscles, thus reducing the resulting abnormal
stress caused, reducing airway resistance, and improving pulmonary and coughing
functions.</p><p>Compared to patients without tracheostomy tubes, patients intubated with tracheostomy tubes
have lower Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores and require longer stays in
rehabilitation units<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
removal of tracheostomy tubes is an important issue for such patients. The length of
extubation is associated with mortality in intensive care units<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Extubation fails in 10&#x02013;20% of patients, and when
extubation has failed, the patient shows clinically poor results<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
reducing errors that determine the length of extubation is important. In the present study,
the pulmonary and coughing functions of patients with tracheostomy tubes were examined by
the measurement of FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PCFR, and extubation-related matters were
discussed. However, airway resistance and the elasticity of the respiratory system are
simple and non-invasive measures that successfully predict the length of extubation<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) indicates the relationship
between respiratory frequency and tidal volumes and has been reported to determine the
length of extubation more accurately than other tools<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, values showing muscle fatigue were reported to be
important elements that determine successful extubation<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, future studies should be conducted on effective
training methods that can make extubation easier for patients with tracheostomy tubes, using
multilateral measurement approaches with diverse training and measurement methods.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2014 Gimcheon University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Khedr</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>El Shinawy</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Khedr</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Assessment of corticodiaphragmatic pathway and pulmonary
