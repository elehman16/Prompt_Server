DFA-02 is a novel bioresorbable modified-release gel consisting of both gentamicin (16.8&#x000a0;mg/mL) and vancomycin (18.8&#x000a0;mg/mL) to be applied during surgical incision closure for the prevention of SSIs. The following double-blind phase 2a trial was designed to test the safety and tolerability of DFA-02.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>At six US sites, the study planned to randomize 40 subjects undergoing colorectal surgery (30 with DFA-02, and eight with placebo gel) in four ascending dose cohorts (10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-mL study drug per wound). Safety was ascertained and serum pharmacokinetics (PK) was determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Study enrollment was discontinued after the first three dose cohorts (10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mL) as even very large incisions could not accommodate more than 20&#x000a0;mL of gel, leaving no scientific justification for the 40-mL cohort. DFA-02 was well tolerated and showed no evidence of local tissue reaction or impairment of wound healing. No serious AEs were deemed related to study drug. Systemic exposure to gentamicin and vancomycin remained well below levels considered to be at higher risk for oto- or nephrotoxicity. The maximal gentamicin and vancomycin levels observed were 2.36 and 0.684&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL at 6&#x000a0;h, which were well below the prespecified stopping criteria of 12 and 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this small phase 2a study, the study drug was well tolerated and appeared to be free of serious adverse effects.

Strategies to reduce SSI have focused on many factors, including, but not limited to, avoidance of shaving (Ko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1992</xref>), appropriate selection, timing and dosing of prophylactic antibiotics (Bratzler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>), and avoidance of hypothermia (Kurz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>). However, despite widespread implementation of these strategies, SSIs remain common (Leaper &#x00026; Ousey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>), although there is some evidence that implementation of these bundles may be beginning to have a positive impact (Tanner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>).</p><p>An attractive potential strategy involves administration of a delayed release antibiotic into the surgical wound prior to the completion of surgery. A gentamicin-containing sponge has had mixed results; (Bennett-Guerrero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Bennett-Guerrero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Friberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Rutten &#x00026; Nijhuis PH. Prevention of wound infection in elective colorectal surgery by local application of a gentamicin-containing collagen sponge. Eur J Surg Suppl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>) efficacy was not observed in some trials, perhaps due to the lack of a potent Gram-positive antimicrobial in the product. DFA-02 is a novel bioresorbable modified-release gel consisting of both gentamicin (16.8&#x000a0;mg/mL) and vancomycin (18.8&#x000a0;mg/mL). This sterile, viscous, clear gel contains sesame oil, soy lecithin, and dehydrated alcohol as excipients. The doses selected for this study were based on the antimicrobial activity, PK/pharmacodynamic (PD), and toxicologic results of preclinical studies conducted with prototype gentamicin/vancomycin gels and with DFA-02. From the PK findings in multiple animal studies, it was expected that the formulation of DFA-02, with 16.8&#x000a0;mg/mL gentamicin and 18.8&#x000a0;mg/mL vancomycin, would provide local tissue levels greater than four times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens for up to 2&#x000a0;days after intraoperative application.</p><p>Therefore, the following phase 2a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-ascending study was designed to test the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of DFA-02 in patients undergoing non-emergent colorectal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This phase 2a study was sponsored/funded by Dr. Reddy&#x02019;s Laboratories (Princeton, NJ) and coordinated by the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI, Durham, NC), and was conducted at six US sites. It was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01496352).</p><p>Ethics, consent, permissions, and competing interests&#x02014;the study was approved by the Duke Health System Institutional Review Board as well as the IRBs overseeing research at each of the sites as follows: The Ohio State University Medical Center (Western Institutional Review Board), Tampa General Hospital, and University of South Florida South Tampa Center (Western Institutional Review Board), Scott &#x00026; White Healthcare (Scott &#x00026; White Healthcare Institutional Review Board), Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital (Western Institutional Review Board), Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center (Western Institutional Review Board). All subjects provided written informed consent. Safety was reviewed on an ongoing basis by a colorectal surgeon (Walter Koltun, MD, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA) not otherwise involved in the trial. This trial was funded by the sponsor (Dr. Reddy&#x02019;s Laboratories); however, the DCRI controlled the performance of all data analysis and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>Adult patients undergoing colorectal surgery were enrolled in this trial.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) males and non-pregnant females 18&#x000a0;years of age or older; (2) body mass index (BMI) 25 to 40; and (3) scheduled to undergo non-emergent colorectal surgery involving a laparotomy incision of 7&#x000a0;cm or greater (hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was allowed).

This sterile, viscous, clear gel contains sesame oil, soy lecithin, and dehydrated alcohol as excipients. The placebo gel was exactly the same as DFA-02 except for the active ingredients. The products were manufactured by NextPharma, Inc. (San Diego, CA). DFA-02 and matching placebo were supplied as 10&#x000a0;mL in 20-mL glass vials. The product was stored at &#x02212;25 to &#x02212;10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. It was thawed at room temperature until clear and used within 7&#x000a0;days of thawing. It was not refrozen and reused.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization and study drug administration</title><p>Patients were randomized using a computer generated randomization scheme prepared by the trial&#x02019;s statistician at the DCRI. DFA DFA-02 10, 20, or 30&#x000a0;mL or matching placebo was administered once at the conclusion of surgery in the operating room. The gel from one or two vials (10 or 20&#x000a0;mL) was drawn into a 30-mL syringe (provided by the sponsor) from the vial with a 14-gauge needle (also provided by the sponsor) or, alternatively, the gel from the vial could be decanted into a sterile container/cup and drawn into the syringe without a needle. For the 10- and 20-mL cohorts, a single 30-mL syringe was used, and for the 30-mL cohort, two 30-mL syringes were used. After closure of the fascia, the gel was administered from the syringe, evenly covering the subcutaneous tissue of the index incision (the longest incision if more than one incision was made). The subcutaneous tissue was then approximated and the incision closed with either sutures or staples. Any extruded gel after closure was collected in a syringe, the volume recorded by the surgeon, and then discarded. Only the longest (index) laparotomy incision was treated with study drug. If a patient required reopening of the surgical incision for any reason, no additional study drug was applied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Prohibited and concomitant medications/procedures</title><p>Consistent with the Surgical Care Improve Project (SCIP) guidelines, all patients received standard preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis antibiotics within 60&#x000a0;min of initial skin incision. Antibiotic prophylaxis was not continued for more than 24&#x000a0;h. Antibiotic prophylaxis could be redosed during surgery for long procedures based on SCIP guidelines. The use of oral nonabsorbable preoperative antibiotic treatment was at the discretion of the surgeon. Adherence to other SCIP guidelines, e.g., maintenance of normothermia, method of hair removal, was recorded. Prohibited interventions included administration of topical antimicrobials (e.g., Betadine), systemic gentamicin or vancomycin preoperatively or within 72&#x000a0;h of surgery, and prophylactic use of negative pressure dressings (e.g., WoundVac, StripVac).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes/recorded variables</title><p>The main objectives of the study were to (1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of DFA-02 in patients undergoing colorectal surgery and (2) evaluate the systemic PK of gentamicin and vancomycin after single doses of 10 to 40&#x000a0;mL of DFA-02 in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by (1) physical examination; (2) surgical incision examination on days 2, 3, and 5 (24, 48, and 96&#x000a0;h postoperatively) and day 14; (3) vital signs: screening (baseline), day of surgery (pre- and postoperatively), days 2, 3, 5, and 14; (4) clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis): screening, days 5 and 14; (5) ECG: screening (baseline), day 5; (6) adverse event recording on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, and 30; (7) ASEPSIS score on day 5 (96&#x000a0;h) postoperatively; and (8) wound questionnaire on day 30.</p><p>Additional recorded variables included (1) evaluation of postoperative renal function as manifested by serum creatinine levels on days 5 and 14 compared with baseline and (2) evaluation of the incidence of antibiotic resistance based on baseline and postoperative rectal/stool and nasal culture and sensitivities for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and MRSA, respectively, and antibiotic sensitivity of any culture positive SSIs. Molecular typing was also utilized to identify MRSA and VRE in lieu of culture and sensitivity.</p><p>Systemic PK of gentamicin and vancomycin were determined from serial blood draws obtained at 1, 6, 24, 48, and 96&#x000a0;h after study drug administration. These assays were performed at MicroConstants, Inc (San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size and study design were typical for phase 2 safety, tolerability, and PK studies, and the study was not statistically powered. This study planned to enroll 40 patients (ten per cohort) undergoing colorectal surgery with a planned incision of 7&#x000a0;cm or greater. Four dose cohorts were planned: 10, 20, 30, and 40&#x000a0;mL of DFA-02 administered as a single dose into the surgical incision at closure. All study data were summarized using descriptive statistics at each assessment time for each treatment group based on actual values and change from baseline/screening values. Continuous variables were summarized using <italic>n</italic>, mean, standard deviation (SD), and minimum, median, and maximum values. Categorical variables were summarized using the number and percentage of patients in each category.

The inclusion of a placebo group in each dosing cohort enabled us to maintain a double-blind study, avoiding possible bias with regard to assessments of safety and tolerability. Consistent with preclinical animal studies conducted by the sponsor, DFA-02 was well tolerated and showed no evidence of local tissue reaction or impairment of wound healing. Safety was assessed by collection of adverse events and by recording safety events of interest, e.g., related to renal function and serum levels of the antibiotics. No serious adverse events were deemed related to study drug.</p><p>Postoperative renal function, assessed by mean serum creatinine levels, showed no adverse effect for DFA-02 compared with placebo gel. A single patient had a creatinine elevation 2&#x000a0;days after surgery that returned to normal within 3&#x000a0;days. The maximum recommended daily intravenous dose for gentamicin in patients with normal renal function is 1.7&#x000a0;mg/kg every 8&#x000a0;h or 306&#x000a0;mg/day for a 60-kg patient with a goal of avoiding peak systemic levels greater than 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and trough levels greater than 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL (Gentamicin Dosage - Drugs.com. Available at: http://www.drugs.com/dosage/gentamicin.html#Usual_Adult_Dose_for_Surgical_Prophylaxis. Accessed July 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). The usual recommended IV dose for vancomycin is 2&#x000a0;g/day with a therapeutic goal of 15 to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L (Vancomycin Dosage - Drugs.com. Available at: http://www.drugs.com/dosage/vancomycin.html. Accessed July 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). In both rabbit and pig models of wound healing, systemic concentrations of gentamicin have been below the systemic peak level, 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, above which nephro- and ototoxicity are more likely to occur, and vancomycin concentrations have been below 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. The highest maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>)/DFA-02 dose correlations observed in preclinical in vivo studies were 0.69&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for gentamicin and 0.33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for vancomycin, observed in a pig model of wound healing (Study MPI 1115-019, Dr. Reddy&#x02019;s Laboratories). Extrapolating from the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>/dose correlations in pigs, the expected human <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for a 60-kg person receiving 40&#x000a0;mL of DFA-02 was estimated to be 7.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for gentamicin and 4.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for vancomycin, both within the clinically accepted range. In our study, the maximal levels of gentamicin and vancomycin for any patient were 2.36 and 0.684&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL at 6&#x000a0;h, respectively, well below the prespecified stopping criteria for the study. In fact, the maximum dose actually tested was 30&#x000a0;mL since as even very large incisions could not accommodate more than 20&#x000a0;mL of gel, leaving no scientific justification for advancing dose escalation to the 40&#x000a0;mL cohort. The systemic PK suggested slow release of the antibiotics from the gel in the incision site.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. As is typical for most &#x0201c;first in patient&#x0201d; studies, in order to optimize safety of study subjects, there was an extensive list of exclusion criteria, which can limit the generalizability of these results to all surgical patients. In particular, while preclinical models showed no adverse effects of the study drug on renal function, to be conservative, we excluded patients with serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.3&#x000a0;mg/dL preoperatively. While no adverse effect was shown on renal function, we cannot rule out different results in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. As expected, and consistent with the small sample size, we observed imbalances between study arms in several patient characteristics. It is important to note, however, that this should not affect many of the study&#x02019;s findings given the nature of the pharmacokinetic and other analyses. Finally, our study was not powered to draw any conclusions as to the efficacy of DFA-02 in preventing SSIs in colorectal surgery. A larger multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of DFA-02 with respect to prevention of SSI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this small phase 2a study, the study drug was well tolerated and appeared to be free of serious adverse effects.
