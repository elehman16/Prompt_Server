Despite that treatments for ODD are among the most effective, few children living in poverty receive these services due to substantial barriers to access, as well as difficulties in the uptake and sustained adoption of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community settings. The purpose of this study is to examine implementation processes that impact uptake of an evidence-based practice for childhood ODD, and the impact of a Clinic Implementation Team (CIT)-driven structured adaptation to enhance its fit within the public mental health clinic setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This study, a Hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation research trial, blends clinical effectiveness and implementation research methods to examine the impact of the 4Rs and 2Ss Multiple Family Group (MFG) intervention, family level mediators of child outcomes, clinic/provider-level mediators of implementation, and the impact of CITs on uptake and long-term utilization of this model. All New York City public outpatient mental health clinics have been invited to participate. A sampling procedure that included randomization at the agency level and a sub-study to examine the impact of clinic choice upon outcomes yielded a distribution of clinics across three study conditions. Quantitative data measuring child outcomes, organizational factors and implementation fidelity will be collected from caregivers and providers at baseline, 8, and 16&#x000a0;weeks from baseline, and 6&#x000a0;months from treatment completion. The expected participation is 134 clinics, 268 providers, and 2688 caregiver/child dyads. We will use mediation analysis with a multi-level Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) (MSEM including family level variables, provider variables, and clinic variables), as well as mediation tests to examine study hypotheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The aim of the study is to generate knowledge about effectiveness and mediating factors in the treatment of ODDs in children in the context of family functioning, and to propose an innovative approach to the adaptation and implementation of new treatment interventions within clinic settings.

Along with conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ODD is part of the disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) diagnostic group, which is characterized by severe behavioral problems including impulsivity, aggression, violence, delinquency, and criminal acts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Family poverty is one of the greatest risk factors for the onset and perpetuation of DBDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]: studies indicate that the accumulation of risk factors associated with poverty, including increased exposure to violence and traumatic events, devastating impact of substance abuse, criminal activity, and chronic disease, as well as family strain have an additive effect, in that the more risk factors a child is exposed to increases their likelihood of exhibiting serious behavioral challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, children living in poverty experience DBDs at rates of up to four times higher than children reared in families with more financial resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Treatments for DBDs are among the most well-studied and efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], yet as many as 80% of children in poverty-impacted communities do not receive services. And for those who do manage to initially engage in behavioral health care, premature attrition from services approaches 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further, the uptake of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community-based settings is slow and beset with challenges. An oft-cited statistic suggests that it can take as long as two decades before treatments that are studied in research trials become integrated as part of standard practice in real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] if at all. Thus, even though children who live in poor communities are at the highest risk for DBDs, they are the least likely to receive effective mental health services.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The 4Rs and 2Ss Multiple Family Group (MFG) intervention</title><p id="Par31">The 4Rs and 2Ss Multiple Family Group (4Rs 2Ss MFG) for Strengthening Families Program is an evidence-based, manualized, family based treatment for families of children with disruptive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

These findings suggested that the implementation of the 4Rs and 2Ss MFG required attention to multi-level implementation processes to modify service delivery practices on a sustainable level.</p><p id="Par34">There has been a growing interest within the mental health field in implementation processes that facilitate the uptake and adoption of evidence-based practices in community-based settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The adoption of EBPs is predicated upon both inner contextual factors pertaining to the organization, including the agency&#x02019;s climate, leadership support, and provider perceptions about EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the larger external context in which the organization is embedded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], including the political and legislative landscape that may mandate or enforce specific practices, and reimbursement mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Hybrid effectiveness-implementation research designs were developed to focus both on an intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness and implementation processes, either sequentially or simultaneously, which is proposed to accelerate the process to integrating EBPs in real-world practice settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As noted by Curran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] there are three types of hybrid designs; examination of the intervention&#x02019;s effects while observing implementation processes, examination of implementation processes while observing effectiveness, and examining both effectiveness and implementation simultaneously.

A secondary objective is to test an innovative method of adaptation of the 4Rs 2Ss MFG through the formation of change teams that are hypothesized to enhance outcomes and inner contextual factors. Within the academic literature on implementation processes, there is a growing emphasis upon staff serving as champions or change agents to implement EBPs and address potential barriers to adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, a main premise of this study is that adaptation of 4Rs and 2Ss MFG by the CIT will impact clinic-level mediators of readiness, leadership support, and climate (path m) which, in turn, is proposed to affect provider-level variables (path n). These differential effects then carry through to the core family variables (path o) and, in turn, child outcomes (path p).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of mediation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2331_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

To secure the sample of clinics, the study team obtained a master list of 168 clinics from OMH. Based on prior statewide studies conducted by the investigative team, it was estimated that approximately 80% of the clinics would participate; thus, we estimated that approximately 134 clinics will enroll in the study.</p><p id="Par43">At each clinic, we anticipate enrolling 20 caregiver/child dyads (a minimum of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;896 per arm, or 2688 total), and two providers per arm, yielding a total of 268 providers. Researchers will consecutively consent families to participate in the study until a sample of 20 caregiver/child dyads per clinic is achieved. Eligible caregivers are 18&#x000a0;years of age or older, English or Spanish speaking, and the primary caregiver of a 7- to 11-year-old child with ODD. Eligible providers are staff members who work in a participating clinic in a clinical capacity, and are English speaking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sampling procedure</title><p id="Par44">A multi-stage sampling procedure was undertaken, with randomization occurring at the agency level in order to prevent an unbalanced representation of clinics across the treatment arms and to conduct a sub-study in which we will examine the impact of clinic choice upon outcomes. From a master list of OMH-licensed agencies and corresponding clinics within the five boroughs of NYC that was received from The Office of Mental Health in 2016, the investigative team created three lists: (1) single-site (agencies that had only one outpatient mental health clinic, (2) multi-site agencies with between two to four clinics and, (3) mega-agencies that had five or more clinics. Each list was organized alphabetically.</p><p id="Par45">A separate randomization process was employed for each list. Clinics within single-site agencies were stratified by borough, and a random number generator was employed to randomly assign clinics to one of three conditions: (1) condition 0, which was services as usual (SAU), (2) condition 1, the 4Rs and 2Ss MFG, and (3) condition 2, the 4Rs and 2Ss MFG&#x02009;+&#x02009;CIT (all three conditions are described more thoroughly on page 8). Once the initial number was generated, subsequent clinics were assigned the next number in the sequence (e.g., if the first clinic received condition 0, the next clinic would be enrolled in condition 1, and so forth). Of note, the research staff member was unaware what numbers corresponded with which condition (e.g., that a clinic in condition 0 would be randomized to SAU). This procedure was undertaken in order to minimize allocation bias.</p><p id="Par46">Multi-site agencies with between two and four clinics were also organized alphabetically within borough, and a random number generator was used to assign the initial clinic to a particular condition. Moreover, additional clinics that were part of the agency in which the initial clinic was randomized received the same condition. For example, if one clinic was assigned condition 0, the remaining clinics, regardless of which borough they were located in, were also assigned to condition 0.</p><p id="Par47">Finally, agencies with five or more clinics were given the choice to select the study condition in which they would participate with an even distribution of these mega agencies occurring across the three study conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Description of the conditions</title><p id="Par48">The study consists of three arms: two active treatment and one comparison condition:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par49">The 4Rs and 2Ss Multiple Family Group intervention</p><p id="Par50">The 4Rs and 2Ss MFG is a 16-week group for urban children of between 7 and 11&#x000a0;years of age with ODD and their caregiver(s).

The analytic structure is complex, so we highlight our approach using Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> as our primary reference. The MSEM framework is useful because it ultimately allows a test of these aims within an integrated path modeling structure.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of mechanisms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2331_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par89">We will employ mediation analysis with two-level MSEM models as explicated by Preacher, Zhang and Zyphur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and extended to three-level models by Preacher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We will use a combination of limited information estimation frameworks (focused on sub-portions of the full model) and full information estimation frameworks (focused on the entire three-level model) to strategically answer questions. At level 1, child outcomes at the immediate post test are modeled as a function of the family predictors (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) using baseline measures of outcomes and family mediators as covariates, taking into account the clustering at the higher levels of the model. The follow-up (6-month) measures of the mediators and the outcomes are included within the model in a classic SEM panel model with autoregressive effects, thereby linking the follow-up data to the immediate post-test data. This is an advantage of using MSEM over traditional multi-level modeling. Different centering strategies (e.g., grand mean versus group mean) can be explored to garner various perspectives on the data. This feature of the model provides perspectives on aim 2 and the relative importance of paths g&#x02013;l in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. To ascertain perspectives of the effects of clinic-level variables on provider variables, random intercept MSEM with the provider-level variables can be estimated as a function of the clinic variables that include dummy coded treatment variables (4Rs and 2Ss MFG&#x02009;+&#x02009;CIT versus 4Rs and 2Ss MFG) impacting the clinic mediators of readiness, leadership support, and climate, which in turn, affect the provider-level intercepts. This modeling, or variants of it, address aims 3 and 4.</p><p id="Par90">The overall analytic structure requires strategic use of different dummy contrasts and limited information estimation of various MSEM models that map onto the questions dictated by the aims, coupled with judicious use of mediational tests linked to joint significance testing. An alternative analytic structure is to work with all four time periods simultaneously in a classic growth curve model and then to model the linear growth in variables as a function of the provider and clinic variables in strategically defined limited information estimation frameworks dictated by the overall model structure in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. We also will explore this approach. Analyses of variable importance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) have been summarized by Tonidandel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Of the two major tools to address the issue (dominance analysis and relative weight analysis), we will use relative weight analysis to gain perspectives because of the less intense computational demands that it makes and its overall flexibility.
