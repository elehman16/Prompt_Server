However, experimental set up and electrode placement are not always determined based on neurofunctional knowledge about WM, leading to inconsistent results. Additional research on the effects of tES grounded on neurofunctional evidence is therefore necessary. Sixty young, healthy, volunteers, assigned to six different groups, participated in 5 days of stimulation or sham treatment. Twenty-five of these subjects also participated in MRI acquisition. We performed three experiments: In the first one, we evaluated tES using either direct current stimulation (tDCS) with bilateral stimulation of the frontal or parietal lobe; in the second one, we used the same tDCS protocol with a different electrode placement (i.e., supraorbital cathode); in the third one, we used alternating currents (tACS) of 35 Hz, applied bilaterally to either the frontal or parietal lobes. The behavioral outcome measure was the WM capacity (i.e., number of remembered spatial position) during the 5 days of training. In a subsample of subjects we evaluated the neural effects of tDCS by measuring resting state connectivity with functional MRI, before and after the 5 days of tDCS and visuo-spatial WM training. We found a significant impairment of WM training-related gains associated with parietal tACS and frontal tDCS. Five days of tDCS stimulation was also associated with significant change in resting state connectivity revealed by multivariate pattern analysis. None of the stimulation paradigms resulted in improved WM performance or enhanced WM training gains. These results show that tES can have negative effects on cognitive plasticity and affect resting-state functional connectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)</kwd><kwd>working memory training</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>resting state functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcranial electric stimulation (tES) is a relatively newly rediscovered tool that both the scientific and general society hope can enhance the performance of several cognitive skills (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dubljevi&#x00107; et al., 2014</xref>). The most commonly used stimulation type is anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is assumed to depolarize the resting potential and thereby increasing excitability in neurons underlying the anode, (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche et al., 2008</xref>). The supposed mechanism of action is modifying intrinsic brain activity by an increased probability of action potentials (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Polan&#x000ed;a et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using tES over repeated sessions while training cognitive skills could affect intrinsic brain activity and interact with training-induced plasticity. Indeed, enhanced training gains have been documented for numerical competence (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2010</xref>) and vocabulary learning (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Meinzer et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, a positive effect of tDCS on working memory (WM) training gain was found by <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al. (2016)</xref> after 7 days of training, although results from other groups reported the effect of tDCS during WM training as being limited to on-line effect (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>) or near-transfer measures (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>). An obvious difference between the abovementioned studies is that while <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al. (2016)</xref> trained visuo-spatial WM (VSWM), <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al. (2014)</xref> trained verbal WM. However, we argue that the previous studies combining tDCS with WM training (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2016</xref>) have limited grounding in neurofunctional knowledge about WM. They all placed a single anode over the left or right frontal lobe. However, most neuroimaging studies show bilateral activation during performance of VSWM tasks (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rottschy et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, it is reasonable to think that bilateral stimulation could be more effective than unilateral, when combining tDCS and VSWM training. Moreover, studies of WM training have consistently shown changes in activity in the parietal lobe (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Olesen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016</xref>). Therefore, we also included groups that received parietal stimulation. In the light of the above considerations, we decided to use bilateral stimulation of either the frontal or parietal lobe, which has not been investigated in previous WM studies.</p><p>The supposed mechanism of tDCS through increase in probability of action potentials could, through long term potentiation (LTP), lead to an increased functional connectivity in the networks affected by stimulation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Polan&#x000ed;a et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). Since earlier studies of WM training alone have suggested that strengthened functional connectivity is a mechanism that underlies the gain in WM capacity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jolles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Astle et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that tDCS over either the parietal or frontal lobes during WM training would increase the strengthening of connectivity within the fronto-parietal network compared to WM training alone. We therefore acquired resting state fMRI data as a part of our first experiment, to evaluate the effect of a combination of tDCS and WM training on changes in connectivity.</p><p>Evaluating the results of our first experiment, we found that both the group receiving frontal tDCS, and the one receiving parietal, had lower WM training gain than the control group, receiving sham stimulation. This effect was in the opposite direction as our hypothesis, and led us to question our setup. Specifically, we focused on the position of the cathode. Looking at previous studies, a variety of cathode positions have been used, e.g., extracephalic, supraorbital, and contralateral. Some authors suggest that the cathode is passive (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Clemens et al., 2013</xref>), whilst others argue that it has an important effect in itself, either through altering the distribution and strength of the currency field generated by the anode (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bikson et al., 2010</xref>), or through decreased excitability in neurons underlying the cathode (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>). To evaluate the possibility that the placement of the cathodes affected the results of the stimulation in the first experiment, we conducted a second experiment, using supraorbital cathodes instead of occipital, and only stimulating the DLPFC bilaterally.</p><p>As moving the cathode did not lead to enhancement of the training effect, we tested the hypothesis that a different type of stimulation could enhance the effect of WM training. Specifically, we turned to transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Unlike tDCS, the effects of tACS are thought to be caused by altering the intrinsic oscillations of the brain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 2013</xref>). This is achieved by alternating the direction of the stimulation current with a predefined frequency, thereby synchronizing stimulated brain areas (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zaehle et al., 2010</xref>). This technique has been used to influence motor and sensory processes, but also higher cognitive functions (see <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 2013</xref>, for review). For example, both <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Polan&#x000ed;a et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec (2014)</xref> have shown that tACS in a theta frequency can enhance performance of WM. However, the choice of a stimulation frequency is not obvious since different aspects of WM have been linked to ranges in both the theta, alpha and gamma bands (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Roux and Uhlhaas, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Honkanen et al., 2015</xref>). The WM task in our study is highly focusing on the WM load, i.e., the number of items required to be held in memory during the delay. E.g., no interfering components are introduced to increase difficulty and the responses given are deemed either right or wrong, no judge of quality of the memory is made. The load component of WM has specifically been linked to gamma frequency in humans (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Basar-Eroglu et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, different means to artificially entrain brain oscillations are used experimentally, e.g., in animals. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2016)</xref> used optogenetic stimulation and showed that stimulation in the frontal cortex at 30&#x02013;40 Hz frequency enhances attention in mice. Based on this we chose to stimulate the frontal or parietal cortex bilaterally with tACS at a frequency of 35 Hz in the third experiment of this study. During the progress of the present study, other groups have also published works indicating that tACS in similar frequencies can have an effect on cognitive performance (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Santarnecchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Methods</title><sec><title>Experiment 1</title><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty healthy adults were divided into three groups before the baseline session, and were blinded to which type of stimulation they received; &#x0201c;Sham stimulation&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 10, six males, mean age = 29.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.9), &#x0201c;Frontal tDCS &#x02013; Occipital Cathodes&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 10, five males, mean age = 29.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.3) and &#x0201c;Parietal tDCS&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 10, seven males, mean age = 28.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.9). All participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: no neurological or psychiatric disorders, no psychoactive medications, no metal objects implanted, no abuse of drugs or alcohol, and no previous experience of tES. The study was approved by the local ethical committee in Stockholm and all participants gave informed written consent according to the declarations of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>During five sessions, participants performed WM training on consecutive days for &#x0223c;25 min while receiving tDCS. The training consisted of an adaptive VSWM task: remembering and repeating a presented sequence of dots in a 4-by-4 grid, one of the tasks previously used in <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Nemmi et al. (2016)</xref>. Difficulty was adapted by changing the number of to-be-remembered dots in the sequence (hereafter &#x0201c;level&#x0201d;) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The daily outcome measure was the mean of the levels of the three highest-level items correctly performed during the training session. Note that subjects participating in the imaging arm of the study were submitted to the MRI acquisition protocol during one session the week before the beginning of the training (baseline session) and during the fifth day of training. These subjects received tDCS stimulation without simultaneous WM training during the baseline session, just before entering the MRI scanner. This procedure was chosen so that any difference between the MRI measures at day 5 and at baseline can safely be ascribed to the combination of tDCS and cognitive training during the 5-day treatment rather than to the short-term effect of a single tDCS session.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Training task.

After the end of the probe the task of participants was to repeat the presented sequence, in the same order, by touching the correct dots. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> shows an example of a sequence at level 4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-11-00364-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Stimulation</title><p>Direct current was generated by a StarStim stimulator, using 25 cm<sup>2</sup> circular electrodes.

During this first session, as well as the last, participants first went through tDCS (either active or sham) during rest and then an MRI scan. MRI data was acquired on a 3T MRI scanner (Discovery General Electric), using a structural T1 weighted sequence (resolution = 0.94 mm &#x000d7; 0.94 mm, TE = 2.5 ms, TR = 5.7 ms, TI = 400 ms, FoV = 24 cm, 180 axial slices, flip angle of 12&#x000b0;) and a 10 min resting state fMRI sequence (eyes open, fixating white cross; 42 axial slices, 3.0 mm slice thickness, 0.5 mm slice gap, TR 2000 ms). Data were analyzed using CONN functional connectivity toolbox (v14.p) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>) in SPM8 (Welcome Trust Center of Neuroimaging, University College London, United Kingdom). Preprocessing included non-brain tissue removal, slice-timing correction, realignment, segmentation of structural images and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. Functional volumes were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian 8 mm kernel and individually band-pass-filtered at 0.008&#x02013;0.09 Hz in the temporal domain. Noise correction was performed using CompCor (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>), that regresses out from the functional time-series the first two principal components of the time-series extracted from white matter and CSF. Moreover, six movement nuisance regressors and their time derivatives plus their quadratic values were regressed out from the BOLD time-series. Images that were regarded as movement outliers (defined as overall movement of &#x0003e;2 mm or root mean squared change in bold signal from volume to volume &#x0003e; 9) were regressed out, using the ART toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. After preprocessing we performed a Voxel-to-Voxel connectivity analysis. In this analysis, the pairwise connectivity pattern between each voxel and the rest of the brain (all other voxels) is computed. After that, a dimensionality reduction step is implemented by means of principal component analysis (PCA maximizing the explained inter-subject variability in the resulting patterns using a lower number of spatial components; here we calculated five components but only retained the first, which accounted for 34% of the variance). We then performed an analysis looking at associations between this component (i.e., the weight of the first principal component) and interaction between group and time (i.e., we looked for voxels were the component was different among groups and between sessions) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2016</xref>).

While the null effect of the parietal stimulation was not so surprising, as no evidence of the effect of parietal stimulation on WM training has been reported in literature, the results of the frontal group were more troubling, as positive effects have been reported (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>). We turned our attention to the placement of the cathode in our setup, as certain groups have reported a cathodal effect on performance that can be due to alteration in the distribution and strength of the currency field (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bikson et al., 2010</xref>), or decreased excitability of the underlying neuron reducing the resting potential (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>).

We hypothesized that the detrimental effect of frontal tDCS observed in the first experiment could be an effect of the cathodes&#x02019; placement: e.g., cathodes placed onto the occipital cortex could have interfered with the visual processing of the stimulus, thus impairing WM. As such, we decided to move the cathodes onto the supraorbital area.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten subjects were included in a group to investigate a different cathode position for tDCS over the frontal lobes; &#x0201c;Frontal tDCS &#x02013; Supraorbital Cathodes&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 10, five males, mean age = 28.6 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.2).

Thus, we first tested the hypothesis that tDCS applied bilaterally over the frontal or parietal lobes would improve the effect of WM training (Experiment 1). Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that frontal tDCS with occipital cathodes had a significant negative effect on training gain. The tDCS stimulation was associated with changes in resting-state connectivity over the 5 days of stimulation, partly within the fronto-parietal network. Experiment 2, where we moved the cathode from the occipital lobe to the supraorbital area, suggested that the impairment of WM training gain observed in the frontal tDCS in Experiment 1 could be due to the placement of cathodes over the occipital lobe. In Experiment 3, we evaluated tACS over the frontal or parietal lobe. The parietal tACS led to significantly lower training gain. None of the stimulations in Experiments 1, 2, or 3 led to enhanced performance of WM tasks or enhanced gain during WM training.</p><p>Regarding enhancement of WM capacity (i.e., independent of the effect on plasticity seen during training), all three experiments failed to find an effect of the factor &#x0201c;Group.&#x0201d; This is in agreement with a number of studies failing to see increases in accuracy or capacity from tDCS during WM tasks in single sessions (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tremblay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Horvath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). However, regarding frontal gamma tACS, both positive (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoy et al., 2015</xref>) and mixed (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Santarnecchi et al., 2016</xref>) results have been reported from single session studies, in contrast to our results. Moreover, one of the WM training studies using tDCS found an increase in average performance but not in training gain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the aim of our study was mainly to examine effects on plasticity (i.e., training gain). Two previous studies of WM training found increased gain from tDCS (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2016</xref>), which is in disagreement with our results. Possible reasons why our results differ are differences in experimental setup, such as current strength electrode positions and WM tasks, which is discussed in more details below. The effects of tACS on WM are generally less explored than the effects of tDCS. As mentioned in the introduction, gamma tACS has been hypothesized to enhance plasticity, possibly via its effect on LTP (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>). Although LTP is one mechanism that can underlie increased interregional connectivity, it is not necessarily the only mechanism behind WM training gain. From a theoretical viewpoint, the stimulation might be more efficient if it was only applied in the delay phase of the WM task (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tallon-Baudry et al., 1998</xref>), which is hard to achieve with present technology in humans. It might be that maintaining a forced gamma oscillation throughout the whole WM process actually interferes with the endogenous interplay between different synchronization frequencies. Studies of theta oscillations in relation to cognitive performance have suggested that the timing of oscillations relative to peaks and troughs of endogenous oscillations are of great importance, and theta phase coupling can reduce reaction times during a delayed letter discrimination task (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Polan&#x000ed;a et al., 2012</xref>). This could be one aspect that is hard to achieve when inducing oscillation artificially, and stimulation might even disrupt endogenous oscillation synchrony (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chander et al., 2016</xref>). Theta tACS has also been shown to increase spatial WM capacity when applied to the parietal cortex (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, 2014</xref>). In this latter study, theta phase was tailored for each subject by adjusting it for the individual alpha peak frequency, probably increasing the effectivity of stimulation. A positive effect of fronto-parietal theta frequency tACS stimulation has been recently confirmed by <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Violante et al. (2017)</xref>, although only on a verbal WM task. As for stimulation in the gamma range, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoy et al. (2015)</xref> found that gamma tACS delivered on the DLPFC is effective in improving the accuracy in a 3-back but not a 2-back WM task. The difference in stimulation site (only frontal in <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoy et al., 2015</xref>, fronto-parietal in the present study) and task used (3-back WM task in <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoy et al., 2015</xref>, VSWM task in the present study) can explain the lack of positive results in the present study.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we found that tDCS affected the change in connectivity from baseline to post-intervention. This reflects not only an effect of stimulation on brain activity, but a specific effect of repeated tDCS, since both MRI acquisitions were made straight after stimulation. This could suggest that tDCS can have long-lasting effects on resting state connectivity. The three clusters of significant group differences were located in the left SPL, left SMG and right STG (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). The SPL region is part of the fronto-parietal network previously found to be associated with WM and attention (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rottschy et al., 2012</xref>). Since the outcome used for this analysis is a measure of global connectivity for each voxel, i.e., not retaining spatial specificity of the areas connected to the clusters, one can only speculate on the physiological mechanisms involved. Moreover, the signs of the values of change in connectivity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>, left panel) are not meaningful (i.e., they are the mean weight of the voxels in the cluster on a principal component), so that one cannot interpret the changes after training as increase or decrease in connectivity. It is worth noting that the connectivity of the Sham group significantly differed from the Frontal tDCS (Occipital Cathodes) group in all three clusters, while it only differed from the Parietal tDCS group in two out of three, reflecting the behavioral outcome. Previous studies have shown that gains from WM training are correlated with altered connectivity in the brain, including clusters near the ones we found in the present study (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jolles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Astle et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, an interpretation is that the increased excitability of the neurons beneath the tDCS anodes interferes with the modification that would take place naturally, e.g., through LTP, during WM training, impairing the plasticity of the WM network. This effect could be exerted either through interfering with the strengthening of connectivity that would normally occur, perhaps via a cathode effect, or through strengthening of connectivity in networks other than the one expected, thereby altering the connectivity pattern.</p><p>The lack of a positive effect in our experiments should not be taken to imply that tACS or tDCS have a negative effect in general on cognitive performance or cognitive training. Rather, conclusions can only be drawn regarding the specific electrode positioning and stimulation parameters chosen in our experiment. Differences in setup between tES studies are a widespread problem, which complicates conclusions in the field. One difference in the present study compared to previous WM training studies with tES is the strength of the currents, which has been noted to give different results (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tremblay et al., 2014</xref>). However, in Experiment 1, we did see a significant impairment from 1 mA current, and it is unlikely that a higher current (as used in <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2016</xref>) would have produced gains instead of impairments.</p><p>Moreover, although these WM training studies (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2016</xref> and our study) included comparable samples of healthy young participants, they differed in their tasks for WM training. A variety of <italic>n</italic>-back, span and more complex tasks were used and stimuli were given in visual, auditory, or combined channels with spatial or verbal items to remember. These differences in behavioral paradigms could be part of the reason why different studies, including those presented in this manuscript, produce different results, e.g., both studies that reported gains during training used <italic>n</italic>-back tasks. Future studies could compare <italic>n</italic>-back and non-<italic>n</italic>-back WM training with identical stimulation set-up to test whether the specific task is responsible for the difference in effect of tES.</p><p>Furthermore, the negative effects found in this study highlight the concern of possible cognitive side effects of tES, a fact that has previously been discussed by <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Iuculano and Kadosh (2013)</xref>. The spatial resolution of transcranial stimulation techniques is low, and the notion that tES can affect other cognitive networks apart from the intended one is quite self-evident (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Iuculano and Kadosh, 2013</xref>). This limitation will hopefully be overcome with more widespread use of high-definition tDCS (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the current study is the small sample size and the short training regime (5 days), which might have limited our abilities to detect a positive effect of tES. However, similar group sizes and training lengths have resulted in positive effects of tDCS in training of numerical abilities (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a significant effect of Day was found in all three experiments, which shows that the length of training was sufficient to measure reliable and significant improvements. Experiment 1 also showed that both group-size and training-time were sufficient to detect a significant impairment in training gains, and also affected resting state connectivity. All training groups showed lower gain than the sham group, although this was not always significant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). In the light of these previous results and our evidences, we find it unlikely that larger group sizes or longer training time would have resulted in any positive effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that tDCS and tACS over the frontal or parietal lobes can have a negative effect on WM training gains. None of the stimulations applied had a positive effect. Moreover, the effect of tDCS on behavioral measures in Experiment 1 was paralleled by changes in resting state connectivity. Furthermore, the position of the cathodes was shown to affect the outcome of stimulation. Neuroimaging findings and negative or unexpected behavioral effects such as these are of particular importance in the light of recent interest in the general public around tES (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tremblay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Horvath et al., 2015</xref>), and as a contrast to an increasing amount of articles suggesting positive effects of tES.</p><p>In the light of the present results, it seems that bilateral stimulation of the frontal and parietal lobe is not more effective than unilateral stimulation, and can on the contrary impair training gain. This seems to be true both using tDCS and tACS. Overall, unilateral frontal stimulation regimes using higher current intensity than the one used in this paper (i.e., &#x0003e;1 mA) seem to be more effective than our stimulation paradigm and should be preferred in future interventions. Similarly, tACS intervention using theta frequency and stimulating frontal and parietal areas rather than bilateral frontal or parietal are to be preferred.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Study design: AM, FN, and TK; data collection: AM, FN, and KK; analysis: AM, FN, and TK; writing and editing: AM, FN, and TK.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Swedish Research Council and The Swedish Brain Foundation.
