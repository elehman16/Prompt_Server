applying the abdominal drawing-in method and modified wall squat exercises on deep
abdominal muscle thickness and lumbar stability. [Subjects] A total of 30 subjects were
equally divided into an experimental group and a control group. [Methods] The experimental
group completed modified wall squat exercises, and the control group performed bridge
exercises. Both did so for 30 minutes three times per week over a six-week period. Both
groups&#x02019; transversus abdominis (Tra), internal oblique (IO), and multifidus muscle
thickness were measured using ultrasonography, while their static lumbar stability and
dynamic lumbar stability were measured using a pressure biofeedback unit. [Results] A
comparison of the pre-intervention and post-intervention measures of the experimental
group and the control group was made; the Tra and IO thicknesses were significantly
different in both groups. [Conclusion] The modified wall squat exercise and bridge
exercise affected the thicknesses of the Tra and the IO muscles. While the bridge exercise
requirs space and a mattress to lie on, the modified wall squat exercise can be
conveniently performed anytime.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Modified wall squat exercise</kwd><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Abdominal drawing-in</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lumbar stability is a important point that enables movement of the limbs while maintaining
of the spine upright under postural change and load<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscles that contribute to lumbar stability include the transversus
abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, quadratus lumborum, the multifidus of the
posterior trunk, and the pelvic floor muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the multifidus and the transversus abdominis are
activated earlier than the other muscles when the human body moves and adjusts the balance
of the trunk. Similarly, the bilateral internal oblique muscles are important for
maintaining lateral stability and the bending ability of the spine. Prior research on lumbar
stability has been conducted with the aim of understanding how to strengthen the spine
through the deep muscles such as the transversus abdominis and multifidus and different
exercise tools including mattresses, balls, dumbbells, balance pads, and diverse postures
such as the supine or prone positions that are used at the beginning of the lumbar flexion
exercise have been used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Squat exercises evenly develop upper body as well as lower body muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and may be done anywhere and at anytime.
This type of exercise is used for improving physi cal performance in many sports and may be
effectively used in rehabilitation programs after an operation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Squat exercises have great merit, but an unstable posture when this
type of exercise is performed damage the lower back and exert pressure on the knees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, wall squat exercises are safe,
without any possibility of doing harm to the lumbar vertebrae or knees because the squats
are performed with the body weight on the wall, making it easy for beginners to conduct this
exercise. As a result, modified wall squat exercises were used in this study with the aim of
improving lumbar stability rather than strengthening the lower body muscles, and this
exercise included motions to strengthen the neck and improve shoulder stability. The aim of
this study was to compare modified wall squat exercises that may be simply conducted without
the help of tools or equipment and without any limitation in space, with bridge exercise an
ordinary lumbar stability exercise, for lumbar stability improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty normal adults were randomly allocated either to a bridge exercise group (BEG: 1
male, 14 female; the experimental group) or to a modified wall squat exercise group (MWSEG:
1 male, 14 female; the control group). Those with muscle, skeletal, or neurological
problems, those who felt pain in the lumbar or pelvic areas, and those who could not perform
the bridge exercise or wall squat due to pain in the knees or ankles were excluded.
Sufficient explanation of this study&#x02019;s intent and the overall purpose was given, and
voluntary consent to participate in this study was obtained from all of the subjects. The
mean&#x000b1;SD age, height, and weight of BEG were 20.8&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years old, 161.8&#x000b1;6.6&#x02005;cm, and
55.3&#x000b1;9.3&#x02005;kg, respectively; and the mean&#x000b1;SD age, height, and weight of MWSEG were
20.7&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years old, 162.9&#x000b1;4.5&#x02005;cm, and 56.3&#x000b1;9.7&#x02005;kg, respectively. Analysis of group
difference in gender was made using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, and analyses of group difference
in age, height, and weight were made using the independent t-test. The above factors were
not significantly different (p&#x0003e;0.05), therefore the two groups were considered
homogenous.</p><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Modified wall squat exercise</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-689-g001"/></fig><p>The subjects conducted bridge exercises using the abdominal drawing-in method and modified
wall squat exercises on stable ground. The abdominal drawing-in method aims to contract the
transversus abdominis and internal oblique, thereby inducing concurrent contraction of the
muscles and reducing excessive lumbar lordosis or anteversion of the pelvis that may occur
during bridge exercises or modified wall squat exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the bridge exercise, subjects flexed their knee joints to 90
degrees, spread both arms by about 30 degrees, and placed both hands on the chest. The
subjects placed both feet at shoulder-width apart and placed both feet parallel on the
ground. The head and the neck were maintained straight, and the eyes looked at the ceiling.
The subjects raised the pelvis according to the instruction &#x0201c;raise the hips,&#x0201d; maintained the
posture for 15 seconds according to the instruction &#x0201c;maintain,&#x0201d; then lowered the pelvis, and
took a rest for 5 seconds according to the instruction &#x0201c;lower the hips.&#x0201d; Ten repetitions of
this process were considered one set, and the subjects performed a total of 10 sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Measurement of Tra &#x00026; Io</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-689-g002"/></fig><p>For the modified wall squat exercises, the subjects stood against a wall, spread both legs
shoulder-width apart, and stood at a distance of about a foot from the wall. With fingers
spread out, one hand was held with the palm end upward from the chest, while the finger ends
of the other hand around the belly were held downward, and pulled the chin was pulled in
pushing the head toward the wall. The pelvis and the lumbar spine were in the neutral
position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). During the squat motion, the
soles of the feet did not leave the ground, the knees were flexed up to a 90 degree angle
where they remained for 5 seconds, and then the knees were extended back to a 10 degree
angle which was maintained for 3 seconds. This was counted as one motion was a process, and
10 motions were considered one set. The subjects took a rest for 15 seconds and conducted
this process again for a total of 10 sets. The subjects conducted bridge exercises and
modified wall squat exercises three times per week, 30 minutes per day, for a total of 6
weeks.</p><p>In order to examine changes in muscle thickness of the trunk and the abdomen of the
participants, this study used ultrasonography (MysonoU5, Samsung medison, Korea) with a
12&#x02005;MHz linear probe. In order to ensure measurement at the same location each time, the
measurement point was marked during the first measurement. Ultrasonography was performed by
one well-qualified tester. First, the subject comfortably lay in the supine position. The
probe was placed transversely on the top of the iliac crest, moved toward the center of the
abdomen, and the screening was stopped when the external oblique, internal oblique, and
transversus abdominis were all shown. The thicknesses of the internal oblique and
transversus abdominis were measured at a point 13&#x02005;mm distal from the point where the fascias
of the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis met<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the measurement of the multifidus, the subjects lay in the
prone position, and the probe was perpendicularly placed on the fourth lumbar vertebra on
the left transverse process. The thickness from the transverse process to the superficial
muscle was measured<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>). In order to evaluate static lumbar stability (SLS), the
contractibility of TrA was evaluated using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU, Chattanooga
Group, Australia). The PBU is an inelastic sack that can be inflated and is connected to a
pressure gauge. It is a simple device that monitors and records changes in pressure during
the movement of the lumbar pelvis. The size of the sack is 16.7&#x000d7;24.0&#x02005;cm, and it has a
measurement range of 0&#x02013;200 mmHg. Excessive changes in pressure signify that movement of the
lumbar pelvic area is not regulated. For SLS measurement, the subjects lay in the prone
position, and the PBU was placed on the midpoint of the bilateral anterior superior iliac
spines; and the baseline pressure was set to 70 mmHg. The subjects pulled in their lower
abdomens to the maximum level without moving the lumbar vertebrae or hips, lowering the
pressure, and maintained this position for 10 seconds. The change in pressure was recorded.
In order to measure dynamic lumbar stability (DLS), the subjects performed the bent knee
fall out (BKFO), as described by Comerford and Mottram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the measurement of BKFO, the subjects lay in the supine
position, and the PBU was placed vertically below the lumbar spine 2&#x02005;cm from the posterior
superior iliac spines. In order to minimize the sway of the trunk, folded towels of the same
height were placed on both sides of the PBU. The baseline pressure was set to 40 mmHg. The
hip and the knee of one leg were bent, and the feet were attached to the ground abducted by
about 45 degrees, then moved back to the original posture. The change in pressure was
recorded.</p><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and are presented as
average and standard deviations. The paired t-test was used to test the significance of
changes in each group, and the independent t-test was used to test the significance of
differences between the two groups. The significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;= 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of Tra, IO, multifidus, SLS and DLS between pre- and post-intervention

an abdominal drawing-in method on deep abdominal muscle thickness and lumbar stability.
Prior research has shown that the abdominal drawing in method is effective at activating the
abdominal muscles, in particular, the transversus abdominis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stevens et al. reported that when subjects conducted bridge
exercises in the neutral position, abdominal muscle activity increased but multifidus
activity was not significantly different<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gorbet et al. in a study in which 30 lumbar pain patients and 30
average subjects completed abdominal drawing-in exercises that contracted the transversus
abdominis, observed that the thickness of the transversus abdominis increased in normal
subjects and lumbar pain patients who conducted abdominal drawing-in exercise contracting
the transversus abdominis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In their
study, the subjects in a quadruped position alternately stretched the upper and lower limbs
in a quadruped position and ultrasonography was used to measure the thickness of the
transversus abdominis. The result of the present study was similar to Bridge exercises and
modified wall squat exercises increased the thicknesses of the transversus abdominis (Tra)
and internal oblique (IO) of the normal subjects but did not increase that of the
multifidus. This is probably because bridge exercises and modified wall squat exercises
using an abdominal drawing-in method increase abdominal muscle activity and minimize
compensation actions such as lumbar lordosis, by relatively reducing the actions of the
erector spinae and the multifidus.</p><p>According to the comparison of the pre- and post-intervention measures of BEG and MWSEG,
there were statistically significant differences in only Tra and IO in both groups.
Regarding changes between pre- and post-intervention, there were no statistically
significant differences between the two groups. These results show that the bridge exercise
and modified wall squat exercise on stable ground affected the development of the TrA and IO
muscles, but did not have an effect on the other muscles. In particular, although bridge
exercises and modified wall squat exercises have the same effect on the development of the
TrA and IO muscles, the bridge exercise requires a space to lie and a mattress. However, the
modified wall squat exercises enable lumbar stability exercise against a wall and may be
conveniently performed anytime, anywhere. Accordingly, the researcher hopes that the
modified wall squat exercise will be utilized together with bridge exercises in home
training for patients who need lumbar stabilization exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Willson</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Dougherty</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ireland</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Core stability and its relationship to lower extremity
