Pain, which anyway affects 70% of children with CP on a daily or weekly basis, can be augmented during physical and medical treatments [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175028.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BTX injections are the gold standard treatment for focal hypertonia but typically repeated every few months to maintain the effect [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The procedure is short, but causes pain and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] since needle-related procedures are a source of pain and distress and general anesthesia is, for the most part, avoided [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other techniques of analgesia, such as light sedation, are standard of care in many institutions and include medications such as midazolam or inhaled nitrous oxide and non-pharmacological interventions [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The use of medical clowns for needle-related procedures has been shown to alleviate pain in young children and reduce parental anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175028.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

The Helsinki committee at Shaare Zedek Medical Center approved the two parts of the study. The first part was a quasi-randomized controlled trial (April 2009; clinicaltrials.gov ID # NCT01377883), the second part was a crossover trial (April 2011).

VAS-after of &#x02265;4/5 was considered severe pain.

Clowns recorded the technique used and how effective was the intervention. Nurses were asked to record the difficulty managing/holding the child and listening to the EMG device. Physicians recorded the level of difficulty in targeting the muscle and listening to the EMG device. We attempted to use gait assessment (10 meter) before and after intervention but we realized that it was very dependent on the child's mood and was not used for analysis.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS V9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Groups were compared depending on data type with t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test when relevant. Correlation between two continuous variables was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficients. The effect of VAS-before, age, gender, previous BTX injections, anatomical distribution of injections, number of muscles injected, injection of deep muscles, amount of BTX, cognitive and language level on the difference between the groups was evaluated with regression models. Repeated measures ANOVA (RMA) were performed to assess the crossover data of the study and also the longitudinal data.

Most children receiving clown-care reported lower pain levels similar to other clown studies,[<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which is the goal of behavioral and cognitive interventions [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Children who did not receive clown care experienced higher levels of pain during the first injection than was anticipated, whereas children receiving clown-care therapy experienced pain equal to or lower than anticipated. This finding was consistent across subsequent injections. This indicates that clown-care can alleviate acute pain and creates resilience for future procedures. Although the clown interaction began before the procedure, it did not relieve anticipated pain before the first experience, indicating that clown care is effective when conducted during the needle procedure itself, not before.</p><p>First experience was found to crucially affect subsequent injections. Apparently if a child had a specific experience, it was difficult to alter the perceptions, as shown previously in children younger than 8 years [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This observation suggests that children are capable of developing memories of pain that can influence their subsequent reactions to similar experiences [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175028.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Clowning may impact the experience of the first procedure in a purely physiological way. It has been demonstrated that social laughter elevates pain threshold, which provides a possible explanation for the pain difference between the clown-care and control group [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Physiological effects of clowning were shown in a randomized control study reporting increased conception following <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization procedures with clown-care [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The altered pain memory had a carry-over effect to other procedures similar to other pain treatments; effective pain medication alleviates pain in subsequent episodes [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175028.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, if the procedure was experienced as traumatic, clowning could not alter this.</p><p>A clowning study similar to ours did not find that clown-care shortened the period of crying during BTX injections [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study documented the effect of clowning by the period of crying rather than a valid pain assessment tool [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175028.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, our clowning techniques did not include painted faces and thus is considered less frightening. Moreover, the clowning effect over time was not assessed.</p><p>Clinicians are not always cognizant of the pain and trauma experienced by children when undergoing interventions. Often the concern about pain is dismissed with the maxim "procedures without anesthesia reduce medical risks". Most BTX procedures are performed without general anesthesia for this reason, [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and sedation is not always available; in these cases medical clowns are able to alleviate pain and reduce subsequent trauma. The opportunity to modulate pain impact during the first procedure has a significant carryover effect. Painful procedures that compromise the child's well being are part and parcel of medical care in those with physical disabilities. The need to improve the quality of life in children with CP is extremely important, justifying the attention given to reduce the child&#x02019;s discomfort without increasing risk. Our results indicate that clown-care during needle procedures reduce pain perception which hopefully will lead to better medical results and reduce the need for general anesthesia in children during medical examinations that require the cooperation of the child.</p><sec id="sec029"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The study used a quasi-randomized assignment and small sample size. The possible consequences for quasi-randomization is that there may have been a biased allocation and biasing of the group comparison due to lack of allocation concealment. We did not control for previous needle procedures (such as IV insertion), operations or painful treatments in the past or parental anxiety that may have impacted pain perception. Pain was recorded according to subjective reports since there is no known objective measure. The effect of clowning is assumed to occur by raising the child's pain threshold, but since the parents and staff could not be blinded to the procedure, clowning may have had an indirect impact on <italic>the child by effecting the environment</italic>. Pain reports were attained from parent or child, thus parent reported pain data are mixed with children reported pain data [<xref rid="pone.0175028.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>In conclusion</title><p>Children with CP benefit from clown-care during Botulinum toxin injections.
