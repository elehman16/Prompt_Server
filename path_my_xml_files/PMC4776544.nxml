It appears that the immuno-modulatory effects occur due to bifidogenic properties of human milk on the flora microbe of infant's GI.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] High levels of oligosaccharides in human milk cause this bifidogenic property.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Also, it been seen that nonhuman milk oligosaccharides such as galacto-oligosaccharides (short chain) and fructooligosaccharides (long chain) have this effect.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a series of studies on preterm and term infants, it has been found that the amount of beneficial flora can be increased by adding oligosaccharides, which also reduces the amount of pathogenic flora.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Furthermore, reduction in GI pH and an increment in the production of short-chain fatty acids (<sub>SC</sub>FAs) are caused by these oligosaccharides. Similarly, in one <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it was shown that <sub>SC</sub>FAs stimulate mucin-2 generation and increase intestinal integrity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Some researchers have found that adding oligosaccharides to the infant's diet reduces the incidence of infections and atopy in them.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, with a series of other studies, scholars observed that there was a trend toward decreased pathogenic bacteria counts in infants who were given prebiotic supplements.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Finally, in a recent study, with prebiotic enteral supplementation, Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. found a trend toward higher bifidobacteria counts.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Based on the above and due to the importance of improving the health status of preterm infants also, since the existence of formula in previous studies may have had a negative effect, as a confounding factor, on intestinal flora; the present researchers decided to investigate their hypothesis; i.e., the complete removal of formula, in addition to eliminating the potentially harmful effects of formula, will cause a synergistic effect between nonhuman neutral oligosaccharides (prebiotic) and breast milk oligosaccharides; which has more favorable effects on fecal microbiota, particularly in very premature infants (infants with weight &#x0003c;1500 g [i.e., very low birth weight (VLBW)]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This double-center randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted from December 2012 to November 2013 in the tertiary NICUs (Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti Hospital NICUs; general and maternity hospitals, respectively) of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Preterm neonates were favorable for participation if BW &#x02264;1500 g and if they were not fed with formula. To ensure tolerate milk initially, when the volume of breast milk reached 30 ml/kg/day, VLBW infants were enrolled in the RCT study. Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, major congenital anomalies, GI system anomalies, proven sepsis or infection immediately before the start of the study and feeding with formula.</p><p>The effects of enteral supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharides (short chain) and fructooligosaccharides (long chain) (<sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS) mixture on fecal microbiota in premature infants were investigated in two groups of prebiotic (Group P) and control (Group C) groups. The neonates in the study were randomly assigned to have their feedings supplemented with either prebiotics (<sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture) Group P or placebo Group C. Randomization was performed 1:1 using a computer-generated randomization list prepared by an independent statistician not involved in the rest of the investigation. <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture was prepared, sterilized and sent to us by nutricia MMP (Mashhad, Iran). Then several samples of <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture were analyzed by a food processing industry specialist.</p><p>In both groups, after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, infants were entered into the study. In the Group P, 0.5 g/kg/day of <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture was started, and maintained until the milk volume reached 70 ml/kg/day. When the milk volume reached 70&#x02013;110 ml/kg/day, the dosage of <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture was increased to 1 g/kg/day and at the milk volume of 110&#x02013;150 ml/kg/day, the <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture was increased to 1.5 g/kg/day, then the mixture was added to the infants&#x02019; diet for one-two additional days. Infants in Group C were received an equivalent volume of distilled water in their milk during the days of intervention. <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS and distilled water were prepared in similar syringes by a trained nurse who was blind to the group's assignments. Syringes were numbered for each infant entering the study by her then the investigator, who was blind to the numbering, allocated numbers to infants in the sequence of entry into the study. Three times; when the volume of milk reached approximately 30 (time 1), 70 (time 2) and 150 ml/kg/day (time 3), stool cultures were sent for an investigation of fecal microbiota (de Man Rogosa Sharpe [MRS] and Eosin Methylene Blue [EMB]). The infants were given parenteral nutritional support during the increase of milk volumes.</p><p>In both groups, infants were initially fed with 20 cc/kg/day on the day that the attending neonatologist decided to initiate the enteral feedings (tube feeding). Then on the next day, feeding volumes were increased to 40 cc/kg/day; on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of the study, volumes were increased to 60 cc/kg/day, and so forth, until a volume of 150 cc/kg/day was achieved. To ensure tolerate milk initially, in both groups, the infants were entered in the study when the milk volume reached 30 cc/kg/day. Parenteral nutrition was gradually tapered as enteral feeding volumes were increased. Human milk fortifier was begun at volume milk of 150 cc/kg/day.</p><p>Stool samples were collected from the neonates in both Groups P and C at three sampling stages; on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of study and on the last day of each study interval in which increasing prebiotic concentration was included in the neonate's diet. The samples were kept refrigerated in thigh plastic containers for &#x0003c;6 h until they were transferred to the laboratory, where they were examined as soon as possible.</p><p>MRS agar (Merck, Germany, pH = 5.7) added with 0.5% cysteine hydrochloride (sigma, USA), and EMB agar were used for enumeration of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> colonies and coliforms respectively.</p><p>Each fecal sample (about 0.5 g) was accurately weighed in a sterilized tube, thoroughly mixed with 5 ml sterile normal saline, and centrifuged for 5 min at 100 rpm. One milliliter of the upper phase was serially diluted 10-fold to 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> dilution.</p><p>One hundred microliters of the proper dilution were surface-cultured on the both types of plates. MRS plates were incubated anaerobically in an anaerobic jar using CO<sub>2</sub> generating gas pack A (Merck, Germany) and were kept at 37&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C for 48 h. EMB plates were incubated aerobically for 24 h in at the same temperature. Colony counting was done by expert eyes and expressed as a logarithm (log) of the colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of fresh feces.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study in both groups was the effect of <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture on fecal microbiota pattern. Secondary outcomes were the duration of dependency to oxygen, incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD) (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life),[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] duration of hospitalization and death for each neonate, which were recorded daily. Gestational ages were assessed by prenatal ultrasonography.</p><p>This paper is derived from the residency thesis No. 392237 in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.

However, no statistical significance was observed in either of the studies.</p><p>Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. reported that, in both groups they studied, the fecal bacterial colonization increased in the study (Exp. 35.41; 95% CI: 15.82&#x02013;79.24, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, they observed that intestinal colonization of specific bacterial groups was not affected by prebiotic supplementation; although there was meaninglessness increasing trend of bifidobacteria counts.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The differentiations in the growth of fecal bacteria in previous studies could be described by different combinations and doses of prebiotics used. Riskin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] used 1% lactulose and observed a preferential intestinal proliferation of lactobacilli, and Kapiki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used a fructooligosaccharide-supplemented formula and reported increase in the growth of fecal beneficial bacteria, while other researchers, such as Knol <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] used a combination of short chain GOS and long chain FOS and demonstrated an increase in the growth of bifidobacteria and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. On the other hand, Moro <italic>et al</italic>. observed that growth of fecal beneficial bacteria followed by prebiotic supplementation was dose-dependent.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Interestingly, in other studies, the presence of formula was serious or semi-serious and so, as a confounding factor may have had a negative effect on the results. Fortunately, we were able to convince the majority of mothers to feed their babies with their own milk. Therefore, due to formula feeding, few infants were excluded from our study.</p><p>The present study showed that despite higher levels of pathogenic bacteria in the first stool cultures in Group P, the growth of these pathogenic bacteria in the last stool cultures in the group were significantly lower, and despite the significantly higher level of beneficial bacteria in first stool cultures in the Group C, after several days of receiving <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS mixture, proliferation of beneficial bacteria increased significantly in the Group P, so that the growth of these beneficial bacteria in the last stool cultures was not statistically significant in the two groups.</p><p>We think that perhaps the complete removal of formula, and consequently, elimination of its inherent adverse characteristics, caused a synergistic effect between nonhuman neutral oligosaccharides (prebiotic) and human oligosaccharides and clear effectiveness in the results.</p><p>Moro <italic>et al</italic>. found that &#x0201c;the degree of prebiotic response is also dependent on baseline colony counts of bifidobacteria,&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] while in our study, despite the unexpected colony counts of beneficial/pathogenic bacteria in the first stool cultures, favorable results of growth of beneficial/pathogenic bacteria in the last stool cultures was obtained.</p><p>Interestingly in contrast to other studies, and probably because of the complete removal of formula in this present study, the duration of hospitalization was more favorable in the Group P [<italic>P</italic> = 0.003; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. However Riskin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed that the mean &#x000b1; SD age at discharge from hospital for the prebiotic versus the Group C was of 52.5 &#x000b1; 41.8 versus 71.6 &#x000b1; 52.4 days, (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), and also Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported that the median length of hospitalization was 52 (30&#x02013;111) and 54 (30&#x02013;181) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69), where, in this respect, no difference was found between the two groups in their studies.</p><p>In our study, the duration of oxygen dependency, during the study period, was similar in both groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09). This is in line with the result of a study by Riskin <italic>et al</italic>., who observed that the duration of oxygen dependency was 25.8 &#x000b1; 36.4 and 29.5 &#x000b1; 36.6 days in the Groups P and C, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In one study,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] use of prebiotics has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of CLD while we did not find a significant difference between the two study groups.</p><p>The present study suffers from a number of limitations. The major limitation of the study could be the rather small number of the infants included (50 premature neonates), even though the results clearly indicated a significant difference between the Groups P and C. Furthermore, the timely submission of stool samples was difficult because infants did not pass stool when we had planned. The strengths of the study include the RCT design in high-risk neonates (i.e., VLBW infants), the complete removal of formula and very good cooperation with professionals from other disciplines involved in the study.</p><p>The present study suggests that it might have been the complete removal of formula which manifests a synergistic effect between nonhuman neutral oligosaccharides (prebiotics) and human-milk-oligosaccharides, which, in turn, led to rapid growth of beneficial <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> colonies in the gut of breast milk-fed preterm infants, while decreasing the number of pathogenic coliforms microorganisms. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to investigate the issue.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Amir-Mohammad Armanian: Dr.
