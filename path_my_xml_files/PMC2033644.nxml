In a follow-up study of patients randomised to two different radiation fractionating regimens, 204 patients filled in a mailed questionnaire 7-11 years after treatment. The questionnaire consisted of the General Health Questionnaire, 20-item version (GHQ-20), and the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). There were no differences in psychological distress between patients receiving conventional radiotherapy and those receiving a slightly hypofractionated regimen. A high prevalence of psychological distress was found in both treatment groups (30% of 'cases' according to the GHQ-20), especially in patients with impaired cognitive or social function, or with pain. Clinicians need to be aware of this morbidity, and their ability to detect patients with psychological problems needs to be improved. The GHQ-20 can facilitate the communication process in a clinical setting. With an increased awareness of these problems and by using valid instruments for identification of patients at risk, the clinicians may intervene and help the patients to reduce their psychological distress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="592" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="593" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="594" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="595" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="596" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="597" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
