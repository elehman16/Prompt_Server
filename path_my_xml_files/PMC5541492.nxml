Intervention and study design acceptability and feasibility were assessed by nine criteria. Secondary outcomes, via online surveys (at baseline, 1&#x02009;week and 1&#x02009;month) measured service use, help-seeking intentions, psychological distress, barriers to help-seeking, attitudes towards mental health help-seeking, mental health literacy, satisfaction and trust.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-one participants were randomised (intervention: n=24; comparison: n=27). Three out of four of the intervention and two out of five of the study design criteria were met. Unmet criteria could be addressed by modifications to the study design. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that Link was useful to participants and may have increased their positive experiences towards help-seeking. There were no observable differences between arms in any outcome measures and no harms were detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Generally, the Link intervention and study design were acceptable and feasible with modifications suggested for the four out of nine unmet criteria. The main trial will hence have shorter surveys and a simpler recruitment process, use positive affect as the primary outcome and will not link to Google.com for the comparison arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12614000386639.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Child &#x00026; adolescent psychiatry</kwd><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd><kwd>Information technology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study provides important insights into the feasibility of a unique internet intervention for mental health help-seeking for young adults and the study design in preparation for a full-scale randomised controlled trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study uses social media as an innovative technique to recruit 18&#x02013;24&#x02009;year olds across Australia, reflecting how young adults would learn about the intervention in a real-world scenario.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Following the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s complex intervention guidelines, the intervention is underpinned by a sound theoretical framework ensuring that the design matches the intended goals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>General practitioners, psychological experts, other service providers, technical experts and young adults were involved in a process of codesign to develop the Link intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This pilot study was not powered to assess the statistical significance of the outcomes and as such the results are descriptive, not generalisable, and should be interpreted with caution.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mental health disorders account for the highest burden of disease in adolescence and young adulthood.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Up to one quarter of young people experience mental health problems with substantial negative effects on interpersonal relationships, functioning at school and work, general health and well-being.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x000a0;While there has been significant investment in mental health service promotion and delivery over the last decade,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> only 35% of young people experiencing mental health problems seek professional help.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>

</p><p>There is a paucity of evidence for online help seeking interventions and where there are studies, they are poorly designed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We sought to address this gap with a rigorous process, following the guidance of the Medical Research Council, involving an iterative approach across intervention development, feasibility testing and evaluation using a randomised trial, before further study on widespread implementation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Help-seeking is a complex behaviour to influence and designing an intervention aimed at improving help-seeking online must address multiple components of behaviour change including overcoming barriers to change, as well as providing algorithms to cluster user&#x02019;s symptoms into related condition categories and thereby direct users to appropriate services likely to meet their needs. Our intervention, Link, is an online program aimed at facilitating mental health help-seeking for young adults aged 18&#x02013;25 years of age. Our prior development phase examined several theories of help-seeking and behaviour change to determine a suitable theoretical framework with the Theory of Planned Behaviour selected.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x000a0;Second, an iterative codesign process with young adults (end users), health service providers and clinical experts tailored the program for use with young adults seeking help for mental health issues.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>In this paper, we report on the feasibility study that aimed to: (1) assess the acceptability and feasibility of the online intervention, Link, to guide young people to appropriate mental healthcare or information; (2) assess the acceptability and feasibility of the study design for the future full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluation; and (3) identify any modifications needed to the intervention or the study design before proceeding to the main trial. This pilot was essential to ensure that the intervention elements were acceptable, appropriate and functioned optimally and that the study design was feasible, including the recruitment and randomisation strategy, suitability of the outcome measures and choice of the primary outcome measure for assessing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the future RCT. This feasibility study was not powered to assess the statistical significance of changes in the intervention versus comparison arm and, as such, results are descriptive, not generalisable, and should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A two-arm RCT was undertaken. Individuals were baseline tested then randomised into balanced (1:1) parallel arms, the intervention arm (Link) or the comparison arm (&#x02018;usual search strategies&#x02019;), and then measured for primary and secondary outcomes with surveys at 1&#x02009;week and 1&#x02009;month postrandomisation. Online recruitment and online surveys were used. The online survey service, QuON,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> provided a secure server for managing the trial phases, issuing surveys and collecting data with responses deidentified and stored securely at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This study is reported following the CONSORT guidelines.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x000a0;The CONSORT checklist for the trial is provided in the online supplementary file.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Two recruitment methods were trialled using various social media and online platforms such as Google&#x000a0;Ads, Facebook advertising and Gumtree: (1) a static advertising campaign with eight advertisements coupled with keywords and (2) a dynamic advertising campaign, where advertisements were regularly modified to maintain a high profile and visibility on the various platforms. Advertisements were limited to those living in Australia (for all platforms) and aged between 18 and 25 years (only Facebook allowed specification of age). This online recruitment strategy was used to reach the population most likely to use the intervention in the real world and to emulate how the intervention would be advertised if found to be effective. Online recruitment was chosen over traditional mass media or mail-out campaigns as it has been found to be as representative as mass-media campaigns.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Further advantages include being able to reach large numbers of participants quickly, a less confrontational format as there is no face-to-face contact and ease of participation with a click of a button.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Recruitment using Facebook has been previously successful with this demographic.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>In keeping with the intention of the Link intervention to provide a range of mental health service and information options according to a stepped care approach,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the inclusion criteria were broad to encompass young adults with mild distress through to more severe mental health problems who have and have not previously sought help, and young people with or without clinical distress, seeking help for issues such as exam stress, relationship troubles, sleep or bullying. Young people had to be: (1) 18&#x02013;25 years of age; (2) living in Australia; (3) able to provide three contact details such as a current valid email address and residential address and either a phone number or alternative email address; and (4) proficient enough in English to complete the surveys and intervention. Provision of a residential address ensured participants were living in Australia and allowed posting of gift vouchers for participation. The two other contact details were required to enable follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Young people interested in the study clicked a link in the advertisements and were directed to the study website where a brief explanation of the study was provided along with check boxes confirming eligibility. Those eligible were directed to the information statement that fully explained the study objectives and procedures including the issuing of a $A25 gift voucher on completion of the study. If interested in participating, eligible young people were asked to provide their contact details and to tick a box indicating consent to participation. The online system then issued an email to consenting participants instructing them to verify that the email address was correct. They were then directed to complete the baseline (prerandomisation) survey using their email address as a username to ensure participants could only participate once. Participants chose their own password. During this pilot, it became clear that many participants discontinued their participation at the email verification stage, and hence this step was removed (June 13th, 1&#x02009;month into the pilot) with consenting participants instead progressing straight to the baseline survey. In addition, the information about gift vouchers was moved to the brief explanation page on which participants landed from the recruitment advertisements, in an effort to improve recruitment. Following the baseline survey, participants were randomised into either the intervention or comparison arm. One week and 1&#x02009;month postrandomisation measurement surveys were conducted in both arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Sample size</title><p>Consistent with feasibility studies, no power analyses were conducted as this study was not intended to assess effectiveness of the intervention relative to the comparison arm. We anticipated that a total sample size of 120 participants (60 in each arm) would be sufficient to test acceptability and feasibility, allowing for approximately 50% attrition, as is common in online recruitment strategies,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> to ultimately reach a sample of 60 (30 in each arm) at the 1-week timepoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation</title><p>An independent academic oversaw the randomisation process including generating the sequence for the random allocation using a random seed generator within QuON in random blocks of four, six or eight. Participants were randomly allocated to a trial arm after baseline and identified by a randomly allocated identification number. The researchers were blind to the randomisation sequence until data analysis had been carried out. Participants were emailed a link to either Google.com (comparison) or Link (intervention), and therefore it was not feasible to blind participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Comparison arm: usual help-seeking strategies</title><p>Participants allocated to the comparison arm received the following instructions: <italic>&#x02018;</italic>Please search for information and help for an issue you are currently facing using whatever strategies you would normally use whether it's online or offline.

A &#x02018;recommended&#x02019; service, in addition to the participants&#x02019; preferred service type, was also displayed based on clinical need. For example, a participant selecting suicidal thoughts as an issue with a preference for online help would also be recommended a 24-hour crisis telephone service (&#x02018;Lifeline&#x02019;) in addition to their preferred service type. There were 31 youth-friendly services included in the Link directory. The program took a minimum of 30&#x02009;s to complete (in order to reduce attrition during the program), but participants could spend longer exploring their issues or return at a later time to where they had ended a previous session if they wished. Intervention participants had access to Link for the duration of the trial (1&#x02009;month in total). For the purposes of this study, participants accessed Link using their logon details to link their data with survey data.

Given the theoretical considerations of how the Link intervention might work to relieve young people&#x02019;s immediate distress when they realise there are options to address their mental health concerns, an additional measure of positive and negative affect, immediately postintervention will be used as a primary outcome for the main trial. The comparison condition will not include a link to Google.com in the main trial as this was suggesting a strategy rather than young people&#x02019;s &#x02018;usual strategies&#x02019; that may not include online.

In particular, the majority of participants in the Link arm found that it was quick, easy, self-directed, personalised and had lots of resources.</p><p>Some participants had specific problems (eg, chronic illness, financial, pregnancy&#x000a0;and worry about the future) that were not addressed in Link, commenting that the &#x02018;information was not appropriate&#x02019; (female, aged 19), &#x02018;not understandable&#x02019; (female, aged 21), &#x02018;impersonal&#x02019; (females, aged 19 and 21) or &#x02018;too long&#x02019; (female, aged 23). Lack of trust in the accuracy of the information available on the internet was also a general concern for both the Link and comparison arms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This feasibility study piloted the acceptability and feasibility of the Link intervention and the study procedures to be used in the future RCT of Link, an online program to assist young adults seeking help for mental health problems. The results demonstrated that the study procedure, involving online surveys and the internet intervention, were feasible and acceptable with several minor modifications identified to enhance recruitment, intervention use and retention in the main trial. There were no indications that the Link or the Google arm caused harms in the participants.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and study design</title><p>Of the nine acceptability and feasibility criteria, four (logging onto and completing the intervention, recruitment rates, usefulness of the surveys and enrolment rates) were not met. These outcomes were examined to determine likely modifications to successfully meet the criteria in the main trial and are described below.</p><sec id="s4a1"><title>Will intervention participants complete Link at least once?</title><p>As the number of intervention participants who completed the intervention fell short of the expected number (75% instead of 85%), we will increase the visibility of the link to the intervention program in email reminders to participants to complete the program. Likewise, comparison participants will receive reminders to seek help using their usual strategies. As 88% of intervention participants who completed the 1-month survey also completed the intervention program, we anticipate that this minor modification will be sufficient to increase the number of intervention participants who access the Link intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Can we recruit quickly enough using social media?</title><p>Two hundred 18&#x02013;25&#x02009;year olds living in Australia were needed to ensure 60 who would participate in the study. As the time frame for completing the study was limited by funding, it was necessary that this number was reached within 3&#x02009;months. However, only 143 participants were recruited within a 15-week period. Therefore, two modifications will be implemented in the main trial to improve the recruitment rates: a new advertising campaign and a new reimbursement scheme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>New advertising campaign</title><p>Two methods of recruiting were trialled in this feasibility study, neither with much success. Further methods of online recruitment are needed to ensure an adequate sample size for the future main trial. Using email recruitment from young people signing up to targeted websites (such as ReachOut.com) may increase recruitment rates and will be explored for the main trial.</p><p>The dynamic nature of recruiting through Google and Facebook became apparent during the first weeks of our study. Due to the competitive nature of social media, flexible advertising with regular monitoring and adjustment is necessary to maintain visibility on social media streams. Increased flexibility of our advertising will increase exposure to young people and also reduce the costs associated with recruiting participants by choosing keywords that are&#x000a0;not currently being used by other organisations. As advertising on social media is dynamic, and dependent on other organisations&#x02019; use of keywords, young people&#x02019;s interests and searches as well as the costs associated with advertising, it is important we respond to the competitive nature of this advertising and have a dynamic and flexible advertising strategy with the ability to change the wording regularly and quickly. As this is a complex and time-consuming process, we will outsource this recruitment to a professional marketing manager with expertise in marketing and recruitment for research studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>New reimbursement scheme</title><p>Alexander <italic>et al</italic> suggest that a small upfront payment with a higher incentive awarded for retention can increase recruitment and retention rates.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> A $A25 gift card was given to each participant who completed the 1-month survey. In order to reduce attrition rates early in the study procedure, rather than the $A25 gift card received at the end of the study, an incremental reimbursement schedule will be implemented with participants receiving increasing amounts per survey (eg, $10 for baseline, $15 after postintervention survey and $25 after a 1-month follow-up survey).</p><sec id="s4c1"><title>Were the measures in the survey useful?</title><p>We included a large number of measures in the feasibility trial to explore their usefulness with the understanding that only the most relevant would be retained in the main trial. We found that the K10, the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire, the Stages of Change Questionnaire, the Barriers to Adolescents Seeking&#x000a0;Help Scale, the Adolescent Quality of Life Scale and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire were the most meaningful. Qualitative analyses suggest that participants found the surveys too time-consuming, therefore shortening the surveys is likely to increase completion rates. Therefore, several measures that provided less meaningful results will be removed for the larger trial including the mental health literacy scale and the items we created based on the Research-Based Education and Quality Improvement guidelines.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These measures are not well validated and are not primary outcomes so removing them is anticipated to improve the study design and retention.</p><p>One of the benefits reported by participants in the qualitative responses was the immediate increase in positive affect after seeking help using Link. This outcome was also discussed as a likely first step in engaging young people with a help-seeking journey during participatory workshops with service providers, researchers and young people. Therefore, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will be used to assess positive affect after participants have been exposed to their intervention, as the primary outcome.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s4c2"><title>Do most eligible participants enrol into study?</title><p>There was high attrition early in the study procedure indicating that methods to increase retention rates during enrolment into the study are necessary. First,&#x000a0;the sign up process was time-consuming and participants may have had concerns about their privacy. Hence, an email address and a phone number only will be required for the main trial. Second,&#x000a0;participants were asked to validate the survey on their email account before obtaining access to the baseline survey in the beginning of the pilot study. One of the changes made during the pilot study was a direct link to the baseline survey without the email validation process. This may reduce drop-off at this point. Third, 20% of participants (n=13) dropped out after completing the baseline survey and before completing the randomisation process, indicating that processes to encourage participants to continue with the study are important here as well. The language used, length of the survey and the look of the website may have influenced the retention rates at this step. Further methods are needed to increase these rates such as including regular reminders via email and SMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>The Link severity scale</title><p>Of interest, this study presents some validation for the severity scale used in Link, as it consistently correlated with scores on the K10. This suggests that the Link severity scale may be a valid measure of the impact of mental health problems on daily life and therefore will be retained within the Link intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>As discussed above, several measures will be removed from the larger trial and the outcome of positive affect will be used as a primary outcome. Some of the current measures used (Stages of Change Questionnaire, Barriers to Adolescents Seeking Help Scale and General Help Seeking Questionnaire) are not well validated and therefore, while useful as secondary outcomes, are not suitable as a primary outcome. The Mental Health&#x000a0;Care Resource Use Questionnaire was also useful and necessary as a secondary outcome; however, as the aim of Link is to direct young people to services appropriate to their needs and preferences, it is difficult to interpret from the services used whether this has occurred. An increase in service use is not necessarily useful for participants with low mental healthcare needs for example.</p><p>One of the benefits of online help-seeking strategies is that information is immediately available and the sense of relief felt by participants once an avenue of help is suggested. Participants indicated that they found Link helpful and easy to use. Providing avenues of care to participants may increase positive emotions and broaden personal resources for coping and help-seeking. Some of the features of Link based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour also tap into the concept of positive psychology.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Increasing mental health literacy and providing young people with a sense of empowerment and meaning improves coping skills,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> particularly problem-focused coping such as help-seeking. By providing avenues for help-seeking in Link, in line with the Theory of Planned Behaviour, positive emotions are likely to occur leading to a positive experience of seeking help. Therefore, we expect that positive affect will be an appropriate primary outcome.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> This measure is well-validated and likely to mediate the relationship between beliefs, and help-seeking intentions and behaviours.</p><p>Many coping strategies that increase positive affect are reinforced in Link such as: positive reappraisal, goal-directed problem-focused coping, increasing the repertoire of coping strategies, relaxation and behavioural therapies and increasing positive meaning of issues.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;46</xref> In line with this theory, Link aims to increase connections with others, improve distraction skills and increase self-esteem. Furthermore, positive emotions also improve coping skills and increase the likelihood of future emotional well-being.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Conducting this feasibility study was a useful way to optimise the intervention and the study design with many issues uncovered before commencement of the main RCT. There were many strengths including the novel recruitment strategies employed allowing a broad range of young adults to be involved in the study. The online survey, data management and randomisation were generally successful with few issues found.</p><p>While no differences between arms were anticipated due to the exploratory nature of this study, providing comparison participants with the link to Google was a limitation as it may have suggested this avenue of help-seeking and led participants to a help-seeking method not ordinarily in their repertoire. Furthermore, as Google is a well-developed program with years of programming to perfect the search engine, it is highly advanced compared with the Link prototype, which currently only maps pathways for seven issues and includes 31 services. Therefore, the comparison arm in the larger trial will exclude the link to Google and instead direct comparison participants to use their usual strategies for seeking help.</p><p>A measure of positive and negative affect was not included in this study. This outcome is a key element to mental health help-seeking, as positive affect associated with the act of help-seeking is important to continued help-seeking behaviour and obtaining help if needed. Many of the outcome measures used are not well validated or widely used. This is in part due to the small number of publications in the field, but also because of the complexity of mental health &#x02018;help-seeking&#x02019; as a focus compared with mental health or psychological distress.</p></sec><sec id="s4g" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this feasibility study, we found that the proposed study design and the Link intervention were feasible and acceptable to participants with some modifications. These will mainly include improving the recruitment strategies, lessening the burden on participants during sign-up and by shortening the surveys, choosing a different primary outcome measure to determine positive affect and using a more realistic comparison condition to elicit &#x02018;usual help-seeking strategies&#x02019;. These are important features and processes to consider in developing and implementing a complex intervention. It is difficult to determine from this pilot trial whether Link will effectively improve help-seeking or positive affect; however, incorporating the improvements identified as a result of this study, the main randomised controlled trial will allow us to investigate the effects of Link on positive affect and help-seeking.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015303.supp2</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><p>
