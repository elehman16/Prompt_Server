Following a prescreening visit, patients&#x02019; eligibility to participate was evaluated at a screening visit. After a 14-day run-in period, eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of 10 sequences, each comprising three treatment periods. The three treatment periods were 28 days in duration, separated by a 21-day washout period. On Days 1 and 28 of each treatment period, serial forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers were performed at pre-dose and at 15, 30 and 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11.5 and 12 h post-dose, with slow vital capacity maneuvers (for the collection of inspiratory capacity [IC] data) performed at pre-dose, prior to the FVC maneuvers. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were monitored throughout the study, and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were collected pre-dose on Day 1 and post-dose on Day 28.</p><p>All patients received an inhaled short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (SABA)/short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) fixed combination (ipratropium bromide/fenoterol hydrobromide 20/50 &#x003bc;g pMDI) as rescue medication for &#x0201c;on-demand&#x0201d; use over the entire study period, with a minimum of 8 h between the use of rescue medication and the spirometric measurements. The following medication was prohibited from the indicated time prior to the screening visit and for the duration of the study: SABAs (6 h), SAMAs (8 h), SABA/SAMA combinations (8 h), LABAs (12 h; 72 h for ultra-LABAs), LAMAs (72 h), leukotriene modifiers (7 days), oral xanthine derivatives (7 days), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (4 weeks), and depot corticosteroids (2 months).</p><p>All patients provided written informed consent prior to any study-related procedure. The study was approved by the independent ethics committees at each institution (Supplementary materials) and was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization notes for guidance on Good Clinical Practice (ICH/CPMP/135/95). The study is registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02680197). There were no substantial protocol amendments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The key inclusion criteria were as follows: male or female patients aged &#x02265;40 years, with a diagnosis of COPD, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)&#x02265;40% and &#x02264;70% of the predicted normal value (measured 30&#x02013;45 min after the administration of 80 &#x003bc;g ipratropium via pMDI) and a post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x0003c;0.7. All eligible patients were to have a change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from pre- to post-bronchodilator value of at least 5% at the screening visit and were to be receiving a LABA and/or a LAMA (with or without an ICS) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. All patients receiving ICSs were switched to the equivalent daily dose of fluticasone propionate DPI after they provided informed consent. The ICS regimen was then maintained for the entire run-in period and for the remainder of the study. Current and ex-smokers were eligible.</p><p>The main exclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of asthma or other respiratory disorders (other than COPD) which, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion, may have interfered with data interpretation; a COPD exacerbation or a lower respiratory tract infection within 8 weeks prior to screening; and a history of at least two exacerbations within the 12 months prior to screening. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the &#x0201c;Supplementary materials&#x0201d; section.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Treatments administered were GB 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID (total daily doses of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g) or matched placebo, all via DPI. In each treatment period, patients received one of the five treatments, such that over the three periods each patient received three different treatments. Patients were assigned to treatment sequences through an interactive response technology system using an incomplete balanced block randomization scheme prepared by the contract research organization statistician. Patients, investigators and their staff, monitors and the sponsor&#x02019;s clinical team were all blinded to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The objective of this study was to identify the optimal dose of GB DPI to be further developed for the treatment of patients with COPD. The primary efficacy variable was FEV<sub>1</sub> area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub>) normalized by time on Day 28. Secondary efficacy variables included the following: FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> on Day 1; trough and peak FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC on Days 1 and 28 (trough values were assessed from the mean of the measurements at 11.5 and 12 h post morning dose; peak values used data collected up to 4 h post-dose); morning pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 28 (calculated from the mean of measurements at 45 and 10 min pre-dose); and change from baseline in pre-dose (morning) IC on Day 28. An additional post hoc analysis was performed on the percentage of patients with an increase from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> of at least 100 mL (ie, responders) on Day 28. Safety and tolerability of the study treatments were assessed in terms of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and ECG data.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analyses</title><p>For the primary end point, a total of 140 evaluable patients (14 per sequence) ensured a power of 94% to detect a mean difference of 120 mL (which was prespecified as the minimal important difference) between each dose of GB and placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.0125 (Bonferroni adjustment), assuming a within-patient SD of 160 mL. Estimating a non-evaluable rate of 20%, it was planned to randomize approximately 180 patients. Since there were four primary comparisons (each GB dose vs placebo), the single-step Dunnett procedure was used to control the family-wise type error rate at 0.05 (two-sided). This ensured the required power for each test, since the single-step Dunnett procedure is uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure.</p><p>The primary end point was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment, period and patient as fixed effects and baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> as a covariate. The adjusted mean differences between each GB dose and placebo were calculated with Dunnett&#x02019;s simultaneous 95% CIs and <italic>p</italic>-values. At each dose level, superiority of GB over placebo was demonstrated if the lower limit of the simultaneous CI for the mean difference was higher than 0. The secondary efficacy end points were analyzed using a similar ANCOVA model to the primary end point, with no adjustment for multiplicity. For the FEV<sub>1</sub> responder analysis, the odds ratio was calculated using a conditional logistic regression model with treatment and period as fixed effects, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> as covariate and patient as stratum.</p><p>The primary end point was analyzed in both the intention-to-treat (ITT; primary analysis) and per-protocol (PP) populations. Secondary and post hoc efficacy variables were analyzed in the ITT population only. The ITT population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and with available efficacy data (primary or secondary efficacy variables) in at least two treatment periods. The PP population was defined as all patients from the ITT population without any major protocol deviations (ie, wrong inclusions, poor compliance and non-permitted medications). The safety population comprised all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted between February 2016 and February 2017.

The GB dose that consistently met criteria for the minimally acceptable dose was 25 &#x003bc;g BID. This was the lowest dose to exceed the prespecified 120 mL difference from placebo for FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> on both Day 1 and Day 28, peak FEV<sub>1</sub> on both days, morning pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 28 and trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 1 (missing this threshold by only 3 mL for trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 28). Furthermore, this dose was superior to the two lower doses for trough and peak FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 1 and to the lowest GB dose for trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 28. In addition, in the post hoc FEV<sub>1</sub> responder analysis, GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID was the lowest dose to which &#x0003e;50% of patients responded.</p><p>Dose&#x02013;response to bronchodilators in COPD is typically assessed using FEV<sub>1</sub> analyses. However, given one of the classic features of COPD is hyperinflation, it is also useful to consider the effects of a bronchodilator on measures such as IC. In this study, all the four GB doses provided statistically significant improvements versus placebo in pre-dose IC. The greatest improvement in IC was observed with the two higher GB doses, which provided differences from placebo consistent with those seen previously with tiotropium and aclidinium.<xref rid="b7-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These data therefore provide further support to the selection of 25 &#x003bc;g BID as the minimal effective dose of this formulation of GB. Of note, GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID is also the minimal effective dose for the extrafine pMDI formulation, in terms of both comparisons with placebo and as an add-on to BDP/FF.<xref rid="b2-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In particular, the FEV1 AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> treatment&#x02013;placebo difference for GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID was 143 mL at Day 28 for the DPI formulation in the current study compared with 142 mL at Day 7 for the pMDI formulation.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the previous study, GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID via pMDI was statistically superior to tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g once daily (OD) for pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> after 7 days of dosing.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, the total daily dose of 50 &#x003bc;g is the approved dose for a different GB formulation that is administered OD (although a study of that formulation showed little difference in efficacy when the same daily dose was administered OD or BID).<xref rid="b9-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The current study recruited a broad COPD population, with wide FEV<sub>1</sub> inclusion criteria, and so these results are likely to be representative. Patients were required to have some degree of reversibility to an SAMA, an approach that is consistent with previous dose-ranging studies.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b10-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This perhaps limits the ability to generalize the findings slightly, as does the requirement for all patients to be receiving inhaled long-acting bronchodilator therapy. However, the reversibility requirement was only 5%; given a number of studies have shown that at a population level average reversibility of patients with COPD is at least 10%, this is unlikely to substantially limit the applicability of the population recruited and therefore of the overall findings.<xref rid="b12-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Indeed, nearly two-thirds of the population recruited into UPLIFT (the 4-year trial of tiotropium efficacy and safety) had a 15% improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> following the administration of ipratropium.<xref rid="b14-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We acknowledge that the efficacy of the 50 &#x003bc;g BID dose was consistently numerically greater than that of the 25 &#x003bc;g BID dose, indicating that the range of doses selected did not go sufficiently high to reach the plateau of the dose&#x02013;response curve. Indeed, in a previous study with the pMDI formulation, a single 100 &#x003bc;g dose provided numerically higher efficacy to a single 50 &#x003bc;g dose.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This illustrates one of the challenges of conducting dose-ranging studies &#x02013; what level of efficacy is sufficient (assuming no safety signal is observed). When powering the study, we selected a difference from placebo (120 mL) for the primary end point that was consistent with other previous studies of bronchodilators in COPD.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This value is also within the 100&#x02013;140 mL range proposed by an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force as the minimal important difference for FEV<sub>1</sub>.<xref rid="b15-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Importantly, the GB dose selection was not influenced by the safety findings, with the observed AE, vital signs and ECG results providing reassurance over the safety of this GB formulation. There were few serious or severe AEs (with no relationship between incidence and GB dose), and the percentage of patients experiencing AEs with GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID was lower than with placebo, with no cardiovascular safety signal. Overall, the safety profile of this formulation was consistent with that of the GB component in the BDP/FF/GB fixed-dose combination pMDI formulation, which has demonstrated a good overall safety profile in studies of up to 52 weeks in duration.<xref rid="b16-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-13-1701" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given the need of a broader armamentarium for treating COPD patients with different phenotypes/endotypes, the availability of this GB DPI formulation might facilitate the development of new combinations with different classes of inhaled anti-inflammatory agents, such as with novel phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, this study supports the selection of extrafine GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID as the minimal effective dose for patients with COPD when delivered via the NEXThaler.</p></sec><sec><title>Data sharing statement</title><p>The data from this study are available on request, following submission of a valid research protocol to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Independent ethics committees</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Czech Republic: Etick&#x000e1; komise, Fakultn&#x000ed; nemocnice Kr&#x000e1;lovsk&#x000e9; Vinohrady (FNKV), Praha.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Germany: Ethics commission at the Hesse Regional Medical Council, Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Hessen, Frankfurt; Ethikkommissionen (EK I und EK II) bei der &#x000c4;rztekammer Schleswig-Holstein, 23795 Bad Segeberg; Ethikkommission an der medizinischen Fakult&#x000e4;t der Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms Universit&#x000e4;t Bonn, Bonn; Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Brandenburg, Hauptgesch&#x000e4;ftsstelle Ethikkommission, Cottbus; Ethik-Kommission der Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&#x000e4;t Freiburg, Freiburg.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hungary: Ethics Committee for Clinical Pharmacology (ECCP), Budapest.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Romania: National Bioethics Committee for Medicines and Medical Devices, Antonescu, Bucharest.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with COPD airflow obstruction had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study:
