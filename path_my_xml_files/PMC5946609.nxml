<underline>Aims and Objectives:</underline>
</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to evaluate if an app-based, feedback-controlled active muscle training can be used to improve the early outcome after total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>
<underline>Materials and Methods:</underline>
</title><p>Sixty patients (mean age 67.3 years, range 45 to 84) awaiting primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized into a control- and training group.</p><p>Both Groups followed an identical postoperative protocol. Additionally, the training group performed an appbased, feedback-controlled active muscle training multiple times daily postoperatively.</p><p>Outcome measures were active and passive range of motion, pain at rest and in motion, knee extension strength, the Timed &#x0201c;Up and Go&#x0201d;, 10 Meter Walk Test, 30 Second Chair Stand Test, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS) and inpatient data.</p></sec><sec><title>
<underline>Results:</underline>
</title><p>Mean time to follow-up was 6.88 days in the control group and 6.59 days in the training group for a total of 47 patients (78.3 percent follow-up). The training group used the GenuSport Knietrainer a total of 18.4 times (range 6 to 42 times) on average.</p><p>Active range of motion was 11.4 degrees higher in the training group (p=0.038), while passive range of motion was almost the same (p=0.906).</p><p>Mean pain was significantly lower in the training group both at rest (p=0.01) and in motion (p=0.002).</p><p>The training group reported significantly better outcomes in the KOOS Activities of Daily Living Score (p=0.037). No significant differences were observed in KOOS pain, symptoms, sports and quality of life (p=219, p=0.625, p=0.204, p=0.452, respectively). The KSS Knee Score and KSS Function Score were significantly better in the training group (p&#x0003c;0.001, p=0.011, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>
<underline>Conclusion:</underline>
</title><p>An app-based and feedback-controlled active muscle training can significantly improve the early outcome after total knee arthroplasty, particularly reduce pain and improve the range of motion.</p><p>More training had better effects on the outcome than less training.</p><p>Treatment costs could possibly be reduced. These findings are highly relevant regarding rising expectations from patients and the need to reduce costs in the health care system.</p><p>Further studies with a longer follow up are necessary.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
