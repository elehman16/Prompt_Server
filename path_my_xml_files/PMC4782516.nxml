I-125 brachytherapy, delivering a high radiation dose to a tumor but sparing surrounding normal tissues, is supposed to be ideal modality for the treatment of salivary gland malignancies. We designed a randomised controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy of I-125 permanent brachytherapy (PBT) versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for inoperable salivary gland malignancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this study, inclusion criteria are subjects with inoperable salivary gland malignancies, aged 18&#x02013;80 years, have provided informed consent, with at least one measurable tumor focus, be able to survive &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months, Karnofsky performance status &#x02265;60, have adequate hematopoietic function of bone marrow, have normal liver and kidney function, and are willing to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Exclusion criteria include a history of radiation or chemotherapy, a history of other malignant tumors in the past 5&#x000a0;years, receiving other effective treatments, participating in other clinical trials, with circulatory metastasis, cognitive impairment, severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, acute infection, uncontrolled systemic disease, history of interstitial lungdisease, and being pregnant or breast feeding.</p><p>The study will be conducted as a clinical, prospective, randomised controlled trial with balanced randomisation (1:1). The planned sample size is 90 subjects. Subjects with inoperable salivary gland malignancies are randomised to receive either I-125 PBT or IMRT, with stratification by tumor size and neck lymph node metastasis. Participants in both groups will be followed up at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24&#x000a0;months after randomization. The primary outcome is local control rate of the primary site (based on imaging findings and clinical examination, RECIST criteria) in 1&#x000a0;year. Secondary outcomes are progression-free survival, overall survival, quality of life (QOL) measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&#x00026;N35) of Chinese version, and safety of treatment. Chi-squared test is used to compare the local control rates in both groups. The survival curves are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test is used to test the significant difference.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Only few observational studies have investigated the effect of I-125 PBT on inoperable salivary gland malignancies.

They also contain a diverse group of histologies, with disparate characteristics in terms of aggressiveness and patterns of spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Surgery has historically been the mainstay of treatment for salivary gland malignancies. Subjects with low-grade tumors are usually treated with surgery alone if complete excision can be achieved. Radiotherapy, as a postoperative adjunct to surgery, has traditionally been reserved for subjects with microscopically high-grade tumors, positive margins or nerve invasion. Although carcinomas originating from the salivary glands were previously thought to be radioresistant, the role of adjunct radiotherapy in therapy has become well recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the therapy for inoperable malignant salivary has been extremely challenging in clinical practice: some subjects are either not candidates for definitive resection or undergo limited procedures leaving behind gross residual disease. Typically, these subjects are deemed inoperable because of technical issues related to the extensiveness or location of the primary tumor. Another subset of inoperable subjects present with medical comorbidities that places them at unacceptably high risk for perioperative complications. Lastly, some subjects refuse surgical therapy out of personal preference. For whatever reason, these inoperable subjects have all traditionally been offered definitive radiation therapy as an alternative to surgery. Unfortunately, the reported results following low linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation are poor, with overall local control rates average below 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a multicenter randomised controlled study conducted by the American Radiation Therapy Oncology (RTOG) and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), the 2-year local control rate (LCR) of unresectable salivary gland cancers with conventional external radiotherapy was only 17&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The dose response of biological systems is influenced by the LET of ionizing radiation. In general, relative radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) increases with LET. A number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of high-LET RT such as fast neutron RT. Batterman et al. described an elevated RBE for fast neutrons in the treatment of lung metastases of malignant salivary gland tumors. In this study, the highest RBE values up to 8 were found for ACC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The randomised controlled study conducted by RTOG and MRC showed that the 2-year local control rate was 67&#x000a0;% for fast neutron radiotherapy compared with 17&#x000a0;% for conventional photon radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the indication of fast neutron radiotherapy has been strictly limited because of its unacceptable damage to the surrounding normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In heavy particles radiotherapy, carbon ions have similar radiobiologic properties as neutrons, and higher RBE values can be expected for salivary gland tumors. Compared with neutron RT, carbon ions additionally provide physical selectivity due to an inverse dose profile. Thus, carbon ions was considered to have potentially greater clinical value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Germany, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with carbon ions radiotherapy was recommended as the standard treatment for inoperable salivary gland malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. But carbon ions radiotherapy was expensive and unavailable, which obviously limits its application.</p><p>Brachytherapy is an important modality in the treatment of human malignancy with ionizing radiation. Where applicable, it may be the method of choice for the following reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. First, the localized dose distribution enhances the ratio of tumor dose to surrounding normal tissue dose. Second, the reduction of oxygen enhancement ratio and dose rate may partially circumvent the radioresistance of hypoxic tumor cells. Permanent implants of I-125 sources in focus sites have been widely used, especially for prostatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Because LET increases with decreasing photon energy, I-125 source with low energy photons(average 28&#x000a0;keV) has higher RBE values (approximately 1.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the low photon energy also provides more sparing for adjacent normal tissue and easy resolution of the problem of protecting medical staff from radiation exposure. Some studies have shown that I-125 permanent brachytherapy (PBT) may have potential advantages in local control of salivary gland malignancies and in minimizing radiobiological damage to normal adjacent tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. I-125 has a long half-life of 60&#x000a0;days and may be ineffective in eradicating tumors with fast growth kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The clinical efficacy of I-125 in prostatic cancer may be due to the relative slow proliferative rate of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Like prostatic cancer, many of salivary gland malignancies are characteristically slowly proliferating tumours with long natural histories. Therefore, I-125 is supposed to be ideal modality for the treatment of salivary gland malignancies, as suggested by other nonrandomised clinical trials. In order to obtain more credible evidence, we launch a Phase III, randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy of I-125 PBT versus IMRT for inoperable salivary gland malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and setting</title><p>The study is conducted as a single center, prospective, randomised controlled trial with balanced randomisation (1:1) for subjects who have inoperable malignant salivary gland tumors are randomised to receive either I-125 PBT or IMRT.

The operation of I-125 seed implantation will be conducted at the department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology. I-125 seeds will be ordered from the manufacturer 1&#x02013;2 days before surgical operation. The placement of the I-125 seed was determined from CT scans with the use of a brachytherapy treatment planning system (BTPS; Beijing Atom and High Technique Industries, Beijing, China). The I-125 seed (model 6711; Jaco Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Zhejiang, China) activity was 0.9-1.0U per seed and had a half-life of 59.6&#x000a0;days. Clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as gross tumor volume (GTV) and its surrounding potential sub-clinical focus or microscopic focus, and it is also divided as CTV1 and CTV2. CTV2, namely high risk area, is defined as primary tumor and around 10&#x000a0;mm, as well as drainage regions of involved lymph node. CTV2, namely low risk area, is defined at 5 to 10&#x000a0;mm beyond CTV2 and lymphatic drainage area which should be prevented by irradiation. The prescribed dose is 120&#x000a0;Gy for CTV1 and 140&#x000a0;Gy for CTV2. And it is commonly assumed that irradiation dose can accumulate to prescribed dose in 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>A CT scan is obtained one week after seeds implantation.

A two-sided significance level of 5&#x000a0;% is used. A covariance model will be used to compare the QOL between two groups by adjusting the difference of baseline. The incidence of adverse events between two groups is compared with the chi-square test/Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trail is conducted to prospectively evaluate I-125 PBT for inoperable salivary gland malignancies in terms of the efficacy, safety and the QOL.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the effect of I-125 PBT for inoperable salivary gland malignancies and thus, the evidence regarding I-125 PBT for inoperable salivary gland malignancies is sparse. In recent years, we have been exploring the effectiveness and feasibility of I-125 PBT for inoperable salivary gland malignancies. Our previous studies displayed that I-125 PBT may be one of the most promising treatment for inoperable salivary gland malignancies, but the evidence of these results is not sufficient enough due to limited number of observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The proposed study is a randomised controlled single-centre trial conducted among subjects with inoperable salivary gland malignancies. To our knowledge, it is the first trial to investigate the efficacy of I-125 PBT for subjects with inoperable salivary gland malignancies, and will add to the knowledge base in a number of ways. Not only tumor cells, but also normal cells, are simultaneously killed by radiotherapy. Many side effects are often observed during and after radiotherapy, including lower white blood cell count, general weakness and loss of appetite, mucositis, xerostomia, hearing loss, radiation dermatitis, fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis of the mandible, and injury to optic apparatus. These side effects may lower the QOL of these subjects. In addition to effectiveness, we also investigate safety and QOL. These findings will help to systematically evaluate clinical application value of I-125 PBT.</p><p>We set a comparison treatment as the control arm, which will help us to assess the efficacy of I-125 PBT. We choose IMRT as the control arm because of its fewer side effects. IMRT is more precise radiotherapy modality which helps to reduce normal tissue damages compared with conventional external radiotherapy. Although there was no evidence that IMRT could significantly improve the LCR, many studies had shown that IMRT could significantly reduce toxic side effects when used in the head and neck cancer region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This IMRT comparison arm can help to protect patient and improve compliance.</p><p>On account of the low prevalence, we will recruit patient with relatively inclusive entry criteria, and anticipate recruiting subjects across the spectrum of histologies and from various inoperable circumstances. These features will improve the generalisability of our findings. On the other hand, subjects will constitute a heterogeneous group, and this could weaken the power of our trial. We have taken a number of steps to reduce selection bias. The trial does not include all relevant subjects (e.g., some subjects are excluded, such as with subtotal resection, T1/T2-staged, and metastatic cancer). In addition, subjects are stratified by tumor size (&#x02264;4&#x000a0;cm vs. &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;cm) and neck lymph node metastasis (yes vs. no) to balance random allocation.</p><p>The treatment allocation cannot be blinded for participants and study staffs due to different procedures and the visibility of implanted I-125 seed in CT image, which is of course a limitation. However, to reduce observer bias in assessment, all assessment data are collected by research assistants who did not participate in the study; in addition, the primary outcome (response to treatment) will be evaluated by independent assessment board. Further, all statistical analysis will be done by a statistician at Peking University Clinical Research Institute who is not affiliated with the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proposed study aims to investigate whether subjects with inoperable salivary gland malignancies will benefit from iodine-125 seed permanent brachytherapy.
