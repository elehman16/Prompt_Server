Increased maternal pregravid insulin resistance (IR) accompanied by insufficient insulin response worsens during pregnancy and becomes obvious as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Thus, chronic IR is a basic component of the pathophysiology of GDM.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] GDM will end to development of type 2 diabetes in the mother and increased risk for obesity and glucose intolerance in the offspring.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies explained the role of IR in progress of hepatic lipogenesis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Furthermore, women with IR were more likely to develop preeclampsia[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] On the other hand, alterations in blood glucose levels mediated through enhanced insulin may trigger obstetric complications.</p><p>Studies indicate that nutrition significantly impact IR.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In nonpregnancy state, weight loss reduces insulin levels, whereas weight gain increases the concentrations.

Fifteen Community Health Centers, five hospitals, and fifteen obstetrical offices were selected (stratified sampling).

Randomization occurred in consecutive order at the time of enrollment.</p><p>After providing written consent, the willing participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to intervention or control group in consecutive order at the time of enrollment. Randomization was performed using computer-generated codes contained in sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes by a responsible person who had no other involvement in the study. Pregnant mothers were randomized by opening the envelopes consecutively until the required sample size was achieved.</p><p>Participants took part in the previously planned prenatal visits with physicians and midwives. In addition, women in the intervention group received present intervention while women in control group received routine education by midwives and physicians. Midwives and physicians were blinded to subject randomization and educational content to prevent contamination.</p><p>Diagnosis of GDM was carried out based on the criteria of American Diabetes Association.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Fasting blood samples (5 mL) were taken in the early morning at Al-Zahra Clinical Laboratory. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were quantified by the use of Mindray bs-800 automatic biochemical analyzer with Bionik kits. Fasting insulin concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with commercially available kits (COBAS 311, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). IR was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculator software.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Board for Health Sciences at the Public Health College of Shahid Sadoughi Of Medical Sciences (4326) and Vice of Research and Technology of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences [294048].</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study instrument</title><p>Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire which was completed through interviews with pregnant women and prenatal care-related records considering demographic and reproductive characteristics.

Each woman met with the study nutritionist at the time of enrollment for baseline assessment and counseling. FPG and fasting insulin were measured at the 12<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy.</p><p>The first session was about the importance of healthy nutrition for pregnant mothers and the benefits of instructed points. One booklet,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which included the recommended points and the benefits of them, the barriers to implementation, and the ways to overcome these barriers during pregnancy, was given to each of the participants in the experimental group. Instructed points included following components: (i) varied and balanced dietary pattern based on food groups containing grains, vegetables, fruit, milk, and meat expressed as servings/day; (ii) weight gaining according IOM recommendations;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and (iii) healthy eating including as low as consumption of fried foods, junk foods, and unhealthy snacks as the most competing preferences to healthy nutrition.</p><p>Our intervention goals to prevent excessive gestational weight gain were (i) to determine the total energy intake based on primitive dietary assessment in accordance to 72-h dietary recall; (ii) to provide 50%&#x02013;55% of total energy intake from total carbohydrate intake. We emphasized on complex carbohydrate intake which should be divided into main meals and snacks (three to four) during the day; (iii) to allocate the total fat intake to 25%&#x02013;30% of total energy intake.</p><p>On a monthly basis, each participant was requested to record her daily dietary food portions on a form and keep this record with herself for use in future sessions. These data and responses to questions about the leaflet's points were used to examine the participants&#x02019; obedience and necessary adjustments as needed. Except the first session, pregnant mothers were divided into small groups (3&#x02013;4 persons) to discuss with each other about educated points.</p><p>Again at 34&#x02013;36 weeks of gestation, a consecutive 3-d food intake record was collected and analyzed to assess the effect of intervention.

The proportion of carbohydrate/fat in their diet was low, too. However, the maternal weight gain and birth size attenuated noticeably.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In one study, the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet decreased plasma glucose concentrations, serum insulin levels, and HOMA-IR score in pregnant mothers with GDM.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, the effect of diets or nutrient intakes on IR in nonpregnancy state was mediated by weight control[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or irrespective of weight management.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Thus, prevention of IR by nutrition education could be regarded for pregnant mothers.</p><p>Our results showed that mean values of FPG after intervention did not decrease while the incidence of GDM was 1.3% compared to 7.7% in control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07).

This finding is consistent with Wolff <italic>et al</italic>. who reported that the fat energy decreased in the intervention group while the protein energy percent of the diet increased and insulin secretions decreased consequently.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] They restricted percentage of energy intake from carbohydrate in obese women, but we individualized energy intake in women with varying BMIs. Hence, we did not observe significantly different in carbohydrate intake between two groups.</p><p>Our result showed that fiber intake increased significantly in interventional group while carbohydrate intake did not change between two groups. Coherently, Fraser <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that insulin sensitivity decreased on a diet contained 40% of energy from carbohydrate and 10 g dietary fiber. Insulin sensitivity in their survey did not decrease in diets with 40% of energy as carbohydrate and 52 g dietary fiber or 60% of energy from carbohydrate and 84 g dietary fiber.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Carbohydrate intake in our intervention group increased compared with baseline values while in control group, there was not any significant change in carbohydrate intake. However, HOMA-IR score in intervention group was lesser compared to control. Of course, our participants&#x02019; energy intake was near pregnancy goals. Similarly, one study suggests that pregnant mothers who consume a diet with lesser than 30% fat and further than 50% carbohydrate as they increase their energy intake will reduce the risk of GDM.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, further studies are needed about this result. Furthermore, higher intake of carbohydrate in our trial is because of higher intake of complex carbohydrates which have been shown with higher fiber intakes in the intervention group.
