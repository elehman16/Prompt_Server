H pylori was eradicated in 6 of 19 patients in the OAM group (32%); 8 of 18 in the RAM group (44%), 4 of 15 in the OC group (27%); none of 18 in the OP group (0%). [&#x0003c; P0.005 for OAM, RAM, OC vs OP; P = N.S. between OAM, RAM, OC]. Overall metronidazole resistance was unexpectedly high at 58%. Eradication rates in metronidazole sensitive patients were 71% (5/7) and 100% (3/3) for OAM and RAM respectively. In conclusion, H pylori eradication rates using high dose ranitidine plus amoxycillin and metronidazole may be similar to that of low dose omeprazole in combination with the same antibiotics for omeprazole with clarithromycin. Overall eradication rates were low due to a high incidence of metronidazole resistance but were higher in metronidazole-sensitive patients. Even high dose ranitidine with two antibiotics achieves a relatively low eradication rate. These metronidazole-based regimens cannot be recommended in areas with a high incidence of metronidazole resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="131" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="132" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="133" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="134" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="135" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00066-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="136" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
