Bile acids (BAs) have been proposed as potential pruritogens in PBC. The ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) protein expressed in the distal ileum plays a key role in the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Pharmacological inhibition of IBAT with GSK2330672 may reduce BA levels in the systemic circulation and improve pruritus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This clinical study (BAT117213 study) is sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with associated exploratory studies supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). It is a phase 2a, multi-centre, randomised, double bind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial for PBC patients with pruritus. The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK2330672, and explore whether GSK2330672 administration for 14&#x000a0;days improves pruritus compared with placebo. The key outcomes include improvement in pruritus scores evaluated on a numerical rating scale and other PBC symptoms in an electronic diary completed twice daily by the patients. The secondary outcomes include the evaluation of the effect of GSK2330672 on total serum bile acid (BA) concentrations, serum markers of BA synthesis and steady-state pharmacokinetics of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>BAT117213 study is the first randomised controlled crossover trial of ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, a novel class of drug to treat pruritus in PBC. The main strengths of the trial are utility of a novel, study specific, electronic symptom diary as patient reported outcome to measure the treatment response objectively and the crossover design that allows estimating the treatment effect in a smaller number of patients. The outcome of this trial will inform the trial design of future development phase of the IBAT inhibitor drug. The trial will also provide opportunity to conduct metabonomic and gut microbiome studies as explorative and mechanistic research in patients with cholestatic pruritus.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>EudraCT number: 2012-005531-84, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01899703?term=GSK2330672&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01899703</ext-link>, registered on 3<sup>rd</sup> July 2013</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pruritus</kwd><kwd>Primary biliary cholangitis</kwd><kwd>PBC</kwd><kwd>Ileal bile acid transporter</kwd><kwd>IBAT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic cholestatic liver disease with a prevalence of 30/100,000, typically affecting middle aged women (female: male ratio 10:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In untreated cases immunologically mediated chronic cholestasis ultimately results in liver cirrhosis with associated complications such as portal hypertension, varices, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. The precise aetiology of PBC is unclear, although genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a key role.</p><p>Pruritus (itch) is one of the characteristic symptoms of PBC and can affect patients at any stage of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, we studied the scale of the pruritus symptom within the United Kingdom (UK)-PBC cohort, a national cohort of over 3000 PBC patients recruited from every hospital in the UK. In this cohort 60&#x02013;70 % of PBC patients reported experience of pruritus at some point in the course of the disease, 30 % had persistent pruritus and 15 % suffered with severe pruritus since the diagnosis of PBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A similar scale of symptom burden has also been reported in PBC cohorts from USA and Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pruritus has a negative impact on perceived quality of life in PBC patients and has been associated with sleep deprivation, worsened day time fatigue and when severe, may lead to depression and suicidal tendencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the current standard of care for PBC patients and the only licenced therapy for PBC has no role in treating pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current treatment of pruritus in PBC involves step-wise use of specific anti-pruritic agents in line with current international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These drugs include cholestyramine, rifampicin, naltrexone and sertraline. Of these, cholestyramine is the only licensed drug for treatment of cholestatic pruritus and use of other drugs is &#x0201c;off-label&#x0201d;. The limitations of these drugs are that their efficacy is not universal, treatment is often associated with side effects and there is a need for regular monitoring for liver toxicity. Patients with medically refractory pruritus may either need to undergo phototherapy, invasive interventions such as nasobiliary drainage or extracorporeal albumin dialysis for temporary relief of pruritus, or may be considered for liver transplantation (LT) which is typically curative. Therefore, development of better drug therapies with fewer side effects is an unmet clinical need for PBC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT)</title><p>Primary BAs are synthesized in the liver from an enzymatic catabolism of cholesterol, a process regulated by enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 7A1. Unconjugated BAs are conjugated in hepatocytes with glycine and taurine, secreted into the bile and stored in the gallbladder. Upon ingestion of a meal, conjugated BAs (&#x0201c;bile salts&#x0201d;) are released into the intestinal lumen where they facilitate absorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins. After their normal physiological function is completed in the intestine, BAs reach the ileum where they are reabsorbed. The ileal bile acid transporter [(IBAT), also called apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT)], is a protein predominantly located in the terminal ileum and serves as the main transporter mediating the ileal uptake of conjugated BAs and their return to the liver via the portal circulation (enterohepatic circulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Bile salts (and their protonated form, BAs) have been suggested to play role in the pathogenesis of pruritus in cholestatic conditions. In cholestasis, the ileal uptake of BAs has been shown to be upregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also, the evidence that pruritus dramatically improves in patients undergoing nasobiliary drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and is effectively cured by LT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] suggests a direct or indirect role for BAs in mediating cholestatic pruritus. Therefore a pharmaceutical agent that can reduce their levels in the enterohepatic and systemic circulations may be predicted to improve pruritus. In two animal studies treatment with IBAT inhibitors SC-435 and A4250 produced BA malabsorption and attenuated BA-mediated cholestatic liver injury by reducing biliary BA output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In humans, use of IBAT inhibitor A4250 has been shown to decrease the serum BAs and increase faecal BAs by highly efficient interruption of their enterohepatic circulation with no serious adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>GSK2330672</title><p>GSK2330672 is a selective inhibitor of human IBAT and it is designed to be a non-absorbable agent restricted to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GSK2330672 is expected to block the uptake of BAs in the terminal ileum, increase their excretion in the faeces and decrease the amount of BAs returning to the liver via enterohepatic circulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore treatment of PBC patients with oral GSK2330672 is postulated to reduce concentrations of BAs in the systemic circulation and in turn improve pruritus.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mechanism of IBAT (ASBT) inhibitor drug. GSK2330672 interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by selectively inhibiting the IBAT protein located in the terminal ileum, thereby reducing the levels of bile acids in the systemic circulation.

Any PBC patient interested in participating in the study could contact the study team at the centre nearest to their location either directly or via referral from local primary or secondary care physicians. The UK-PBC platform was utilised for recruitment using a similar approach to the to the RIT-PBC trial reported recently by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The established UK-PBC database was screened for patients with PBC-40 itch domain scores meeting the definitions of persistent and/or severe pruritus. The clinicians looking after these patients were contacted to approach the patients and interested patients were referred to their local recruiting centre. All participants gave their written consent to participation before screening investigations were performed. Participants completed the consent process with study investigators trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and assessment of capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation</title><p>All eligible subjects enrolled in the study were randomised to either Sequence 1 or Sequence 2 to receive oral placebo or GSK2330672 for a 14-day period in a cross-over fashion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Sequence 1 was GSK2330672 for 14&#x000a0;days followed by placebo for 14&#x000a0;days and Sequence 2 was placebo for 14&#x000a0;days followed by GSK2330672 for 14&#x000a0;days. Randomisation was carried out via a dedicated electronic system for randomisation-RAMOS (Randomisation and Medication Ordering System) by generating a unique randomisation number for each participant that linked to the corresponding allocated sequence of study drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study treatment</title><p>The investigational medicinal product used in this study was GSK2330672. The control intervention was placebo. Both GSK233072 and placebo were manufactured at a dedicated manufacturing unit in London (UK) and dispensed as 30&#x000a0;g aliquots of oral solution into amber glass bottles for distribution to participating study centres. The study centres supplied solutions to subjects in accordance with the randomization schedule. Subjects consumed the entire quantity of one or two bottles of study drug twice daily followed by two 50&#x000a0;mL rinses of water. All patients started the study with 14-days placebo run in period followed by 14-days treatment with GSK2330672 or placebo in a cross over fashion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Dose escalation and stopping criteria</title><p>The initial dose of GSK2330672 was 45&#x000a0;mg and all patients were asked to increase the dose to 90&#x000a0;mg on day 4. If this was not tolerated, they were asked to continue at 45&#x000a0;mg and attempt a dose increase again two days later. If 90&#x000a0;mg could not be tolerated by the end of day 7, subjects were asked to continue only 45&#x000a0;mg.</p><p>Following stopping criteria were in place to assure subject safety: 1) to stop the study treatment if the stopping criteria for liver chemistry were met [ALT &#x0003e;5-8 x upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5-2 x ULN], and 2) to withdraw the subject from the study if corrected QT (QTc) interval withdrawal criteria were met based on their average values on triplicate ECGs separated by five minutes. These were QTc&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;msec, or uncorrected QT &#x0003e;600&#x000a0;msec, or QTc &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;msec change from baseline). If a subject met the stopping criteria, appropriate safety follow-up assessments and procedures were completed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Concomitant medications</title><p>Before starting the study, all patients were advised to stop using their usual anti-pruritic agents including cholestyramine, colesevelam, rifampicin, naltrexone, sertraline, gabapentin and anti-histamines. The use of these medications was prohibited during the study period until the final follow-up period when rescue medications were permitted. Application of topical agents used to relieve pruritus was permitted during the study only if agents did not contain active ingredients in the list of prohibited agents and with prior agreement of the clinical investigator. Subjects were asked to abstain from taking new prescription or new non-prescription drugs (including vitamins and dietary or herbal supplements), from the start of the placebo run-in period until completion of the follow-up visit. The use of UDCA was permitted and patients who were on UDCA were standardised to receive Ursofalk&#x000ae;(Dr. Falk Pharma UK Ltd) once daily preparation at dose 13&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg/kg/day and instructed to take it at bed time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Patient reported outcomes</title><p>Existing patient reported outcome (PRO) measures to assess the impact of PBC symptoms include the PBC-40, a widely acceptable, validated, disease-specific questionnaire and the 5-D Itch scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, for this study a more specific PRO measure was needed that could detect the severity and variability of pruritus and other PBC symptoms and potential treatment effects on a daily basis with a short recall period. The development of such a measure began with interviews with PBC patients to identify additional characteristics of pruritus and other symptoms and their impact on sleep and daily activities. With input from PBC patients and PRO experts a new electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) diary was developed to assess the severity of the pruritus and other PBC symptoms. Subjects completed the ePRO diary every morning and evening before dosing the study drug. In the ePRO diary pruritus severity was rated using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Psychometric testing to support the validity and reliability of the ePRO will be evaluated with data from the current clinical study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This trial is designed to estimate the effect of study drug GSK2330672 relative to placebo when co-administered with UDCA on pruritus symptom, markers of efficacy and disease progression and the PK of UDCA. No formal hypothesis will be tested.</p><p>The efficacy endpoint in this study is the patient reported rating of pruritus severity scores. Pruritus will be measured in three different PROs: pruritus NRS using the ePRO, the 5-D itch scale and the PBC-40 questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Changes in pruritus NRS will be used as the key measure of the efficacy endpoint and will be analysed using a mixed effects model with fixed effect terms for treatment period and sequence to examine differences between GSK2330672 and placebo. Subject will be treated as a random effect in the model. Point estimates and their associated 95 % confidence interval (CI) will be constructed for the mean differences in pruritus severity scores.</p><p>Data from subjects that are co-administered UDCA as part of their standard care will be analysed similarly for PK endpoints. Following log-transformation, maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), AUC (0&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h) and AUC (12&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) of UDCA and glycine and taurine conjugated metabolites of UDCA (TUDCA and GUDCA) will be separately analysed. This will be done using a mixed effects model with fixed effect terms for treatment period and sequence to examine differences between UDCA administration with and without GSK2330672. Point estimates and corresponding 90 % CI will also be constructed for the difference and/or ratio between the mean of the test treatment (UDCA plus GSK2330672) and the mean of the reference treatment (UDCA alone).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample size</title><p>The efficacy endpoint in this study is pruritus score and the sample size for efficacy endpoint is based on the pruritus 0 to 10 points scale. On this scale the average effect of rifampicin is 1.62 points and the reported pooled total standard deviations of various anti-pruritic drugs ranges from 1.22 to 3.84 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Assuming that GSK2330672 is at least as effective as rifampicin, a sample size of 40 will result in a reasonable power (&#x0003e;90 %) if the standard deviation (SD) is 3.1 points or less. For estimation of relative bioavailability 20 subjects taking UDCA are required to ensure that the resultant 90 % CI of the ratio will be within 0.8 and 1.25 assuming that the true ratio is 1 and the SD on the log10 scale is less than 0.25.</p><p>An initial sample-size of 40 subjects was selected based on considerations of both efficacy and PK endpoints. However, due to the uncertainty around sample-size assumptions a series of interim analyses for futility and possible sample-size re-estimation were carried out at regular intervals. Data from completed patients were reviewed by an unblinded review committee (composed of GSK personnel not directly involved in study conduct). As the probability of demonstrating sufficient difference was high, the sponsor revised the sample-size from 40 to 22. No other changes to study conduct were planned as a result of the interim analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conduct of the trial</title><p>The conduct of the trial followed the principles outlined in the NHS research governance framework for health and social care, GCP and the guiding principles of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. The trial involved the participant visiting the study centre a total of six times including screening visit, day 1 visit, three consecutive fortnightly in-patient stays (each up to 36&#x000a0;h) and a follow up visit. The schedule of study procedures during these visits and data collection is summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.</p><p>Protocol deviation or exemptions were not allowed with the exception of immediate safety concerns. All Investigators at recruiting sites followed standard operative procedures for collection, handling, processing and storage of samples (blood, urine and stool) collected at study visits. All clinical and non-clinical subject data including medical history (to capture co-morbidities and concomitant medications) and physical examinations were entered into electronic case report forms (eCRFs). No patient identifiable information was entered in the eCRFs. All participants were allocated a unique study identifier which was used on eCRFs transmitted electronically to the sponsor and combined with data provided from other sources in a validated data system.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>BAT117213 study: schedule of procedures and data collection</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Period description</th><th>Screening</th><th colspan="4">Placebo run-in</th><th colspan="4">Treatment period 1</th><th colspan="4">Treatment period 2</th><th colspan="4">Follow-up<sup>f</sup>

A second interim analysis of the data from 19 patients was performed in July 2015 and the sponsor decided to reduce the total sample size to 22 patients. The recruitment ended in October 2015 with all 22 patients randomised from two trial sites (Newcastle 13; Birmingham 9). The treatment follow-up of participants was completed in December 2015.

The four main classes of drugs that are recommended by current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] include bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine), enzyme inducers (rifampicin), opioid antagonists (naltrexone) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (sertraline). These drugs are limited by their lack of universal efficacy, poor compliance (especially cholestyramine) and the need for regular monitoring for liver toxicity (rifampicin). Cholestyramine and rifampicin have good reports but clinical experience of both naltrexone and sertraline has been disappointing for many clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A critical review of literature shows that the strength of evidence for current anti-pruritic drug therapy is poor. Cholestyramine, the current first-line therapy was last studied over five decades ago but has never been subjected to randomised placebo-controlled trials and has evidence category II-2 (cohort or case control analytical studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Only rifampicin and naltrexone have been studied in controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and sertraline (evidence category II-2) is the last agent investigated with a positive outcome on pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A number of other drugs have been investigated but with little success and more recently both gabapentin (2006) and colesevelam (2010) trials failed to show any therapeutic benefit in cholestatic pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>IBAT2330672 trial</title><p>The apparent lack of novel drug development in cholestatic pruritus can be attributed partly to incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease. More recent advances in molecular research have identified novel targets for drug development in cholestasis. IBAT inhibitors are novel class of drugs with therapeutic potential in cholestasis. They have been shown be beneficial in cholestasis by the experimental studies and their desired effects on serum and faecal bile acid profile has been proven in healthy people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The BAT117213 study is the first phase 2 multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of IBAT inhibitor in PBC patients with pruritus. Unlike the only other phase 2 trial of an IBAT inhibitor drug (LUM001) in PBC (CLARITY study, NCT01904058), the main strength of the BAT117213 study is its crossover design which allows estimating the treatment effect in a smaller number of patients and reduces the between-patient variability and yields a more efficient comparison of treatments than a similar sized parallel group trial. In the BAT117213 study every patient will receive both the study drug and the placebo; therefore each patient will serve as his/her own matched control.</p><p>An additional strength of this trial is the utility of patient reported outcomes to measure the treatment response objectively using existing validated tools including the PBC-40 questionnaire and 5-D itch scale as well as a novel, easy-to-use electronic symptom diary. The latter has been specifically developed for this study and it contains morning and evening diaries with questions on itch, fatigue and concentration to comprehensively capture the severity of the symptoms over the preceding 12&#x000a0;h. In addition, the exit interviews conducted at the end of the study provide the opportunity for patients to express their experiences in the study in a semi-structured method that may not have been detected with the more structured patient reported outcomes measures.</p><p>The BAT117213 study also provides a unique opportunity to conduct novel, explorative, mechanistic research in patients with cholestatic pruritus. Serum and urine samples obtained during the study will be used to study the metabolic phenotype (metabonomics) of pruritus in PBC by using <sup>1</sup>H (proton)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly, using the faecal samples from study patients gut-microbiome studies will be undertaken to study the association between gut microbiota composition and pruritus in PBC. Results of these metabonomic and microbiomic studies are likely to provide more insight into the biology of pruritus in PBC and may identify potential biomarkers for cholestatic pruritus.</p><p>The main drawback of this trial is the potential carryover effect (i.e. effect of the treatment from the previous time period may &#x0201c;carry over&#x0201d; on the response to subsequent period) and lack of &#x0201c;washout period&#x0201d; between treatment periods. Carryover effect is a common problem inherent to the cross over study design and may potentially confound direct estimates of treatment effect. Therefore the statistical analysis the data will be assessed for any evidence of carry over and appropriate sensitivity analyses will be performed. To mitigate against the lack of &#x0201c;washout period&#x0201d; the outcome measurements will be restricted to the latter part of each treatment period.</p><p>In summary, BAT117213 study is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a unique class of drug in treating pruritus in PBC patients and provide novel information about bile acids and metabolic changes and gut microbiome profile in cholestatic pruritus. The results from this trial will inform the trial design of future development phase of the IBAT inhibitor drug.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABPI, association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry; AE, adverse event; ALT: alanine transaminase; ASBT, apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter; AUC, area under the curve; BA, bile acid; C4, 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one; CI, confidence interval; CYP, cytochrome P450; ECG, electrocardiogram; eCRF, electronic case report form; ePRO, electronic patient reported outcome; GCP, good clinical practice; GI, gastrointestinal; GSK, GlaxoSmithKline; GUDCA, glyco ursodeoxycholic acid; IBAT, Ileal bile acid transporter; LT, liver transplantation; MS, mass spectrometry; NHS, National Health Service (of the UK); NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NRS, numerical rating scale; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis (previously cirrhosis); PGX, pharmacogenetics; PK, pharmacokinetics; PRO, patient reported outcome; RAMOS, randomisation and medication ordering system; RCT, randomised controlled trial; SAE, serious adverse event; SD, standard deviation; TUDCA, tauro ursodeoxycholic acid; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; ULN, upper limit of normal.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the subjects for participating in this clinical trial and the NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre for supporting the exploratory studies associated with this clinical trial.
