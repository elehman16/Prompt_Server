Moreover, it is involved in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of several disorders and diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and aging.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Lipid peroxidation forms reactive aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA). Assessing the end products of lipid peroxidation is considered as one of the best assays for oxidative damage.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In animal models, caloric restriction (CR) and experimental fasting have been shown to increase life span and benefit cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Although the exact mechanisms underlying these fasting-conferred health benefits are unknown, reduced oxidative stress has been proposed as a potential mechanism.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The few studies that have assessed correlations between oxidative stress and CR or experimental fasting have reported inconsistent results.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] <italic>Ramadan</italic> fasting is a distinctive model for long-term intermittent fasting (IF) that is accompanied by several lifestyle changes, including alterations in meal times and frequency, caloric content and composition, sleep/wake patterns, circadian rhythm patterns, and physical activity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, results from experimental fasting cannot be generalized to <italic>Ramadan</italic> IF.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies that have assessed oxidative stress during <italic>Ramadan</italic> are limited and reported conflicting results.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Sleep duration, exercise, and meal composition have been reported to influence reactive oxygen species.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Few studies have addressed the effect of prolonged IF during <italic>Ramadan</italic> on oxidative stress.

In addition, all previous studies collected a single blood sample to assess oxidative stress. Because oxidant concentration levels can be affected by the time of day that the samples are taken and by the relationship between these times and meal times[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and because meal times change during <italic>Ramadan</italic>, the timing of the sample collection may have influenced oxidant measurements in previous studies.

Therefore, we conducted this study to examine the effects of intermittent Islamic IF on circadian alternations in the lipid peroxidation marker MDA during and outside <italic>Ramadan</italic> while controlling for several confounders.

An increase in free radicals stimulates MDA production. MDA reacts with TBA in the presence of acid and heat to form a red pigment that has a peak absorbance (l) of 530 nm. Blood samples were collected via an intravenous cannula in the antecubital vein at 22:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, and 11:00. Samples were immediately centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C, and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. Reagents were acquired from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). Tetramethoxypropane was used to produce MDA to get a standard curve in the range of 0.1 &#x000b5;M to 5.0 &#x003bc;M. Blood serum (200 &#x003bc;l) was mixed with 5 mM butylated hydroxytoluene (25 &#x003bc;l), 0.2 M phosphoric acid (200 &#x003bc;l, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and 0.11 M TBA (25 &#x003bc;l). The mixture was kept at 90&#x000b0;C for 45 min and then briefly put in ice to stop the reaction. MDA extraction was done by adding n-butanol (500 &#x003bc;l). Absorption was then measured in a 96-well plate reader (Spectra Microplate Autoreader, Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) at 530 nm and 570 nm.

Although the fasting period during <italic>Ramadan</italic> was longer, there were no significant changes in the MDA levels.</p><p>Previous studies that aimed to assess oxidative stress during <italic>Ramadan</italic> fasting reported conflicting results. Moreover, those studies did not control for confounders that may affect oxidative stress such as sleep duration, physical activity, and meal composition. In a sample of healthy volunteers during <italic>Ramadan</italic> fasting, Faris <italic>et al</italic>. assessed oxidative stress using urinary 15-F12-Isoprostane.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This study showed that increased body weight during <italic>Ramadan</italic> was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Interestingly, the study also showed that volunteers who lost weight had reduced levels of 15-F12-Isoprostane.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The above findings stress the importance of controlling for weight changes in oxidative stress measurements during IF. In another study, Ibrahim <italic>et al</italic>. observed no changes in serum MDA levels during <italic>Ramadan</italic> fasting.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, they observed a reduction in MDA concentration in red blood cells (RBCs).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The reason for this discrepancy between serum MDA and RBCs MDA is unclear.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The influence of the dietary fat changes on the fatty acid composition of plasma lipids and RBCs fatty acids is well documented.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, the fatty acid composition of plasma may not reflect the long-term nutritional status of dietary fats because of fast turnover and directional flux of various lipoproteins.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, RBCs fatty acid composition might be a better indicator of long-term dietary fatty acid intake than plasma lipid fatty acid composition, as RBC fatty acids do not change rapidly after dietary manipulations.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This may explain the differences between lipid peroxidation between plasma and RCBs lipids. In a third study, Ozturk <italic>et al</italic>. assessed oxidative stress among pregnant women and demonstrated that <italic>Ramadan</italic> fasting has no effect on oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The above studies contradict Al-Shafei, who reported a significant reduction in serum MDA among healthy volunteers and diabetic and hypertensive patients during <italic>Ramadan</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, Al-Shafie did not report the participants&#x02019; weights before and during <italic>Ramadan</italic>. Weight reduction during fasting has been shown to reduce oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition, the investigators collected only a single early morning blood sample;[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] the timing of blood collection may have confounded the reported results. Comparing an early morning, overnight-fasted pre-<italic>Ramadan</italic> sample to blood collected after Suhur meal during <italic>Ramadan</italic> may have impacted the MDA measurements. During fasting, there is a greater tendency to utilize fat rather than glucose as a source of energy,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which results in higher fat oxidation.</p><p>Failure to control for potential confounders that may affect MDA levels, including meal composition, physical activity, sleep duration, fasting duration, smoking status, and medication use, may account for the inconsistencies between the different studies. Further research will be necessary to control for all potential confounders.</p><p>The current study has some limitations. The number of recruited volunteers is relatively low. Note that this limitation is inherent to experimental studies that use objective assessments in the laboratory under controlled conditions within a short specified period.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In addition, this type of studies is costly and a pilot study such as this is needed to convince funding agencies to fund a larger study.
