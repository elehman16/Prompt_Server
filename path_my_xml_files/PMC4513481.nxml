Patients who do not respond adequately depend on the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, but these may have serious side effects. Clinical observations suggest that ephedrine can diminish, postpone or even prevent the need for immunosuppressive therapy when added to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or low-dose prednisone. In the Netherlands, ephedrine is not licensed for MG nor is reimbursement guaranteed. MG is a rare condition, and ephedrine might be indicated only in a subset of patients. Thus, randomised controlled trials comparing large groups are difficult to conduct. We, therefore, aim to aggregate data from a small series of n-of-1 trials&#x000a0;(also known as <italic>single patient trials</italic>) to assess the effect of ephedrine as add-on treatment for MG.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, multiple crossover n-of-1 studies in 4 adult patients with generalised MG who show inadequate improvement on pyridostigmine and/or immunosuppressive drugs.

MG is a rare disorder, with a prevalence of about 78 per million<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> and an incidence of 4&#x02013;6 per million.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Clinically, MG is characterised by fluctuating muscle weakness in various muscle groups and fatigability, often resulting in marked impairment in activities of daily living (ADL). Muscle weakness and fatigability are often more pronounced at the end of the day, after exercise, during warm weather or during illness.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>Many patients respond well to first-line treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), such as pyridostigmine, which inhibit the activity of the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and thus, enhances neuromuscular transmission.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This treatment is well tolerated by most patients. If symptoms can no longer be controlled with AChEIs, the second step in MG treatment consists of immunosuppression with high doses of corticosteroids (prednisone), azathioprine, or other immunosuppressant agents;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> however, these can give rise to moderate or serious side effects.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence and our clinical observations suggest that some patients with MG can avoid high-dose immunosuppressive treatment by using ephedrine as add-on treatment to AChEIs or low doses of prednisone. Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts on the adrenergic receptors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Its mechanism of action in MG has been investigated,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> but is not well understood.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> One study showed that ephedrine increases the quantal content of the endplate potential as well as the probability of quantal release of acetylcholine in an in vitro canine model, but only at concentrations that would not be reached in patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Another study suggested that ephedrine improves neuromuscular transmission by stimulating &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors and stabilising the structure of the neuromuscular junction.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Clinically, the onset of the effect is usually seen within hours to days, although some studies in congenital MG suggest that it may take weeks to months before the full effect is reached in some patients.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The effects of ephedrine in patients with MG have not been studied extensively,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> but it appears to be well tolerated (personal observations by JJGMV). Side effects consist of adrenergic effects, such as palpitations, restlessness, insomnia, headache and nausea, which are most likely dose dependent.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Rationale for the trial</title><p>Although anecdotal evidence<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> and our clinical observations suggest that some patients with MG may benefit from ephedrine, a recent Cochrane systematic review showed that its effects have never been formally assessed in randomised controlled, clinical trials (RCTs).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This lack of evidence hinders market approval of ephedrine for MG and may also hinder its reimbursement.</p><p>MG is a rare disease, and there are only a small number of patients who might benefit from add-on treatment with ephedrine. It is, therefore, difficult to conduct group-RCTs to determine its effectiveness. <italic>N-of-1 trials</italic> (also known as <italic>single patient trials</italic> or <italic>n-of-1 RCTs</italic>) may provide a way of gathering scientifically robust evidence of effectiveness in small patient groups. N-of-1 trials are randomised, controlled, multiple crossover trials in single patients, in which data are contributed over several treatment cycles. Evidence from several n-of-1 trials can be aggregated to produce population treatment effect estimates.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Given the multiple crossover character of n-of-1 trials (ie, each patient acts as their own control and contributes multiple cycles of data), the number of patients needed in n-of-1 trials (ie, sample size) to estimate the population treatment effect is much reduced compared with group-RCTs<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and thus makes this type of trial very suitable to conduct research in small patient populations.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p>We aim to conduct a series of n-of-1 trials to obtain scientifically robust (&#x02018;level 1&#x02019;) evidence<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> of benefits and harms of add-on treatment with ephedrine for autoimmune MG, followed by an optional open-label extension phase for patients who decide to continue treatment with ephedrine. The primary endpoint is the study population treatment effect of ephedrine compared with placebo on muscle strength and endurance, as measured by the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score, when ephedrine is added to regular treatment with pyridostigmine, either alone or in combination with stable low-dose prednisone or immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p>Key secondary objectives include:

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The current series of trials is part of a project which aims to create more knowledge about the suitability of n-of-1 trials for regulatory decisions such as reimbursement and marketing authorisation. Regulatory and patient stakeholders were, therefore, consulted on the design of the protocol, and both will contribute to dissemination of trial results (see &#x02018;Dissemination of results&#x02019; and &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; sections).</p><p>In addition, theoretical and actual benefits and burdens for n-of-1 trial participants have been described for more common disorders such as osteoarthritis and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;36</xref> This study will explore whether benefits and burdens of n-of-1 trials conducted for rare diseases (where there are often fewer treatment options available) are similar to those for more common diseases. The experiences of physicians and pharmacists involved in the trial will be compared with experiences of their counterparts in a routine n-of-1 trial service in Australia.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and duration</title><p>The study consists of a small series of n-of-1 trials followed by an optional open-label extension phase. Each n-of-1 trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled, physician-blinded and patient-blinded, multiple crossover trial in a single patient. The n-of-1 trials will consist of three cycles of 2&#x02005;weeks duration, each consisting of one period of ephedrine treatment and one period of placebo treatment. The order of the treatment periods will be randomised. This 6-week multiple crossover phase will be followed by a 4-week evaluation phase, during which data analysis of the multiple crossover phase, feedback of results to the patient and their treating physician, and evaluation of the trial will take place. Thus, each n-of-1 trial will take 10&#x02005;weeks to complete. The optional open-label extension phase which follows the n-of-1 trial will be a further 6&#x02005;months.

For the n-of-1 trial, oral add-on treatment with ephedrine 25&#x02005;mg twice daily will be compared with add-on treatment with a placebo twice daily. To this purpose, commercial tablets of 50&#x02005;mg ephedrine will be divided into two equal halves, and repackaged in a non-transparent capsule. For the placebo, a placebo tablet will be repackaged in a non-transparent capsule. The divided 50&#x02005;mg commercial tablets comply with the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.

The multiple crossover phase consists of three cycles with two 1-week treatment periods: one period of 5&#x02005;days (Monday&#x02013;Friday) when ephedrine is taken as add-on treatment, and one 5-day period (Monday&#x02013;Friday) when a placebo is taken. The 5-day treatment periods are followed by a 2-day wash-out period (Saturday and Sunday) to prevent carry-over effects. A 2-day wash-out is considered adequate because of the short half-life of ephedrine of approximately 6&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>On the first day of the first two periods (cycle 1), study medication will be administered in hospital to monitor adverse reactions.

This report, which will unblind patient and physician, will be made available to the treating physician to guide clinical decision-making and to discuss with the patient during an outpatient visit in week 8. The resulting treatment decision will be recorded. In addition, the number of eligible patients, patients recruited, patients who completed their n-of-1 trial, the total number of completed cycles, and the number of patients who decided to participate in the open-label extension phase will be recorded to evaluate the acceptability of this type of trial.</p><p>In addition to the quantitative evaluation of the acceptability of this type of trial, acceptability will also be evaluated qualitatively by exploring the experiences of patients, physicians and pharmacists in the trial. Semistructured telephone interviews of approximately 30&#x02005;min will be conducted with the patient (week 9 or 10). The topics for the interview schedule were derived from methodological (theoretical) benefits and burdens of n-of-1 trials,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> published studies on experiences of patients and carers with n-of-1 trials,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>

AEs will be monitored throughout the n-of-1 trial. All SAEs and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) occurring during the study and either reported spontaneously or as part of the AE monitoring will be followed up by the principal investigator and will be reported separately to the Medical Ethics Committee (MEC). Unblinding will occur if there is reason to believe a SAE or SUSAR was due to the study medication and if the patient cannot be treated without knowing which treatment they were receiving. Unblinding and the reason for unblinding will be recorded.

This report will be discussed by the patient and their physician during the evaluation phase of the n-of-1 trial and may be used to guide individual therapeutic decisions. All data from completed cycles will be used for the analyses of treatment effects. Given the small sample size, no additional analyses at group level, such as interim or subgroup analyses, are planned.</p></sec><sec id="s2j4"><title>Adverse effects, study inclusion and views of patients, physicians, and pharmacists</title><p>A descriptive report will list the number of patients who experienced adverse effects during the placebo and ephedrine periods of the multiple crossover phase of the n-of-1 trials, as well as the type of adverse effect. This includes both self-reported adverse effects and those measured by vital signs, ECG and blood test monitoring. The number of patients eligible for the trial, as well as the number of patients who enrolled in the trial, who completed the trial, and who opted to proceed with the open-label extension afterwards will be described. A qualitative analysis will explore the experiences of patients, physicians and pharmacists with the n-of-1 trial, including patient satisfaction. This evaluation will also include a description of the average time cost of the n-of-1 trial for the physicians and pharmacists.</p></sec><sec id="s2j5"><title>Long-term effects of ephedrine</title><p>Baseline QMG, MG-Composite and MG-ADL scores, and the scores measured during the n-of-1 trials will be compared with the scores for these measures during the open-label extension phase at 2, 4 and 6&#x02005;months.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Any amendments to the study protocol will be recorded and submitted to the MEC, with substantial amendments submitted for approval prior to implementation.

Series of n-of-1 trials can be used to determine population treatment effectiveness as well as treatment effects in individual patients. N-of-1 trials may be particularly valuable to explore population treatment effects in patients with rare diseases, where parallel-group RCTs may be unfeasible due to small patient numbers.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>A limiting factor to the widespread use of series of n-of-1 trials, however, is the requirement for a stable disease course and for symptomatic, short-acting nature of the investigational treatment due to the crossover nature of the trial.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Generalisability of the treatment effect to the entire population may also be limited if there is substantial heterogeneity in the study population treatment effect, especially if the sample size is small.</p><p>Despite these limitations, data from the current series of n-of-1 trials will be pooled to obtain a population treatment effect estimate, and will be used to facilitate regulatory innovation in two ways. First, the Dutch National Health Care Institute (NHCI) is in the process of implementing a &#x02018;feasible information trajectory&#x02019; to obtain fitting evidence in situations where classic (group-)RCTs are not feasible.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> A workgroup of the NHCI will evaluate to what extent this study demonstrates that an n-of-1 trial design is suitable to generate evidence for reimbursement decisions. Second, based on the results of this trial, a workgroup of the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) will discuss scientific regulatory questions which should be clarified before evidence from pooled n-of-1 trials could be used in a request for marketing authorisation. Furthermore, tailored implementation strategies, such as lectures and seminars, will be used to stimulate a range of stakeholders in the field of rare diseases to consider further development and use of n-of-1 trials.</p><p>Finally, we would like to invite clinicians and researchers in other hospitals to contact the study team if they are considering using (a similar version of) the current study protocol to conduct their own n-of-1 trials for add-on treatment with ephedrine in patients with generalised MG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the members of the Medicines Evaluation Board Work Group; Dr Ilse Verstijnen (Dutch National Health Care Institute); Johan Voerman, Marcel Timmen, and Dr Anja Horemans (Dutch Association for Neuromuscular Diseases); Dr Dirk Knol (VU University Medical Center); Professor Hans van Delden (University Medical Center Utrecht); and Professor Carin Uyl-de Groot (Erasmus University Rotterdam) for their feedback on the study protocol.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CV, SSW and JJGMV conceived of the study and initiated the design.
