and gluteus maximus strengthening exercises on pronated feet. [Subjects and Methods] The
present study was conducted with 18 adults without no history of surgery on the foot or
ankle. One group performed both gluteus maximus strengthening exercises and abductor
hallucis strengthening exercises, while the other group performed only abductor hallucis
strengthening exercises five times per week for four weeks. [Results] The group that
performed both gluteus maximus and abductor hallucis strengthening exercises showed
smaller values in the height of navicular drop than the group that performed only abductor
hallucis strengthening exercises. The muscle activity of the gluteus maximus and the
vastus medialis increased during heel-strike in the group that added gluteus maximus
exercises, and the muscle activity of the abductor hallucis significantly increased in
both groups. [Conclusion] Given the results of the present study, it can be suggested that
strengthening the gluteus maximus while also performing exercises to correct the pronated
foot is an effective method for achieving normal gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Navicular drop</kwd><kwd>Foot arch</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The feet support the body&#x02019;s weight and play the role of levers when an individual is
performing work<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The body weight normally
falls on the center of the foot, and balance is maintained by the muscle activity of the
foot<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the foot becomes diseased or
deformed, the foot adapts to perform its functions under the conditions of disease or
deformity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakening of the gluteus
maximus is a cause of foot deformities that induces the hip joint to internally rotate and
the foot to pronate<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Within the sole are the lateral longitudinal arch, the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), and
the transverse arch<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MLA is
controlled with the assistance of bone structures, ligaments, and the extrinsic and
intrinsic muscles of the foot<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among
these muscles, the abductor hallucis (AbdH) has been reported to control excessive foot
pronation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The AbdH has also been
reported to be important for stabilization of the MLA and indispensable for toe-off during
gait<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although there are many exercises
for strengthening the AbdH, the toe-spread (TS) exercise has been shown to achieve higher
levels of AbdH muscle activity in when compared to the short-foot exercise; however, the
difference was not statistically significant when both exercises were performed in the
sitting position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among selective gluteus maximus strengthening exercises, the one performed by slightly
lifting the knee while maintaining the hip joint in external rotation and the knee joint at
90&#x000b0; flexion while in the prone position was reported to be the most effective<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there is literature indicating that the plantar arches and the iliacus muscle
affect each other, studies identifying the effect are rare. Therefore, subjects were divided
into two exercise groups in this study: one group strengthened only the abductor halluces
(which directly affects the plantar arches), while the other group strengthened both the
abductor hallucis and the gluteus maximus. The lower-extremity muscle activity levels of the
two groups during the gait were compared in order to propose the most effective method to
strengthen the MLA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 18 healthy adults were selected after excluding subjects with a history of
arthritis, foot or ankle surgery, diabetes, foot abnormalities, or present cuts to the lower
extremities. The study subjects were selected from among those who had foot pronation
(&#x0003e;10&#x02005;mm) based on navicular drop (ND) tests<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were provided with a written informed consent
form in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean age,
height, and weight of the study subjects who strengthened both the gluteus maximus and the
AbdH simultaneously were 21.89 &#x000b1; 1.69&#x02005;years, 163 &#x000b1; 7.26&#x02005;cm, and 57.56 &#x000b1; 14.33&#x02005;kg,
respectively. The mean age, height, and weight of the study subjects who strengthened only
the AbdH were 22.3 &#x000b1; 2.06&#x02005;years, 164.7 &#x000b1; 8.53&#x02005;cm, and 62.22 &#x000b1; 12.04&#x02005;kg, respectively.</p><p>The study subjects performed their respective exercises three times per week in the
laboratory and two times per week at home for four weeks. The subjects who performed both
gluteus maximus and TS exercises did three sets of 20 repetitions of exercises that
selectively strengthened the gluteus maximus in the prone position and 100 repetitions of TS
exercises in the sitting position while maintaining both the hip joints and the knee joints
at 90&#x000b0; flexion. The subjects in the other group performed only 100 repetitions of TS
exercises.</p><p>A surface electromyographic (EMG) DTS system (TeleMyo DTS, Noraxon Inc., AZ, USA) was used
to record and process the EMG signals from the gluteus maximus, the vastus medialis, the
tibialis anterior, and the AbdH. For the gluteus maximus, the EMG electrodes were placed at
the midpoint of the sacral vertebrae and the greater trochanter. EMG electrodes for the
vastus medialis were placed four-fifths of the way aling a line from the ASIS and the joint
space in front of the anterior border of the medial ligament, while electrodes for the
tibialis anterior were placed 1/3 on the line between the tip of the fibula and the tip of
the medial malleolus. Electrodes for the abductor hallucis were placed approximately 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;cm
posterior to the navicular tuberosity. Single electrodes were used for the surface EMG. The
signals were extracted at a rate of 1,500&#x02005;Hz and noises in raw EMG signals were removed
through 20&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz bandpass filters and 60&#x02005;Hz notch filters. The muscles&#x02019; EMG signals were
processed into root mean square (RMS), and the EMG data were analyzed using the MyoResearch
Master 1.07 XP program (Noraxon Inc., AZ, USA). After determining the three most stable gait
cycles, we found average values of heel-strike, foot-flat, toe-off muscle activity. The EMG
data were normalized to maximal voluntary contraction (% MVC).</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
ND&#x02019;s<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> before and after group exercises
were compared using independent t-tests. Paired t-tests were used to measure changes in
lower extremity pre- and post-exercise EMG measurements in each group. Foot switches were
attached to the center of the heel, below the first and fifth metatarsals, before walking in
order to divide the gait cycle into the heel-strike, foot-flat, and toe-off phases; lower
extremity EMG was performed in each individual phase. The significance level was set to
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The ND was 5.53 &#x000b1; 1.58 in the group that performed both gluteus maximus and TS exercises

recommendable because inconvenience in the lower extremity related to physical stress was
not improved<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. O&#x02019;Sullivan reported that
when subjects with pronation received MLA support with tape and had their standing foot
pressure measured the results indicated that pressure was decreased in the front and middle
parts of the feet<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in a
study conducted by Franettovich et al., taping was applied to five subjects with pronated
feet and the researchers identified that the height of the MLA increased and excessive
muscle use decreased compared to levels measured without taping<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, in relation to muscle activity, the researchers
advised that they could not know how taping increased the height of the arch of the foot.
Given these results, short-term effects can be expected from using aids for maintaining or
increasing the height of the MLA, but long-term effects cannot be expected; also, no effect
can be expected when no aid is used. Many studies have been conducted on various exercise
methods using muscles directly connected to the MLA to supplement such shortcomings. Since
many studies set the criterion for pronated feet as 10&#x02005;mm or greater ND<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the subjects in the present study were selected based on
that criterion. Subjects were randomly divided with one group of nine subjects performing
both gluteus maximus and TS exercises three times per week for four weeks, while another
group of nine subjects performed only TS exercises. Feet with smaller values in the height
of the ND were less pronated, and the group that added gluteus maximus strengthening
exercises showed decreased values in the height of the ND compared to the group that
performed only TS exercises. The gluteus maximus is an external rotation muscle of the hip
joint, and it is proposed to have externally rotated the alignment of the lower extremity to
reduce the foot pronation in these patients.</p><p>In normal gait, it is said that the muscle activity of the gluteus muscle group, the
quadriceps, and the tibialis anterior increases during heel-strike and that the muscle
activity of the calf muscle and the intrinsic foot muscles increases during toe-off<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The group that performed both gluteus
maximus and TS exercises showed significantly higher muscle activity of the gluteus maximus
and the vastus medialis during heel-strike and high muscle activity of the AbdH during
toe-off, while the group that performed only TS exercises showed only increased muscle
activity of the AbdH during toe-off. When compared to the muscle activity during normal
gaits reported by Neumann<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, the group that
added gluteus maximus strengthening exercises showed muscle activity much closer to that of
normal gaits. Given the changes in the height of the ND and the changes in the EMG of the
lower extremity during gait, strengthening both the TS and the gluteus maximus is considered
more effective for correction of the MLA than performing only TS exercises.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, in determining the criteria for subjects&#x02019;
normal feet, ND tests were not sufficient, and the number of subjects was not large enough
for generalization. In addition, although the AbdH is the most superficial muscle of the
foot, it is a small muscle and is susceptible to cross talk from other intrinsic and
extrinsic muscles. Another limitation is the fact that changes over time were not assessed
after the four-week exercise intervention period was over. Future studies should consider
these limitations and conduct motion analyses and radioactive examinations to study diverse
