The WelTel strategy of using weekly short message service (SMS) to engage patients in care in Kenya, where mobile coverage even in poor areas is widespread has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral load suppression among those on ART. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the WelTel SMS intervention compared to standard care on retention in PMTCT program in Kenya.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>WelTel PMTCT is a four to seven-centers, two-arm open randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will be conducted in urban and rural Kenya. Over 36&#x000a0;months, we plan to recruit 600 pregnant women at their first antenatal care visit and follow the mother-infant pair until they are discharged from the PMTCT program (when infant is aged 24&#x000a0;months). Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control arm (standard care) at a 1:1 ratio. Intervention arm participants will receive an interactive weekly SMS &#x02018;How are you?&#x02019; to which they are supposed to respond within 24&#x000a0;h. Depending on the response (ok, problem or no answer), a PMTCT nurse will follow-up and triage any problems that are identified.</p><p>The primary outcome will be retention in care defined as the proportion of mother-infant pairs coming for infant HIV testing at 24&#x000a0;months from delivery. Secondary outcomes include a) adherence to WelTel; (b) adherence to antiretroviral medicine; (c) acceptance of WelTel and (d) cost-effectiveness of the WelTel intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth for PMTCT retention.

According to the AIDS Response Progress Report 2014, the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya has increased by 15&#x000a0;% over the last 4&#x000a0;years, reaching 1.6 million cases in 2013, with an estimated incidence of100 000 new HIV infections in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Women represent about 57&#x000a0;% of all PLHIV in Kenya and close to 1&#x000a0;% (101,000) of all Kenyan children are living with HIV, corresponding to 10&#x000a0;% of all PLHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As many as 11 000 Kenyan children were estimated to be newly infected in 2013, mainly through mother to child transmission (MTCT). Thus, Kenya&#x02019;s commitment to eliminate MTCT of HIV by 2015 will not be achieved, but improvements have been made. Over the last decade, the number of HIV-infected pregnant women in need for PMTCT in Kenya has also declined, albeit too slowly, from 98,000 in 2004 to 79,000 in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since 2013, Kenya has adopted PMTCT Option B+, the World Health Organization guideline recommending all pregnant women living with HIV receive immediate HIV treatment <italic>for life</italic> regardless of immune defense (CD4 count), a strategy called PMTCT Option B+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Antiretrovirals (ARVs) during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding, and for the infant 6&#x000a0;weeks post-delivery can reduce the risk of transmission from 35&#x000a0;% to &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;% in low-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Key strategies to finally eliminate MTCT include increased knowledge of PMTCT, increased involvement from the male partner, universal attendance of antenatal care (ANC) by pregnant women, universal testing of pregnant women for HIV and provision of ARVs from early pregnancy throughout the breastfeeding period, and facility delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Kenya&#x02019;s progress on these goals is uneven. While the proportion of pregnant women tested for HIV has increased from 68 to 92&#x000a0;% in the last 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], only 5&#x000a0;% of male partners accompanied their pregnant partner to ANC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PMTCT coverage (the number of pregnant women living with HIV started on ARVs before delivery) declined in Kenya from 86&#x000a0;% in 2010 to 73&#x000a0;% in 2013, i.e. 58,000 out of 79,000 pregnant women living with HIV were offered PMTCT services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This was partly due to the multiple challenges of implementing Option B+, which is much more resource demanding.</p><p>Only 50&#x000a0;% in need of PMTCT were given ARVs within 6&#x000a0;weeks of their HIV diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a service delay that may cause avoidable MTCT. Only 45&#x000a0;% of all HIV-exposed infants were tested for HIV, i.e. the majority of children were lost to follow up leading to preventable child deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Because of these shortcomings, the proportion of HIV-exposed children who became HIV-infected has halted at 14&#x000a0;% in the last 3&#x000a0;years. If Kenya is to achieve the global target of eliminating MTCT of HIV, initially aimed for 2015, this trend needs to be reversed through new and more effective interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mobile phone use for information and health service strengthening in Kenya</title><p>The rapid expansion in mobile phone technology in Africa has created new opportunities for information sharing and service delivery where other infrastructure, such as cable connectivity and constant electricity supply is inadequate. In 2013, 82&#x000a0;% of Kenyan households owned a mobile phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], reaching 100&#x000a0;% of 20&#x02013;29 year-olds i.e. the age-period when most women give birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, Kenya has the world&#x02019;s highest proportion of cell phone owners (80&#x000a0;%) who use mobile banking, and 60&#x000a0;% of Kenyans living on less than $2,50 i.e. under the poverty line, have mobile phones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Mobile technology for health (mHealth) is increasingly being used to overcome shortcomings in information systems, laboratory equipment and human resource capacity in low-income countries. Within maternal and child health care (MCH), mobile technology has been used to link ANC with pregnant women and new mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], to remind community health workers in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and to submit surveillance reports on disease outbreaks and delivery of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other uses of mHealth include registration of records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and monitoring of drug procurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several trials have highlighted the potential of mHealth to improve HIV services e.g. in adherence to ART, retention in ART care, and even for receipt of laboratory HIV test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review, which included the WelTel RCT in Kenya found compelling evidence that weekly text messages to non-pregnant HIV infected patients are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in improving ART adherence.</p><p>Whether a weekly interactive SMS intervention (the WelTel model) improves adherence and retention in PMTCT care and encourages life-long ARVs is unknown. The situation for pregnant women living with HIV in a country like Kenya is often highly complicated. Many women do not feel comfortable disclosing their HIV status to a partner or family members in fear of being stigmatized and socially isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which greatly influences adherence to ART and PMTCT. Furthermore, most women are newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy, often asymptomatic and have little time to adjust to the idea of living with HIV before they must start on ARVs. Our previous research shows that competing burdens, including breadwinning responsibilities, stigma, feelings of guilt and fear of transmitting HIV to the baby, fear of abandonment and violence from the male partner also affects women&#x02019;s capacity to adhere to PMTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The WelTel trial remains the only SMS adherence intervention study with the lowest risk of bias ranking. The WelTel service has other advantages in that it is low cost since it uses SMS to check-in on patients, can work with minimal literacy since problems can be followed up with voice calls and extends into the population that do not own their own phones since shared access is sufficient, and by being open-ended check-ins allows almost any problem to be triaged. We will assess the effectiveness, including evaluation of costs of weekly interactive SMS reminders to improve the retention of pregnant women and mother-infant pairs in PMTCT care in Kenya. Ultimately this will result in better PMTCT coverage and reduced infant HIV infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Research hypothesis</title><p>The weekly interactive mobile phone SMS (WelTel) is an effective as well as cost-effective method to improve the retention of women living with HIV and their newborns&#x02019; in PMTCT care (women living with HIV and their HIV exposed infants who successfully complete the program when infant is aged 24&#x000a0;months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study objectives</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To determine effectiveness of the WelTel SMS intervention on retention of women living with HIV and their newborns&#x02019; in PMTCT care in urban and rural Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess adherence to the WelTel SMS intervention among pregnant women and newly delivered mothers living with HIV.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine adherence to single components of PMTCT among pregnant women and newly delivered mothers living with HIV (ARVs, facility-based delivery, early infant HIV testing and exclusive breastfeeding).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore facilitators for and barriers to using WelTel SMS in order to inform any improvements on the model for PMTCT among pregnant women and newly delivered mothers living with HIV as well as PMTCT staff.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate costs from a payer&#x02019;s perspective, of the WelTel SMS for retaining women living with HIV and HIV-exposed infants in clinical follow-up until 24&#x000a0;months post-delivery (discharge from PMTCT).</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial design</title><p>The WelTel PMCT study is a 4&#x02013;7 center two-arm open randomized controlled trial in which the intervention is allocated in a 1:1 ratio (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> trial design).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>WelTel PMTCT trial design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2016_321_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study is in western Kenya and involves 4&#x02013;7 facilities that are among over 192 facilities providing PMTCT services located in the catchment of Academic Model Providing Access to Health Care (AMPATH) &#x02013; a large HIV Comprehensive Care Program run under the auspices of Moi University School of Medicine, located in Eldoret.

The PGI will also enable the investigators to assess the validity of the EQ5D and SF12 in this population and context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection and management</title><p>All outgoing and incoming text messages will be automatically recorded on the WelTel platform. The platform also captures all of the &#x0201c;problems&#x0201d; noted by participants, instances of non-response, and actions taken in relation to participants&#x02019; &#x02018;problem&#x02019; responses and non-responses. Platform data will be backed up every 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>All questionnaires will be paper-based and the data manager will then enter data into a database at the central office on an ongoing basis. A data manager will check the forms for completeness and quality will be verified by re-checking a random sample of 10&#x000a0;% of the data. Any problems that arise will be resolved promptly. Participant files will be stored in a locked office at the trial sites.</p><p>Data on attendance, HIV care clinical indicators like viral load and CD4 cell count as well as treatment regimen will be collected medical records. We will also collect information on demographic characteristics (age, education level, marital status and parity) of all screened patients/potential trial participants.</p><p>Qualitative research using in &#x02013;depth interviews will also be performed to discover &#x02018;how&#x02019; and &#x02018;why&#x02019; the intervention works to improve retention in PMTCT program. Purposive sampling will be used to identify participants for qualitative interviews. Face-to-face interactions will be used to build trust during the interview process and to enhance free interaction between the researcher and the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All conversations will be recorded with permission from the respondents and the interviews will be performed at a place and in a language preferred by the respondent.</p><p>All qualitative research tools will be developed in English, then translated to Kiswahili, and then back translated to English. The interview guide will be available in both languages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Baseline participants&#x02019; characteristics will be reported separately by treatment arm. Baseline characteristics include: age, parity (nulliparous versus previous birth), marital status (single, married or cohabiting, divorced/widowed), ARV exposure (experienced vs. naive), duration of known HIV diagnosis (newly vs. previously diagnosed), age (18&#x02013;29, 30&#x02013;39, 40&#x02013;49, &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years of age), phone ownership (owned vs. shared), level of education (none, primary, secondary, post-secondary), distance from clinic (&#x02264;1&#x000a0;h vs. &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;h), number of children born after HIV diagnosis, on ARV at enrolment (yes, no), time on ARV at enrolment (&#x02264;6&#x000a0;months, 7&#x02013;12 months, &#x02265;13&#x000a0;months) and HIV status disclosure (yes, no). We will report the mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (first quartile, third quartile) for continuous variables, and count and percentages for categorical variables. All analyses are by <italic>intention-to-treat</italic> i.e. according to the study group to which women were originally allocated regardless of subsequent intervention received and per protocol. Other more statistical methods will be used to take into account switching.</p><p>For the primary outcome, we will compare the proportion of mothers living with HIV and their HIV-exposed infants in the program at 24&#x000a0;months post-birth in the intervention vs. control arm using both parametric (Chi-Square) and exact (Fisher) statistical tests. Secondary outcomes will also be compared between arms, with t-tests for normally distributed variables, Mann Whitney-U tests for non-normally distributed variables, and Chi-Square and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. The relative risk (RR) for PMTCT retention with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals will be computed and the number needed to treat to prevent one non-retained mother-infant pair will also be estimated. Concerning the secondary outcomes, average treatment effects (ATE) will be computed for continuous outcomes and RRs for categorical outcomes. For both primary and secondary outcomes, log-linear or linear regression models will be used to provide effect estimates adjusted for potential imbalances in baseline participants&#x02019; characteristics, if required. We will repeat the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes within such subgroups (in relation to socio-demographics) to assess the homogeneity of the intervention effect across pre-determined subgroups of patients. Stratified RRs and ATEs will be computed. Regression models, which include the intervention allocation and subgroup-defining variables and their interaction, will be applied to assess effect modification across groups; all statistics tests will be run based on two side <italic>p</italic>-values and values&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be again performed with Stata version 14.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Qualitative process evaluation</title><p>Qualitative data will be analyzed using content analysis, guided by Graneheim and Lundman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. First, the transcribed material is read a number of times to get a general sense of the material by a group of researchers. Using the open code software for qualitative research, meaning units, which are key phrases in the text, are identified, condensed and outlined. Codes will then be ascribed to each meaning unit. The codes will be compared and grouped into sub-categories. This comparison will be performed consistently to identify emerging categories that will be further compared, re-organized and merged into sub-themes and one overarching theme. The coding and analysis process will be deductive in nature and involve key members of the research team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will perform an economic evaluation to assess WelTel SMS from a healthcare payer perspective. The primary outcome of the cost effective analysis (CEA) will be the incremental cost per additional mother-infant pairs that remain in PMTCT until infant is aged 24&#x000a0;months. A secondary outcome is averted infant HIV-infections at cessation of breastfeeding. For the cost-utility analysis the outcome will be quality adjusted life years (QALYs), based on responses to the SF-12 and EQ5D. For both analyses (CEA and CUA) we will report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) that will be computed as the ratio of the incremental costs to provide WelTel SMS over usual care and incremental effects e.g. cost per additional mother-infant pairs that remain in PMTCT until infant is aged 24&#x000a0;months, cost averted infant HIV-infections at cessation of breastfeeding and cost per QALY.</p><p>A secondary analysis will also consider the incremental cost per averted deaths by bringing infants lost to follow up back and enabling treatment. Thus, we will determine ICER for cost per averted deaths. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will be to address uncertainty.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial provides an opportunity to test whether the WelTel SMS intervention is effective in improving retention in PMTCT care. Further, we will be able to determine whether the interactive WelTel text-messaging intervention, by engaging patients with the PMTCT clinic on a weekly basis, is a cost-effective way to improve retention in this critical stage of care, potentially helping to eliminate pediatric HIV infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome; ANC, antenatal care; ART, antiretroviral therapy; ARVs, antiretroviral drugs; CEA, cost effectiveness analysis; CUA, cost utility analysis; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ICERs, incremental cost effectiveness ratios; IDIs, in-depth interviews; IREC, Institutional review and ethics committee; MCH, maternal and child health; MTCT, mother to child transmission; PIP, partners in prevention &#x02013; Moi University; PLHIV, people living with HIV; PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission; QALYs, quality-adjusted life years; RCT, randomised clinical trial; RR, relative risk; SMS, short message service; UNAIDS, Joint United Nations programme on AIDS; WelTel SMS, Weekly mobile phone short message service</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients who participated in pre-testing the data collection tools, the staff at Partners in Prevention (PIP) Moi University for organizing field logistics for the trial.

They will give all eligible participants that are newly diagnosed until their next clinic appointment to decide whether to enroll in the study. The risk of breach of confidentiality resulting from the text messaging intervention will be minimized since the content of the text message will not include language related to HIV. In addition, the research phone number will not be displayed on the participant&#x02019;s cell phone when a text is received unless the participant actively installs a &#x0201c;true caller&#x0201d; software that reveals the number from which an SMS or call originates.</p><p>Each participant will be assigned a unique study ID (the outpatient number with additional serialization that denote participation codes), which will be used in all subsequent data collection and analyses.
