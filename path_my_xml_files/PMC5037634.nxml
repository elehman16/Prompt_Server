Although medications and lifestyle changes are effective for improving outcomes in chronic diseases, many patients do not receive these treatments, in part because of financial barriers, patient and provider-level knowledge gaps, and low patient motivation. The <italic>Assessing outcomes of enhanced chronic disease care through patient education and a value-based formulary</italic> study (ACCESS) will determine the impact of two interventions: (1) a value-based formulary which eliminates copayment for high-value preventive medications; and (2) a comprehensive self-management support program aimed at promoting health behavior change and medication adherence, combined with relay of information on medication use to healthcare providers, on cardiovascular events and/or mortality in low-income seniors with elevated cardiovascular risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The ACCESS study will use a parallel, open label, factorial randomized trial design, with blinded endpoint evaluation in 4714 participants who are over age &#x0003e;65 (and therefore have drug insurance provided by Alberta Blue Cross with 30&#x000a0;% co-payment); are at a high risk for cardiovascular events based on a history of any one of the following: coronary heart disease, prior stroke, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or any two of the following: current cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia; and have a household income &#x0003c;Can$50,000. This 3-year study is powered to detect a minimal clinically important relative risk reduction of 12&#x000a0;% in the composite clinical outcome of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, need for coronary revascularization, and hospitalizations for chronic disease-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions, each of which will be assessed using healthcare administrative data.

Approximately 80&#x000a0;% of these are from myocardial infarctions and strokes. Similar statistics have been demonstrated in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Important risk factors for cardiovascular events include prior stroke or myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, or hypertension (henceforth referred to as &#x0201c;chronic diseases&#x0201d;).</p><p id="Par6">Health behavior changes (e.g., exercise, healthy diet, smoking cessation, and adherence with pharmacologic preventive management) are particularly important in the management of people with these chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We identified a significant evidence to care gap for people with chronic diseases in Alberta, Canada, similar to that observed in other North American populations, including that nearly 50&#x000a0;% of people with cardiovascular-related chronic diseases do not take guideline-recommended medications (e.g., statins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">As occurs in nearly all organizations for economic co-operation and development countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], most Canadian citizens (irrespective of whether they have private or publicly funded drug insurance) are subject to cost-sharing (i.e., copayments or deductibles) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This requires that patients pay a portion of the medication cost&#x02014;typically a copayment of 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of the total cost of the prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]&#x02014;or deductibles which may be as high as 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of household income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a recent survey of nearly 2000 Western Canadians, up to 20&#x000a0;% of Western Canadian patients identified having financial barriers to obtaining their drugs; and patients with these barriers were 30&#x02013;55&#x000a0;% less likely to use statins than those who did not perceive financial barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In addition to financial barriers, in our recent survey of Western Canadians, we also identified that patient and provider-level knowledge gaps and patient motivation were major barriers to optimal medical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patient knowledge and motivation both tie into the concept of self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]: a set of positive health behaviors which include adherence to prescribed medications. Our recent survey suggested that 40&#x000a0;% of patients with these chronic conditions did not recall receiving health behavior change counseling, and of those who did, up to 70&#x000a0;% of them did not report following the advice given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Management of chronic disease may be suboptimal when patients experience financial barriers or do not engage in self-management. If suboptimal control persists for extended periods, patients may be hospitalized for complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] such as myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or chronic disease-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). ACSC are those for which &#x0201c;timely and effective outpatient care, including use of appropriate medications, can reduce the risk of hospitalization&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These potentially preventable hospitalizations are clinically relevant to patients and for health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for study interventions</title><p id="Par10">
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par11">Value-based formulary which eliminates copayment for high-value preventive medications</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par12">One way to reduce the frequency of financial barriers is to provide full coverage for &#x0201c;high-value&#x0201d; medications. Also known as value-based insurance, within a value-based formulary, medications shown to confer important benefits in high quality studies, and/or provide good value for money are provided for free, with other lower-value medications still subject to patient copayment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Numerous observational studies have suggested that reducing copayments has the potential to improve adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and a recent high-quality randomized clinical trial (MI-FREEE) has demonstrated that eliminating copayments for beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and antiplatelet agents in patients post-myocardial infarction reduced the total number of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The impact of value-based insurance in a broader patient population has not been tested using a rigorous study design. The ACCESS study is powered to determine the impact of value based insurance in a broader patient population on both clinical outcomes and costs&#x02014;and as such will address an important gap in the literature.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>b)</label><p id="Par13">Self-management support program</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par14">A variety of interventions to enhance patient self-management have been tested in people with chronic diseases within randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Within a recent systematic review that sought to determine which elements of such programs were most effective in people with diabetes, interventions to enhance self-management, patient education, and facilitated relay of information to clinicians were noted to be some of the most effective interventions at improving glycemic control and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. &#x0201c;Facilitated relay&#x0201d; is defined as clinical information transmitted to clinicians by means other than the existing medical record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; the expectation is that clinicians act on the information to improve patient management. The systematic review noted considerable heterogeneity in the observed efficacy of the self-management programs. Part of this difference may relate to the format of the message, which (when crafted and delivered by health care workers) may lack effective techniques demonstrated to promote behavior change, and may not be tailored appropriately to individuals&#x02019; preferences and values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Additional uncertainty with respect to the effectiveness of interventions to enhance self-management, patient education, and facilitated relay of information to clinicians was also noted because of low sample sizes and short study duration (almost all studies &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This uncertainty will be addressed by the ACCESS study, which will be powered to detect differences in clinical and cost outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par15">The <italic>Assessing outcomes of enhanced chronic disease care through patient education and a value-based formulary</italic> study (ACCESS) will determine the effectiveness of two interventions targeting financial and self-management related barriers:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="Par16">a value-based formulary that eliminates co-payment for select high-value medications (i.e., value based insurance); and</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="Par17">a comprehensive self-management support program aimed at promoting health behavior change (by addressing concerns and improving self-efficacy), combined with relay of information on medication use to health care providers on cardiovascular events and/or mortality in low-income seniors with elevated cardiovascular risk.</p></list-item></list>

<italic>Intervention 1</italic> will be enrolment in a new drug formulary (operationalized through their existing government drug insurance) that will eliminate copayments for high value preventive medications (those which prevent myocardial infarction, strokes, hospitalizations and delay progression of kidney and other vascular disease): statins, beta blockers, ACE-i, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, anti-platelet agents, anti-arrhythmic drugs, anticoagulants, oral anti-diabetes agents, insulins, and smoking cessation aids (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1).</p><p id="Par26">
<italic>Intervention 2</italic> will be a tailored, adaptive, and interactive self-management support system that attempts to address determinants of intention and self-efficacy with regards to improving health habits and medication taking behavior. The second component of this intervention is comprised of facilitated relay of participants&#x02019; current use of recommended medications to their regular healthcare providers to facilitate prescription changes as needed, with the goal of overcoming clinical inertia.</p><p id="Par27">The system was designed by behavioral and implementation scientists, clinical experts, health services researchers, in partnership with a health marketing firm (Emergence, New York, NY) and a health technology firm (Locus Health, Charlottesville, VA) to incorporate principles of design-thinking and brand-engagement, informed by a process of patient engagement, as described below. Details, including the final design and implementation plan, are presented in the Box.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="box"><title>Box: Intervention 2 design and implementation</title><p id="Par28">Step 1&#x02014;defining the objective: the primary objective of intervention 2 was to improve patient knowledge and participants&#x02019; self-management abilities including making positive health behavior changes including adherence to prescribed medications (especially statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs), healthy lifestyle choices, and smoking cessation for those who self-report smoking cigarettes.</p><p id="Par29">Step 2&#x02014;initial patient engagement: we conducted a series of ethnographic-style interviews where one academic researcher (DC, BM, TC) was paired with a marketing expert to visit the homes of ten purposively sampled community dwelling patients chosen on the basis of having low incomes and several chronic conditions that would qualify them for inclusion in this trial. Questions focused on their medical conditions and medications, to explore the perceived meaning and impacts of these in their daily lives. From this experience, we developed different patient phenotypes or archetypes, which was foundational to developing the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Step 3&#x02014;tailoring the intervention: beyond these patient archetypes, we used several individual measures to tailor the intervention for individuals&#x02019; situation. (1) The Necessity-Concerns framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was used to personalize the intervention to individuals&#x02019; circumstances and beliefs. We stratified individuals into categories of necessity-predominant beliefs (those who don&#x02019;t believe their medications are necessary or helpful) and concerns-predominant beliefs (those who have concerns about side-effects, dependency or interactions). (2) Given that different types of messaging might be required for those who are non-adherent to their medications, we used validated instruments for assessing adherence at study baseline (Morisky Adherence Questionnaire) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] to assist in categorizing participants appropriately.</p><p id="Par31">Step 4&#x02014;procuring patient recommendations: we searched publicly accessible websites from professional societies and patient-information groups to obtain the medical information appropriate for trial participants. These included dietary and physical activity recommendations, scientifically-sound explanations of medication effects, and evidence of medication efficacy. These materials were reviewed by clinical committee members for appropriateness for inclusion.</p><p id="Par32">Step 5&#x02014;brand and message development: based on insights generated from the immersive patient research, the marketing team created a patient-facing brand and visual identity for the engagement platform. They then transformed physician-vetted medical information into messages that are easily understandable and relatable by the majority of potential participants. Specific messaging was developed to address each different patient archetype, adherence-state and beliefs-state described above.</p><p id="Par33">Step 6&#x02014;development of the online platform: the marketing team in conjunction with Locus Health, the health technology partner, then designed, developed and built an online portal for patients to interface with the design elements and messaging material developed in step 5. Participants who indicate a preference for an electronic mode of communication receive an email on a daily basis inviting them into their portal where they receive information, or are asked to respond to as series of cards. For each card completed, participants receive points which are tracked and make them eligible to receive virtual awards. This approach is designed to improve engagement with the platform through positive reinforcement.</p><p id="Par34">Step 7&#x02014;development of the analog platform: from previous studies in the area, we expected that at least half of study participants would not be able or willing to access the online platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. From the types of messaging developed in step 5, our marketing partners developed paper-based mailers that participants randomized to receive the self-management intervention receive weekly focusing on medication adherence and positive health behavior choices.</p><p id="Par35">Step 8&#x02014;development of the facilitated relay strategy: since only 50&#x000a0;% of Albertans with chronic diseases are taking guideline-recommended therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we developed personalized letters that would be sent to participants to take to their primary care provider and to their pharmacist. Where individuals are not currently prescribed both classes of recommended medications, the purpose of the letter is to remind the care provider about the evidence behind these therapies and strategies to attempt if the drugs had previously not been tolerated. For those who are on both statins and ACEi/ARBs at baseline, the letter simply informs their provider that they are enrolled in a clinical trial with a self-management intervention designed to assist them in working with the patient for improved heart health. These letters were pilot-tested with five primary care physicians and four pharmacists and refined based on the feedback received.</p><p id="Par36">Step 9&#x02014;focus group testing: once a preliminary version of the intervention was designed, we convened two focus groups of individuals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 and <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) who would meet inclusion criteria for the trial. We solicited their feedback about the various elements of the intervention (including the brand identity and visual design), receiving important comments and suggestions. For example, we heard that our initial design was too complex and that navigating the site was not intuitive.
