Recruitment came from patient referrals to home health at hospital discharge. Eligible patients were aged 50 years and older and taking or initiating treatment with medications with potential or significant drug-gene-based interactions. Subjects (n = 110) were randomized to pharmacogenetic profiling (n = 57). The study pharmacist reviewed drug-drug, drug-gene, and cumulative drug and/or gene interactions using the YouScript<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CDST to provide drug therapy recommendations to clinicians.

Most patients receiving home health care are elderly, take multiple medications, and experience poor compliance due to a number of issues, primarily adverse drug events (ADEs). This often leads to emergency department (ED) visits, re-hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life. With trends toward bundling of post-inpatient services, penalties for readmissions, and integration into Accountable Care Organizations, there is increased interest in hospitals co-managing or even acquiring home health providers. There is hope that innovative medical management can improve outcomes and reduce costs.</p><p>Medication-related problems are defined as circumstances during drug <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy">treatment</ext-link> that actually or potentially interfere with optimal care outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are common among polypharmacy patients taking multiple medications and can cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which are adverse drug events (ADEs) at normal doses for approved uses. For example, routinely prescribed psychiatric medications are a common cause of ADR-driven ED visits [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pharmacogenetic variation also leads to ADRs, including single drug-gene interactions (DGIs) and cumulative drug-drug-gene Interactions (DDGIs). More than 85% of patients have significant genetic variation in the cytochrome P-450 (CYP 450) genes that metabolize the majority of the most commonly prescribed medications [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170905.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Genetic variance among patients who are abnormal metabolizers compounds the potential risk for ADRs and often results in decreased efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170905.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both drug-drug and drug-gene medication related problems rise with polypharmacy, and two-thirds of adults over age 65 use one or more prescription drugs daily [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An estimated 35% of seniors experience ADEs, nearly half of these preventable [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 10&#x02013;17% of hospitalizations of older patients are directly related to ADRs [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, patients aged 60 years and older account for 51% of ADR-related deaths [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170905.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to predict and reduce unnecessary drug-related adverse reactions and its value has been shown in clinical trials in psychiatry [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based on these results, we believe that adding pharmacogenetic and cumulative information warnings to drug interaction clinical decision support tools (CDST) available to pharmacists could be useful in managing polypharmacy elderly patients. Interactions involving genes cause approximately 47% (25% were DGIs and 22% were DDGIs) of significant interaction warnings that can lead to side effects and ADRs [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170905.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Knowledge of a patient&#x02019;s pharmacogenetic profile and gene-based ADR susceptibility allows clinicians to make medication therapy decisions specific to each patient leading to better outcomes such as decreased pill burden, improvement of disease state, decreased ADRs, and increased quality of life. However, controlled trials of integrated pharmacogenetic information in a broad polypharmacy population have been lacking. Pharmacogenetic profiling reduced hospitalizations (39%) and ED visits (71%) in a prospective registry study in an ambulatory Medicare-age polypharmacy population [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, we undertook a randomized controlled trial in a high-risk population of chronically ill patients aged 50 years and older admitted to home health care after an inpatient hospitalization. The trial was designed to add pharmacogenetic data in an integrated clinical information system compared to a standard drug information system. In addition to re-hospitalization and ED visit metrics; we examined secondary endpoints including death and Medicare administrative quality measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The home health trial was approved by the Harding University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), and the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46) and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02378220">NCT02378220</ext-link>.

The study statistician provided the principal investigator with a list of 400 random assignments of potential study subjects that were randomized in blocks of 100 (50 for each study arm within each block of 100.) Patients meeting eligibility criteria were numbered chronologically based on the date of consent and were assigned to each arm according to the randomization list.

Reports were reviewed by the study pharmacist who provided final drug and dose change recommendations to fit patient needs and forwarded to clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis compared the primary and exploratory outcomes between tested and untested groups. Descriptive statistics are presented as means and ranges for count and ordinal outcomes and as percentages for binary outcomes. All count outcomes were compared between tested and untested groups using Poisson regression, and all Poisson regression models were diagnosed for over-dispersion. When over-dispersion was detected (p&#x0003c;0.05), the negative binomial regression was used instead of the Poisson regression. substantial The log-rank test was used to compare time-to-event outcomes. The time-to-event outcomes were further described using Kaplan-Meier estimates (curves and estimates at 30 and 60 days shown) and hazard ratios estimated from the Cox proportional hazards model. Ordinal outcomes (OASIS metrics and PHQ-2 scores) were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare the proportion of patient deaths. The effect on mortality was expressed by a risk ratio calculated from a log-link generalized linear model (with confidence interval calculated using profile likelihood from the model). Patient deaths and the composite event outcomes (analyzed both as counts and times to the first event) were added post-hoc to the exploratory outcomes. Composite event outcomes included re-hospitalizations + ED visits + deaths and re-hospitalizations + ED visits (where overlapping events were counted as one). Both were compared at 30 and at 60 days and as the time to the first composite outcome event. Calculations were carried out in R, version 3.2.3 (Vienna, Austria). All tests were two-sided. P&#x0003c;0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. As the study was designed as a pilot, tests were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 57 tested patients were compared to 53 untested patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170905.g001">Fig 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170905.t001">Table 1</xref> reports patient demographics overall and for tested and untested groups.

Reduction in the number of re-hospitalizations, ED visits and in the composite number of outcomes were observed at 30 days. At 60 days, primary and exploratory composite outcomes post-discharge were considerably lower in the tested group. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170905.t002">Table 2</xref>, at 60 days twenty-eight patients in the untested group had no ED visit, while eighteen had one visit, five had two visits, one had three visits and one had four visits. In the tested group thirty-nine patients had no ED visits at 60 days while fourteen had one visit and four had two visits. At 60 days thirty-one patients in the untested group had no re-hospitalization, while thirteen had one re-hospitalization, three had two re-hospitalizations and six had three re-hospitalizations. In the tested group forty-one patients had no re-hospitalization at 60 days while fourteen had one re-hospitalization, one had two re-hospitalizations and one had three re-hospitalizations. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170905.t003">Table 3</xref>, the mean number of outcomes per patient in the tested vs. untested group for re-hospitalizations was 0.33 vs. 0.70 (relative risk (RR), 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27&#x02013;0.82; p = 0.007); ED visits was 0.39 vs. 0.66 (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34&#x02013;0.99; p = 0.045); re-hospitalizations + ED visits was 0.54 vs. 1.04 (RR, 0.52; 95% C, 0.32&#x02013;0.86; p = 0.01). The testing reduced the number of re-hospitalizations, ED visits, and composite number of re-hospitalization + ED visits at 60 days by 52%, 42% and 48% respectively. The true re-hospitalization, ED visits, and composite number of re-hospitalization + ED visits reduction in a population similar to this study will likely fall between 18% to 73%, 1% to 66%, and 14% to 68% (95% CI) respectively. Six deaths were observed in the untested group versus one death in the tested group, an 85% reduction in the risk of death in the tested group (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01&#x02013;0.87; p = 0.054). At 60 days, the mean composite number of re-hospitalizations + ED visits + deaths was 0.54 for the tested group versus 1.10 for the untested group (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30&#x02013;0.81; p = 0.005). For the composite exploratory outcomes at 60 days, the dispersion assumption was violated, so negative binomial regression was used instead.

Although over 137 medications have pharmacogenetic considerations in their label [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the value of testing has yet to be established. Although some validation is needed, it should be noted that approximately one-half of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States undergo metabolism via CYP450 enzymes. Similar to creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate as a biomarker of kidney function, CYP genetic status serves as a biomarker of the patient&#x02019;s ability to metabolize drugs via CYP450 enzymatic pathways. FDA guidance regarding pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired renal function suggests that dosing recommendations be based on creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, such as area under the curve (AUC), half-life and C<sub>max</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, patient CYP genetic status and the resulting alterations to CYP enzyme activity are fundamental to understanding the AUC, half-life and C<sub>max</sub> which measure and determine circulating drug levels. Older patients may realize a greater benefit from pharmacogenetic testing along with an appropriate CDST being at heightened risk for polypharmacy and adverse medication outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This trial assessed the clinical impact of pharmacist medication management with access to pharmacogenetic profiling integrated with cumulative drug-gene interaction warnings (YouScript<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CDST). Inhibition of CYP enzymatic activity by concomitant medication(s) can dramatically change a person&#x02019;s metabolic capacity presenting with a phenotype that does not match with the genetic phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. YouScript<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> algorithms combine all drug-gene and drug-drug interactions to predict the cumulative effect of all interacting components on an affected drug. This is important because normal and intermediate metabolizers can be &#x02018;phenoconverted&#x02019; to poor metabolizers. The phenotype prediction from genotype data depends heavily on the allelic variants present in a population of interest and the number of alleles being interrogated. An overestimate of the normal-function of CYPs is likely to occur when a considerable number of no- and decreased-function alleles are missed. In addition, other genetic, physiological, pathological, and environmental factors on CYP expression and activity may also have an implication. Interpretation of the functional consequences of predicted phenotypes for drug clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>, and thus translation into specific dosing guidelines for individual drug-diplotype pairs, will benefit from future genotype-stratified pharmacokinetic studies for high-priority drugs [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The study population was selected to have a higher than average return on pharmacogenetic testing defined by the likely frequency of drugs interacting with CYPs. Patients who were aged 50 and older, enrolled in home health, and taking or initiating treatment with at least one medication with a significant DDI or DGI as defined by FDA boxed warning, FDA cautionary labeling, clinical literature or YouScript<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> algorithm- predicted significant effect were included. To verify patients were similar in each arm, the distribution of diagnosis (patient diseases, disorders and related health problems) and medication utilization between the tested and untested groups were compared. The diagnosis results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170905.s007">S2 Table</xref>) showed significant differences only in the frequency of the cerebrovascular conditions and eye diseases. Finding statistically significant differences for two conditions is not unusual among twenty-six comparisons (1.3 such differences would be expected, on average.) Additionally, the frequencies of these two conditions were higher in the tested group. Despite this, there was an overall reduction in ED visits and re-hospitalizations at 60 days. Therefore, not adjusting for this imbalance appears to be, in fact, conservative. All other diseases, disorders and health related problems between the two groups were not statistically significant and likely did not impact the presented outcomes of the study.</p><p>Home health patients are polypharmacy treated subjects; the average number of drugs per patient in this study was 11.6. The average drug count at baseline (before pharmacogenetic profiling based intervention) was relatively balanced between the tested and untested groups (11.6 vs. 11.8; p = 0.6, two sample t-test). On comparing the frequency of drugs prescribed between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170905.s008">S3 Table</xref>), no major difference were observed validating a relatively good balance between the two arms. A major 52% reduction in the number of re-hospitalizations and a 42% reduction in the number of ED visits at 60 days post-discharge was observed in the tested versus the untested group. This finding occurred in an HHA that, according to 2015 Home Health Quality Improvement reporting was in the 5<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup>-percentile group for the CMS re-hospitalization benchmark. The HHA received 4.5 of 5 stars in the CMS Home Health Compare rating.</p><p>Reducing rates of re-hospitalization has attracted attention from policymakers as a way to improve quality of care and reduce costs. ED visits are also an important cause of morbidity, and may often be caused by ADEs, particularly among patients aged 65 years and older [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Six deaths were observed in the untested group versus one death in the tested group, an 85% reduction in the risk of death. However, because of the small sample size it is unclear if it was directly related to pharmacogenetic-guided treatment. The death in the tested group occurred before pharmacogenetic results were sent to the clinician.</p><p>The fact that most patients are not normal metabolizers for at least one CYP drug metabolizing enzyme is extremely important when managing a patient medications. The wide range of CYP isozyme-encoding gene variants suggests that a large number of DGIs and DDGIs must go undetected without pharmacogenetic testing. The total number of patients with risk phenotypes, as well as the incidence of DGIs and DDGIs identified, supports the use of risk-based pharmacogenetic testing [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, this study had many more severe interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170905.t006">Table 6</xref>) than the Hocum et al study [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] likely because of higher average drug count (11.6 vs. 8.2). In addition, the mean age, percentage of patients who were 65+ years, and the racial differences were higher in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170905.s009">S4 Table</xref>). Also, the home health patients in this study are all being released from the hospital to home health, so they tend to be less well than a typical ambulatory patient.</p><p>The limitations of this study include small sample size, use of a randomized population within one institution and undetermined impact of the genetic testing on patient-provider interactions. Also, the average time to change drug therapy was approximately 3 weeks; only one week short of the 30-day time point which could have impacted the time-to-event outcome at 30 days. However, the benefits of pharmacogenetic profiling at 30 days are possible if the average time to change therapy is shortened, but the impact is still less certain since in some instances as it may take longer for the benefits of the intervention to materialize. This study was planned as a pilot study and therefore no power calculations were carried out. Despite the small size of the study, other factors such as age, gender, race and baseline health status (OASIS) were relatively balanced between the two study arms. Because of this balance, the small size of the study and the type of the outcomes, the analyses were not adjusted for covariates to avoid an increased type I error [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170905.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. When results were adjusted for categorical age all p-values were smaller than the corresponding unadjusted p-values. The unadjusted p-values presented in our results are thus appropriately more conservative compared to the adjusted p-values. Actual cost and charge data was not available. Therefore, cost savings were modeled based on Medicare average all-cause readmission [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and ED visit cost [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], resulting in a $4382 per patient cost savings in 60 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170905.s010">S5 Table</xref>) prior to the cost of intervention, resulting in decreased healthcare resource utilization. Follow-up was limited to 60 days post-discharge, but over time additional savings could increase the value obtained from the one-time expense of testing as the results can be used for ongoing patient management. A recently conducted cost-effectiveness analysis showed cost-savings when considering a one-time genetic test to avoid lifetime ADRs [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we conducted a pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial testing comprehensive medication management delivered by clinical pharmacists, incorporating pharmacogenetic testing along with appropriate CDST versus usual care. This home health trial mirrored a previously published prospective observational study which demonstrated that pharmacogenetic CYP testing of ambulatory elderly exposed to polypharmacy reduced hospitalizations by 39% and ED visits by 71% compared to a matched retrospective control cohort. This study offers a potentially important opportunity to minimize ADEs and reduce health resource utilization and marks an important step towards accomplishing the goals of the Triple Aim (improved care of the individual, improved health of the patient population and decreased per capital costs) [<xref rid="pone.0170905.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To further validate these findings, additional prospective confirmatory studies involving real-world applications in larger populations in the same and alternate settings are needed to broaden its acceptance in routine clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset used for the analysis.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s002"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s004"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Institutional Review Board approval from Harding University.</title><p>Also includes amendment submission and approval from IRB.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s005"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Description of the YouScript<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CDST and example of the personalized prescribing report.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of selected OASIS and PHQ-2 metrics between the two groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s007"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of patient diseases, disorders and related health problems between the two groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s008"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of the frequency of drugs prescribed between the two groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s009"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of differences in the demographic characteristics of patients between this trial and Hocum study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170905.s010"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Estimated financial savings from re-hospitalizations and ED visits reduction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170905.s010.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tyler Mamiya (Community Health Plan of WA), Brian Hocum (United Therapeutics), Vicki Pennington and Kelly Chism (Unity Health) for their involvement in conceptualization of this project; Richard Newman (Immune Express) for monitoring and administrative support of this study; Jarrod Heck for his comments on this manuscript and Daniel Rustan (Genelex Corporation) for creating the clinical capture database.
