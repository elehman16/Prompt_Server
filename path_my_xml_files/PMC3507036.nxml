Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA) is an effective way of supporting postoperative analgesia and has gained wide acceptance. In addition it used as a standard method to manage acute postoperative pain. Also it is well accepted by both patients and medical personnel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Physicians often choose IV-PCA because it has a simple route of administration and is safe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Today, cesarean delivery is a widespread surgical procedure with rising rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Thirty five percent of infants in Iran are delivered by caesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] After cesarean section, pain may reduce the ability of the mother for breast-feeding. Also it may harm the mother's ability to best care for her infant in the immediate postpartum period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, good analgesia is important after caesarean section because it will provide opportunities for mothers&#x02019; child bonding and hence leading to greater overall patient satisfaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Several studies compared the PCA with different routes of opioids administration for post-caesarean analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Other studies compared the PCA with different regimens to manage the pain after caesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In addition, in one study they compared the PCA with morphine in patients who underwent elective cesarean section under general anesthesia with different anesthetic techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Also, previous studies reported that in the postoperative pain after cardiac surgery, PCA is a better way in improving analgesia in comparing with traditional Nurse-Controlled Analgesia (NCA) treatment, so patients prefer it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>We could not find any information about comparisons between NCA and IV-PCA morphine and methadone for acute post-operative pain after cesarean section. Therefore, we decided to undertake a randomized clinical trial of NCA and IV-PCA morphine and methadone in a series of elective cesarean surgery patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial and conducted in the Sadi hospital in Iran, Isfahan; over an 8 months period from Apr 2010 to Nov 2010, Ethical approval was obtained from our hospital's ethics committee before recruitment. Patients were eligible for enrolment if they didn&#x02019;t have evidence of eclampsia, preeclampsic toxemia, bacteremia or coagulopathy, inability to use the PCA device, known allergy to any of the study medications, diabetes mellitus and history of drug abuse. Written informed consent was recorded from subjects who agreed to participate.</p><p>350 women who requested general anesthesia for elective cesarean section were randomly assigned to the three groups using a computer-generated number list. Group I (n=200) were assigned to receive IV-PCA morphine, group II (n=100) to receive IV-PCA methadone and group III (n=50) to receive NCA morphine.</p><p>As the general anesthesia resolved, patients received IV-PCA or NCA when they were admitted to the post-anesthesia care unit and were awake, able to answer questions and follow commands. The total volume of IV-PCA medication was determined to be 100 cc, consisting of 10 mg solution of morphine or 5 mg solution of methadone. The continuous IV-PCA regimens consisted of 4 cc/h (0.4 mg of morphine solution or 0.2 mg of methadone solution), with 15 min lockout time and bolus of 1 cc (0.1 mg of morphine solution or 0.05 mg of methadone solution). The NCA regimen consisted of a 10 mg/1cc solution of morphine with a dose of 5 mg, given every 5 hour based on patients requested and nursing.</p><p>Data collection included the number of injections actually delivered by the PCA, the number of demands by each patient to nurse administer, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, VAS patient satisfaction score, sedation score and the incidence of nausea and vomiting and pruritis. Pain intensity was measured on a10 point VAS that ranged from &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; (no pain) to &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; (worst possible pain). Overall satisfaction was assessed by using a 10 point scale (o = no satisfaction to 10 = best satisfaction).</p><p>Study measurements in 24 hour were taken at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 9 hand 24 h. Patients had been in the post-anesthesia care unit for maximum 30 minutes and the time when they were admitted to the ward was designate as time 0 for the purpose of assessment.</p><p>All analyses were done with the use of PASW software (version 18). Data are presented as means &#x000b1; 1SD, median (IQR) or number (percent) as appropriate. Repeated Measurement of ANOVA was used to compare trend of pain score during 24 hours follow-up. One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean of age, Kruskal-wallis was used to compare median of pain, satisfaction and sedation score (24h) and chi-square was used to compare incidence of nausea and vomiting and pruritis among groups. <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 17 patients who did not enter the study, 11 patients met the screening criteria but refused consent and 6 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria.

Pain decreases the ability to function and interferes with maternal care of the newborn. Sever postoperative pain is also associated with longer postoperative stay, nausea and vomiting, reduced cough, sputum retention, atelectasis, hypoxemia and increased risk of cardiac events].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The present study hypothesized the differences between IV-PCA morphine or methadone with NCA morphine for pain management after caesarean section and demonstrated that in the first 24 hours after caesarean section, IV-PCA methadone or morphine provided more effective analgesia than NCA with morphine. VAS pain score was significantly decreased in the IV-PCA group. Also patient satisfaction with postoperative analgesia was significantly increased in the IV-PCA group as compared with the control group. The prevalence of nausea and vomiting in NCA group was more than IV-PCA groups like sedation and pruritis, but just the differences between groups for pruritis was significant.</p><p>Because of limitation in trials to compared NCA with IV-PCA after cesarean section -previous trials mostly evaluated the PCA with different routes of opioids administration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and different regimens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] for post caesarean analgesia- we were unable to find similar studies to compare our results, but in a meta-analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and a systematic review[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] of randomized trials that compared NCA with IV-PCA with opioids in the postoperative pain after cardiac surgery, the authors reported evidence that supports the efficacy of IV-PCA versus NCA which are similar with the findings of the present study in cesarean population. Also in contrast of our results Andrew <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] in a randomized trial showed that nurse-administered subcutaneous morphine is a satisfactory alternative to IV-PCA after cardiac surgery. Lim <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] compared intrathecal (IT), epidural (EP) and IV-PCA morphine for post-caesarean section analgesia. And concluded that the use of IT and EP morphine were associated with lower pain scores than IV-PCA. Also both EP and IT morphine were associated with a greater risk of pruritis than IV-PCA which is similar with the present study that showed the prevalence of pruritis in IV-PCA group was lower than NCA group even though study groups were different in both trails.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study showed that the use of IV-PCA was associated with lower pain scores when compared with NCA. Also the use of IV-PCA methadone enhanced the efficacy of analgesia of IV-PCA morphine. Future trials should focus on patient and surgical variables effect on IV-PCA. And cost-effectiveness studies will be needed to find out whether the usual use of PCA should be advocated in place of NCA in post-cesarean surgical patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
