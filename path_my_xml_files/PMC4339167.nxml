rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) on stride length, cadence, and gait speed in healthy young
females. The findings of this study might be used as clinical guidance of physical therapy
for choosing the suitable frequency of RAC. [Subjects] Thirteen healthy young females were
recruited in this study. [Methods] Ten meters walking tests were measured in all subjects
under 4 conditions with each repeated 3 times and a 3-min seated rest period between
repetitions. Subjects first walked as usual and then were asked to listen carefully to the
rhythm of a metronome and walk with 3 kinds of RAC (90%, 100%, and 110% of the mean
cadence). The three frequencies (90%, 100%, and 110%) of RAC were randomly assigned. Gait
speed, stride length, and cadence were calculated, and a statistical analysis was
performed using the SPSS (version 17.0) computer package. [Results] The gait speed and
cadence of 90% RAC walking showed significant decreases compared with normal walking and
100% and 110% RAC walking. The stride length, cadence, and gait speed of 110% RAC walking
showed significant increases compared with normal walking and 90% and 100% RAC walking.
[Conclusion] Our results showed that 110% RAC was the best of the 3 cueing frequencies for
improvement of stride length, cadence, and gait speed in healthy young females.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rhythmic auditory cueing</kwd><kwd>Frequency</kwd><kwd>Gait speed</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Walking is one of the most basic movements of human beings. Detecting the gait parameters
of human beings while walking have an important significance for evaluating the recovery of
motor function as well as guiding the rehabilitation treatment of clinical patients. The
gait speed, which is simple, sensitive, and reliable, is a commonly used index for
evaluating walking ability. In addition, cadence and stride length are two important
elements of gait speed, which complement each other and are correlated<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The gait of the elderly is unstable, and their walking rhythm is disordered. Gait speed and
stride length decrease significantly, and the fall risk increases. Parkinson patients have
an abnormal posture and gait pattern, which are characterized by decreased stride length,
reduced gait speed, and rhythm disorders. As for stroke patients, gait speed, stride length,
cadence, and single support duration are also decreased, while the double support duration
is increased. Gait rhythm perturbations are present in both the elderly and people with
Parkinson disease (PD) and stroke. In order to solve the abovementioned problems, rhythmic
cueing currently has achieved great progress in Parkinson and stroke treatment<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, rhythmic cueing is receiving much
more attention with respect to improvement of walking ability in the elderly and fall
prevention<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rhythmic cueing is divided into 3 categories, namely, auditory, visual, and somatosensory
cues. Auditory rhythmic cueing is mostly chosen in walking treatment, with the cues produced
by a metronome<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous reports indicate that the use of acoustic rhythms is a more effective method of
practice in stroke patients gait rehabilitation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the gait parameters and synchronization of adults with
severe traumatic brain injury were improved with 100% rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) and
110% RAC; gait speed, stride length, and cadence all increased<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subsequently, in the presence of auditory rhythmic cues, stride
length, cadence, and gait speed increased in patients with PD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although sufficient evidence has been found to support that auditory rhythmic cueing can
improve walking ability in previous literature, there is lack of basic research and a
uniform standard for the RAC frequency, and there are many controversies concerning the most
suitable frequency for the auditory rhythm. Different frequencies of RAC were used in
different studies, and the gait parameters changed differently. Further research should be
conducted to study the influence of different auditory rhythms on gait.</p><p>Therefore, this paper explores the stride length, cadence, and gait speed with rhythmic
auditory cueing using three commonly used frequencies (namely, 90%, 100%, and 110%) in
healthy young females by using the RAC as a stimulus. The purpose of the study was as
preliminary research for figuring out which frequency of RAC is the best for improvement of
gait parameters as well as to offer clinical guidance of physical therapy for choosing the
suitable frequency of RAC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 13 young people (females). The subjects&#x02019; characteristics are detailed in

gave their informed consent to participation in the study. The IRB approval number was
2014-5, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Capital Medical
University.</p><p>The tools used in the experiment included a 10&#x02005;m tape, stopwatch, colored adhesive tapes,
and a metronome.</p><p>For the study environment, we prepared a clean and quiet environment with a suitable
temperature and a cement floor. Walking test points were marked along a flat 16-m distance
in a straight line, a start point, 3&#x02005;m point, 13&#x02005;m point, and end point with colored
adhesive tapes.</p><p>In each test, the subjects were asked to walk a total of 16&#x02005;m. To eliminate acceleration
and deceleration effects, only the middle 10&#x02005;m distance was used for calculations. Firstly,
subjects walked as usual 3 times with 3 minutes of seated rest between repetitions. Then,
the subjects&#x02019; mean cadences of normal walking were calculated and then converted to 90%,
100%, and 110% of the mean cadence. The three kinds of RAC (90%, 100%, and 110%) were
randomly assigned. Then subjects were asked to listen carefully to the rhythm of the
metronome and walked three times with 3 minutes of seated rest between repetitions. The
metronome could be heard clearly by young females and was not thought to be too noisy. Gait
speed, stride length, and cadence were calculated.</p><p>In order to determine the main effect of the 3 intervention methods, one-way analysis of
variance with Bonferroni correction was used; the factor was the walking condition. The data
were analyzed by using SPSS Ver. 17.0 of Windows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results for stride length, cadence, and gait speed under four conditions (normal

frequencies showed obvious statistical significance. The 100% RAC showed no significant
difference in gait speed under the normal walking conditions. The results also showed that
the gait speed and cadence for 90% RAC walking showed a significant decrease compared with
normal walking and 100% and 110% RAC walking. The stride length, cadence, and gait speed of
110% RAC walking showed significant increases compared with normal walking and 90% and 100%
RAC walking. Comparison of normal walking with 100% RAC walking revealed no significant
variation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Under the three frequencies of RAC, stride length, cadence, and gait speed showed different
changes, with the stride length, cadence, and gait speed during 110% RAC walking all showing
significant increases. Therefore, the 110% RAC was the best cueing frequency among the 3
frequencies used to improve the stride length, cadence, and gait speed in healthy young
females.</p><p>Under higher rhythmic auditory cueing, the strength of the nerve impulse issued by the
central motor and the accuracy increase. Therefore, the regulation of skeletal muscle by the
central nervous system can strengthen the coordination between the agonistic muscle and
antagonistic muscle. When the agonistic muscle is contracting, the antagonistic muscle will
fully relax, which can greatly reduce the internal resistance, increase the lower limb joint
movement amplitude, and improve the switching frequency of the lower limb. Furthermore, some
studies indicate that the RAC can increase the excitability of the spinal motor neurons via
the reticulospinal tract and reduce the muscle reaction time in response to motor commands
so as to improve the gait speed<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, 110% RAC can result in a significant increase in stride length, cadence, and gait
speed.</p><p>In a future study, apart from RAC walking training, rhythmic auditory cueing can be applied
to the training of robot-assisted walking, for example ManBuzhe (Tian Jin) Rehabilitation
Equipemnt Co., Ltd., in stroke patients, spinal cord injury patients, and even orthopedic
disorders patients. It is expected that it can play an active role in weight support and
auxiliary active treatment through rhythmic auditory cueing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the &#x0201c;Research on Design Theory and Compliant Control for
