Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a sulfur-based nutritional supplement that is purported to have pain and inflammation-reducing effects. To investigate the effects of MSM in attenuating damage associated with physical exertion, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of MSM supplementation on exercise-induced pain, oxidative stress and muscle damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Twenty-two healthy females (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) and males (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) (age 33.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.9&#x000a0;yrs.) were recruited from the 2014 Portland Half-Marathon registrant pool. Participants were randomized to take either MSM (OptiMSM&#x000ae;) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11), or a placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11) at 3&#x000a0;g/day for 21&#x000a0;days prior to the race and for two days after (23 total). Participants provided blood samples for measurement of markers of oxidative stress, and completed VAS surveys for pain approximately one month prior to the race (T<sub>0</sub>), and at 15&#x000a0;min (T<sub>1</sub>), 90&#x000a0;min (T<sub>2</sub>), 1&#x000a0;Day (T<sub>3</sub>), and 2&#x000a0;days (T<sub>4</sub>) after race finish. The primary outcome measure 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) measured oxidative stress. Secondary outcomes included malondialdehyde (MDA) for oxidative stress, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as measures of muscle damage, and muscle (MP) and joint pain (JP) recorded using a 100&#x000a0;mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Data were analyzed using repeated and multivariate ANOVAs, and simple contrasts compared post-race time points to baseline, presented as mean (SD) or mean change (95% CI) where appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Running a half-marathon induced significant increases in all outcome measures (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

The number of Americans finishing organized running races has risen from approximately 4.2 million in 1990 to over 15.5 million in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The total active membership of USA Triathlon has grown from just under 65,000 in 1994 to over half a million in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This trend is indicative of an increase in exhaustive training programs. Intermediate runners training for a half-marathon run an average of 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;miles per week, and can often exceed 35&#x000a0;miles per week in the three months before the race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Exhaustive exercise increases oxygen consumption and stimulates mitochondria and lymphocytes, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At low to moderate levels, RONS are critical for cellular regulation of gene expression and cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In muscle cells, they act as signals for cell adaptation and are thus necessary for muscle growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At high levels they become destructive to tissues, damaging cells and inhibiting muscle growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Oxidative stress or damage occurs when RONS react with cellular constituents and deform the constituent to an unusable form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Two primary groups of biological constituents damaged by oxidative stress are DNA bases and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. High levels of RONS become genotoxic when in contact with DNA. Guanine has the lowest oxidation potential of the four bases and thus is most commonly oxidized, forming 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). When the body repairs the damage 8-OHdG is removed and excreted, becoming a marker for the oxidative stress. This damage, although possible in most tissues, occurs primarily in muscle tissue and circulating lymphocytes. DNA damage occurring as a result of oxidative stress may play an important role in the etiology of cancer, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Lipids within the cell membrane are also damaged when high levels of RONS are present in the body. Oxidation of fatty acids in the membrane result in lipids degrading into malondialdehyde (MDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MDA is a mutagenic byproduct and reacts with deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine in DNA, forming DNA adducts, and is itself damaging to the body, sometimes causing cell lysis and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Breaking of muscle cells releases creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the blood stream &#x02013; two enzymes found at high levels in muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, 8-OHdG, a measure of oxidative stress, was chosen as the primary outcome measure. The secondary measure of MDA also measured oxidative stress. The secondary outcomes of muscle damage were measured through cellular enzymes (CK and LDH), and muscle pain and joint pain were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS).</p><p id="Par25">Physical training adapts the body to higher levels of RONS and increases its ability to manage the excess oxidative potential. However, long bouts of exercise still produce an unmanageable amount of oxidative stress. It has been suggested that the relationship between health and exercise is U-shaped, with negative health outcomes present both at low and very high levels of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many negative health outcomes associated with very high levels of exercise are caused by excessive oxidative stress on the tissues. These outcomes include increased muscle fatigue, lower force production, and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a small sulfur-based molecule comprised of a sulfur atom with two double-bonded oxygen atoms and two methyl groups. It is a naturally occurring molecule found in a variety of foods including fruits, vegetables, grains and milk. Although it is most commonly supplemented to improve joint health, recent studies indicate that MSM may also be effective in seasonal allergic rhinitis, interstitial cystitis, autoimmune disease and cancer chemoprevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that it has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although MSM, when ingested, has an antioxidative effect in vivo, the molecule itself does not directly quench oxidant activity. Instead, MSM reduces the body&#x02019;s production of RONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It takes repeated doses over at least one week for MSM to build to an efficacious level within the body. This characteristic comes from its quick absorption rate and slower excretion rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In animal models, MSM has been shown to bolster the antioxidative capacity of cells compared to placebo controls, suggesting the presence of protective physiological pathways. In one study, MSM significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and IL-1&#x003b2;, while increasing glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another study showed that MSM pre-treatment significantly attenuated damaging effects of acetaminophen including decreased GSH and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and increased MDA and MPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats, one study found significantly lower levels of CAT, SOD, and GSH in the hypertensive rats, and these levels recovered to control levels in MSM-treated rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Initial human exercise studies have suggested that MSM supplementation may reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage. In untrained males, supplementation of 50&#x000a0;mg/kg/day reduced levels of MDA, PC, and oxidized glutathione after an acute bout of exercise, when compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and 50&#x000a0;mg/kg/day MSM supplementation increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced CK and bilirubin levels after exhaustive exercise compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Another study evaluating moderately-trained men noted reduction in muscle soreness and fatigue with increased MSM dosage, while trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) increased and homocysteine decreased at 3.0&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies suggest that MSM may bolster pathways that protect against excessive oxidative stress from exercise.</p><p id="Par29">These studies evaluated untrained and moderately-trained men. The effects of MSM on trained individuals and women is still unknown. Determining MSM&#x02019;s effectiveness on trained individuals is important because it is the population to most likely benefit from reduced oxidative and muscle damage. In addition, the current study was designed to observe the effects of MSM in a real-world application. We hypothesized that supplementing MSM at 3&#x000a0;g/day for three weeks reduces the oxidative damage induced by a bout of exhaustive exercise, and that the reduction of oxidative stress results in reduced muscle damage and subsequently reduces muscle soreness and joint pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par30">Included participants were in good health and between the ages of 21 and 45; all participants were recruited from the registrant pool of the Portland Half Marathon. Participants were excluded if they had taken MSM in the past month, warfarin, corticosteroids or statins in the past three months, used tobacco in the past six months, were pregnant or nursing, or if they were peri- or postmenopausal. In order to reduce variation in training regimens, competition in a race of greater than a 5&#x000a0;K within the month prior to the race was considered a basis for exclusion. Potential participants were excluded if they had ever participated in a full marathon, participated in a half-marathon during previous six months, or participated in more than three half-marathons during previous three years. Previous race history was used to exclude highly trained individuals and provide a study population of participants who could be considered &#x0201c;weekend warriors.&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par31">Potential participants were screened for initial eligibility via a telephone call and then scheduled for a baseline visit. At the baseline visits, participants gave informed consent and then completed an eligibility and health questionnaire, a training log capturing training information for three prior days, and listed medication and supplement use. This study was approved by the National University of Natural Medicine Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="Par32">This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of MSM on oxidative stress, cell damage and pain caused by exhaustive exercise. Twenty-four participants were randomized to receive either MSM or placebo at a dose of 3&#x000a0;g/day for three weeks preceding the Portland Half-Marathon. Blood serum and pain-scale questionnaires were collected approximately one month prior to the race day (baseline), and again 15&#x000a0;min, 90&#x000a0;min, 1&#x000a0;day and 2&#x000a0;days post-race. Serum samples were analyzed for the primary outcome measure 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and malondialdehyde (MDA); both are markers of oxidative stress. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured as markers of muscle damage.

The start and finish lines for the race were both in downtown Portland. Decisions on training regimens, diet, and competitive goals were left to individual participants. The study did not collect pre-race training or dietary information. Participants completed a 24&#x000a0;h recall form for alcohol consumption at each time point, but were only asked to abstain from alcohol between the 15&#x000a0;min and 90&#x000a0;min post-race visits.</p><p id="Par35">Participants took MSM or placebo starting three weeks prior to the race and continued until two days afterward.

A reduction of 10&#x000a0;mm or greater is generally accepted as clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The reduction of 19.8&#x000a0;mm for muscle pain, although not statistically significant, is bolstered by its clinical relevance. Between-group outcomes for joint pain resulted in clinically significant lower pain levels of between 9 and 10&#x000a0;mm. Although the results did not reach statistical significance, the clinically significant effect combined with similar results across two pain measures suggests that MSM may be effective in reducing exercise-induced pain.</p><p id="Par51">While no between-group comparisons reached statistical significance at any time point, there was a statistical trend for lower 8-OHdG levels in the Placebo group two days after the race. The differences in 8-OHdG between MSM and Placebo groups that occurred at one and two days after the race appear to have occurred in part due to Placebo group levels falling below baseline. Treatment appeared to have almost no effect on the muscle damage markers CK and LDH. Logarithmically adjusted CK levels were slightly higher in the MSM group at each time point, but differences were minimal and statistically equivalent. Group comparisons for LDH showed slightly lower levels in the MSM group for race day time points, and slightly higher levels in the one and two day time points.</p><p id="Par52">This study aimed at recruiting a group of participants who are not year-round competitive runners, but rather people who have decided to enter a race as a means of increasing their exercise for personal accomplishment, or for social benefits. By having a group of participants who were not overly trained, we hoped to create a group for which running a half-marathon would induce a measurable oxidative stress response. Because the body adapts to exercise, a group of highly trained individuals may not have a strong oxidative stress response to running a distance that is regularly achieved. Overall, the recruitment criteria were effective in creating a study group reflective of this larger population. A key element in this success was recruiting from a pool of people who already opted-in to running the race. The study group was slightly overweight, had an average age of 35&#x000a0;years, and completed the race in just over two and a half hours, on average. Body mass index was similar to U.S. population, age was similar to all half-marathon participants, and race time was slightly higher than overall U.S. average times &#x02013; reflective of first or second attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A higher number of female runners is typical in distance running, but our study did not include enough men to reasonably test for potential gender differences in outcome measurements. However, because women are an underrepresented group in studies of this type, we consider the high number of female participants in our study population to be a strength of our study.</p><p id="Par53">Three previous studies evaluating the effects of MSM on untrained men showed significant reductions in the oxidative stress markers MDA and protein carbonyls, a reduction in the muscle damage markers CK and bilirubin, as well as an increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These studies used a similar exercise intervention (14&#x000a0;km run) as the present study. Another clinical trial showed MSM supplementation at 3&#x000a0;g/day increased trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) in moderately trained males after completing knee extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is differing study populations. The study population was comprised of moderately trained participants. It is possible that the ability of MSM to attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage in untrained and moderately-trained men does not work in broader populations, including women, populations with higher BMIs, and varying training levels. In addition, knee extensions have a very different effect on physiological pathways than running a half-marathon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Interestingly, the results of this study suggest that MSM supplementation may simultaneously reduce muscle and joint pain, yet increase oxidative stress markers. It also suggests a correlation between higher levels of oxidative stress and muscle pain (data not shown). Although statistical significance was not reached in the group comparisons, overall patterns seem to place these findings at odds. This discrepancy may have resulted from the lack of a true baseline measurement. Baseline levels were measured approximately one month prior to the race, representing a pre-training measurement rather than a pre-race measurement. A pre-training baseline measurement is not able to account for varying training regimens, which have a considerable impact on oxidative stress responses. A measurement either the night before or immediately before the race would have provided a better representation of a pre-race baseline level. A baseline blood-draw was not taken directly before the race due to logistical constraints and the excessive burden it would have placed on the participants.</p><p id="Par55">If the discrepancy did not result from a lack of true baseline, MSM must reduce pain through a separate mechanism of action. Several studies have indicated that MSM may have anti-inflammatory properties. MSM has been shown to reduce levels of NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2;, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and the activation of inflammasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is possible that the reduction in pain stems from a reduction in inflammation.</p><p id="Par56">The body adapts to repetitive exercise, including attenuation of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is especially true for habitual exercise routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and it is common for the intensity of training regimens to be highest the month prior to the race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Differences in training, individual response to training, and level of individual athleticism in the month prior to the race can have major impacts on normal levels of oxidative stress and muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Oxidative stress levels in this study were lower at one and two days after the race than at baseline, indicating a biochemical adaptation occurred during the month between baseline and the race. Furthermore, previous research gives no evidence that training regimens affect normal, or baseline pain levels. Therefore the baseline pain measurements, unlike the serum measurements, were likely similar at the start of the race to those measured one month prior, and resulted in changes more reflective of previous research.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par57">Although the group was largely reflective of the targeted population, males were underrepresented and recruitment did not meet goals for number of participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The low number (<italic>n</italic> = 5) of male participants prohibited adjusting for gender in statistical analysis, as the low representation would make results highly unreliable. The original aim was to have 32 participants finish the study as per the power calculations conducted on 8-OHdG. Recruitment was hindered by an unexpectedly high percentage of race participants residing in areas not amenable to study involvement. Fortunately, a strong study design and effective incentives reduced the drop-out rate and maximized data capture. It was assumed that 25% of recruited participants would drop from the study. The study ended with a dropout rate of 8% (2/24).</p><p id="Par58">8-OHdG was chosen as the primary outcome measure because of its novelty as a serum marker of exercise-induced oxidative stress. In prior exercise studies, it was more common to use urine 8-OHdG levels, while serum markers have more commonly been used in studies analyzing food or drug impacts on oxidative stress. Although investigating unique markers can result in a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action, the lack of prior research has a limiting effect on study design and implementation. Furthermore, analysis of 8-OHdG was performed through competitive ELISA, which introduced inter-assay variability. This was addressed in part by ensuring that all time points from a single individual were assayed together, thus removing any inter-assay variability from time point changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">The study suggests that MSM supplementation may attenuate exercise-induced muscle and joint pain at clinically relevant levels, but that it does not reduce post-exercise markers of oxidative stress or muscle damage from pre-training levels. We also observed that running a half-marathon reliably induces muscle and joint pain, oxidative stress and muscle damage, over a predictable time course. It still remains uncertain whether MSM supplementation attenuates exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage from pre-race levels, or whether results observed in previous research only apply to narrow populations. Further research on the effects of MSM on pre-exercise levels of oxidative stress and muscle damage, and research examining the effects of MSM supplementation on post-exercise pain among a larger sample of broadly-trained participants is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>8-OHdG</term><def><p id="Par5">8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p id="Par6">Catalase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p id="Par7">Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOMS</term><def><p id="Par8">Delayed onset muscle soreness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSH</term><def><p id="Par9">Glutathione</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRI</term><def><p id="Par10">Helfgott Research Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p id="Par11">Lactate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDA</term><def><p id="Par12">Malondialdehyde</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPO</term><def><p id="Par13">Myeloperoxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSM</term><def><p id="Par14">Methylsulfonylmethane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NUNM</term><def><p id="Par15">National University of Natural Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p id="Par16">Protein carbonyls</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RONS</term><def><p id="Par17">Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD</term><def><p id="Par18">Superoxide dismutase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAC</term><def><p id="Par19">Total antioxidant capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAC</term><def><p id="Par20">Tolox equivalent antioxidant capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par21">Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Morgan Schafer and Dr. Jennifer Ryan who have contributed in numerous ways to this study, Mamie Wheeler and the entire staff of the Portland Marathon, and Susan Holmes whose skill and expertise in phlebotomy helped participant involvement.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par60">The supplements and placebo in this study were supplied by Bergstrom, which sells products related to the research described in this paper.
