Although they provide maximal stability, they are also associated with interference on imaging modalities, may induce stress shielding, and additional explantation procedures may be necessary. Alternatively, degradable polymer implants are mechanically weaker and induce foreign body reactions. Degradable magnesium-based stents are currently being investigated in clinical trials for use in cardiovascular medicine. The magnesium alloy MgYREZr demonstrates good biocompatibility and osteoconductive properties. The aim of this prospective, randomized, clinical pilot trial was to determine if magnesium-based MgYREZr screws are equivalent to standard titanium screws for fixation during chevron osteotomy in patients with a mild hallux valgus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients (n=26) were randomly assigned to undergo osteosynthesis using either titanium or degradable magnesium-based implants of the same design. The 6 month follow-up period included clinical, laboratory, and radiographic assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No significant differences were found in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score for hallux, visual analog scale for pain assessment, or range of motion (ROM) of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ).

Although these implants provide maximum stability, these nondegradable materials interfere with imaging modalities, such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, and often require an undesirable second operation to remove the implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, the mechanical properties of nondegradable implants (steel or titanium) are quite different from those of cortical bone, potentially resulting in inhomogeneous stress transfer and limiting the bone-healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This constellation of effects defines &#x0201c;stress shielding.&#x0201d; Therefore, it might be beneficial to use implants material with a Young&#x02019;s modulus close to that of cortical bone.</p><p>Currently, the most commonly used degradable implants are polymer-based. These are mechanically weaker than metallic devices and are associated with foreign body reactions and osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the first magnesium-based implants used at the beginning of the 20th century exhibited high corrosion rates that consequently generated subcutaneous gas cavities and reduced mechanical stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently developed magnesium-based implants demonstrate improved anticorrosive and mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Degradable magnesium-based intravascular stents (WE43) yield good clinical results and are biocompatible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The present study investigated the use of the MAGNEZIX&#x000ae; compression screw (Syntellix AG, Hannover, Germany). MAGNEZIX&#x000ae; is an aluminum-free magnesium alloy that is classified as an MgYREZr alloy according to DIN EN 1753. This alloy contains rare earth elements and is compositionally similar to WE43. It has already demonstrated good biocompatibility and osteoconductive quality <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The chevron osteotomy is a distal &#x0201c;V-shaped&#x0201d; metatarsal osteotomy that was first described by Austin and Leventen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is the operative option used to treat mild to moderate hallux valgus deformities. The angle of the &#x0201c;V&#x0201d; is about 60&#x000b0; and results in the impaction of the fragments without osteosynthesis. Recent studies have reported modification of the angulation and range of the limbs. The use of a greater angle and horizontal osteotomy can maximize the contact surface, but osteosynthesis would be necessary because fewer fragments would be impacted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Loss of fixation and, consequently, malunions and pseudarthrosis, have been reported following surgery without fixation. Various studies have reported using K-wires, screws, staples, and plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; however, screw fixation is mechanically superior to other modes of fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical trial was to determine if the MgYREZr alloy-based screw (MAGNEZIX&#x000ae;) demonstrates equivalent clinical and radiographic outcomes to standard titanium screws in hallux valgus surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This prospective, randomized controlled study (according to EN ISO 14155&#x02013;1:2009 and EN ISO 14155&#x02013;2:2009) was approved by the ethics committee of medical school hannover, monitored by an independent trial center, and conformed to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The implants were made of a powdered metallurgically processed magnesium alloy: this aluminum-free material consists of MgYREZr (a material similar to WE43) that contains &#x0003e;90 wt% magnesium. With an average grain size of &#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m, this high-performance alloy demonstrates an offset elastic limit of R<sub>p0.2</sub>&#x0003e;250 MPa, tensile strength &#x0003e;275 MPa, and percent elongation at break &#x0003e;10%.

Lateral release was performed over an incision that was placed between the first and second metatarsal bones. The musculus adductor hallucis tendon was released, and the lateral sesamoid was mobilized. The medial approach was performed according to the technique described by Waizy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The exostoses were removed, and the center of the metatarsal head was marked with a 1.2 mm K-wire. An oscillating saw was used to perform a 90&#x000b0; chevron osteotomy. The distal fragment was displaced to the lateral side, and osteosynthesis was performed according to the patient group. Temporary fixation with a threaded K-wire (1.2 mm) was performed at the desired position of the screw. Intraoperative X-rays were acquired to verify correct K-wire positioning and determine screw length. A two-step pilot drillbit was used to make the countersunk hole in the head.</p><p>In the titanium group (TI), the compression screw was turned to generate compression, and the K-wire was removed after the screw was positioned. In the degradable group (DI), additional predrilling was performed using a 2.0 mm diameter hand-operated drill. The MgYREZr degradable compression screw was then inserted to generate compression, and the K-wire was removed after the screw was positioned.</p><p>The overriding bone of the proximal metatarsal fragment was removed using an oscillating saw. The tourniquet was released, and the skin was sutured. Postoperative bandages were applied by holding the big toe in the correct position.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiography</title><p>All radiographs were conducted under standardized, weight-bearing conditions at V1, V3, and V6&#x02013;8. Posterior-anterior radiographs were used to measure the hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and the distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA). To determine the axis of the first metatarsal bone, a line was drawn from the center of the head through the center of the base of the first metatarsal bone. This is considered the most precise, least biased method for determining postoperative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The big toe was held and stabilized in the correct position using hallux valgus wool and crepe bandages for 6 weeks, and the bandages were changed twice a week. Physiotherapy with only passive MTPJ mobilization was initiated after the removal of the first dressings. Sutures were removed 2 weeks after surgery (V5).

In the present study, no implant removals were necessary during the first 6 months after surgery. This may be attributable to the design of the screw, which lacked a prominent screw head. The implant removal rate due to soft tissue irritation was reported to be low with the head design of the Herbert screw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, because this study had a relatively short follow-up period and reduced irritation due to the screw head design, it was difficult to show the potential benefit of degradable screws given the reduction in redundant surgery.</p><p>Degradable implants are currently in clinical use for fixation in chevron osteotomy. The clinical outcome is excellent for both degradable and nondegradable implants. Caminear et al. retrospectively studied a series of 18 chevron osteotomies fixed with copolymer pins and observed high AOFAS scores (87.4&#x000b1;14.9) and only one giant cell granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The AOFAS score for hallux is not validated; however, it is the most used clinical scoring system. Small et al. conducted a retrospective study of 71 chevron osteotomies fixed with degradable polymer pins and reported a 100% bone healing rate, but osteolysis appeared in 5.6% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The only previous comparative study (chevron osteotomy: polymer pins vs. permanent K-wires) was reported by Gill et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. No differences were found regarding the prevalence of clinical symptomatic complications, but osteolysis was observed in 10.2% of patients in the polymer-based group. In our study, 3 (2 DI and 1 TI) patients experienced delayed wound healing. Further studies with a greater number of patients are necessary to identify a possible clinical difference.</p><p>Stable fixation with accelerated bone healing reduces immobilization time and the risk of developing joint stiffness. In contrast to polymer-based implants, magnesium alloys showed promising biomechanical results <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The in vivo results also attributed an osteoconductive quality to the magnesium alloy MgYREZr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This would facilitate early bone healing, and consequently, faster mobilization with early recovery, which would potentially benefit the patients. Further studies should test this osteoconductive hypothesis by measuring bone healing velocity.</p><p>The use of degradable magnesium implants is controversial. The degradation process produces hydrogen gas, and gas cavities have been described. The source of the gas cavities remains an issue of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In clinical use, gas formation would be an obstacle to bone and wound healing. Waizy et al. performed a rabbit study with a 1 year follow-up to test the alloy MgYREZr and found no bone erosion due to gas cavities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Corrosion occurs in both degradable and permanent implants. Implant wear may cause the accumulation of particles around implants that stimulate inflammation, osteoclast activation, and osteoblast inhabitation. This pathway induces osteolysis and may also trigger hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Witte et al. previously demonstrated that the magnesium alloy WE43 was nonallergenic in an epicutaneous patch test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. MgYREZr is similar to WE43; therefore, we hypothesized that it may also have a nonallergic composition. We did not observe any cases of allergic reaction during follow-up.</p><p>The degradation of a magnesium alloy can potentially induce a systemic inflammatory reaction or pathologic changes in visceral organs. However, to date, no <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have reported either of those adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Waizy et al. postulated that MgYREZr would have good biocompatibility due to the absence of acute, subacute, and chronic systematic inflammatory reactions and the absence of specific pathologic changes in the visceral organs in an <italic>in vivo</italic> study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present clinical study confirmed the good clinical outcome hypothesized for this degradable magnesium alloy.</p><p>The primary limitation of this study was the relatively short follow-up time, and future studies should be focused on long-term consequences. We set the endpoint of the study at 6 months follow-up because this was the typical endpoint for operative hallux valgus therapy at our institution. At 6 months, complete bone healing should be attained, and further radiographic controls should not be necessary. We were not able to verify complete screw degradation; however, based on <italic>in vivo</italic> results from Waizy et al., it is reasonable to assume that the magnesium alloy was completely or nearly completely degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Another limitation of our study was the relatively low statistical power of the radiographic measurements. However, we could show an equivalent clinical outcome, and we did not observe pseudarthrosis or other implant-associated complications. The strength of this study is that it is the first prospective, randomized, single surgeon study to investigate a degradable, magnesium-based implant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study demonstrated that the degradable magnesium-based screw was radiographically and clinically equivalent to the conventional titanium screw. We did not observe any instances of foreign body reaction, osteolysis, or systemic inflammatory reaction. Larger prospective randomized trials with a longer follow-up are needed to confirm the findings of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AOFAS: American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society; DI: Degradable group; DMAA: Distal metartarsal angle; HVA: Hallux valgus angle; IMA: Intermetatarsal angle; MTPJ: Metatarsophalangeal joint; ROM: Range of motion; TI: Titanium group; VAS: Visual analog scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Mr. Robert Schavan is employed by the company Syntellix; he has not influenced the collection of data or its interpretation.
