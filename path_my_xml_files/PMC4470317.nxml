this study was to assess the beneficial effects of long-term regular RIPre on human
arteries. Forty patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
were assigned randomly to a RIPre group (n=20) or coronary heart disease (CHD) group
(n=20). Twenty patients scheduled for mastectomy were enrolled as a control group.
RIPre was achieved by occluding arterial blood flow 5 min with a mercury
sphygmomanometer followed by a 5-min reperfusion period, and this was repeated 4
times. The RIPre procedure was repeated 3 times a day for 20 days. In all patients,
arterial fragments discarded during surgery were collected to evaluate endothelial
function by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), CD34<sup>+</sup> monocyte count, and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS expression). Phosphorylation levels of STAT-3
and Akt were also assayed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Compared with the CHD
group, long-term regular RIPre significantly improved FMD after 20 days (8.5&#x000b1;2.4
<italic>vs</italic> 4.9&#x000b1;4.2%, P&#x0003c;0.05) and significantly reduced troponin after
CABG surgery (0.72&#x000b1;0.31 and 1.64&#x000b1;0.19, P&#x0003c;0.05). RIPre activated STAT-3 and
increased CD34<sup>+</sup> endothelial progenitor cell counts found in arteries.
Long-term, regular RIPre improved endothelial function in patients with CHD, possibly
due to STAT-3 activation, and this may have led to an increase in endothelial
progenitor cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Remote ischemic preconditioning</kwd><kwd>endothelial function</kwd><kwd>coronary heart disease</kwd><kwd>STAT-3</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies have shown that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPre) can reduce infarct size
and decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury, making it an attractive, novel strategy to
prevent myocardial injury (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It has been shown to be effective in reducing
myocardial reperfusion injuries in both experimental and clinical settings (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Recently, the application of RIPre for patients
with acute myocardial infarction during ambulance transit was shown to reduce infarct
size, but the mechanism is largely unknown (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) activation is thought to
play a cardioprotective role during myocardial infarction by ischemic
preconditioning.</p><p>Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who experience myocardial infarction exhibit
endothelial dysfunction (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This contributes to
the pathogeneses of atherosclerosis and its complications and is closely related to
cardiovascular events. RIPre before hospital admission increases myocardial salvage and
has a favorable safety profile (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); however, the
direct role of RIPre in regulating human arterial function remains elusive.</p><p>The aims of the present study were twofold: to identify the beneficial effects of
long-term regular RIPre in human arteries, especially with regard to endothelial
function protection, and to determine its potential mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Forty patients who had significant coronary arterial stenosis and were scheduled for
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were enrolled in the study. The patients
were randomly assigned to the RIPre (n=20) or CHD group (n=20). Twenty patients with
breast cancer who were scheduled for mastectomy were included as a control group.
Exclusion criteria were the presence of an acute coronary syndrome, heart failure,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled hypertension, serum creatinine
concentration &#x0003e;2 mg/dL, or anticipation of noncompliance with the study protocol.
The study objectives and protocol were fully explained, and written informed consent
was obtained from all patients. This study was approved by the regional Ethics
Committee in accordance with the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>RIPre was administered while upper arm blood pressure was monitored 3 times a day for
20 days. A blood pressure cuff was placed around the upper arm and inflated to 200
mmHg to occlude arterial blood flow for 5 min. The cuff was then deflated to allow
reperfusion. The procedure was repeated 4 times at 5-min intervals. Limb ischemia was
confirmed by a change in the color of the skin and a decrease in skin temperature.
Following limb reperfusion, the skin color returned to pink, and the skin temperature
returned to the baseline level. In the CHD group, blood pressure was routinely
measured three times daily. After 20 days, all patients underwent CABG surgery, and
discarded artery fragments were collected following the procedure for later analysis
(<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Routine patient treatment for CHD was maintained during the study in both
the RIPre and CHD groups. Antihypertensive treatment was titrated to achieve a target
blood pressure of &#x0003c;130/80 or &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg for patients with or without
diabetes, respectively, during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) response</title><p>FMD response was measured at baseline and on day 20 and used as an index of
endothelial function. Color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the brachial artery was
performed in the resting state end-diastolic dimension, (D0), pneumatic compression
to 250-300 mmHg was maintained for 5 min, and 60-90 s after deflation, reactive
hyperemia of the brachial artery diastolic diameter (D1) was determined. The color
Doppler evaluation of FMD is reported as the percent change in brachial artery
diameter and was calculated as follows: (D1-D0)/D0)&#x000d7;100. FMD values &#x02265;10% and &#x0003c;10%
were considered to indicate normal vascular endothelial function and endothelial
dysfunction, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>CD34<sup>+</sup> monocyte count by flow cytometry</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> monocyte and leukocyte counts were performed in all patients at
baseline and on day 20. A total of 10 &#x000b5;L blood was added to two tubes, and IgG
antibody was added to one tube as a control. Fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated CD34 and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD38 antibodies were added
to the remaining patient samples and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently,
1 mL erythrocyte lysis buffer was added, and after an additional 15 min in the dark,
phosphate-buffered saline was added to adjust the cell concentration for flow
cytometry (FACSCAN Becton Dickinson, USA). The antibody positive rate was recorded as
the percentage of CD34<sup>+</sup> leukocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Arterial CD34<sup>+</sup> monocytes by immunohistochemisty</title><p>Tissue sections were stained as previously described (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cryosections of internal mammary artery fragments (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) were
stained for CD34 (BD Pharmingen, USA), counterstained with FITC-fluorescence (Sigma,
USA) and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Denmark). Sections were
examined using a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope (Japan) and the Lucia Measurement
software 4.6 (India).</p></sec><sec><title>Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression by semiquantitative
RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from arterial tissue samples using the SV total RNA Isolation
System (Promega, USA) and diluted in 30 &#x000b5;L RNA-free water. The purity of RNA can be
confirmed by RNA electrophoresis. The RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Thermo Scientific, USA) was used to obtain 3 &#x000b5;g total RNA. The reaction mixture
contained 2 &#x000b5;L cDNA, 10 &#x000b5;L 2&#x000d7; PCR Taqmix, 1 &#x000b5;L upstream and downstream primers, and 5
&#x000b5;L RNA enzyme water, for a total volume of 20 &#x000b5;L. The primers used were as follows:
eNOS-specific (299 bp) sense, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TTCCGGGGATTCTGGCAGGAG-3&#x02032;</named-content> and antisense,
5&#x02032;-GCCAT-GGTAACATCGCCGCAG-3&#x02032;); glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase

cycles were carried out as follows: 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 65&#x000b0;C for 45 s, and
72&#x000b0;C for 30 s. RT-PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis,
visualized with ethidium bromide, and quantified by densitometry. The results are
reported as the ratio of eNOS and GAPDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Fragments of arterial tissue obtained during CABG surgery were used to measure
protein phosphorylation by immunoblotting for survival kinases (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The excised tissue was clamped between stainless steel tongs
precooled with liquid nitrogen, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.
Approximately 100 mg powdered arterial tissue was used for protein extraction. Frozen
tissue samples were homogenized on ice in 0.5-mL ice-cold lysis buffer containing 30
mM HEPES, 20 mM KCl, 2.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM EDTA, 40 mM sodium fluoride, 4 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, a
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete
Mini; Roche Applied Science, Germany). Following electrophoresis and blotting,
membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with antibodies against
<sup>705</sup>Tyr-phospho-STAT-3, total STAT-3, total serine/threonine-protein kinase
(Akt), and <sup>473</sup>Ser-phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, USA). Beta-actin
(Sigma) was used as a loading control. After washing in Tris-buffered saline and
Tween-20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, USA), and the bound antibody was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The densities of
bands with appropriate molecular masses (60 kDa for Akt and 80 kDa for STAT-3) were
semiquantitatively determined using a LAS-3000 mini Lumino image analyzer (Fujifilm,
Japan). Blood troponin concentration was assayed in all patients after CABG surgery
using a diabody one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Access Immunoassay System;
Beckman Coulter, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD for continuous variables or frequency percentages for
categorical variables. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the
normality of distribution for continuous variables. Multiple comparisons were
evaluated by one-way ANOVA, and the differences between two groups were analyzed by
Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Either chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were
used to compare differences between categorical variables. Differences of continuous
variables that were not normally distributed were compared with Kruskal-Wallis or
Mann-Whitney U-tests. Differences were considered to be statistically significant if
the P value was less than 0.05. All analyses were performed with the S-Plus
statistical package (Mathsoft Inc., USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>, the control, RIPre, and

CHD groups were well matched with respect to age, gender, angina class, and
cardiovascular risk factors. On echocardiography, left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic
dimensions were similar in the two groups. In addition, there were no differences
between the RIPre and CHD groups in medical treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). The use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and
statins was similar between the two groups. Coronary angiography showed serious
lesions in coronary vessels in all RIPre and CHD patients, and all underwent CABG
surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). Hematologic analysis
showed that the three groups had similar white cell and mononuclear cell counts

evaluate endothelial function (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and we found
significant improvements consistent with previously reported results (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In the RIPre group, FMD improved from 4.6&#x000b1;3.2%
to 8.5&#x000b1;2.4%, but this change was not significant in the CHD group (5.5&#x000b1;3.3%
<italic>vs</italic> 4.9&#x000b1;4.2%). After treatment, FMD in the RIPre patients was close
to normal and significantly improved compared with the CHD group. The observed increase
in FMD demonstrates that long-term regular RIPre significantly improved endothelial
function. However, these methods test peripheral arteries rather than coronary vascular
endothelial function. To this end, we tested samples of the internal thoracic artery
obtained during surgery (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). eNOS mRNA gene expression in artery samples (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) was
higher in the RIPre group than in the CHD group. These results indicate that increased
eNOS mRNA gene expression resulted from improved endothelial function (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Recently, ischemic preconditioning studies demonstrated activation of STAT-3 as a part
of the SAFE pathway (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Studies in animal models have confirmed that the
cardioprotective effects of RIPre are due to STAT-3 activation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The SAFE pathway is
thought to have a cardioprotective effect related to RIPre in myocardial infarction
(<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>),
and its role has been confirmed in patients after CABG surgery in whom troponin values
were significantly different between patients in RIPre and CHD groups. This indicates
that in the event of myocardial infarction, long-term regular RIPre can protect
myocardial cells and reduce myocardial necrosis. In this model, RIPre activates STAT-3
(SAFE pathway), increases p-Akt, and then increases eNOS mRNA gene expression, resulting
in improved endothelial function and FMD. Hence, we presume that the increase in eNOS
mRNA gene expression is correlated with the activation of STAT-3 (SAFE pathway).
However, as this was a human experiment, blockers could not be applied to test our
hypothesis.</p><p>Stem cell research in the past decade has shown that EPCs, a population of bone
marrow-derived cells, circulate in the blood and modulate new vessel formation and
homeostasis in adults (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, low EPC number is correlated with poor vascular
function (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and is an independent risk factor
for adverse events in CHD patients (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It follows that the number of circulating EPCs
may determine the capacity to repair vascular damage and may be viewed as an index of
vascular health. The popular concept is that circulating EPCs are protective, and their
alteration may account for the progression of endothelial dysfunction and
atherosclerosis that are commonly seen in LV dysfunction and CHD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The role of EPCs in endothelial dysfunction, however, remains a
matter of debate. Due to the difficulties in their identification, limited information
is available about the normal range of EPCs in CHD. In addition, earlier studies have
been hampered by their retrospective nature and by the lack of uniform criteria to
precisely identify EPCs. Studies have mainly focused on cells positive for the CD34
endothelial marker, which is an adhesion molecule expressed in hematopoietic stem cells
(<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), because it is not expressed in mature
endothelium (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Conversely, there are few data
on the pathophysiological significance of other subsets of stem/progenitor cells. The
levels of EPCs are decreased in coronary artery disease, and animal models have shown
that a decrease in the endogenous pool of progenitor cells may accelerate the course of
atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Similarly, early investigations showed that circulating EPCs
are involved in modulating LV remodeling processes that lead to heart failure (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It was recently reported that patients with
ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy have a lower number of EPCs than healthy
individuals (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the present study,
immunohistochemistry of internal mammary artery specimens (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) revealed that EPCs were
positive for the CD34 endothelial marker and that they increased in CHD. Although this
does not prove a causal relationship, we found a significant positive correlation
between FMD and CD34<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, overall increases in stem cell number and function have been proposed as a
therapeutic means for improving LV function in CHD patients. Stem and progenitor cell
circulation and pretreatment of cardiac homing have been shown to reduce infarct size
and improve cardiac function.</p><p>In conclusion, long-term regular RIPre improved endothelial function in patients with
CHD, possibly via STAT-3 activation (SAFE pathway), and may have been associated with an
increase in arterial EPCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
