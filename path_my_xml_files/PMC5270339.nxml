Telemedical solutions have been shown to be beneficial in different emergency projects, focused on specific disease patterns. Our previous pilot studies have shown that the implementation of a holistic prehospital EMS teleconsultation system, between paramedics and experienced tele-EMS physicians, is safe and feasible in different emergency situations. We aim to extend the clinical indications for this teleconsultation system. We hypothesize that the use of a tele-EMS physician is noninferior regarding the occurrence of system-induced patient adverse events and superior regarding secondary outcome parameters, such as the quality of guideline-conforming treatment and documentation, when compared to conventional EMS-physician treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Three thousand and ten patients will be included in this single-center, open-label, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial with two parallel arms. According to the inclusion criteria, all emergency cases involving adult patients who require EMS-physician treatment, excluding life-threatening cases, will be randomly assigned by the EMS dispatching center into two groups. One thousand five hundred and five patients in the control group will be treated by a conventional EMS physician on scene, and 1505 patients in the intervention group will be treated by paramedics who are concurrently instructed by the tele-EMS physicians at the teleconsultation center. The primary outcome measure will include the rate of treatment-specific adverse events in relation to the kind of EMS physician used. The secondary outcome measures will record the specific treatment-associated quality indicators.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The evidence underlines the better quality of service using telemedicine networks between medical personnel and medical experts in prehospital emergency care, as well as in other medical areas. The worldwide unique EMS teleconsultation system in Aachen has been optimized and evaluated in pilot studies and subsequently integrated into routine use for a broad spectrum of indications. It has enabled prompt, safe and efficient patient treatment with optimized use of the &#x0201c;resource&#x0201d; EMS physician. There is, however, a lack of evidence as to whether the advantages of the teleconsultation system can be replicated in wider-ranging EMS-physician indications (excluding life-threatening emergency calls).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02617875">NCT02617875</ext-link>.

The emergency call is received by the EMS dispatch center and answered by a specially trained paramedic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] who dispatches either solely an ambulance with paramedics or simultaneously, in life-threatening cases, also an EMS-physician vehicle. This is called the rendezvous system. If an ambulance only is dispatched, but the on-site patient situation requires an EMS physician (e.g., a more life-threatening case, or the administration of a special medication, such as opioid analgesia for severe pain management or a drug to reduce systemic arterial pressure in case of severe arterial hypertension, is required), then an EMS physician can be requested by the paramedics on site. The German nationwide network of ambulance locations shows a significantly higher density than that of emergency-physician locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is due to the fact that national law and local regulations of the 16 states of Germany define the maximal time frame for EMS aid. Hence, the paramedics usually arrive on scene several minutes earlier than the EMS physician. The paramedics must start with the primary emergency medical care using their own initiative, but within the restrictions of the German law and local regulations. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the time delay until the arrival of the EMS physician is more pronounced in rural than in urban areas and can jeopardize patients care by the omission of essential physician-dependent treatments. Increasing numbers of emergency calls, vacant EMS-physician posts due to lack of available emergency physicians, and the increasing workload of the EMS physicians hinder the disposability of EMS-physician treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Paramedical teams alone cope with 56% of the current emergency calls in Germany, the remaining 44% require an additional EMS physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This ratio depends on the region and the ratio shifts to requiring more EMS-physicians in rural areas in comparison to urban areas. Furthermore, in Germany the arrival time of the EMS physician to the emergency scene has increased considerably in 95% of emergency cases during the last 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This time interval increased from 18.9 to 28.2&#x000a0;min between 1995 and 2012 and was more than 20&#x000a0;min in 17% of the cases in 2012. The obligatory EMS response time in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia of 8&#x000a0;min for the first EMS unit in urban areas, and the 12-min response time in rural areas is based on the recommendations according to the law (RettG NRW). However, the data reveal that the time interval between the arrival of the EMS ambulance and the EMS physician is frequently prolonged. In addition, as recently shown in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, some EMS-physician sites do not provide continuous operational readiness due to the aforementioned shortage of physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although there is a lack of systematic data for all German states, it is obvious that similar conditions are widespread. In these cases EMS physicians from more distant locations, or helicopter emergency medical services, mostly during the daytime, are required. This circumstance further prolongs the response times of EMS physicians and treatments are restricted to those administered by paramedics until their arrival. In many cases the paramedics are not able, or not allowed, to administer adequate aid (i.e., administration of opioids or performing invasive procedures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In summary, Germany has a well-established ground-based EMS, but five problems remain:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Prolonged emergency response times with delayed treatments by EMS physicians</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increasing numbers of emergency calls</p></list-item><list-item><p>Shortages of EMS physicians</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outdated communication systems</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regionally different but improvable emergency treatment quality</p></list-item></list>
</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mobile prehospital EMS teleconsultation</title><p>Telemedicine networks between medical personnel and medical experts have been shown to be beneficial for the quality of service that they supply in many medical fields. National and international teleconsultation is increasingly used for emergency care of stroke patients between hospitals with and without specialized stroke units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has also been shown that the real-time use of digital observation cameras is more favorable than using telephone consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, transmission of a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and telephone consultation with a cardiologist improved the emergency treatment and the outcomes of acute myocardial infarction patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other prehospital teleconsultation systems in emergency medicine are rare and have only been used in pilot projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The American Heart Association (AHA) emphasizes the use and scientific evaluation of teleconsultation systems in prehospital emergency care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The German research project &#x0201c;Stroke Angel&#x0201d; showed that the use of a tablet computer, with structured collection of stroke-specific patient data and its automatic forwarding to the hospital, decreased the prehospital process time of acute stroke management by half [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, one disadvantage of this concept is the very specific focus on one medical condition.</p><p>The obvious need for a safe and widely usable tele-emergency system encouraged us to develop a holistic, multifunctional, algorithm-based, mobile teleconsultation system as a complementary structural element to the ground- and air-based EMS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Routine use of the EMS teleconsultation system in Aachen</title><p>After the favorable experience of the two pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the EMS teleconsultation system was introduced step-wise into routine use, complementary to the ground- and helicopter-based EMS in Aachen. Since 2014 the costs have been covered by health insurance funds. All ambulances have been equipped with the teleconsultation system since 2015. To date, the teleconsultation EMS physician (tele-EMS physician) has been mainly used for specific cases, such as hypertensive emergency, stroke, and dislocated fractures, to which solely paramedics have originally been dispatched. The decision to involve a tele-EMS physician is made by the paramedics on scene based on standard operating procedures (SOP) devised by the EMS medical director, after obtaining verbal informed consent from the patient. Additionally, the paramedics decide on their own whether they require a physically present EMS physician on scene. Therefore, the tele-EMS physician is used either during the time gap until the arrival of the physically present EMS physician or the tele-EMS physician provides medical and organizational advice without a physically present EMS physician. This offers the opportunity for the paramedics to administer medications and perform invasive procedures under supervision by the tele-EMS physician, which is otherwise not possible under national laws and local regulations. For example, paramedics are not allowed to administer opioids without a delegation by a physician. If adverse events (AEs) occur, the tele-EMS physician can give advice to prevent further possible patient harm. Thus, the teleconsultation system in Aachen protects patients from delayed physician-dependent treatments and provides a high-quality medical therapy by using software-based, guideline-conforming treatment. Delegation of opioid administration by physicians to nursing stuff is usual in hospital, but unusual in EMS. Severe pain or other life-threatening conditions require prompt and accurate medical treatment. In one pilot study, conducted in the EMS of the central state of Hessen, an EMS physician delegated by phone the administration of morphine by paramedics in 172 patients with limb trauma; this resulted in no life-threatening AEs and their pain was significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In contrast to the in-hospital delegation by phone and in the latter study, the tele-EMS physician in Aachen monitors (ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure measurement, voice communication with the paramedics) the patient continuously during the treatment until the patient is handed over to another physician (EMS physician or physician in hospital). This system holds the potential to improve patient safety by giving the paramedics online medical control. Concurrently, the obligatory indications for dispatching of conventional EMS physicians have been restricted since March 2015, as a tele-EMS physician is available for secondary medical and organizational advice at any time. This refers, for example, to the emergency cases where a physician-decision regarding drug administration is required. Meanwhile, 4219 patients (1 April 2014 to 31 March 2016, worldwide the largest case series), were routinely treated using this EMS teleconsultation system in Aachen. Until now, the primary dispatching of the tele-EMS physician directly by the dispatching center&#x000a0;has been waived. However, analysis of the severity levels of cases to which the EMS paramedics responded with the secondary use of the tele-EMS physician shows similar severity levels as the primarily dispatched EMS physician-staffed responses. Furthermore, the use of the tele-EMS physician instead of a conventional EMS physician did not show any complications and the quality of the medical history survey, the medical treatment and the documentation of &#x0201c;Tracer&#x0201d; diagnoses, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, improved. Additionally, the engagement time of the physician decreased by half with the use of tele-EMS. Our experience from the routine use of the teleconsultation EMS system in Aachen &#x02013; excluding critical emergency cases such as severe trauma, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced airway management &#x02013; shows that this system may provide an equal or even better quality of care than the conventional EMS system. Furthermore, this system enables more economical utilization of EMS-physician resources. A nationwide implementation of this teleconsultation EMS system in all dual EMS systems requires proof that it is not harmful and shows some advantages in cases where primarily a tele-EMS physician is required (excluding life-threatening emergency calls).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives and study design</title><p>The TEMS trial is designed as a single-center, prospective, randomized, interventional, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, sequential noninferiority trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Requirement of telemedical facilities</title><p>All routinely used EMS ambulances in Aachen are equipped and connected to a specific teleconsultation center. This system consists of four sections: the teleconsultation center, a server infrastructure, a fix-mounted in-vehicle PC and a portable autonomous communication device called the &#x0201c;PeeqBOX,&#x0201d; as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Teleconsultation center</title><p>The teleconsultation center is staffed by experienced EMS physicians from the Department of Anesthesiology of the University Hospital of RWTH, Aachen, Germany and physicians of the P3 Telehealthcare GmbH, Aachen, Germany. During the clinical routine one round-the-clock tele-EMS physician is required. In the course of this study an additional tele-EMS physician will be engaged. Minimal educational requirement for tele-EMS physicians comprises a minimal experience of 4&#x000a0;years in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine and an EMS-physician certification. Furthermore, additional qualifications such as European Resuscitation Council Provider and Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support are required. All tele-EMS physicians must pass a specific training regarding the telemedical characteristics including communication principles. The teleconsultation center is located next to the dispatching center in the region of Aachen. Live vital data (curves and numerical data of ECG rhythms and, if needed, 12-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, blood pressure measurements) are transmitted to the tele-EMS physician. Solely the data transmission systems manufactured by GS Stemple (Kaufering, Germany), which are approved according to the medical devices law, are used. In addition to this diagnostic data, still-picture transmission and video transmission data are available to the tele-EMS physician. These data are explicitly used in addition to verbal communication with the paramedics and not for diagnostic purposes. The content of this visual data must be verbally verified. SOP, guidelines and drug databases are IT-based and provided to the tele-EMS physician. Standardized, context-sensitive and checklist-based documentation software is used in the teleconsultation center for all emergency cases conducted with the aid of a tele-EMS physician. Data transfer from the emergency scene, or the ambulance to the teleconsultation center, respectively, as well as the bidirectional audio connections are encrypted according to the state of the art. This enables the highest degree of interception protection during data transmission. To further improve data safety, all data are marked with an electronic key.

Intensive standardized training of the entire EMS personnel regarding the teleconsultation system had already been performed before its implementation for routine use. This training focused on the transmission technology and on uniform and purposeful communication. This should enable a structured, efficient and safe transmission of the conversation content. Furthermore, legal matters, such as the informed consent of patients, the legal relationship between the paramedics and the tele-EMS physicians and liability risks, were discussed and clarified. A further safety measure is the support of the tele-EMS physicians by the software-based checklists. The advantages of checklist-based operations have been shown for patient safety within the World Health Organization (WHO) project: &#x0201c;Safe Surgery Saves Lives&#x0201d; wherein improved patient outcome was shown for elective as well as for emergency surgery with the checklist-based working [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The SOP for the teleconsultation system defines such checklists for the tele-EMS physicians, to ensure a necessary minimum standard of teleconsultation; for example. intravenous drug administration is only permitted if all required information is collected and all safety measures are taken (such as pulse oximetry, blood pressure measurement, ECG rhythm analysis). The tele-EMS physician evaluates the validity and reliability of the teleconsultation data transfer. In cases with low rates of data transfer and interruption of continuous patient monitoring, any delegation to the paramedics is not allowed according to the SOP if continuous monitoring is medically indicated. However, as is usual nationwide, the paramedics would continue to treat the patients, even in the case of complete interruption of the teleconsultation system. All paramedics are educated and trained in advanced life support. Furthermore, a backup mobile phone is available in each ambulance, in accordance with German industrial standard (DIN EN 1789) and the teleconsultation center is provided with a fixed-line connection in case of interruption of the Internet connection. An IT-safety concept was established in collaboration with the data protection officer of the city of Aachen to protect all transmitted and collected data against unauthorized access, unauthorized modifications and data loss. This IT-safety concept also comprises the storage time frame and the access rights.</p><p>AEs are possible regarding technical, organizational or medical factors. Occurrence of AEs during the teleconsultation must be documented on standardized forms provided to the tele-EMS physicians and the paramedics. These documentations must be analyzed immediately by the investigators, to recognize problems and potential hazards without delay and to initiate countermeasures as soon as possible. AEs listed under primary outcome measures are expected in connection with the specific kind of EMS care (conventional/telemedical).</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Definition of AEs</title><p>All unexpected AEs and the expected primary outcome AEs in the course of the EMS treatment must be documented on an AE Reporting Form which will be provided by the sponsor.

The system appeared functional and was highly appreciated by the paramedics in Aachen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the majority of cases it reduced the requirement of EMS physicians and also enabled immediate medical advice to be given by EMS physicians to the paramedics. The &#x0201c;TemRas&#x0201d; project showed that an EMS teleconsultation system with a transregional teleconsultation center is feasible, can be operated without any complications, and that its requirements are in demand for daily use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Transfer of real-time patient vital data, pictures and audio communication system function between the paramedics on scene and the physician in the teleconsultation center was fast and reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This enabled prompt, safe and efficient patient treatment, even without an available physician on scene or until the arrival of the EMS physician. It enhanced the optimized use of the &#x0201c;resource&#x0201d; EMS physician. After its evaluation, it was implemented for routine use of the EMS system in Aachen. All conducted emergency missions with the aid of the tele-EMS physician were uneventful and provided a better quality of medical history, treatment and documentation. Furthermore, the physician engagement time was shortened by half. Until now, this system has only been used for the primarily dispatched ambulances staffed by paramedics, with restricted EMS-physician indications.</p><p>The need of EMS physicians for emergency missions has increased by about 2&#x02013;3% per year over the last 20&#x000a0;years in Aachen. Before the implementation of the multifunctional mobile teleconsultation system an EMS physician was needed in 34&#x02013;36% of emergency missions, now it has deceased to about 26% which is considerably less frequent than the national average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>There is a lack of evidence as to whether the advantages of the teleconsultation system, instead of a physically present physician on scene, could also be replicated in further cases with EMS-physician indications (excluding life-threatening emergency calls).</p><p>However, we would like to acknowledge some potential bias in our study: different levels of medical education or EMS experience within our physicians cannot be excluded during our study conducted in the clinical routine. In particular, our minimal educational requirement for the tele-EMS physician is beyond that for the conventional EMS physician according to the guideline of the General Medical Council of North Rhine-Westphalia. On the other hand, we also have conventional EMS physicians, with much more experience than our minimal educational requirement for the tele-EMS physician. This potential experience bias will be addressed in our statistical analysis with data presentation being at the medical education/experience level of our involved physicians in each group. Furthermore, the conventional EMS physician always has the opportunity to contact the tele-EMS physician for any advice which may be a further source of performance bias which will also be addressed in our data analysis.</p><sec id="Sec50"><title>Risk-benefit assessment</title><p>So far, our experience with the teleconsultation EMS system shows at least an equivalent diagnostic and treatment quality between the tele-EMS physician and the conventional physically present EMS physician on scene. As immediate life-threatening emergency cases (as described in the &#x0201c;Exclusion criteria&#x0201d;) are excluded from this study, no specific risk is expected with either with conventional treatment or with telemedical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment is expected to start in March 2017.

This regulation refers to the &#x000a7; 203 subsection 1 No. 1 and subsection 2 No. 1 of the German Penal Code (StGB).</p><p>
<bold>The routine informed consent procedure for teleconsultation is defined as follows:</bold>
</p><p>If the patient is legally competent and there is no emergency situation, the patient must be verbally informed and verbal consent for the telemedical procedure must be obtained. In emergency situations, where the patient is not legally competent, e.g. shock, severe pain or impaired consciousness, the consent is justified under the &#x0201c;presumed consent&#x0201d; principle. This principle refers also to legally competent patients, in urgent cases with the aim to prevent serious patient harm. The standardized patient information given by the paramedics and the verbal patient consent must be documented on the EMS Form on scene by the paramedics. In addition, the tele-EMS physician must ensure this consent procedure before the commencement of the telemedical consultation and also document it on the tele-EMS Physician Form. In cases where the patient is not willing to be treated by a tele-EMS physician, the paramedics must document this and to decide whether they need a conventional EMS physician on scene, or to be responsible themselves for carrying out the EMS operation.</p><p>
<bold>The study-specific informed consent procedure for teleconsultation treatment is defined as follows:</bold>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Scenario: the legally competent patient will be informed about the study and the pseudonymized analysis of his data. This will be performed by trained paramedics on scene (phase C) if the emergency condition allows it (e.g., no life-threatening situation, patient is legally competent). In addition, each patient will receive written patient information with contact details of the principle investigator, where they can receive further information. As soon as possible (phase D), a subinvestigator will personally explain all aspects of the study and the requirements concerning data collection, analysis and protection. All arising questions must be answered to the complete satisfaction of the patient. The patients will be asked to voluntarily confirm their willingness to participate in the study. An informed consent, including the disclosure of individual data must be signed and dated by the patient and the subinvestigator. A copy of the Informed Consent Form will be provided to the patients</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scenario: for nonlegally competent patients (e.g., shock, severe pain or impaired consciousness) the consent will be justified under the &#x0201c;presumed consent&#x0201d; principle, after individual assessment of the entire situation during phase C. Afterwards, the patients (after regaining legal competency) or the legal representative will be personally informed about the study and the consent will be obtained by the subinvestigator as in the first scenario (phase D)</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>
<bold>The study-specific informed consent procedure for conventional EMS treatment is defined as follows:</bold>
</p><p>This procedure will take place in the same manner as described for the telemedical treatment, with one exception: a conventional physician, instead of the paramedic, will inform the patient about the study and informed consent could also be obtained during phase C of the study.</p><p>According to ethical approval, informed consent will be waived for the patients, who will be pseudonymized and included in the parallel-conducted retrospective analysis of the nonrandomized conventional EMS physician cases.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Survey of personnel</title><p>A satisfaction survey of the paramedics, the EMS physicians and the emergency room personnel regarding the EMS system used will be performed with anonymized questionnaires after the EMS operation.
