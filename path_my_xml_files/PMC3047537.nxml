Although HIV-1 sequencing is frequently used to substantiate linkage between newly HIV-1 infected individuals and their sexual partners in epidemiologic and forensic studies, viral sequencing is seldom applied in HIV-1 prevention trials. The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00194519) was a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial that enrolled serodiscordant heterosexual couples to determine the efficacy of genital herpes suppression in reducing HIV-1 transmission; as part of the study analysis, HIV-1 sequences were examined for genetic linkage between seroconverters and their enrolled partners.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We obtained partial consensus HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> sequences from blood plasma for 151 transmission pairs and performed deep sequencing of <italic>env</italic> in some cases. We analyzed sequences with phylogenetic techniques and developed a Bayesian algorithm to evaluate the probability of linkage. For linkage, we required monophyletic clustering between enrolled partners' sequences and a Bayesian posterior probability of &#x02265;50&#x00025;. Adjudicators classified each seroconversion, finding 108 (71.5&#x00025;) linked, 40 (26.5&#x00025;) unlinked, and 3 (2.0&#x00025;) indeterminate transmissions, with linkage determined by consensus <italic>env</italic> sequencing in 91 (84&#x00025;). Male seroconverters had a higher frequency of unlinked transmissions than female seroconverters. The likelihood of transmission from the enrolled partner was related to time on study, with increasing numbers of unlinked transmissions occurring after longer observation periods. Finally, baseline viral load was found to be significantly higher among linked transmitters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In this first use of HIV-1 sequencing to establish endpoints in a large clinical trial, more than one-fourth of transmissions were unlinked to the enrolled partner, illustrating the relevance of these methods in the design of future HIV-1 prevention trials in serodiscordant couples. A hierarchy of sequencing techniques, analysis methods, and expert adjudication contributed to the linkage determination process.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Characteristics of the transmitting and seroconverting partner affect HIV-1 sexual transmission risk, making studies of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (in which one partner is HIV-1 infected and the other is uninfected) of significant scientific value <xref rid="pone.0016986-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, the virus is not bound by vows of fidelity and behavioral characteristics of sexual partnerships are often difficult to ascertain due to recall bias and willingness of some persons to report sensitive behaviors such as concurrent partnerships. HIV-1's high mutational capacity has allowed the use of sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, particularly of the envelope gene <xref rid="pone.0016986-Shankarappa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Wolinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, to objectively identify HIV-1 source partners and to investigate patterns of HIV-1 transmission.</p><p>Observational studies have used molecular approaches to study the transmission of HIV-1 from person to person <xref rid="pone.0016986-Leitner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Truong1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and within populations <xref rid="pone.0016986-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Paraskevis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Forensic investigations of HIV-1 transmission have also relied upon phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequence data from suspects and victims <xref rid="pone.0016986-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016986-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0016986-Learn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Leitner2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) and have required the highest burden of proof (&#x02018;beyond a reasonable doubt&#x02019;) to establish HIV-1 transmission linkage. In contrast, viral sequence-based linkage determination rarely is applied to HIV-1 prevention trials, since most prevention strategies focus on HIV-uninfected persons (e.g., vaccines, microbicides or pre-exposure prophylaxis) in which it is assumed that the efficacy of the intervention is independent of the source of the transmitted virus. However, evaluation of interventions aiming to reduce HIV transmission from infected individuals to their partners require that each seroconversion event be linked to the source partner, as the efficacy of such interventions can only be measured if HIV-1 transmission events are definitively linked to a source partner receiving either the intervention or placebo. Furthermore, definitive linkage information is important for epidemiologic studies seeking to quantify the proportion of HIV-1 infections that could be averted through interventions targeting stable couples or to characterize risk factors associated with those transmissions.</p><p>An example of such a prevention trial is the Partners in Prevention HSV-2/HIV-1 Transmission Study that enrolled African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples to evaluate the efficacy of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) suppression with acyclovir given to HIV-1/HSV-2 dually-infected participants in reducing HIV-1 transmission to their HIV-1-uninfected heterosexual partners <xref rid="pone.0016986-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Despite the high probability that HIV-1 strains from couples enrolled in this study would be linked, the clinical trial demanded that HIV-1 transmission endpoints be defined systematically. In this paper we report on our evaluation of genetic linkage between HIV-1 sequences from epidemiologically linked partnerships in the trial and discuss its potential value for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study</title><p>The study design, recruitment, baseline characteristics and primary study findings of the Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study are detailed elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0016986-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016986-Lingappa2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Briefly, 3,408 HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples were enrolled at 14 sites in 7 sub-Saharan African countries. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants and the research was conducted according to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. The University of Washington Human Subjects Review Committee and ethical review committees at each local and collaborating organization approved the Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study protocol and the trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#00194519). HIV-1 infected partners, all of whom were also infected with HSV-2 and 68&#x00025; of whom were female, were randomized to either acyclovir (400 mg orally twice-daily) or placebo and followed for up to 24 months. 155 HIV-1 seroconversions, of which 60&#x00025; occurred in couples with females as HIV-1 infected partners, were detected using rapid and enzyme-linked serologic assays at the local research sites <xref rid="pone.0016986-Lingappa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 151 of which were confirmed by HIV-1 Western blot and quantitative HIV-1 RNA measurements at the University of Washington <xref rid="pone.0016986-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Of these, nineteen seroconverting partners had negative HIV-1 Western blot but detectable HIV-1 RNA at the time of enrollment (identified by an &#x02018;SC&#x02019; in the partner-pair identifier); these were not included as clinical trial endpoints due to HIV-1 acquisition at the time of randomization, but they are included in this report of the linkage analysis. The primary trial endpoint was defined as incident HIV-1 infection in a previously HIV-1 uninfected partner (&#x02018;seroconverting partner&#x02019;) confirmed to be genetically linked to his/her putative transmitting partner (&#x02018;HIV-1 infected partner&#x02019;) by viral sequence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Overview of transmission linkage methods</title><p>For each putative HIV-1 transmission pair, consensus sequencing of a population of partial HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> genes was performed on blood plasma collected within 3 months of seroconversion from both partners. This protocol of sequencing both <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> was followed with the exception of 12 pairs that met linkage criteria by <italic>env</italic> sequencing alone; <italic>gag</italic> was not sequenced for these pairs due to time and budgetary constraints. In light of data showing viral genetic homogeneity in most individuals with acute/early HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0016986-Keele1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016986-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> it was decided that deeper sequencing on the HIV-1 infected partner would be performed to identify potentially low-level transmitted variants in cases of initially unlinked or indeterminate pairs eligible for inclusion as trial endpoints. For most pairs (42/49) whose sequences did not show clear evidence of linkage by <italic>env</italic> or <italic>gag</italic> consensus sequencing, multiple single molecule (SM) C2-V3-C3 <italic>env</italic> sequences were obtained following endpoint dilution of cDNA from the HIV-1 infected partner's plasma to identify linked variants present at lower frequency. Furthermore, for a subset of unlinked pairs, we performed <italic>env</italic> amplicon pyrosequencing of the HIV-1 infected partner's virus population to detect even rarer variants that may have been transmitted. To provide phylogenetic context for the partners' HIV-1 sequences we collected publicly available subtype A, C, and D sequences from African countries, using 1 sequence per individual, from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database (HIVDB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html</ext-link>). To better characterize the HIV strains circulating in the community at sites with fewer than 10 study-related seroconversions, we obtained <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> from 3&#x02013;8 additional HIV-1 infected individuals enrolled at such sites (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32 across all study sites, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016986-t001">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016986.s005">Table S1</xref>) who were epidemiologically unlinked to the putative transmission pairs, as a &#x0201c;local control&#x0201d; (LC) comparator population. This was achieved at all but 1 study site (Site 4). An adjudication committee of 3 experts, blinded to randomization arm, independently reviewed sequence data to assign linkage classification as described below.

partnerships. To minimize the risk of specimen mix-up and contamination, laboratory work on HIV-1 infected and seroconverting participants was physically and temporally separated. All pre-PCR steps were performed in PCR clean rooms. Viral RNA was extracted from blood plasma using the Qiagen RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and primers RT2 (HXB2 coordinates 3301&#x02013;3321) and Nef3 (9015&#x02013;9038). This was followed by nested PCR targeting <italic>gag</italic> (p17&#x02013;p24 region) and envelope (<italic>env</italic>, C2-V3-C3 region). We used Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and primers gag1 (772&#x02013;793), RT2 (3301&#x02013;3321), ED3 (5957&#x02013;5986), and Nef3 (9015&#x02013;9038) for the multiplexed first round and Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers gag2 (793&#x02013;818), gag5 (1826&#x02013;1847), ED31 (6817&#x02013;6845), and ED33 (7360&#x02013;7381) for the independent second round reactions. Final sequence lengths were thus &#x0223c;1,009 base pairs (bp) for <italic>gag</italic> and &#x0223c;516 bp for <italic>env</italic>. For SM sequencing on HIV-1 infected partners' plasma, we used endpoint serially diluted cDNA to ensure that PCR amplification of the targeted regions would originate from a single amplifiable template <xref rid="pone.0016986-Rodrigo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. During the first part of the study, clonal sequencing of the C2-V5 region of <italic>env</italic> was performed for all pairs (PP1-58), using ED31 (6817&#x02013;6845) and BH2 (7697&#x02013;7725) for the first round and DR7 (6990&#x02013;7021) and DR8 (7638&#x02013;7668) for the second round. These amplicons were cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). Given the time and costs of clonal sequencing for each partner in those first 58 transmission pairs, the trial endpoint committee decided to utilize consensus sequencing of partial <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> regions to increase efficiency in determining transmission linkage. Both clonal and consensus sequencing was performed on most of these specimens. For efficiency, this redundancy on linked pairs was eliminated later in the study. Plasmid DNA and PCR products were purified with the FastPlasmid Mini kit (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) and the QIAQuick PCR or gel extraction kit (Qiagen), respectively. Standard dideoxy terminator sequencing was performed at a local facility. Sequence chromatograms were manually edited with Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Amplicon pyrosequencing of C2-V3-C3 <italic>env</italic> (two, &#x0223c;220 bp reads from the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the ED31/ED33 <italic>env</italic> amplicon were obtained and analyzed separately) was performed on HIV-1 infected partners' plasma using the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche Diagnostics, Branford, CT).

The &#x0201c;linked&#x0201d; dataset was derived from sequences from acutely infected individuals and known transmission pairs. From June 2007- April 2009 when we conducted our data analysis, the publicly available sequence data for heterosexual transmission pairs was limited. To augment the number of sequences in our reference data set, we included data from individuals with a variety of HIV risk factors, including the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) <xref rid="pone.0016986-Gottlieb1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Shankarappa2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> (acute infections) as well as from heterosexual <xref rid="pone.0016986-Leitner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, male-to-male (unpublished data and <xref rid="pone.0016986-Shankarappa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>), and mother-to-infant <xref rid="pone.0016986-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> transmission cases.

The purpose of the Bayesian analysis was to have an objective statistical measure of linkage for each HIV-1 transmission event that could account for the prior probability that HIV-1 sequences from these partner pairs in long-term sexual partnerships would be linked. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that two sequences are linked (<italic>i.e</italic>., the probability of linkage, given existing data) is a function of the prior probability that they are linked and the distributions of genetic distances from known linked and unlinked sequences described above, as shown in the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0016986.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>
</p><p>X denotes the objective data obtained during sequence analysis, the pairwise genetic distance in this case. P(linked) and P(unlinked) are the prior probabilities of linkage and lack of linkage for pairs of sequences from HIV-1 infected partner participants in our dataset and f(X | linked) and f(X | not linked) are conditional densities of the genetic distances for linked or unlinked sequences based on the distribution of genetic distances in the reference datasets. As opposed to a &#x02018;pure Bayes&#x02019; approach in which an acceptable value or range of values for P(linked) and P(unlinked) are specified, this approach uses an &#x02018;empirical Bayes&#x02019; approach. Here, an initial value of P(linked) is chosen (P(linked) &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5), the posterior probabilities of linkage for each couple is computed, and P(linked) is updated as the proportion of partners who are classified as linked in the Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study. This procedure is then iterated until convergence. Prior to adjudication, Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated using the distance between the 2 most closely related sequences in <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> for each partner pair.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Criteria for assignment of linkage</title><p>For each enrolled pair and each level of sequence analysis (consensus, SM and pyrosequencing), HIV-1 linkage was assigned by first requiring that partner-pair derived HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> and/or <italic>gag</italic> sequences form monophyletic clusters (<italic>i.e</italic>., originating from the same terminal node) in maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees that included sequences from unrelated individuals (&#x0201c;local controls&#x0201d;). Second, the pairwise genetic distances were required to be associated with a Bayesian posterior probability &#x02265;50&#x00025; for the gene in which monophyly occurred. Partner-pair sequences that met these two requirements were tentatively classified as linked.</p><p>An adjudication committee consisting of three independent experts in HIV-1 viral genetics (J.I.M., F.E.M., and initially T.L. and subsequently J.A.), who had not participated in the clinical trial protocol design and were blinded to participants' treatment assignments, evaluated phylogenetic and Bayesian posterior probability for each seroconverter pair. If at least two adjudicators concordantly assigned linkage status, the pair was tentatively classified by that assignment. Pairs with linkage status that could not be determined definitively received indeterminate classifications. Interim adjudication occurred before each meeting of the Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study Data and Safety Monitoring Board and a comprehensive review of the dataset to finalize linkage assignments by consensus was performed before the final clinical trial analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Selected epidemiologic and biological variables were compared in linked and unlinked pairs, evaluating for statistical significance with the two-sided Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>During The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study, 155 incident HIV-1 infections were identified by HIV-1 serology performed at the study site, of which 151 were confirmed by positive HIV-1 Western blot at University of Washington (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016986-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Through a hierarchical, multi-step process based on sequencing, phylogenetic and Bayesian statistical analysis, and independent adjudication, we found that over one quarter (26.5&#x00025;) of HIV-1 transmission events within this cohort were not linked to the enrolled partner.</p><p>Numerous studies have used viral sequencing to evaluate HIV-1 transmission linkage, but our analysis represents the first use of viral sequencing for HIV-1 transmission linkage as an integral component in the primary efficacy analysis of a large randomized HIV-1 prevention trial. Because the trial's intervention was intended to reduce infectiousness in the HIV-1 infected partner, only linked transmissions were relevant to ascertainment its efficacy. As with previous linkage assessments in observational studies <xref rid="pone.0016986-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016986-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016986-t004">Table 4</xref>) included an evaluation of sequence data from <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> for monophyly in maximum likelihood trees to determine linkage. However, to provide additional statistical support for our linkage determinations, we developed a Bayesian algorithm incorporating prior probability of linkage and genetic distance data and increased our sensitivity for detecting rare variants in the HIV-1 infected partner that may have been transmitted to the seroconverter using deep sequencing techniques. While consensus <italic>env</italic> sequencing identified 85&#x00025; of linked pairs, <italic>gag</italic> and deep <italic>env</italic> sequencing permitted classification of an additional 9 (8.3&#x00025;) and 8 (7.4&#x00025;) linked pairs, respectively, that would not have been linked if only consensus <italic>env</italic> were used to define linkage. Our Bayesian algorithm provides a quantitative assessment of linkage and offers additional perspective for the genetic distance data, by relating those data to the expected distance ranges for linked and unlinked sequence pairs. It did not, however, take precedence over phylogenetic linkage determinations. In 3 pairs (PP47, SC1, and SC6), linkage decisions were based on monophyly despite having Bayesian posterior probabilities &#x0003c;50&#x00025;. In future studies, if a particular site lacked &#x0201d;local controls&#x0201d; or other geographically-appropriate reference sequences, the Bayesian algorithm could be helpful in differentiating monophyletic pairs associated with transmission versus those that were more genetically distant, yet clustered due to geographic location. The determination of linkage by individual adjudicators was highly consistent, with identical independent assessments in 96&#x00025; of cases, followed by full concurrence after discussion. If only one scientist had evaluated the data, 6 (5.6&#x00025;) of the linked pairs may have received an indeterminate designation, which suggests that discussion amongst experts during the adjudication process was helpful in resolving uncertainties in interpretation of the data. In only 3 (2.0&#x00025;) of cases were adjudicators unable to determine the linkage status conclusively, possibly due to HIV-1 dual or superinfection followed by recombination of viral strains. Additional deep or whole genome sequencing may resolve such indeterminate classifications, but was beyond the scope of this study.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0016986-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0016986.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Summary of sequencing and analysis methods used in this study.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0016986-t004-4" xlink:href="pone.0016986.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benefits</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Limitations</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impact on this study</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Our finding that &#x0223c;27&#x00025; of seroconverters' HIV-1 sequences were unlinked to those of their enrolled partners underscores that transmission linkage cannot be assumed, and in doing so, provides a guide to help minimize uncertainty in HIV-1 transmission linkage assignment for future observational studies of HIV-1 infectiousness and trials of candidate prevention interventions to reduce HIV-1 infectiousness.</p><p>Nevertheless, several limitations are noteworthy. First, we could not determine the relative utility of each type of sequencing in linkage determination because our protocol did not require all three types of sequencing data from each individual, but we advocate for use of consensus <italic>env</italic> sequencing at a minimum, as 85&#x00025; of linked pairs were determined by analysis of partial consensus <italic>env</italic> sequences, followed by consensus <italic>gag</italic> and multiple <italic>env</italic> variant sequencing, as needed. Second, our ability to sequence &#x0201c;local controls&#x0201d; from each study site was also limited. Ideally, we would have sequenced a robust sample of the circulating viral population from epidemiologically unlinked individuals that corresponded to the HIV-1 subtype found in participants at each study site. However, when we received participants' plasma specimens, the viral subtypes were unknown and the clinical trial's time constraints precluded sequencing from additional unlinked participants. We found that the subtype A, C, and D sequences from Africa retrieved from the HIVDB adequately separated the sequences from sites in our study, minimizing the possibility that geographic clustering led to false evidence of linkage. Finally, the epidemiologically linked reference sequence data sets used to develop the Bayesian algorithm were not taken exclusively from transmission pairs whose HIV-1 risk factor was heterosexual sex. There were few publicly available sequences from genetically linked heterosexual HIV-1 transmissions and we therefore needed to include data from male-male and mother-infant transmission pairs. However, as the trial proceeded, sequence pairs that the adjudicators determined to be linked were added to this database, such that the data from linked pairs in our trial outnumbered those from published reference sets.</p><p>Recent data has revealed the role of minority viral variants from the transmitting partner in individuals acquiring HIV-1 through heterosexual sex <xref rid="pone.0016986-Sagar1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Derdeyn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016986-Haaland1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which was our rationale for using deep sequencing techniques in couples whose viruses were initially found to be unlinked. An additional step that could have been performed was analysis of HIV-1 sequences from genital specimens of HIV-1 infected partners. Although it is theoretically possible that sequencing from blood may have missed a viral variant present exclusively in a genital compartment, the likelihood of this is low, as analyses of seminal and cervicovaginal specimens have shown that viral sequences from blood and genital sites cluster monophyletically and often intermingle within an individual <xref rid="pone.0016986-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016986-Pillai1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The relatively high fraction (26.5&#x00025;) of unlinked infections we found differs from a cohort study of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in Zambia from 1994-2000, in which 13&#x00025; of prospectively identified seroconverters were found to have viruses not linked to their stable partner <xref rid="pone.0016986-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Their study used analogous laboratory methods, involving amplification of HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag</italic> consensus sequences from blood plasma RNA, and similarly evaluated phylogenetic relationships and genetic distances. While the two studies cannot be directly compared due to differences in design, location, and period of conduct, it is notable that a greater proportion of HIV-1 infected partners in the Zambian cohort were male compared to our cohort (52&#x00025; versus 33&#x00025;). In our study, male seroconverters were significantly more likely than females to report sex with additional partners; it is plausible that the greater proportion of male seroconverters with unlinked viruses is a consequence of this behavior and may explain the higher rate of unlinked infections our cohort. Our finding of more unlinked seroconversions occurring later after study enrollment most likely is related to the increase in reported sexual activity with partners other than those with whom they were enrolled during the 2 years of follow-up <xref rid="pone.0016986-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The strong associations we saw between unlinked transmission and reported sexual activity with additional partners and the higher proportion of female seroconverters found to be infected from their stated partners, corroborates our linkage assignments and suggest that behavioral rather than biological factors may underlie the higher rate of non-linkage in our cohort. Our rigorous evaluation of transmission linkage reduced potential misclassification of over a quarter of seroconversion endpoints &#x02013; a substantial issue for efficacy trials of interventions to reduce HIV-1 infectiousness. Insofar as the unlinked transmissions represent HIV-1 infection transmitted from outside the stable HIV-1 serodiscordant partnership, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating messages that underscore the risk of sex with partners of unknown serostatus when working with HIV-1 serodiscordant couples. In addition, our finding of nearly 30&#x00025; of HIV-1 transmissions being genetically unlinked and likely acquired from an outside partner in these African couples, indicates a need for biomedical interventions, such as vaccines, microbicides and pre-exposure prophylaxis, for the HIV-1 seronegative partner in serodiscordant partnerships.</p><p>The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study did not find an association of HSV-2 suppression with a change in HIV-1 transmission through either a modified intent-to-treat analysis evaluating only linked HIV-1 transmission events, or a per-protocol-analysis that evaluated all eligible HIV-1 transmission events <xref rid="pone.0016986-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, for future studies, the erroneous assumption of linkage for one quarter of identified transmission events could clearly be a major source of misclassification bias with a consequent high risk of inaccurate conclusions about risk factors for HIV-1 transmission or efficacy of interventions to reduce HIV-1 infectiousness. While the need for deep sequencing in future HIV-1 transmission linkage confirmation algorithms bears further study, our findings suggest that analysis of HIV-1 sequences from two potentially linked individuals in a clinical trial should include: 1) consensus <italic>env,</italic> 2) consensus <italic>gag,</italic> 3) analysis for monophyly and pairwise genetic distance in both gene regions, 4) Bayesian posterior probability calculations incorporating the prior probability of linkage and the pairwise genetic distances, 5) discussion/adjudication by experts, and 6) sequencing of multiple <italic>env</italic> variants in putative transmitting partners in couples without clear evidence of linkage by consensus sequencing. Our approach is relevant both for future HIV-1 prevention trials evaluating interventions that target the HIV-1 infected partner and for studies seeking to characterize virologic, immunologic, and host genetic determinants of HIV-1 transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0016986.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
