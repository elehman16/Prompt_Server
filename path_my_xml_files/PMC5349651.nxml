Many countries have a policy to increase timely diagnosis, but trials aimed at changing general practitioner (GP) practice have been unsuccessful. We aimed to assess whether a GP&#x02019;s personal letter, with an evidence-based leaflet about overcoming barriers to accessing help for memory problems&#x02014;aimed at empowering patients and families&#x02014;increases timely dementia diagnosis and patient presentation to general practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and finding</title><p>Multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial with raters masked to an online computer-generated randomisation system assessing 1 y outcome. We recruited 22 general practices (August 2013&#x02013;September 2014) and 13 corresponding secondary care memory services in London, Hertfordshire, and Essex, United Kingdom. Eligible patients were aged &#x02265;70 y, without a known diagnosis of dementia, living in their own homes. There were 6,387 such patients in 11 intervention practices and 8,171 in the control practices. The primary outcome was cognitive severity on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Main secondary outcomes were proportion of patients consulting their GP with suspected memory disorders and proportion of those referred to memory clinics. There was no between-group difference in cognitive severity at diagnosis (99 intervention, mean MMSE = 22.04, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 20.95 to 23.13; 124 control, mean MMSE = 22.59, 95% CI = 21.58 to 23.6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.48). GP consultations with patients with suspected memory disorders increased in intervention versus control group (odds ratio = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.28, 1.54). There was no between-group difference in the proportions of patients referred to memory clinics (166, 2.5%; 220, 2.7%; <italic>p</italic> = .077 respectively). The study was limited as we do not know whether the additional patients presenting to GPs had objective as well as subjective memory problems and therefore should have been referred. In addition, we aimed to empower patients but did not do anything to change GP practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our intervention to access timely dementia diagnosis resulted in more patients presenting to GPs with memory problems, but no diagnoses increase. We are uncertain as to the reason for this and do not know whether empowering the public and targeting GPs would have resulted in a successful intervention.

Across developed countries, many people with dementia never receive a diagnosis, while others receive one late in the illness [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our systematic review of interventions to increase the rates of dementia diagnosis reports no clearly successful intervention; although educating general practitioners (GPs) increased their ability to diagnose dementia, this approach did not result in increased diagnostic rates [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, the dementias are incurable, but early diagnosis allows people to plan for the future [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], receive treatment to reduce cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and access social and voluntary care. Early diagnosis also helps family carers [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], reduces crises, and delays care home entry [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for people with dementia with little negative effects [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Family carers report difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis of dementia for their relative, which can take several years, with the delay causing increased anxiety and carer burden [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Families find that some relatives with memory problems are reluctant to consult their GP about it and deny problems when seen [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Barriers to seeking help or diagnosis include fear of the diagnosis, concerns about stigma, GP disinclination to make this diagnosis, negative responses from other family members, normalisation of symptoms, and a lack of awareness about the signs of dementia [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our systematic review of interventions to increase the rates of dementia diagnosis reports no clearly successful intervention; although educating GPs increased their ability to diagnose dementia, this did not result in increased diagnostic rates [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Previous interventions have neither specifically targeted and tried to empower older people nor used the relationship with GPs to address barriers to diagnosis other than symptom recognition. This has helped in other fields; for example, GP personal letters with information leaflets changed patient&#x02019;s behaviour regarding diagnosis of bowel cancer, leading to increase in uptake of diagnostic procedures [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>We therefore aimed to facilitate patients and families to present to their GP and gain a timely diagnosis of dementia (as evaluated through cognitive severity at presentation), through a personalised letter and evidence-based leaflet [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] sent directly to patients registered with general practices and to evaluate this in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design</title><p>Multicentre, parallel group, cluster RCT. We recruited general practices in southeast England (north and east London, Hertfordshire, and Essex).

The corresponding memory services were in Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, East London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, and Hertfordshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust. We obtained written ethics approval for the study from National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee London, Queen Square for the trial (ID: 13\LO\0996).

He was not involved in the remainder of the trial until analysis. Independent raters, masked to randomisation status, collected data about patients referred from participating GP practices to memory services, both for the year before and the year after the study. We masked memory services but could not mask GP practices or their patients who received a leaflet. Masked raters collected information from Morbidity Information Query and Export Syntax (MIQUEST), a Department of Health interface for anonymised data extraction from GP practices [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Recruitment and follow-up</title><p>We recruited GP practices and the corresponding memory services to which GP practices referred and collected anonymised baseline and follow-up data.

We used the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) complex intervention development recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to improve the intervention through consultation with the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Society GP reference group, family carers, people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia experts. We refined the text content, layout, colour, illustrations, usability, and acceptability. We then used a professional designer. The leaflet contains information about overcoming common barriers to accessing dementia diagnosis and care if people are concerned about themselves or a relative. It covers how to persuade someone to go to the doctor to seek help if there are memory worries, what information to give to the GP, how to be referred to specialist services, confidentiality, overcoming refusal of help, information available for patients and families about dementia, and what to do if things are not working.</p><p>We developed a personal letter signed by their GP to the &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; population (people &#x02265;70 y living at home without a known diagnosis of dementia) to accompany the leaflet, following similar consultation. The letter was addressed to the individual patient and explained the leaflet was about how to get help for themselves or someone else they knew with memory problems. It outlined potential symptoms, stressed these should have persisted for over 3 mo, that help is available, and they should contact their GP if worried about themselves or a relative. The GPs did not change the main text of the letter, but they provided personalised contact details.

An audit of the referral rates and MMSE scores of people with dementia presenting to one memory service found the mean number of referrals was 11 patients/ practice/y, with a mean MMSE = 19.5 (standard deviation, SD = 6.1). A difference of three points in MMSE has been reported as clinically significant [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We required 71 undiagnosed people with dementia to present to memory clinics in each group in order to detect a difference of three points, with 90% power at a 5% significance level. To account for clustering within each GP practice, we inflated the sample based on a projected intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.03 [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on these calculations, we required a sample size of 93 patients referred in each group. We allowed for 18% attrition of referred patients who did not have the full memory clinic assessment, thus inflating the sample size to 114/group. We planned to recruit 11 GP practices to each arm of the study using the estimate of 11 patients referred per practice per year.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Changes to trial outcome after the trial commenced</title><p>The MMSE was the measure of cognition we had envisaged being available for most patients. However, possibly because of a change in charging for the use of the MMSE [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], many memory services were using other cognitive measures, most commonly the 100 point ACE-R and ACE-III. We decided before we began the analysis to include patients with MMSE scores and to make a complete dataset of MMSE for those without MMSE scores but with ACE scores by imputing the missing data. We employed multiple imputation after using data on the latter to estimate the missing MMSE scores. We ran a regression model on the 221 patients across both study arms who had both MMSE and ACE. This included some people who were excluded from the analysis of outcomes, as they were already known to have dementia.</p><p>The MMSE score was the response variable and the ACE score the predictor. The coefficients of the intercept and the ACE score were statistically significant and consistent with a recent study of established dementia [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This latter model assumes absence of the MMSE is explained entirely by the ACE value, which may be too simplistic. We therefore used multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and controlled for other potentially relevant factors: sex, age, marital status, living condition, education, area-level index of multiple deprivation, and a random effect by practice. Following standard practice, we imputed five complete datasets and analysed them separately, pooling the results using Rubin&#x02019;s rule [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and using these estimates for the remaining analysis. We then converted the ACE scores using the ACE and MMSE as a single outcome score (called &#x0201c;combined MMSE&#x0201d; in this paper).</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Analysis</title><p>There was no study data monitoring committee.

Our intervention was designed to empower patients and increase early diagnosis of dementia through increasing presentation to GPs with memory symptoms. The letters resulted in more people presenting to their GPs from the intervention practices with suspected memory problems. Although there was also a secular increase in GP referrals in both groups, GPs in the intervention group referred less of the people who presented to them with memory problems than in the nonintervention group. We do not know whether the extra patients presenting but not referred were worried well or had cognitive deficits, but overall in both groups there was no increase in the MMSE at diagnosis over time, so GPs are not referring earlier.</p><p>While very low cost, this evidence-based complex intervention planned in accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) complex intervention development recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and incorporating the identified elements of behaviour change of capability; opportunity; and motivation for the patients [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], joins the list of unsuccessful interventions to change GP behaviour and increase timely diagnosis. Previous interventions had not succeeded by trying to work through GPs, we therefore adopted a new approach.</p><p>We are unable to be definitive as to why our approach was unsuccessful, but there are several possible reasons. Our intervention helped empower patients with memory problems to present to GPs. There was nothing specifically targeted at GPs to change their referral behaviour. The intervention may have encouraged some people who do not have dementia to attend their GP and then be reassured their memory problem was not due to dementia, or receive treatment for another problem. Neither GPs nor their patients reported the intervention was upsetting or worrying or led to too much GP work. GPs may usually refer people at crisis points or with more severe dementia, and both GPs and some memory clinics, despite national policy, may not think referral is indicated in mild dementia. This seems to have been a pattern in the past with high mortality in the year after diagnosis [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>While the national strategy to increase dementia diagnosis has changed the behaviour of GPs, no intervention trial has done so [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of whether the change in policy also leads to an earlier diagnosis in terms of cognitive severity. We find that it does not. Thus, GPs are referring more frequently but not earlier in the illness. It is possible that patients in the intervention group, who presented to GPs and were not referred, had a milder dementia or MCI.</p><p>Nonetheless, in the UK, an increase in diagnostic rates has followed the National Dementia Strategy and the subsequent increase in memory clinics [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Dementia Identification Scheme, offering financial incentives to GPs for new diagnoses of dementia, started in October 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dementia-ident-schm-fin.pdf">https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dementia-ident-schm-fin.pdf</ext-link>) and coincided with the study period. National statistics about the people on dementia registers and our finding of highly significant increases in referral rates since the year before baseline in both groups suggest the successful drivers of behaviour change were multifactorial and likely to include national strategies (UK National Dementia Strategy and the Prime Minister&#x02019;s challenge on dementia) and societal change with an increase in publicity about dementia in the national media, which can be considered as large and continuing interventions.</p><p>GPs do not refer all patients with suspected dementia to memory clinics, but our data accounted for individual GPs&#x02019; previous referral practice. We did not expect the reduction in using the MMSE as an initial measure of cognition and had to modify our primary outcome measure. However, we successfully recruited to this study and there were enough people with data on the combined MMSE, with more than twice as many new referrals in each group than our initial power calculation required. We estimated missing MMSE scores by using the ACE score and other covariates. We assumed that MMSE score can be calculated by the observed covariates through our model and accounting for uncertainty in the estimation procedure using multiple imputation. While this is more robust than relating the MMSE and ACE scores using simple regression models to calculate point estimates, there may be unobserved factors, potentially explaining absence in the main outcome variable. We assumed the ACE-R and ACE111 were equivalent, as most of the questions are the same and they correlate significantly (r = 0.99, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The ACE-III also continues to show high sensitivity and specificity at cutoffs of the ACE-R [<xref rid="pmed.1002252.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We were, however, reassured that our other analyses produced similar results to our primary analysis. We equated timely referral with earlier referral, but this may not be so. The increase in diagnoses over time may mean more people were helped by an early referral. We did not undertake a full economic evaluation of the intervention.</p><p>There was considerable missing data regarding ethnicity from the practices in Hertfordshire, which are areas of around 85% white UK ethnicity for the whole population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales#data">http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales#data</ext-link>, accessed 23.6.16). The people in older age groups are probably even more predominantly of white UK ethnicity. Only two people whose ethnicity was reported from these areas were specified as being of nonwhite UK origin. Thus, 68/84 (81.1%) of the people whom we did not have ethnicity data came from these Hertfordshire areas. Our experience is that when an area&#x02019;s population is overwhelmingly white UK, practitioners do not judge it necessary to specify those data in the notes. As other demographic data were detailed, this seems a likely explanation. If we assumed that those whose data were missing from any practice were white UK ethnicity, then 140 (84.3%) people in the intervention and 160 (92.3%) in the control were white UK, although this would probably be a slight overestimate.</p><p>While those who are forgetful are less likely to remember to respond to a letter, we were looking for people with early illness, who do not have an all-pervasive memory problem. In addition, the letter discussed whether they or another relative had a memory problem and could have been picked up by partners or other relatives they were living with. More than half the people referred lived with someone else.</p><p>We categorised the GP datasets through the coded data extracted using MIQUEST, but different GPs may record such data inconsistently, if at all. We were able to consider recording the year before the intervention and adjust for it. We therefore think the between-group differences are true differences.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Clinical implications and conclusions</title><p>An evidence-based complex intervention to empower patients with memory symptoms or their families and increase early diagnosis of dementia through facilitating presentation to GPs was unsuccessful. It increased those with suspected memory problems presenting to their GPs but not referrals from there to memory services. We think this may be because GPs are concerned about the availability of services, both in terms of waiting lists for diagnostic services and of very limited postdiagnostic services.</p><p>We recruited from diverse areas and had excellent follow-up rates, so our findings of lack of effectiveness are likely to be generalisable that GPs are not referring patients earlier in the illness. Interventions likely to be successful in decreasing cognitive severity at diagnosis will need to target both the public and practitioners and particularly concentrate on the benefits of earlier diagnosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002252.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Trial protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002252.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002252.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT statement.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002252.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002252.s003"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>GP intervention leaflet.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002252.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002252.s004"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>GP intervention letter.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002252.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the National Institute for Health Research, through the Dementia and Neurodegenerative Research Network (DeNDRoN), for approaching GP practices and the GP practices and memory clinics who took part in this study; and NoClor (North Central London Research Consortium), Central &#x00026; East London PCRN (Primary Care Research Network), and Herts &#x00026; Essex PCRN for helping us identify the GP practices.
