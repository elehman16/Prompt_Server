The present study aimed to examine the effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in preventing VAP in patients hospitalized in ICU. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 60 mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of developing VAP. NAC (600 mg/twice daily) and placebo (twice daily) were administered to NAC group (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and control group (<italic>n</italic> = 30), respectively, through the nasogastric tube in addition to routine care. The clinical response was considered as primary (incidence of VAP) and secondary outcomes. Twenty-two (36.6%) patients developed VAP. Patients treated with NAC were significantly less likely to develop clinically confirmed VAP compared with patients treated with placebo (26.6% <italic>vs</italic>. 46.6%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.032). Patients treated with NAC had significantly less ICU length of stay (14.36 &#x000b1; 4.69 days <italic>vs</italic>. 17.81 &#x000b1; 6.37 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028) and less hospital stay (19.23 &#x000b1; 5.54 days <italic>vs</italic>. 24.61 &#x000b1; 6.81 days; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) than patients treated with placebo. Time to VAP was significantly longer in the NAC group (9.42 &#x000b1; 1.9 days <italic>vs</italic>. 6.46 &#x000b1; 2.53 days; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). The incidence of complete recovery was significantly higher in the NAC group (56.6% <italic>vs</italic>. 30%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). No adverse events related to NAC were identified. NAC is safe and effective to prevent and delay VAP, and improve its complete recovery rate in a selected, high-risk ICU population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetylcysteine</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd><kwd>ventilator-associated</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>control</kwd><kwd>prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>intratracheal intubation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Ventilator-associated-pneumonia (VAP) is a complication developed in about 30% of mechanically ventilated patients.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients with VAP have higher morbidity and mortality rates, and faced with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay, and are consequently imposed greater hospital costs.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The pathogenesis of VAP is complex; however, bacterial colonization of respiratory and digestive tracts, biofilm formation, and micro aspiration of contaminated secretions are the most important pathogenic factors involved.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The current preventive strategies for VAP are mainly directed at colonization and aspiration modification.
