Advances in understanding the physiology of emesis led to the development of receptor-targeted antiemetics (5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT<sub>3</sub>] antagonists, neurokinin-1 [NK-1] antagonists) and resulted in evidence-based guidelines for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) for acute (within 24&#x000a0;h of chemotherapy administration) and delayed (24&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h after chemotherapy administration) phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>An important risk factor for CINV is the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy regimen, first classified by the Hesketh algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] recommend a combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, dexamethasone, and an NK-1 antagonist to prevent CINV after administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). For moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), guidelines differ somewhat depending on the chemotherapy regimen but generally recommend a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist plus dexamethasone (plus a NK-1 antagonist for select patients).</p><p>Nevertheless, CINV prevention (especially delayed CINV) remains a significant problem and is considerably underestimated by physicians and nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, strategies to improve CINV prevention (especially delayed) are needed. First-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron [oral]) are administered daily because of their short half-lives, usually on day 1 of chemotherapy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They may be administered on days 2 and 3 to control delayed CINV, but their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in this setting are questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist with a longer half-life (&#x0223c;40&#x000a0;h), can be administered on day 1 of chemotherapy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several hypotheses, based on preclinical studies, have been proposed for its mechanism of action, including 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor internalization and prolonged inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor function that continues after palonosetron has dissociated from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>APF530 is a new, subcutaneously (SC) administered polymeric formulation of granisetron that was developed to provide slow, controlled, and sustained release of granisetron to prevent both acute and delayed CINV associated with MEC and HEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. APF530 comprises 2&#x000a0;% granisetron and a polymer vehicle of tri(ethylene glycol) poly(orthoester) (TEG-POE) that undergoes controlled hydrolysis, resulting in slow, controlled, and sustained drug release. The novel biodegradable polymeric excipient is hydrolyzed in vivo, generating nontoxic biodegradable metabolites. This Biochronomer&#x02122; drug delivery system (Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Redwood City, CA) allows therapeutic levels of granisetron to be maintained for &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;days with a single subcutaneous injection. In clinical studies in patients undergoing chemotherapy, single-dose APF530 (5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg granisetron) administered SC in the abdomen provided circulating levels of granisetron within 30&#x000a0;min, a maximum plasma concentration at &#x0223c;24&#x000a0;h, and sustained therapeutic levels for &#x0003e;120&#x000a0;h.</p><p>In this phase 3 noninferiority trial, the clinical efficacy of APF530 250 and 500&#x000a0;mg SC (containing granisetron 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg, respectively) was compared with that of the approved dose of palonosetron (0.25&#x000a0;mg intravenously [IV]) for prevention of acute and delayed CINV following single-day administration of MEC or HEC in patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were men or women &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years old with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy and scheduled to receive single-day MEC or HEC according to then-applicable Hesketh criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

APF530 500&#x000a0;mg SC was also noninferior to palonosetron in preventing delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC. Furthermore, APF530 SC demonstrated antiemetic efficacy over the entire 120-h period after MEC or HEC comparable to that of palonosetron. These results were achieved in a patient population with a variety of cancer types and receiving a range of chemotherapy regimens. The safety profiles of both APF530 SC doses were similar to that of palonosetron and consistent with previous clinical experience with granisetron in the CINV setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ISRs occurred across all treatment groups, but were generally mild and resolved by the end of the study. Thus, APF530 SC appears to add an option to the existing formulations of granisetron (IV, oral, and transdermal), providing sustained release of the drug for prevention of both acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that, at the time the study was designed, palonosetron did not have an established benefit in preventing delayed CINV in patients receiving HEC, so a noninferiority margin could not be set. In addition, some criteria used to classify regimens as MEC or HEC have been updated since the study was conducted. Notably, regimens containing cyclophosphamide plus anthracyclines classified as MEC in this study are now considered to be HEC, and carboplatin-based regimens classified as HEC in this study are now considered to be MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Assigning emetic risk of chemotherapy agents can be controversial, and this is illustrated in the current study. Few chemotherapy agents have been prospectively evaluated to determine their true emetic rate when antiemetics are not given. All rating scales are based on expert consensus, rather than on true high-quality evidence. The Hesketh classification was a diligent effort to try to place combination chemotherapy, rather than just single agents, into a useful system. As with all emetic rating systems, it has limitations. Paradoxically, as seen in the results of the current study, emetic control for all randomized arms was somewhat higher in patients receiving HEC than it was for those receiving MEC, according to the Hesketh system. Limitations of current criteria used in treatment guidelines can be seen in the fact that groups have reclassified emetic risk even of older chemotherapy agents (such as cyclophosphamide plus anthracyclines) more than a decade after first listing these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It was appropriate in this study to give results by older and newer risk criteria, as requested by the FDA. However, it is notable that a post hoc analysis reclassifying patients according to the new antiemetic risk criteria showed no notable statistical or clinical differences in efficacy measures between APF530 and palonosetron; so, it did not alter the conclusions. Moreover, antiemetic guidelines updated after this study was initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] now recommend the use of aprepitant as CINV prophylaxis in patients receiving HEC.</p><p>To date, several large randomized trials have demonstrated that palonosetron is at least as effective as ondansetron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], dolasetron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and granisetron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC. However, in the current trial, a new subcutaneous formulation of granisetron was noninferior to palonosetron (an agent broadly recommended as the preferred 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist in treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), in the control of acute CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC. It has been postulated that the superiority of palonosetron over first-generation agents is in part due to its unique characteristics, including cooperative interactions with substance P and the NK-1 receptor pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our findings of noninferiority of this granisetron formulation to palonosetron appear to question this hypothesis. From the results of this study, it appears that both APF530 and palonosetron provide good antiemetic control in the settings tested, and oral palonosetron was recently reported to be noninferior to palonosetron IV in preventing acute CINV in patients receiving MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The convenience of a single SC injection of APF530 provides an alternative option to palonosetron IV for the prevention of CINV. Post hoc analyses may provide further insights into the efficacy of APF530 SC and the effects of sex, age, type of chemotherapy regimen administered, and prior therapies. Further studies may investigate the potential for APF530 in other clinical situations where sustained antiemetic activity is desired, such as during multiday chemotherapy, in patients receiving radiation therapy, in patients who are unable to tolerate oral antiemetics, in combination with aprepitant and other NK-1 antagonists, and in the postoperative setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the many investigators and their clinical staff who made this study possible and thank the employees at Heron Therapeutics, Inc.
