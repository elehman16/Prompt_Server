hemiplegic patients was developed. This system, which stimulates active exercise while
accounting for intensity, time, and frequency, was examined in the present pilot study.
[Subjects and Methods] Patients had shoulder pain and limited shoulder movement. Changes
in range of motion (ROM) and scores of a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were evaluated
in the experimental and control groups every four weeks for twelve weeks. The modified
motor assessment scale (MMAS) was used before and after experiments. [Results] Significant
differences between experimental times in ROM for shoulder flexion, abduction, and
adduction on the paralyzed side were observed in the experimental group at every time
point. Pain VAS scores in the experimental group improved progressively and significantly
with time, indicating a consistently increasing effect of exercise. There were significant
differences between the MMAS scores before and after completion of the program in the
experimental group. [Conclusion] Muscle strengthening is important in hemiplegic patients,
and active exercise was more efficient than passive exercise in this regard.
Rehabilitation with the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system may represent an
efficient and important tool in upper limb training and comprehensive modern
rehabilitation therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Monkey Chair and Band system</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoulder pain, which is experienced by 70&#x02013;84% of patients with hemiplegic stroke, has
become a dominant factor in delaying participation in a rehabilitation program<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The pain and limited range of motion (ROM) make ambulation more difficult. In addition to
affecting physical activities owing to the compromised ability to maintain balance and
restricting activities of daily living (ADL), this negatively impacts the desire and ability
to engage in social activities because of feelings such as fear, frustration, and
disappointment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the pain is not treated, it also causes edema, joint
instability, joint contracture, and bone and soft tissue atrophy, as well as limits the
ability to move the upper limbs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The goal
of rehabilitation therapy for hemiplegic patients is to allow them to regain independence in
activities and make it easier to perform such activities by improving the movement on the
paralyzed side<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, muscle
strengthening is recommended to improve the ability to perform exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kinesitherapy is essential for preventing muscle tonicity and atrophy in hemiplegic
patients. With continuous exercise, it improves muscular strength and joint flexibility,
which allows performing more physical activities. Most studies on exercise effects show that
exercise contributes to the recovery of physical function. Duncan et al. reported that
balancing ability was increased after twelve weeks of complex exercise including
bicycling<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Smith et al.,
there was a significant improvement in the strength of the hamstrings and spastic reflexes
in patients who received treadmill exercise in the form of a low-intensity cardiac
rehabilitation program administered three times a week for twelve weeks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Rimmer et al. reported that patients who had
performed one-hour exercise programs three times a week for three months showed meaningful
differences in oxygen uptake, muscle, hamstrings, and spine flexion, and body composition
(weight, body mass index [BMI], thickness of subcutaneous fat)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fact that the upper limb motor ability defines the
ability to perform ADL emphasizes the importance of its rehabilitation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For hemiplegic stroke patients, passive or active
exercises using machines and apparatuses are recommended to increase the ROM of the shoulder
joint while simultaneously reducing shoulder pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Generally, physical therapy is combined with apparatus and robotic therapy in
rehabilitation of upper limb motor ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, studies on the effectiveness of rehabilitation robotic systems that assist
hemiplegic patients in performing exercises have been lacking. Furthermore, few comparative
studies have been conducted. Finally, despite their importance, there is a deficit of
studies on the impact of rehabilitation systems on the effect of exercise programs.</p><p>In this study, a simple rehabilitation device system (<italic>Monkey Chair and Band
System</italic>) was developed for strengthening of upper limb muscles of hemiplegic
patients. Unlike the modern complex robotic systems, which utilize only passive exercise,
this system employs active exercise and accounts for factors such as exercise intensity,
time, and frequency. The present pilot study comprehensively investigates the effects of
this new system, focusing on the improvement of upper limbs motor ability by strengthening
muscles in hemiplegic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients with post-stroke hemiparesis were treated at the Rehabilitation Medical Center in
Yongin, Korea. They were enrolled in this study after they understood its purpose. Written
informed consent was obtained before enrollment, and the study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) (HYI-13-046-1). The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1)
presence of post-stroke hemiparesis for at least 6 months as diagnosed by a medical doctor;
2) stable vital signs (heart rate under 100/min, blood pressure under 150/80 mmHg) and
ability to understand the meaning of this study; 3) ability to acquire more than twenty-five
points in the Korean Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE-K); 4) presence of shoulder pain;
and 5) ability to flex and abduct the shoulder actively over 90&#x000b0; with limitation of shoulder
ROM and ability to extend and adduct the shoulder over 20&#x000b0;. Twelve patients who satisfied
the above criteria were assigned randomly to the experimental or control group such that
selection bias in gender, age, and period was eliminated (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Characteristics Group</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Gender (n)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Period (months)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Stroke type (n)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Hemiparetic side (n)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">cerebral hemorrhage</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ischemic stroke</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">right</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">left</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.0 &#x000b1; 13.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.8 &#x000b1; 8.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.7 &#x000b1; 12.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.5 &#x000b1; 15.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.1 &#x000b1; 3.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.5 &#x000b1; 8.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.9 &#x000b1; 7.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.0 &#x000b1; 10.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4 &#x000b1; 10.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.6 &#x000b1; 1.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>M: male; F: female; M: mean; SD: standard deviation; BMI: body mass index</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p><p>First, the general characteristics and subjective symptoms of the participants were
determined via a pre-test examination, and an additional physical examination was performed
for patients who reported pain. Changes in ROM and scores of the visual analog scale (VAS)
for pain were then measured in the experimental and control groups of the <italic>Monkey
Chair and Band</italic> program at weeks 0 (pre-test), 4 (first test), 8 (second test),
and 12 (third test). Modified motor assessment scale (MMAS) scores were also evaluated
before the experiment and after twelve weeks.</p><p>The <italic>Monkey Chair</italic> was developed to help hemiplegic patients exercise
actively during upper limb rehabilitation by improving stability, accuracy, and coordination
between the normal and paralyzed sides. Exercises supported by the device include flexion
&#x00026; extension, adduction &#x00026; abduction, and internal rotation &#x00026; external rotation of
the shoulder, flexion &#x00026; extension of the elbow, and pressing &#x00026; unfolding of the
palm. The device can provide all the elements of precise, active, repetitive, and
goal-directed exercise for brain plasticity improvement. The height, length, and width of
the arms of the <italic>Monkey Chair</italic> were adjusted based on the physical condition
of the patients such that they were able to hold the spindle comfortably. The intensity of
the rotation of the spindle was increased during the test in 4 steps (1.02&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>,
2.75&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>, 4.59&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>, and 6.12&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>). The speed and power of
the spindle could be controlled. The <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system was
designed to strengthen the patients&#x02019; shoulder and elbow muscles by facilitating active
movements. Before starting exercise, the ability to extend a resistive band (Thera-Band,
Hygenic Corporation, USA) was assessed using the formula ([extension length &#x02212;stable
length]/stable length) &#x000d7;100. Depending on the degree of personal adaptation, the exercise
intensity was adjusted every fourth week. Maximum resistance standards were determined based
on the ability to pull the band ten times with the same performance. Depending on the
results, the patients then performed exercise using suitable color-coded bands (yellow:
0.7&#x02013;1.0&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>, red: 0.9&#x02013;1.6&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>, green: 1.1&#x02013;1.9&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>, or
blue: 1.4&#x02013;2.8&#x02005;kg<sub>f</sub>). For better consistency of results, shoulder flexion,
extension, abduction, and adduction on the paralyzed side were measured for ROM
determination using the same joint protractor (Sammons Preston&#x000ae;, 2003) by the same
researcher. During measurements of the passive maximum angle after the active initial
motion, the participants lay straight on their back while being fixed at each axis. The
values at which the patients started to feel constant pain and the range of joint
flexibility were measured. A VAS was used to measure shoulder pain. The MMAS, a tool with
verified reliability and validity in evaluating exercise ability of hemiplegic patients, was
used to assess the upper limbs and ability to walk. The MMAS includes nine elements, with
eight of them designed to evaluate exercise ability and one to assess muscle tension. In
this study, upper arm function, hand movement, and walking ability were measured before and
after the tests. The scale consisted of seven points, from 0 to 6, with higher values
indicating higher ability. The two groups also received the general physical therapy for
stroke patients at the hospital. The program for the experimental group comprised joint
motion (stretching gymnastics), main training, and relaxation using the <italic>Monkey Chair
and Band,</italic> which were performed three times a week for 30 minutes each, for a
total of thirty-six times in twelve weeks. The exercises were performed at an intensity
corresponding to a Rating Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale score of 13 points (70% effort) out
of 15 points (6&#x02013;20). If changing the exercise level induced fatigue as determined based on
the RPE score and degree of pain, the exercise was stopped (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>

means and standard deviations were calculated for all data. Repeated measures analysis of
variance (RMANOVA) was used to evaluate changes in ROM of the shoulder and VAS scores for
every time point and each group during the twelve weeks of exercise. The level of
significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05 for all differences, and the degree of freedom was 5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The differences in ROM of the shoulder on the paralyzed side between the experimental and

Hemiplegic stroke patients experience limitation in shoulder ROM and shoulder pain. This
results in a vicious circle of constantly restricted activities.</p><p>The <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system described in this study seems to maintain
muscle balance by continuously stimulating the flexor and extensor muscles, and it reduces
muscle tone while increasing joint flexibility. In the control group, however, there were no
remarkable improvements in ROM. In some cases, reduction in ROM is caused by unstable
position, inactivity, and decreased muscle and joint flexibility of the affected side.
Therefore, the new system should be efficient in stroke patients who feel frustrated by the
long-term rehabilitation, resulting in insufficient engagement in the rehabilitation
program. Similar to the studies of Bertiti as well as Brouwer et al., a positive effect of
resistance exercise on ROM in hemiplegic stroke patients was detected in the present
work<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises improving both ROM and weigh resistance are necessary for enhancing upper limbs
strength. Moreover, exercises for muscular strength of the elbow and fingers are also
needed, as well as training aimed at improving hand skills and functional work ability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Wolf et al.,
constraint-induced movement therapy led to recovery of functional exercise ability of the
arms in patients three to nine months after a stroke<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The authors suggested that the improvement in motor ability was
due to changes in the central nervous system. This observation further supports the results
of the present study.</p><p>A previous study of the effects of reaching exercise in hemiplegic patients did not detect
significant differences in MMAS scores for upper limb motor skills<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, according to the present results, the
exercise program aimed at stabilization and strength training of the shoulder using the
<italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system improved the MMAS scores.</p><p>Patients in the experimental group, who had suffered from pain, experienced pain relief and
increase in ROM after the completion of the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> program.
No significant differences in pain intensity were observed in the control group, whereas
muscular strength and movement control declined. The differences in shoulder extension ROM
were less significant than the differences in ROM for other shoulder movements. This could
be caused by differences in the state of patients in the experimental and control groups.
Furthermore, body movement instead of joint movement was measured during the extension
exercise. The use of the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system led to especially
large improvements in shoulder flexion (up to 92% compared to 72% at baseline), whereas
conventional manual therapy resulted in no improvement. It can be concluded that further
improvements are needed in remedial exercise equipment, including a wider range of motion.
Furthermore, additional studies are necessary on automation of clinical exercise testing and
frame motion.</p><p>This study has the following limitations. 1) Other treatments for shoulder pain
(acupuncture, oral agents, electrotherapy, and joint cavity injections) were not controlled
for because of ethical issues. 2) Physical therapy and exercises within the regular
rehabilitation therapy differed for patients of the control group because each of them had
an individual treatment program. 3) The results cannot be generalized owing to the
insufficient sample size and study period. 4) Patients who could not flex and abduct the
shoulder beyond 90&#x000b0; and extend and adduct the shoulder beyond 20&#x000b0; were not included in the
study.</p><p>The use of the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> upper limbs strengthening program
resulted in significant differences in both ROM improvement and pain relief compared to the
general therapy, as well as in improvement of muscle strength. According to Kawahira et al.,
repetition of a facilitation technique promoted the functional recovery of the hemiplegic
upper limb to a greater extent than the conventional rehabilitation<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study demonstrated the positive effect of
repetitive and intensive training according to the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic>
program in hemiplegic stroke patients.</p><p>The rehabilitation system presented in this study is more efficient both in terms of time
and cost than the use of complex apparatuses without a systemic program. Moreover, the
developed program is repetitive and easy to adapt to other rehabilitation programs. Active
resistant exercise yielded better results in terms of ROM, pain VAS scores, and MMAS scores
than passive robot-assisted exercises while being less expensive to implement. The use of
the <italic>Monkey Chair and Band</italic> system developed in this study to strengthen the
upper limb muscles via simple active exercise administered according to the therapy program
led to remarkable improvements in ROM and pain VAS scores of hemiplegic upper limbs compared
to passive therapies. Muscle strengthening is clearly of high importance for patients with
hemiplegia, and an active therapy produced a greater effect than a passive therapy.
Therefore, the rehabilitation program utilizing the simple <italic>Monkey Chair and
Band</italic> apparatus can be considered an important tool in efficient training of upper
limbs and comprehensive modern rehabilitation therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JU</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of self-directed exercise using a task board on
