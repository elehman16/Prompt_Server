Cups or pads did not reduce school dropout risk (control=8.0%, cups=11.2%, pads=10.2%). Self-reported absence was rarely reported and not assessable. Prevalence of STIs in the end-of-study survey among controls was 7.7% versus 4.2% in the cups arm (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.48, 0.24 to 0.96, p=0.039), 4.5% with pads (aPR=0.62; 0.37 to 1.03, p=0.063), and 4.3% with cups and pads pooled (aPR=0.54, 0.34 to 0.87, p=0.012). RTI prevalence was 21.5%, 28.5% and 26.9% among cup, pad and control arms, 71% of which were bacterial vaginosis, with a prevalence of 14.6%, 19.8% and 20.5%, per arm, respectively. Bacterial vaginosis was less prevalent in the cups (12.9%) compared with pads (20.3%, aPR=0.65, 0.44 to 0.97, p=0.034) and control (19.2%, aPR=0.67, 0.43 to 1.04, p=0.075) arm girls enrolled for 9&#x02005;months or longer.

To allow for a design effect of 1.25 and 7.5% loss to follow-up, 250 girls (10 schools with an average of 25 girls per school) were scheduled for recruitment per arm.

After all balls were chosen, a DEO opened the three envelopes to reveal the colour-allocated assignment. Following randomisation, participants and study nurses were made aware of the allocation, but allocation was concealed from the laboratory staff and the trial statistician until the database was locked.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>Meetings were held in the 30 study schools with parents/caregivers, target-aged girls, and teachers to discuss the study and answer questions.

This documented which days girls had their menstruation and which days they were absent from school. Calendars were formatted as a teleform; data was captured from weekly scanning of images to the local database, and then extracted to the raw database. Health facilities in the study area were visited to explain the study, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) symptoms and the process of tertiary care referral, and the researcher's contact details given. Communication was established with district hospitals for suspected TSS admissions. Participants, families, and schools received written information about the study, TSS symptoms, how to contact the study staff, and health facility referral.</p><p>Kenyan registered study nurses employed full time during the study visited schools weekly to follow-up girls and assess any safety issues. At each scheduled follow-up, nurses documented menstruation, intervention use, adverse events, and any problems on a one-to-one basis. Nurses physically checked girls' cups to ascertain use (by cup colour change), damage, or loss. Girls were referred to the district hospital gynaecologist for clinical assessment if required. The trained nurses instructed girls to self-complete a vaginal swab for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> to evaluate vaginal colonisation, and positives were retested to evaluate the prevalence of TSS toxin production. A random sample of 35 cups was obtained to evaluate <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> growth. HDSS census and health clinic record reviews were conducted to assess any deaths, TSS, or other severe adverse events among participants.</p><p>Homes of all girls absent for a term were visited to document reasons for non-attendance, whether the participant had dropped out of school or was temporarily absent (eg, due to illness) or had migrated and when, and whether they were pregnant. If pregnant, information was collected to establish the estimated delivery time (ie, the dates of last menstrual period or conception, if known) and the birth outcome if delivery had taken place. This was conducted by community health workers in each village trained as &#x02018;village recorders&#x02019; (VR) within the HDSS. Lists of absent girls and the geolocation of their residence were forwarded to each VR for follow-up. Participant dropout was identified through a computer-generated list of girls absent from nurse screening each term. Nurses verified with teaching staff if the listed participants did not attend school the previous term. If girls failed to attend a scheduled nurse screening visit but were reported as present in the school, an alternate screening visit date was arranged, or if the girl refused to attend a screening visit it was explored whether the girl intended to withdraw from the study. If girls were found to be absent from the school and if teachers confirmed non-attendance or did not know, girls were scheduled to be visited at home by a VR. All girls were visited at home at the end of the study to validate earlier findings, plus capture any missed dropouts, pregnancies, and pregnancy outcomes.

If girls had not yet reached menarche, but otherwise fulfilled all other entry criteria, they were eligible for enrolment during the course of the study as soon as they started menstruating. At enrolment, all participants in each arm received puberty and hygiene training; girls in the cups and pads arms received menstrual product-specific training from study nurses after enrolment. Girls attending cup-allocated schools were each provided one menstrual cup (Mooncup (Mooncup, Brighton, UK), size B; see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure S1</xref>) with written and verbal instructions on cup insertion and cleaning. Menstrual cups are reusable bell-shaped receptacles which collect &#x0223c;30&#x02005;mL of menstrual blood when inserted into the vaginal canal.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Emptying is required every 4&#x02013;8&#x02005;hours depending on menstrual flow. Once emptied can be immediately reinserted, with cleansing by boiling occurring at the end of a cycle. The Mooncup used in this study was sourced from the UK. It is made of high-grade medical silicone which is safe, durable, and pliable, and the material is hypoallergenic with no open pores or edges to harbour bacteria. They are manufactured in the UK to ISO 13485:2003 standards, and have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Mooncups are available for sale in Kenya, marketing at a cost of &#x0223c;$25 each in 2012. Girls in pad-allocated schools received 16 Always sanitary pads (2 packs per month) and corresponding instructions. Always sanitary pads are available in Kenya and were sourced locally in Kisumu for &#x0223c;$1 per pack in 2012. Girls attending control schools continued their usual practice. All girls received hand-washing soap, and pencils for calendar completion. All schools were provided with detergent soap each month for hand washing.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013229.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-013229supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes were school dropout, defined as non-attendance for one term with no return to school; and days' absence, defined as self-reported days absent per 100 schooldays (excluding weekends, holidays, strikes, etc).

For binary outcomes, we compared treatment groups with unadjusted and multivariate log-binomial Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) models with the school as the cluster variable. Results were expressed as the risk ratio and 95% CI. For continuous responses, we used unadjusted and multivariate linear regression models using a normal distribution and identity link functions, and expressed results as the mean difference (95% CI). An independent covariance structure with a robust variance estimator was used for GEE models. Prespecified covariates included girls' baseline age, SES and self-reported sexual intercourse. Age at enrolment and age at menarche were documented as integers in years as girls did not know their dates of birth, with the majority increasing their annual age at each January school enrolment. Age was collapsed into 14 years and 15&#x02013;16 years. SES index was calculated using a weighted average using multiple correspondence analyses (MCA).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> MCA indicators were generated from biennial household surveys in the HDSS, documenting the occupation of household head, primary source of drinking water, use of cooking fuel, in-house assets (eg, lantern lamp, sofa, bicycle, radio and television) and livestock (poultry, pigs, donkey cattle, sheep and goats).<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The SES of households for each participant was ranked into quintiles. This was collapsed into a dichotomous variable of poorest (40%) and less poor (60%). Two absence rates were created (a) days absence per 100 viable schooldays (ie, excluding weekends, and school closure days including holidays, school strikes, etc) and (b) days absent during period per 100 menstruating viable schooldays. Missing values for SES and reported sexual intercourse were imputed. Intracluster correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for primary outcomes. To determine the effect of duration on the treatment effect, secondary stratified analysis was conducted by the duration that girls were enrolled in the study. This was calculated from the date intervention provided to the date of the outcome measured. These were then collapsed into two categorical time thresholds, duration of follow-up at least 9&#x02005;months (yes/no), and duration of follow-up for at least 12&#x02005;months (yes/no). Finally, we compared the effects of cups among girls whose cup was observed by nurses to change colour, against those with no colour change and against controls. Analysis was conducted in SAS V.9.3 and SPSS V.22. No adjustment was made for multiplicity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Girls were enrolled from 15 August 2012 to 27 August 2013 and followed until 21 November 2013.

Furthermore, as our study was nested in a HDSS, it allowed us to visit participants' homes to confirm cases of migration or school dropout, and to document any pregnancies and related birth outcomes. This approach minimised the under-reporting of pregnancy-related dropouts due to the stigma associated with premarital sex, although some still may have been missed.</p><p>The study was designed as an exploratory feasibility study to support the design of future trials and was not powered to detect small-to-moderate differences in outcomes between study arms, especially taking the relatively short duration of follow-up into account (median 10.9&#x02005;months). The study duration was compromised by a national teachers' strike at the start of enrolment, plus late entry of younger girls who could only enter the study once they reached menarche. The relatively short intervention period was compounded by the slow initial uptake of cups, requiring time for familiarisation before girls used them regularly,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> as reported in a Nepalese study.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Our results suggest 9 or more months intervention were required before potential beneficial effects became apparent, reducing our study power as only two-thirds of girls were followed for at least 9&#x02005;months, and half of them for more than 1&#x02005;year. This short duration limited the study's ability to detect differences in school dropout. The rate of dropout appeared higher during early intervention, and declined in the second year for participants followed longer, which may reflect that the most vulnerable girls were among early dropouts, including those at higher risk of STI. Studies to date, predominantly using school registers, have not shown a strong association between absence and menstrual intervention with varying duration of follow-up ranging between 1-month and 1-year.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref> Attendance data may be a poor measure of menstrual intervention effectiveness in SSA where girls report multiple reasons for absenteeism.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The limitations of routine registration has also been noted in school-based helminth studies.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> One menstrual cup study using a combination of school registers and time diary data for a subset of girls was able to ascertain that girls miss a total of 0.4 menstruating days in a 180&#x02005;day school year in Nepal.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We could not use our calendar data to confirm or refute this; although girls filled in the days of their menstruation, many did not self-report absence days. Lack of quantifiable school absence here and in other pilot studies,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> contrasts with girls',<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and parents narratives.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is unclear if girls in this environment exaggerate missed time when in focus groups but not in structured questionnaires,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> if girls avoid reporting reasons that are associated with stigma (such as teenage pregnancy), fear repercussions when reporting absence (which we consider possible in our study), or if menstrual absence due to abdominal cramps or other reasons over-ride any menstrual product effect.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Further research is needed to better quantify the effects of menstrual interventions on school absence, and it seems prudent that studies validate their measurement tools in pilot studies and spot-checks.</p><p>The impact on STIs was assessed using the prevalence of STIs at the end of the follow-up. Logistical constraints prevented testing for STIs at baseline and any pre-existing differences in STI prevalence cannot be excluded. It is recommended that future trials evaluating these interventions assess the incidence of STIs. Similarly, collection of baseline and end line sexual behaviours would confirm or refute any hypothesised intervention effect.</p><p>An important component of this study was the necessity to ensure that cup users were able to use them hygienically. Owing to the limited literature on the potential risk of poor school hygiene on menstrual cup safety, we selected schools based on pupil&#x02013;latrine ratio, some separate latrines for girls, and the availability of water at the baseline spot-check. This limits the generalisability of our study, and it is unclear if the results can be extrapolated to schools without these conditions; however, while these inclusion criteria were met at baseline, observational follow-up and separate discussions with girls revealed conditions fluctuated and schools often did not supply soap or water.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is noted that concerted effort is underway in many countries including Kenya to address WASH in schools, with national guidelines on minimal standards.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Adequate hygiene also required preintervention education, provision of soap throughout the study, and presence of a nurse in the schools. Soap was provided to all girls, to ensure a balance between the arms. Girls in the control group received small (non-menstrual) items, such as pencils or a biro pen, at similar intervals to those in the other arms for diary completion. This frequent exposure to study nurses was appreciated by all girls, including those in the control group, and may have positively influenced girls' attitude to school and attendance.</p><p>In conclusion, our feasibility study found that provision of menstrual cups and sanitary pads for &#x0223c;1 school-year was not associated with a significant effect on school dropout, but was associated with a lower risk of STIs in schoolgirls in western Kenya. We hypothesise this is due to reducing the need for transactional sex to obtain menstrual products. These results are relevant to other areas with similar high frequency of transactional coerced sex among adolescent girls. Our study also suggests that cup use may be associated with less bacterial vaginosis, which is common in SSA and a known risk factor for STIs and HIV acquisition and transmission. Menstrual cups are safe to use and well accepted after a familiarisation phase,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and can be reused for up to 10&#x02005;years, and so are more cost-effective than pads. This was a pilot study and the findings now need to be confirmed in a larger trial with longer follow-up among secondary schoolgirls, who are vulnerable to sexual coercion and pregnancy-related dropout.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Metagenomic studies evaluating the effect of menstrual cups on the vaginal microbiome and subsequent potential effect on STI, HIV transmission, and maternal health are also recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the head teachers, school staff, girls and their parents in the study schools for their full participation throughout this study.
