The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between circadian salivary cortisol levels, cortisol suppression by dexamethasone and genetic polymorphisms in some HPA axis-related genes to the response to placebo and fluoxetine in depressed patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The diagnosis and severity of depression were performed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D<sub>17</sub>), respectively. Euthyroid patients were treated with placebo (one week) followed by fluoxetine (20&#x000a0;mg) (two months). Severity of depression was re-evaluated after placebo, three weeks and two months of fluoxetine treatments. Placebo response was defined as HAM-D<sub>17</sub> score reductions of at least 25% and to&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;15. Early response and response were reductions of at least 50% after three weeks and two months, and remission with&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7 after two months. Plasma TSH, free-T4, circadian salivary cortisol levels and cortisol suppression by dexamethasone were evaluated. Seven genetic polymorphisms located in the Corticotrophin-releasing-hormone-receptor-1 (rs242939, rs242941, rs1876828), Corticotrophin-releasing-hormone-receptor-2 (rs2270007), Glucocorticoid-receptor (rs41423247), FK506-binding-protein-5 (rs1360780), and Arginine-vasopressin (rs3729965) genes were determined. Association analyses between response to placebo/fluoxetine and polymorphism were performed by chi-square or Fisher exact test. Cortisol levels were compared by <italic>t</italic>-test, ANOVA and the general linear model for repeated measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>208 depressed patients were recruited, 187 of whom were euthyroid. Placebo responders, fluoxetine responders and remitters exhibited significantly lower circadian cortisol levels than those who did not respond (p-values of 0.014, 0.008 and 0.021 respectively). Patients who abandoned treatment before the third week also exhibited a trend to low cortisol levels (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057). The polymorphisms rs242939 (CRHR1) and rs2270007 (CRHR2) were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only the rs242939 polymorphism (CRHR1) exhibited association with early response (three weeks) to fluoxetine (p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.043). No other association between outcomes and polymorphisms was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results support the clinical relevance of low salivary cortisol levels as a predictor of antidepressant response, either to placebo or to fluoxetine. Only one polymorphism in the CRHR1 gene was associated with the early response. Other factors may be involved in antidepressant response, although further studies are needed to identify them.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12888-014-0220-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>Salivary cortisol</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd><kwd>Fluoxetine</kwd><kwd>Antidepressants</kwd><kwd>Polymorphisms</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) [MIM 608516] is a highly prevalent mental disorder, characterized by depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, often accompanied by high suicide rates. Lifetime prevalence of MDD in Chile is high, with an average of approximately 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The recurrence risk of depression is also high and correlates with the number of previous episodes. Consequently, to avoid recurrence once depression has been diagnosed, it must be promptly and efficiently treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Nearly 40% of patients do not respond to the antidepressants recommended as a first line of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and approximately 40% accomplish full remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Antidepressant therapeutic action is typically observed after 2&#x02013;4 weeks of treatment. Therefore when an antidepressant treatment fails, there is a long delay until insufficient outcome can be assumed with some confidence, and as a result many patients lose time with ineffective antidepressant therapies. For these reasons, it is essential to find reliable markers that can help to predict the antidepressant outcome and to design effective personalized therapies.</p><p>The most common antidepressants currently available, including fluoxetine (FLX), are targeted to the monoaminergic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The effects of antidepressants on monoamines are observed within a few hours. Intriguingly, the therapeutic response is observed with a delay of several weeks after the initiation of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This indicates that something beyond normalization of monoamines is required to accomplish the clinical antidepressant response. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis has been observed in patients with major depressive disorder and with poorer antidepressant outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, elevated cortisol levels and no suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone suppression test (DST) have been associated with worse antidepressant treatment outcome, relating the HPA axis dysregulation to the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This suggests that patients resistant to antidepressant treatment may represent a biologically distinct group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, 30-40% of patients with MDD respond to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the mechanisms underlying the placebo effects are still unknown, neurobiological changes such as neuroimaging differences between placebo responders and non-responders have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently low cortisol levels were reported in depressed patients with early life stress experiences that responded to placebo treatment, suggesting that the mechanisms of placebo effect could involve HPA axis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hence responsiveness to either placebo or antidepressant treatments may be related to the extent of the dysregulation of the HPA axis and to the ability to normalize the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition, responsiveness could be influenced by other factors such as genetic polymorphisms or epigenetic modifications that interfere with the normal function of some genes of the HPA axis, limiting the normalization induced by antidepressants. For instance, polymorphisms in corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 and 2 (CRHR1 and CRHR2), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) have been previously associated with HPA (dys) regulation, MDD and/or antidepressant response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Briefly, in the GR gene some of the SNPs have been associated with depression and antidepressant effects. One of them, the BclI polymorphism, has been associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], higher ACTH levels and a trend to lower response rates to paroxetine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The FKBP5 gene, that encodes for a co-chaperone of heat shock protein 90 that regulates GR sensitivity, has three polymorphisms associated with rapid response to antidepressant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One of them, rs1360780 SNP was associated with higher intracellular FKBP51 protein expression, antidepressant response and higher recurrence of depressive episodes in the lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also, three polymorphisms in the CRHR1 gene (rs1876828, rs242939, and rs242941) were associated with major depressive disorder and with antidepressant response to FLX in Chinese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and better antidepressant response in a high anxiety depressed group of Mexican-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. CRHR2 functioning has been related to reactivity of the HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and carriers of the G allele of rs2270007 polymorphism showed worse overall response to citalopram (SSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Finally, as far as we know there are no previous association studies of the AVP gene with MDD or antidepressant response; however, animal model studies suggest that the AVP gene represents a strong candidate to explain the genetic influence in MDD and response to therapy. For instance, AVP overexpression was observed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of rat models with extreme anxiety and in stressed or depressed rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. AVP overexpression in the extreme anxiety model was caused by a SNP A (&#x02212;1276) G in the promoter of the AVP gene, reducing the binding of a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, chronic FLX treatment significantly reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> AVP release from rat hypothalamic organ culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In humans, polymorphisms like the one mentioned in rats have not been described, however polymorphisms in this gene may have subtle effects contributing to related phenotypes. In a previous study (data not shown) we explored for polymorphisms by DNA sequencing of 1.1 kilobases (kb) of the promoter region of the AVP gene (&#x02212;1050 &#x02013; +60&#x000a0;bp) in 26 samples of Chilean depressed patients. We found that the rs3729965 SNP was relatively polymorphic and putatively included in a site recognized by a transcription factor (MZF1).</p><p>In this article we analyze the relation between circadian salivary cortisol levels and cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression test (DST) with the placebo response after one week of treatment, with the response to FLX after three weeks and two months of treatment, with remission after two months and with adherence to treatment. Lower levels of salivary cortisol were observed in placebo responders, in FLX responders after two months of treatment and in those that reached full remission than in those who did not respond in each group. Also, a trend to lower cortisol levels was observed in the group of patients who abandoned the study before the third week of treatment compared to the group that continued the treatment. The genetic profiles of seven polymorphisms located in corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1, rs242939, rs242941, rs1876828), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2, rs2270007), GR (rs41423247), FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5, rs1360780) and Arginine vasopressin (AVP, rs3729965) genes were analyzed in all subjects. This group of polymorphisms does not represent the total genetic variation in these genes.</p><p>Two of these SNPs were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, rs242939 of the CRHR1 gene and rs2270007 of the CRHR2 gene, and only one polymorphism was associated with the early response to FLX (three weeks); rs242939 of CRHR1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>This is a prospective longitudinal study that involves clinical follow-up of depressed patients. All examinations were performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were enrolled in the waiting rooms of two primary health care centers of Santiago, CESFAM Pablo Neruda and CESFAM Juan Antonio Rios, and they were treated as outpatients throughout the entire course of the study. All patients signed a full written informed consent approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile.</p><p>To identify patients with current major depressive disorder a two-stage screening process was used. Briefly, all eligible and consenting patients were asked to complete the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). This brief 12-item instrument, previously validated in Chile, measures current mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD) and to exclude other psychiatric disorders, individuals with scores of 4 or more in the GHQ-12 were invited for a DSM-IV based Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] [American Psychiatric Association, 1994]. The ratings of symptom severity were evaluated using the 17-item version of the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D<sub>17</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Three clinicians with formal training in the use of these instruments were calibrated on scale scoring of HAM-D<sub>17</sub> and MINI. Patients with a score of at least 15 on HAM-D<sub>17</sub> were included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Exclusion criteria included medical or neurological illnesses, acute or chronic infections, abnormal thyroid function, hypertension, pregnancy, breastfeeding, current substance abuse and co-morbid current psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, bipolar depression, severe cognitive impairment and clear suicide risk). The subjects had to be medication-free for at least two months prior to the beginning of the treatment. Also, patients with history of treatment-resistant MDD, defined as non-responders to two previous trials of antidepressants at adequate dosages, were excluded.</p><p>This study included the placebo treatment of all patients (lactose tablets) during one week, after which the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> test was applied again. The placebo response was defined as a reduction in at least 25% of the initial score and to an endpoint lower than 15. We selected this cutoff, which is not very strict, because the placebo treatment was performed during only one week. Greater placebo effects are usually observed after 2&#x02013;3 weeks of placebo treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], however for ethical reasons and since there are proven treatments for major depression we could not delay the initiation of treatment with FLX any longer. Subsequently, patients were treated with FLX antidepressant only at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/day during three weeks, and then increased to 40&#x000a0;mg/day depending on clinical outcome and tolerance. In case of anxiety symptoms or insomnia, alprazolam or zolpidem were prescribed (13% of the patients). To rate changes in the severity of depression and to evaluate the response, assessments using the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> scale were made at the third week and after two months of FLX treatment. For the purposes of this study the final evaluation was carried out after two months of treatment, although patients continued with it. The therapeutic response was evaluated by calculating the percentages of HAM-D<sub>17</sub> score reduction by the third week and two months of FLX treatment, ((baseline score &#x02013; three weeks or two months score) &#x000d7; 100/baseline score). The baseline considered to evaluate response rate to FLX was the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> score obtained after placebo treatment. Early responders and responders to therapy were defined as those patients showing a reduction in the initial HAM-D<sub>17</sub> scores of at least 50% after three and eight weeks of treatment, respectively. Remitters were defined as patients with&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7 in HAM-D<sub>17</sub> after two months of treatment. Non-responders and non-remitters were those who did not reduce the score by at least 50% or to&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7 in the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> by the corresponding time of treatment. Patients who did not respond to FLX were changed to another antidepressant drug, according to regular clinical practice. To minimize the placebo effect achieved by the professional towards the patient, contacts between patient and physician were established only during scheduled clinical evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Endocrine evaluation</title><p>After the diagnosis and evaluation of severity using HAM-D<sub>17,</sub> TSH, free T4 and circadian salivary cortisol levels were evaluated. Patients with altered thyroid hormones were excluded. Normal range for TSH was 0.70-5.52 mUI/L (our results 0.75-5.5) and T4F 0.80-1.80&#x000a0;ng/dL (our results 0.84-1.69) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Salivary cortisol levels were evaluated at 08:00, 12:00, 15:00 (after lunch) and 23:00. After the last saliva collection, patients took a low dose of Dexamethasone (0.5&#x000a0;mg) and a new saliva sample was collected at 8:00&#x000a0;AM the following morning. This was performed to evaluate the suppression effect of dexamethasone (dexamethasone suppression test, DST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The salivary circadian cortisol levels and DST evaluations were performed at the end of the week of placebo and after two months of FLX treatments.</p><p>We evaluated the salivary cortisol circadian rhythm by collecting saliva samples in plastic disposable tubes at 08:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 23:00 as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The sensitivity of HPA negative feedback was assessed by the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For the DST, 0.5&#x000a0;mg of dexamethasone was given at 23:00 and a salivary sample was taken the next day at 08:00. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 &#x000d7; g for 2&#x000a0;min and the free cortisol was measured in the supernatant using the DIASource enzyme immunoassay, (Diasource, Nivelles, Belgium), with a sensitivity of 0.01&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/dL and intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) lower than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Only six patients (3.2%) showed the placebo response, defined as a reduction in HAM-D<sub>17</sub> scores by at least 50%, two of whom reached full remission after two months of FLX treatment. Since the placebo treatment period was too short, only one week, we decided to apply less strict criteria to classify placebo responders. Therefore the cutoff for placebo response was defined as a reduction of at least 25% of the baseline and scoring less than 15 in the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> scale. Under this criterion 21 out of the 187 patients (11.23%) responded to placebo. Placebo responders started with HAM-D<sub>17</sub> average scores of 21.67 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.02; CI: 20.29-23.04) and reduced it significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) to an average of 11.76 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.17; CI: 10.78-12.75).

The reduction in this non-responder group was also significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), although it represented only a score reduction of 8.8%. The initial HAM-D<sub>17</sub> average scores before the initiation of placebo treatment were not significantly different in the placebo responder and non-responder groups (21.67 compared to 21.31); 82 out of the 187 euthyroid patients (43.85%) had received previous antidepressant treatment. Only four of them (4.88%) responded to placebo while the remaining 78 did not (95.22%). In the group of 105 patients with no previous antidepressant treatment, 17 responded to placebo (16.2%) and 88 did not (83.8%).

The gender bias in the recruited patients may be explained by several factors, such as higher prevalence of MDD in women than in men, men not wanting to participate due to work reasons, the interviews being performed during working hours when more homemaker women than men attend medical services, as shown by 52% of our recruited MDD patients being housewives, among others. The low number of males included in this study prevents us from evaluating the role of gender in the outcome. The average of the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score of the recruited patients (21.45, SD 3.78) corresponds to moderate to very severe depression (HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score =15 to 35).</p><p>The non-euthyroid patients were 10.1% of the total recruited patients; 8.2% were hypothyroid and 1.9% hyperthyroid. This result is in agreement with other studies carried out in similar kinds of patients. For instance, Chilean individuals with anxiety and mood disorders exhibited 9.7% hypothyroidism and 2.2% hyperthyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in the general population is 1-2%; it is more frequent in women and in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The high rate of hypothyroidism observed supports the idea that it is more prevalent in patients with mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Placebo effect in depressed patients</title><p>Placebo effect has been defined as &#x0201c;any improvement of symptoms or signs following a physically inert intervention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The placebo effect is especially effective in relieving subjective symptoms such as pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression, although the best understood is the one that works on analgesic responses.</p><p>For antidepressant treatments, reduction in rating scales either for placebo or different antidepressants is perceived in the first week, however most placebo antidepressant effects are observed after 2&#x02013;3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In our study, although many patients improved after placebo treatment, only six of them reduced at least 50% of the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> score after placebo. This was expected considering the short period of placebo treatment. Therefore, we reduced the strictness of the placebo response classification to a reduction of at least 25% of HAM-D<sub>17</sub> scores and to scores lower than 15 by the end of the week. The period we used placebo was limited due to ethical reasons. Under these conditions we found that 11.23% of the patients responded to placebo, which could be considered as a high rate in view of the short period of placebo treatment selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Placebo effects are influenced by several factors such as caregiver interaction, learned expectations or experience with previous treatments. Caregiver interaction was controlled in this study by limiting the contact between patient and physician to scheduled clinical evaluations, but the other two factors could not be prevented. In fact, our results showed that previous antidepressant treatments, which could be related to expectations and previous experiences, were associated with poorer placebo response (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019). Thus patients with no previous antidepressant treatment had a better chance of responding to placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Placebo effect and circadian salivary cortisol levels</title><p>The placebo effect is a psychobiological phenomenon that can be attributable to neurobiological mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Recently, low cortisol levels in depressed patient with early life stress experiences who also responded to placebo treatment were reported, suggesting that the mechanisms of placebo effect could have physiological bases such as HPA axis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Something similar was observed in studies of placebo effects in analgesia, with the report of reduction of cortisol levels after placebo administration when preconditioned with sumatripan (a 5-HT1B/1D agonist that stimulates GH and inhibits cortisol secretion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, literature reports demonstrated that placebo treatments partially reproduce cerebral glucose metabolism in FLX-treated depressed men in randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Reviewed by Benedetti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]). We determined circadian salivary cortisol levels and DST, and evaluated their association with placebo treatment outcome. Lower baseline salivary cortisol levels were consistently related to better response to placebo intake (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), supporting that HPA axis activity could have a role in the mechanisms of placebo antidepressant effect and that placebo responders correspond to a distinct biological group. For example, this group could be composed of people suffering from a DSM-IV adaptive disorder rather than MDD. Additionally, a meta-analysis carried out by Knorr et al. showed higher salivary cortisol levels in depressed patients compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It has been shown in several studies that cortisol or hydrocosterone may alter autobiographical and emotional perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Thus, it could be proposed that elevated cortisol may be related to altered perception of events and the course of depression disorder. Similarly, lower cortisol levels in the placebo and FLX responder groups may also indicate lesser biological disturbance in stress regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>Nevertheless, in our placebo effect study we evaluated cortisol levels at the end of the week of placebo treatment, therefore we do not know whether the cortisol levels were reduced as a consequence of the placebo treatment or if baseline levels were already low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further studies could be performed to determine this.</p><p>Finally, we cannot discount that the placebo effect observed did have a causal connection with the outcome. This could be explained by other causes such as the natural course of the disease or more desire or motivation for improvement in the group with lower HPA activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

In fact, the antidepressant response observed following drug treatment may include a placebo effect, therefore in our study the relatively low response rate (54%) might be explained by the exclusion of the placebo responders, who would have probably responded to FLX treatment too. Thus placebo responders could most likely to benefit from a biologically active treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>FLX treatment outcome and circadian salivary cortisol levels</title><p>Circadian salivary cortisol levels and DST, and their relationship with placebo and FLX treatment outcome were evaluated. Our results show that lower salivary cortisol levels were consistently related to better response to both placebo and FLX after two months of treatment (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). No significant difference was observed between early and non-early responders. The results were the same when we excluded the OC users. There is evidence that oral contraceptive use results in higher corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) levels with consequent higher total cortisol levels. This increase only affects bound cortisol; free cortisol levels are unaltered in states of increased CBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Therefore the similarity between results using OC or not is reliable.</p><p>The relationship between higher cortisol levels and poorer response to placebo and FLX treatments is in agreement with the hypothesis that the extent of dysregulation of HPA might be related to worse outcome. The elevated baseline cortisol levels in non-responders could be explained by several factors such as differential genetic and/or epigenetic individual profiles that maintain cortisol levels elevated.</p><p>No differences in cortisol after DST was observed in the groups of responders and non-responders.</p><p>Non-suppression of cortisol secretion by dexametasone has been reported in depressed patients, supposedly caused by altered cortisol feedback inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In previous studies we performed DST in depressed patients using the standard dose of 1&#x000a0;mg dexametasone, observing high suppression rates (data not shown). Therefore, in this study we performed the DST using a reduced dose of dexametasone (0.5&#x000a0;mg). Interestingly, 93.6% of the patients suppressed after intake of dexamethasone and consequently only 6.4% of the whole group of euthyroid patients did not exhibit suppression. These differences with other studies may be related to several factors such as ethnic differences and different diagnostic criteria used. The suppression after dexametasone intake was not related to the capacity to respond to placebo or FLX, however in remitters cortisol levels were significantly lower after DST than in non-remitters. This suggests that remitters are more sensitive to cortisol feedback inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Genetic associations</title><p>Many studies have associated polymorphisms in genes involved in the HPA axis, MDD and other personality traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] with antidepressant response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. For instance, some reports have suggested a relationship between CRHR1 polymorphisms (rs1876828, rs242939, and rs242941) and both the risk of suffering major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and antidepressant response to FLX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. CRHR2 polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of suffering major depression with borderline significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and with a worse overall response to citalopram (SSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similar associations have been reported for polymorphisms in the AVP, GR and FKBP5 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>The CRHR1 (rs242941, rs1876828), GR (rs41423247), FKBP5 (rs1360780) and AVP (rs3729965) polymorphisms analyzed in this study were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, however the polymorphisms of rs242939 of CRHR1 and rs2270007 of the CRHR2 genes were not. It is possible that the bias in the sample selection, i.e. depressed patients, may explain these results. If these polymorphisms are related to MDD, then the selected group does not represent the general population, explaining the disequilibrium observed. A comparison with non-depressed subjects of the same population could help to decipher this issue.</p><p>In the association analyses between the polymorphisms and the outcome, allele and genotype association with the polymorphism rs242939 of CRHR1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.043) was found. These results strengthen the concept that CRHR1 is involved in antidepressant response and also suggest that CRHR1 could have greater effect than other genes whose association was not detected in this study under the conditions used, but have been associated by other groups. CRHR1 is a receptor of CRH with higher affinity for it than CRHR2 and is highly expressed in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. CRHR1 has been related to BDNF expression in the hippocampus. In animal models, the increase in corticoids induced by stress leads to reduction of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, an effect related to reduction of BDNF expression (reviewed by Ventura-Junc&#x000e1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]). Interestingly, the hippocampal volume reduction could be reversed by antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The rs242939 polymorphism is located in an intron region of the CRHR1 gene; it has is yet to be determined if the genetic association observed here and by others is caused by a direct functional biological effect of this polymorphism or another linked to it.</p><p>The lack of expected association effects of other polymorphisms in CRHR1, CRHR2, GR, FKBP5 and AVP genes could be interpreted in several ways. First of all, MDD is a very complex disorder in which many genes each of small effect could be interacting. If epistatic effects involving some or all of these genes are occurring, much larger sample sizes should be studied. Also, there might be ethnic differences in allele frequencies and/or different linkage groups with other functional polymorphisms in the Chilean population compared to those included in the publications reporting association. In turn, the treatment response might be also influenced by other factors such as epigenetic alterations in genes important to HPA functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Additionally, the disorder evaluated in this study is moderate to severe depression. Probably, a more extreme phenotype could have shown a more important genetic involvement or a stricter definition of the phenotype might be more related to the genes. Lastly, it is possible that the lack of reproducibility of other studies could be caused by a publication bias effect toward positive results, generating the idea that experiments with negative results rarely occur. Thus genetics might explain only few of the causes of depression and outcome.</p><p>Gene-gene interactions have been hypothesized to be related to MDD and to antidepressant outcome. The sample size of our study and the low allele frequency of each minor allele do not allow us to perform these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Previous treatment effect on outcome after FLX treatment</title><p>As mentioned before, personal history of previous antidepressant treatments was significantly associated with unresponsiveness to placebo (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019). Nevertheless, it was not related to response to FLX treatment at any time or to remission. This suggests that the widely reported antidepressant unresponsiveness in patients with history of previous ineffective treatments could be more related to reduction in placebo effect rather than to a lack of neurochemical action of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This might be related to the partial response reported within 2&#x000a0;weeks of antidepressant treatment as the most important positive predictor for achieving remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. We propose that this quick response could be more related to the placebo effect than to antidepressant specific action(s).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Adherence to a treatment</title><p>26.5% of the patients who initiated FLX treatment abandoned it. Interestingly the group that abandoned the treatment before the third week of FLX treatment may have had lower circadian cortisol levels and cortisol levels after DST (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057). Nevertheless this group included only 20 patients and the significance is borderline. There might be several reasons to abandon a treatment, including different personalities or mood conditions that may correlate with compliance. Unfortunately, since this group of patients did not return to the clinical evaluation it is not possible to find the actual reasons. One possible explanation could be a very rapid effect of the antidepressant treatment and the feeling of the patients that they do not need any further treatment or medical supervision. This option could be related to lower or no HPA dysregulation, expressed as lower cortisol levels. On the contrary, the abandonment could be related to no response, persistence of depressive symptoms and disappointment with the treatment, adverse effects of FLX or to the placebo, etc. None of these possibilities are likely related to lower cortisol levels. More studies must be performed to confirm this data and to explore the factors affecting adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data confirm the relevance of cortisol levels in the response of depressed patients either to placebo or FLX treatment; however the genetic data only supports the association of rs242939 polymorphism of CRHR1 with the response but does not support association with other polymorphisms reported in the literature. These results suggest that there may be other factors involved in antidepressant response, such as polymorphisms with very low effect probably interacting with other factors.</p><p>Further insights into the mechanisms of response to placebo and to medications are needed. Identification of biomarkers, genetic or otherwise, that can help to predict antidepressant response would be of great clinical relevance.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12888_2014_220_MOESM1_ESM.ods" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
