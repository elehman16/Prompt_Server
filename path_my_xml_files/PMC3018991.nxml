Personalized medical care has been consistently proven in literature as contributing to the maintenance of psychological balance and quality of life in patients suffering from chronic conditions. However, limited research has investigated the role of personalized approach in improving these parameters in patients with advanced incurable diseases. The scope of this paper was to investigate the possible impact of personalized care condition in advanced colon cancer patients, requiring palliative care. 60 patients (32 M, 28 F) (mean age 64,6) suffering from this disease were randomly assigned to a standard or to a personalized care condition. The latest implied (a) frequent (at least 2 monthly) meetings with the doctor, (b) possibility to be involved in treatment decisions, (c) more information given about diagnosis and prognosis and (d) psychological support provided to the patient and his/her family members, to deal better with daily problems and needs. The design of the study was prospective and consisted of two successive evaluations of quality of life (SF&#x02013;36 questionnaire) and anxiety and depression (HAD test). Cancer patients pertaining to the personalized treatment approach had both superior quality of life scores (p &#x0003c; 0,05) and lower anxiety (p &#x0003c; 0,01) and depression (p &#x0003c; 0,05) than the control group. A more detailed analysis showed significant differences of vitality and social functioning for subjects pertaining to the study group (p &#x0003c; 0,05), as well as a lower ratio between  latent and manifest anxiety (p &#x0003c; 0,01). These results argue in favor of the benefits of a personalized treatment approach for patients with advanced incurable diseases.

Typically, a combination of palliative therapeutic resources (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and conservative surgery) is used in this case, but all these techniques are likely to affect the quality of life of patients, via significant side effects and / or emerging lifestyle restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In this context, the quality of the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship can become a key factor for prognosis: it can moderate or, reversely, contribute to further depreciation of patients' quality of life, and, in turn, it can influence in both ways the adherence to the treatment.</p><p>Studies done so far with this respect in oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] showed that involving the patient in medical decisions (within a so&#x02013;called &#x02018;personalized therapeutic plan&#x02019;) is a potent vector that can maintain or even enhance one's quality of life. </p><p>Primary argument in favor of this position is that cancer patients have an immediate perspective of their own suffering and death; therefore, they should not only have the right to know the diagnosis, but also to be part of all critical treatment decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]</p><p>Inversely, other authors claim that especially in situations where life expectancy is uncertain and efficacy of therapeutic measures is doubtful, the physician should be the only one to take the primary decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The proponents of this view argue that information delivery, deliberation and decision taking are classically assumed only by the doctors and offering opportunities of decisions to patients would just contribute to their confusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p>So far, advocates of the first position seem to be backed-up by more data, at least in the case of colonic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. However, the implementation in practice of personalized therapeutic plans is still rather rare; therefore, studies done so far on this topic are also rare and far from conclusive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Objectives" id="sec1-2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a personalized therapeutic plan on the quality of life and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression) for patients suffering from advanced colonic cancer and requiring palliative care. </p><p>Our hypotheses consisted in arguing in favor of:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>a positive effect of this plan on the quality of life of the patient (despite the multitude of physical symptoms brought by the disease);</p></list-item><list-item><p>a lower vulnerability to psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression) in patients attending a personalized therapeutic plan.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study's number of participants was 60 patients (32 males and 28 females) (mean age = 64,6; SD = 3,2) with advanced colonic cancer in the post&#x02013;colectomy phase and who had a stable relationship with their oncologist in the previous two months before testing.</p><p>Control group (n = 30) (15 males and 15 females) (mean age = 62,7; SD = 3,1) was represented by patients carrying a chronic non&#x02013;malignant, well tolerated condition (arterial systemic hypertension or diabetes mellitus). </p><p>Three doctors were involved in the study (two for the study group and one for the control group), with no differences between them regarding the age, location and expertise. </p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria </title><p>We included in the study only patients with advanced colonic cancer (stage 3 B), in the post&#x02013;surgical phase (after colectomy with colostomy), who had a stable relationship with their doctor for the last two months, were not treated by other doctors or health professionals, and consented to be subjects of this study for a 8&#x02013;week continuous period.

SF&#x02013;36 Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]
It is the most widely used instrument for the measurement of the quality of life (QOL). It is translated into numerous languages and the validity of the 8 subscales is confirmed in general populations and in a wide variety of patient groups in more than 2000 articles. It comprises 36 questions and 8 scales, dedicated to self&#x02013;perceived functional health, general well&#x02013;being, and to various components of physical and mental health (such as pain perception or vitality). Scores are reported on a scale from 0&#x02013;100 (mean = 50, SD = 10), and are proportional to QoL. 
</p></list-item><list-item><p>
HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]It is a simple 14&#x02013;items test, to evaluate anxiety and depression in hospital settings. Each item is answered by the patient on a four point (0&#x02013;3) response category, with scores of 11 or higher &#x02013; for either subscale &#x02013; indicating probable presence of a mood disorder and a score of 8 to 10 being just suggestive of the presence of the respective state.
</p></list-item><list-item><p>
An original questionnaire (8 questions) (appendix 1) Was designed to evaluate the degree of personalization of the relationship, as it is perceived by the patient. Answers were coded numerically (1...4 or 1...5), with scores proportional to the degree of personalization of the approach. The range of answers was 8 to 39; scores above 26 (upper 1/3) were considered relevant for a personalized approach.
