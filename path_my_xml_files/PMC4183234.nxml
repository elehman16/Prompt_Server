of 33 puerperae with post-episiotomy pain. TENS was applied for 30 minutes
to groups: HFT(100 Hz; 100 &#x000b5;s), LFT (5 Hz; 100 &#x000b5;s), and
placebo (PT). Four electrodes were placed in parallel near the episiotomy
and four pain evaluations were performed with the numeric rating scale. The
first and the second evaluation took place before TENS application and
immediately after its removal and were done in the resting position and in
the activities of sitting and ambulating. The third and fourth evaluation
took place 30 and 60 minutes after TENS removal, only in the resting
position. Intragroup differences were verified using the Friedman and

handled, safe and low-cost resource that sends electrical impulses through the
skin<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It has typically biphasic waves containing
positive and negative phases, which may be either symmetric or asymmetric<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, with the main purpose of relieving
pain<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Although its mechanism of electroanalgesia
production is still controversial, its effectiveness would be explained by the gate
control theory of pain and by the activation of a system of endogenous
opioids<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>Perineal pain is manifested in the postpartum period mostly due to tissue lesions
that may occur spontaneously (lacerations) or due to the surgical incision
(episiotomy)<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Episiotomy
is a lesion resulting from a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or scalpel
to help deliver the baby and avoid severe tears that can be difficult to repair.
Nevertheless, there is evidence to recommend restricted rather than routine use of
episiotomy because the restrictive policy appears to have more benefits<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Women submitted to episiotomy have
a greater prevalence of pain complaints<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and have
difficulty performing functional activities<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, despite
the recommendations for restrictive use of episiotomy, there is still a high
prevalence of this procedure in Brazilian maternities, with rates of up to
60.7%<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, a statistic that
supports the development of studies that analyze the techniques that reduce the
morbidity caused by this practice.</p><p>In the literature, it is possible to verify the use of several pharmacologic and
non-pharmacologic resources aimed at reducing pain from perineal trauma<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The most common resources in obstetric practice include
non-hormonal anti-inflammatory drugs applied directly to the perineal trauma
site<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, oral<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and rectal<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> analgesics, and non-pharmacologic
resources, such as cryoanalgesia<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Despite the existence of clinical investigations regarding these therapeutic
practices in perineal pain<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>,
there is still a lack of methodological quality and several gaps in the studies
regarding their effectiveness. Therefore, new trials are necessary so that decisions
can be made regarding the real effectiveness of these modalities. Evaluating the
effect of high and low-frequency TENS in post-episiotomy pain relief of puerperae is
a great advance for studies in this area and it is justified by the need to broaden
the usable resources and behaviors in puerperal care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial with placebo carried
out with puerperae submitted to post-episiotomy vaginal delivery at a public
hospital in Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil. Data were collected between August 2009
and July 2010.</p><p>The puerperae were included according to the following criteria: (1) low-risk
pregnancy; (2) age above 15 years; (3) ability to read, write, and speak in
Portuguese; (4) awareness of time and space; (5) between six and 24 hours
post-vaginal delivery; (6) midline or mediolateral episiotomy with stitches; (7)
post-episiotomy pain; (8) absence of any genitourinary pathology.</p><p>The participants who were excluded presented: (1) obesity (Body Mass Index
[BMI] &#x02265; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); (2) puerperal complications; (3)
instrumental delivery (use of forceps); (4) perineal lacerations, (5) epidural
anesthesia; (6) use of analgesic resources during data collection.</p><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade de
Pernambuco (CEP/UPE), Petrolina, PE, Brazil, under protocol number 145/09. All
participants and legal guardians, in case of participants under 18 years of age,
voluntarily signed an informed consent form.</p><p>A pilot test with 12 patients was carried out to verify the comprehension and
effectiveness of the data collection instruments and to calculate sample size.
Reduction in the pain scores post-intervention was applied as a parameter,
considering clinically relevant a reduction of 1.39 points in the numeric rating
scale (NRS)<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Sample size was estimated through simple sample
equation, with power of 80% and standard deviation of 1.0, which required a sample
size of nine volunteers in each group.</p><p>The participants were randomized into groups according to a spreadsheet generated in
a computer program by a researcher who was not involved in the selection of
participants. Randomization occurred in the order in which each patient was enrolled
in the study. It was established that the puerperae should be within six to 24 hours
post-vaginal delivery. The minimum limit of six hours post-delivery was determined
because this is the period recommended for women to leave their bed, whereas the 24
hours is related to the acute phase of the lesion and the peak of the inflammatory
process<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In the case of
medication use and based on the drug dose, the waiting time was counted from the
time when the last dose of analgesic/anesthesia was administered, considering the
possible interferences that could cause biases in the initial pain assessment.</p><p>The main researcher trained two examiners, one responsible for the pain assessments
and for filling out evaluation forms and the other responsible for applying TENS.
The device KINESIS New Microcontrolled (KW Eletr&#x000f4;nica Ltda., Amparo, SP,
Brazil) was used with two pairs of silicone-carbon electrodes (5.5cm &#x000d7; 3cm),
hypoallergenic conductive gel, and hypoallergenic microporous surgical tapes (25 mm
&#x000d7; 10 m). The device was calibrated before data collection.</p><p>TENS was applied to the three study groups: high-frequency TENS (HFT), low-frequency
TENS (LFT), and placebo TENS (PT). The electrodes were placed in parallel, near the
episiotomy, in the region of the pudendal and genitofemoral nerves, both responsible
for the perineal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the positioning of the electrodes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbfis-18-01-0072-g01"/></fig><p>The HFT group received frequency of 100 Hz and 100 &#x000b5;s pulse, and the LFT group
received frequency of 5 Hz and 100 &#x000b5;s pulse for 30 minutes. The electrical
impulse intensity was controlled by the participants and adjusted when necessary.
They were instructed that the sensation of strong and tolerable pulses should
remain, although it should be sensorially comfortable. At the end of the
application, the researcher recorded the intensity employed by each participant.</p><p>The participants of the PT group had their electrodes placed similarly to the HFT and
LFT groups, and although the device remained on for 30 minutes with the light on to
simulate it was working, it did not send any electrical stimulation. At the end of
the study, due to ethical reasons, the participants in the PT group were offered HFT
to treat the pain. HFT was chosen because it has already been used in a previous
study<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> with effective
results.</p><p>Data collection forms were filled out with the profile of the puerperae, obstetric
procedures and history, labor and newborn data. Afterwards, four pain assessments
were performed. The initial evaluation took place prior to the use of TENS. The
participants were questioned regarding the pain from episiotomy and those that
mentioned the presence of pain answered the NRS (in the resting position) regarding
the movements of sitting and ambulating. At the end of this stage, TENS was applied
to the three groups.</p><p>The second evaluation began immediately after the removal of TENS. The NRS was
applied once again (in the resting position) regarding the sitting and ambulating
movements. A questionnaire was applied to the three groups regarding the TENS, with
the following questions: (1) is TENS comfortable or uncomfortable?; (2) would you
use it again?; (3) were you dissatisfied, slightly satisfied, satisfied or very
satisfied?</p><p>The third evaluation was performed 30 minutes after removing TENS, and the fourth
evaluation was performed 60 minutes after removing TENS. These evaluations measured
pain through the NRS only in the resting position.</p><p>Data were analyzed in the program SPSS version 16.0. The Kruskal-Wallis test and
Dunn's post-test were used for the following continuous variables: age, number of
pregnancies, deliveries, abortions, number of prenatal appointments, gestational
age, weight, height, and newborn's Apgar score. The chi-square test was used for the
analysis of the categorical variables: marital status, ethnicity, education,
occupation, prenatal care, pudendal block, episiotomy, gender, use of pain relief
resources, type of pain relief resource. Intragroup differences in the pain
assessments were verified through Friedman's test for the resting position, and
Wilcoxon's test for the sitting and ambulating activities. In the intergroup
analyses, Kruskal-Wallis's test was employed. The level of significance adopted was
p&#x02264;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Out of the 50 patients evaluated for eligibility in this study, 16 were excluded
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and one was excluded from
randomization, totaling 33 evaluated puerperae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The three groups were homogenous as to sociodemographic
variables: age (P=0.10), marital status (P=0.41), ethnicity (P=0.37), education
(P=0.10) and occupation (P=0.20); obstetric and labor variables: prenatal care
(P=1.00), number of appointments attended (P=0.47), number of pregnancies (P=0.51),
deliveries (P=0.62), miscarriages (P=0.89), gestational age (P=0.56), type of

height (P=0.20) and Apgar score in the first minute (P=0.21) and the fifth minute
(P=0.08). Among the pain relief resources used by the participants,
non-pharmacological therapeutic methods were not observed, but oral dipyrone was
taken by 65.6% (n=21) of the participants (P=0.64).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the included patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbfis-18-01-0072-g02"/></fig><p>The initial mean of pain intensity was similar in the three groups. In the intragroup
analysis, there was no significant difference in the PT group regarding pain
intensity in the resting position and in the activities of sitting and ambulating in
any evaluation (P&#x0003e;0.05). In the HFT and LFT groups, in the resting position, a
significant difference was observed between the first and all following evaluations,
and between the second and the third and fourth evaluations (P&#x0003c;0.001). There was
also a significant difference in the sitting and ambulating activities
(P&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In the results of the intergroup analysis, there was a significant difference in the
resting position in the comparison among the groups in the second (P&#x0003c;0.046),
third (P&#x0003c;0.001), and fourth (P&#x0003c;0.001) evaluations, evidencing the reduction in
pain scores in the HFT and LFT groups. In the sitting activity, a significant
difference was verified in the second evaluation, indicating reduction in the pain
scores of the HFT and LFT groups when compared to the PT group (P&#x0003c;0.008). No
significant difference was verified among the three groups while ambulating
(P&#x0003c;0.20; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). The amplitude in the

(n=1) were very satisfied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These findings suggest that both HFT and LFT cause clinically relevant reduction in
pain intensity immediately after its application, with a residual effect lasting for
one hour after use. TENS in the HFT and LFT groups reduced the intensity of initial
pain scores, measured as moderate in both groups, and later as weak.</p><p>In the four evaluations performed in the resting position, in the HFT group, there
was pain reduction measured by the NRS (4.54/10; to 1.72/10; to 0.81/10; to
0.27/10), and this pattern was also observed in the LFT group (4.50/10; to 2.25/10;
to 1.66/10; to 1.16/10). In the sitting activity, the pain intensity scores
decreased from the first to the second evaluation in the HFT group (6.81/10 to
3.18/10) and in the LFT group (6.08/10 to 3.75/10).</p><p>Similar data were observed in the ambulating activity, evidencing the reduction in
pain scores in both groups, HFT (6.18/10 to 3.36/10) and LFT (5.66/10 to 3.83/10).
No significant difference was verified in the pain score of the PT group in any
evaluation.</p><p>Therefore, it is clear that both HFT and LFT reduced the levels of pain in the
resting position. In both groups that employed TENS, there was a clinically relevant
difference in the intragroup analysis in all situations evaluated, i.e. TENS reduced
pain in the puerperae by more than 1.39 units in the NRS, which is considered a
relevant value for moderate pain intensity<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p><p>In all evaluations the reduction in pain scores was higher than 1.8 units in the NRS,
which is considered a significant value for severe pain. In the HFT group, all
scores were higher than 2.4, indicating great improvement in the pain
treatment<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the intergroup analysis, there was a significant difference in the pain scores in
the resting position between the HFT and LFT groups<italic> versus</italic> the PT
group in the second, third, and fourth evaluation. There was also a significant
difference in the second evaluation in the sitting activity, however, there was no
difference among the three groups in the ambulating activity.</p><p>Similarly to this study, other authors observed a reduction in the post-operative
pain score after the application of TENS through the NRS<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism
of action of TENS in different conditions of pain is still uncertain<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>Studies suggest that the analgesic effect obtained by LFT and HFT may be produced by
the interference of the therapeutics in the blocking of the transmission of the
nociceptive input at the level of the spinal cord through the activation of
&#x003b4;-opioids and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, subsequently reducing input through the
spinothalamic tract<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. LFT would induce the antihyperalgesia mediated by the
release of serotonin and &#x003b4;-opioid receptors in the spinal cord dorsal horn, whereas
HFT would release &#x003b4;-opioid receptors<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to make the right adjustment to the position of the
electrodes and the intensity of the electric stimulation to ensure ideal pain
relief. Normally, there may be differences in the intensity of the stimulation
between HFT and LFT. HFT is applied at the level of sensorial stimulation and LFT at
the motor level<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In HFT, the stimulation must be increased until
the point that the patient feels a comfortable tingling sensation, being increased
until the maximum level tolerated by the patient without being harmful, whereas in
LFT, the patient will report the sensation of "tapping", but with no muscle
contraction<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the electrodes were placed in parallel near the episiotomy
site, thus, the current generated paresthesia in the entire perineal area, relieving
the pain. In general, HFT is applied at low intensities and LFT at high
intensities<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, and some
authors suggest that the amplitude of the current must be over 15 mA<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Agreeing with the literature, in
this study the puerperae of the LFT group was submitted to higher intensities than
those of the HFT group and, the amplitude of the stimulation in the groups varied
between 19-30 mA.</p><p>Except for some reports of uncomfortable stimulation, TENS has no acute side effects.
In the long term, an adverse effect that may be observed in some patients is skin
irritation<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. However, no
side effect was verified in this study, and the authors believe this fact may be
explained by the short time of application (30 minutes). Similar results were found
by other studies also with no side effects resulting from the use of TENS<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p><p>Several authors state that TENS is more effective when applied at lower intensities
of pain than in severe pain<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and
its application is indicated when the pain intensity varies from weak to
moderate<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, a situation
analyzed in this study. Despite the fact that the results have showed the
effectiveness of TENS, it is important to highlight that the evaluation of its
effect lasted one hour after its application, and the authors suggest that future
studies verify the residual effect of TENS for longer periods.</p><p>Regarding the effect of TENS during movement and in functional activities, authors
confirm the improvement of pain scores in ambulation<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>,
respiratory function, and movement<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In the intragroup analysis of this study, pain decreased
significantly in all activities, i.e. resting, sitting, and ambulating. However,
when comparing HFT and LFT groups to the PT group, there was no difference observed
in the ambulating activity, which may have resulted from the influence of other
variables of the pain complaint.</p><p>Regarding patient satisfaction, in the HFT and LFT groups, 100% of the puerperae
reported that they found TENS comfortable and they would use it again, and in the PT
group most of the patients confirmed these findings as well. Hence, it is possible
to observe that even though there was a confirmed reduction in pain scores only in
the groups that used active TENS and a higher percentage of puerperae claimed to be
satisfied with the treatment in these groups, good satisfaction levels were also
observed in the PT group, a fact that was also verified in other studies<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to know the influence of the placebo effect on the
satisfaction of these patients, since the referred satisfaction could be associated
with the attention offered by the professionals to these women during collection.
However, it is possible to guarantee that in this study an appropriate methodology
was used with placebo and the blinding of the patients.</p><p>Some limitations may be found in this study. Due to the routine of the service,
ethical aspects and practical reasons of the collection, it was not possible to
verify the use of drugs by the puerperae after the application of TENS. Other
limitations are related to the sample size and the duration of follow-up in the
effect of TENS (one hour after its application), thus the authors suggest the
development of future studies with larger samples aimed at verifying the benefits of
this treatment for longer periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>HFT and LFT are safe and effective resources without side effects and presenting good
