The patients will be randomised to either a conventional group or an integrative group with a 1:1 allocation according to computer-generated random numbers concealed in opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes. Watchful waiting or oral medication including &#x003b1; blocker, 5&#x003b1;-reductase inhibitors or antimuscarinic drugs will be offered as conventional treatment. Integrative treatment will include moxibustion therapy in addition to the conventional treatment. The moxibustion therapy will be conducted twice a week for 4&#x02005;weeks on the bilateral acupoints SP6, LR3 and CV4 by a qualified Korean medical doctor. The primary outcome will be the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) after eight sessions. The secondary outcomes will be the post-void residual urine volume, the maximum urinary flow rate, IPSS, the results of a Short-Form 36-Question Health Survey after 12&#x02005;weeks, and the patients&#x02019; global impression of changes at each visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and these methods have proved effective in improving LUTSs, urinary flow rate and post-void residual urine in many previous studies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></p><p>However, this conventional treatment is limited by certain side effects. For &#x003b1; blockers, rhinitis (6.6%), dizziness (4.4%) and abnormal ejaculation (2.8%)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> caused by tamsulosin have been observed. Moreover, abnormal ejaculation (14.2&#x02013;28.1%) caused by silodosin,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cardiovascular adverse events (5.7% hypertension, 3.9% non-hypertension)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and mild dizziness (13.9%)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> caused by alfuzosin, severe dizziness leading to drug suspension (2.0%) caused by terazosin,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and dizziness (4.41%), postural hypotension (4.03%) and asthenia (4.08%)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> caused by doxazosin have been verified. In addition, erectile dysfunction (4.53%), decreased libido (2.36%) and abnormal ejaculation (1.78%)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> caused by finasteride have been identified, and dry mouth (24%), dyspepsia (5%), back pain (5%) and micturition disorder (5%)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> caused by tolterodine have been shown to occur. In particular, when two or more types of these medications are combined, each side effect is expected; thus, careful use only for patients with moderate to severe BPH is recommended.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>To overcome this limitation, many studies investigating complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatment have been conducted, but the 2011 American Urological Association's (AUA's) guidelines reported that no definite evidence exists to recommend CAM treatment because of the lack of quality and quantity of CAM studies of BPH.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In contrast, clinical studies of acupuncture or herbal medication for BPH with LUTSs have been consistently performed<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> and have demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods. Moxibustion has been shown to be effective in treating urinary disorders,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> but well-designed clinical trials to prove its effectiveness are lacking. Therefore, we designed a pilot trial to explore the feasibility of moxibustion as an adjuvant for BPH with LUTSs based on its effectiveness and safety and to estimate the appropriate sample size for a future, large comparative effectiveness study, with the purpose of developing an optimal integrative treatment acceptable to both medical doctors (MDs) and Korean medical doctors (KMDs) in the present medical system. The design of this clinical trial is based on a literature survey and a conference of experts including KMDs, urological doctors (UDs), and an Eastern&#x02013;Western integrative medicine specialist who has both MD and KMD licenses. This pilot study is a randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group, 1:1 allocation, exploratory and pragmatic design.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aims</title><p>The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility of moxibustion as an adjuvant for conventional treatment in patients with BPH and to determine the correct sample size for verifying, in future studies, the effectiveness and safety of the integrative treatment compared with conventional treatment for patients with BPH accompanying LUTSs. This is a single-centre, assessor- and analyser-blinded, parallel-group, 1:1 allocation, pragmatic randomised controlled study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Notices were posted in front of the Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital (PNUYH) urological office and the Pusan National University Korean Medicine Hospital (PNUKH) genitourinary clinic office, and an advertisement for the study was also placed on the internet homepage of PNUKH. A UD will confirm the diagnosis of BPH and the impracticality of surgical treatment for patients who volunteer to participate. A KMD will thoroughly examine all inclusion/exclusion criteria and explain the trial to eligible patients. When the patient decides to participate in the study, the KMD will obtain written informed consent, and a baseline assessment will be performed. The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase and follow-up. A more detailed description of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008338F1">figure 1</xref>.

The UD will discuss behavioural modifications, such as water intake, with the patient. Watchful waiting will be used for patients without renal insufficiency, urinary retention, recurring infection or complications of bladder outlet obstruction. Oral medications will be prescribed when no therapeutic effect is observed after watchful waiting, and the medications will be selected taking into consideration overactive bladder, prostate size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Preferentially, an &#x003b1; blocker, such as alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin, will be used for functional symptom mitigation. 5&#x003b1;-Reductase inhibitors, such as dutasteride and finasteride, will be used when the prostatic volume is &#x0003e;40&#x02005;mL or PSA &#x0003e;1.4&#x02005;ng/mL. In cases of a high risk of BPH progression, prostate &#x02265;30&#x02005;mg or PSA &#x02265;1.5&#x02005;ng/mL, a combination of an &#x003b1; blocker and a 5&#x003b1;-reductase inhibitor will be used. Anticholinergic agents, such as tolterodine, will be prescribed for patients with overactive bladder but will need to be monitored for patients with &#x02265;250&#x02005;mL post-void residual urine. The conventional treatment components can be changed at the discretion of the UD because this research is a pragmatic study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of additional moxibustion therapy, and the conventional treatment will be maintained for the last follow-up.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

This system has had some negative aspects, such as the incautious use of medicine combinations and distrust between the two medical fields; however, it has had some positive aspects as well, including providing patients with a large variety of treatment choices.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Therefore, the need for integrative medicine has been propounded steadily to establish a new medical system combining the advantages of Western and Korean medicine.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>This study was designed as an investigation of add-on treatment without a placebo control because additional alternative treatments in conjunction with the conventional treatment are considered appropriate in light of the medical ethics and medical treatment system.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Despite relatively acceptable rates of adverse events, increased side effects caused by the combination of different types of oral drug<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and by patient vulnerability factors, such as ageing and underlying disease, must still be investigated. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant treatments should be evaluated, after which the adjuvant treatment may be considered for intractable urinary disorders including interstitial cystitis and chronic prostatitis. In addition, a pragmatic design is used to improve applicability to the clinical field and decision-making.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Thus, we set broad inclusion/exclusion criteria and flexible interventions allowing for different treatment regimens according to each patient's medical condition. In addition, considering the pragmatic purpose and the study ethics, conventional oral medication is not restricted to one type. Moxibustion therapy has the limitation of inconvenience because patients must visit the hospital for every treatment, whereas conventional oral medication can be provided once for a relatively long period; thus, after discussion, the experts decided to perform treatment for a relatively short period of time and to follow-up after 12&#x02005;weeks, as in conventional treatment.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>This study has some limitations. The 12-week follow-up was set according to the routine check period of conventional treatment, but this was not sufficient to evaluate the long-term effects. Furthermore, development of changes cannot be investigated because frequent and regular IPSS checks were not planned in this trial. Therefore, future trials should include more frequent and regular outcome assessments in both groups and a longer follow-up period of at least 1&#x02005;year in order to investigate development of changes in each group and persisting effects, so that the treatment sessions, period and interval can be appropriately modified for the final integrative treatment guideline. Another limitation is that prostate size is not included as an outcome measure because the feasibility of the treatment is the main focus rather than definitive assessment of its effectiveness. Therefore, studies evaluating the effect of the combined treatment on prostate size should be conducted after the LUTS-reducing effect is demonstrated. Future power analysis studies should be performed by determining the effect size based on the results of this study, and cost-effectiveness studies should be performed to provide important information for decision-makers.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is currently in the recruiting phase.
