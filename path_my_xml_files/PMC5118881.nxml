The current study aimed to investigate the benefits of a TM system in managing AE in advanced-stage COPD patients to improve their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator whenever variations in respiratory parameters fell beyond the individual&#x02019;s normal range. The study&#x02019;s primary endpoint was HRQL, measured by the Italian version of the two Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its secondary endpoints were: scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the number and duration of hospitalizations; the number of readmissions; the number of appointments with a pulmonary specialist; the number of visits to the emergency department; and the number of deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three hundred thirty-four patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups for a 1&#x000a0;year period. At its conclusion, changes in the SF36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5754, respectively]. Variations in HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 (3.6); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not significantly different in the two groups [IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.89 (95% CI 0.79&#x02013;1,04); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16 and IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91 (95% CI 0,75 &#x02013; 1.04); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16, respectively]. The readmission rate for AECOPD and/or any cause was, however, significantly lower in the TM group with respect to the control one [IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43 (95% CI 0.19&#x02013;0.98); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24&#x02013;0.89); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, respectively].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Study results showed that in areas where medical services are well established, TM does not significantly improve HRQL in patients with COPD who develop AE. Although not effective in reducing hospitalizations, TM can nevertheless facilitate continuity of care during hospital-to-home transition by reducing the need for early readmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Retrospectively registered on January 2012, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&#x00026;rank=3">NCT01513980</ext-link>. </p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Telemonitoring</kwd><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Health-related quality of life</kwd><kwd>Hospitalization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>250487</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>A common, preventable disease characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability in high, middle, and low income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite international standardized guidelines, improved pharmacotherapy, integrated care, and pulmonary rehabilitation, patients with COPD typically worsen over time and experience episodes of acute exacerbation (AE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] which are crucially important in patient management in view of their negative effect on Quality of Life (QoL) and prognosis and the fact that they often lead to hospitalization. Exacerbations of COPD are estimated to result in approximately 110,000 deaths and more than 500,000 hospitalizations per year and have been calculated to account for approximately 70% of COPD-related direct medical costs, with over 18 billion spent in direct costs worldwide annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Telemonitoring (TM) (or remote monitoring) involves the use of telecommunication technology to transmit data regarding patients&#x02019; vital signs, symptoms, and medications to an operator at a monitoring station who will, in turn, transmit them to a specialist who can recommend treatment variations or new interventions to avoid deterioration in a patient&#x02019;s medical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although a number of studies have suggested that TM in patients with chronic diseases can be safe, reliable, and cost effective, systematic reviews have reported inconclusive results regarding its impact on the management of COPD patients, and evidence is still insufficient to draw firm conclusions about its clinical and/or cost effectiveness as far as AE is concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a major public health problem in the geographic area serviced by our hospital, located in the Veneto region (Italy), and led to approximately 6400 hospitalization in 2009 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ser-veneto.it/">http://www.ser-veneto.it/</ext-link>). In view of conflicting results on TM utility in COPD patients, the current study set out to clarify the utility of TM in detecting early signs of AE episodes in advanced-stage COPD patients to permit specialists to take timely, appropriate measures to improve patients&#x02019; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce the utilization of healthcare services. In this trial, TM was integrated into existing clinical services, and monitoring was provided by teams of pulmonary specialists who already knew the patients who were recruited. Both the intervention and control groups had access to the same conventional clinical care: the only difference was that patients in the study group also had TM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, unblinded, parallel-group, two arm, 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was carried out in the Veneto region (Italy); participants were recruited between 1<sup>st</sup> November 2011 and 31<sup>st</sup> July 2012.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial intervention: telemonitoring</title><p>Patients in the intervention group were provided a TM system consisting of a finger pulse-oxymeter (Wrist Clinic <sup>TM</sup> &#x02013; Medical Concierge, Medic 4 all Italia, Italy) and a gateway device for data transmission over a telephone line to a central data management unit located at the Veneto Regional e-Health Centre. It was possible for a patient/proxy to communicate with the trained operators manning the unit from 08:00&#x02013;18:00 Monday through Friday. At enrollment, the clinical team responsible for that particular patient explained how to use the TM kit and provided self-management education materials. Additional training was provided by the technician who installed the TM kit at the patient&#x02019;s home.</p><p>Using the TM equipment, patients transmitted their monitored Heart Rate (HR) and Oxygen Saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) values to the operator every other day and/or in the event of subjective clinical worsening. A &#x02018;spot check&#x02019; or single measurement of SpO<sub>2</sub> was also performed once a day, usually in the morning. The operators daily (Monday&#x02013;Friday) reviewed the online data of each patient and if the HR and/or SpO<sub>2</sub> values that were transmitted were outside of the patient&#x02019;s &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; range, they contacted the patient and asked for a second measurement. If the second measurement was also outside of the patient&#x02019;s normal range, the operator alerted the clinical staff. Values considered out-of-range were customized for every patient depending on his/her individual clinical situation. For patients recruited at discharge from hospital, alarm limits were set on the basis of baseline values obtained from pulmonary function testing carried out before the hospitalization during routine visit with a pulmonary specialist. All patients&#x02019; registered data were available to the reference pulmonary specialist on a web-based platform. Once alerted, the specialist him/herself called the patient by telephone to verify if symptoms had stabilized or worsened or if new symptoms had arisen. In the latter event, the patient&#x02019;s adherence to therapy was checked and, if unsatisfactory, interventions promoting adherence were prescribed. If adherence to treatment proved satisfactory, the diagnosis of AECOPD was confirmed and, the specialist undertook one of the following actions: 1. Modified the patient&#x02019;s usual medication by telephone. 2. Sent a district nurse (a nurse employed by the National Health Service specialized in making home visits) for a home visit who made a report on the situation. The nurse assessed the subject&#x02019;s clinical status and adherence to treatment and decided if the patient required an examination by a pulmonary specialist. 3. Set up an office appointment with a pulmonary specialist. 4. Decided that the patient should be taken to the Emergency Department (ED). According to our protocol, the time between when the measurement was outside of the patient&#x02019;s normal range and the specialist&#x02019;s recommendation was registered and between when the recommendation was registered and the district nurse or pulmonary specialist actually examined the patient was within 30&#x000a0;min and 48&#x000a0;h, respectively. The specialist made his/her decision on the best course of action depending on the data registered by the TM system, the patients&#x02019; symptoms, and his/her clinical judgment.

If there were any variations in the clinical status of patients in the control group, he/she directly called/went to see the GP who decided if the patient required an urgent appointment with a pulmonary specialist or a visit to the ED; the former was arranged by the GP. The only difference between the intervention and control groups was that the former also had the TM service.

Data analysis was performed on a &#x0201c;per protocol&#x0201d; approach. All the participants who were randomised to the treatment group and began the study were monitored and included in the analysis regardless of their compliance to treatment. Data available concerning deceased patients were included in the analysis. Standard descriptive statistics, including means with standard deviations and/or numbers with associated percentages, were used to analyze the patients&#x02019; demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or chi-squared test were used to compare continuous or categorical variables, as appropriate. Non-normally distributed variables were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for data normality. The Central Limit Theorem&#x02019;s normal approximation was assumed when the SF36 data were assessed since it is a standardized approach used to analyze large patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. SF36 scores are expressed as means and standard deviations with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between two means. Results with regard to hospitalizations, readmissions and visits to the ED are expressed as Incidence Rate per year (IR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and a 95% CI. IR was calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of days of the study and multiplying the result by 365. Groups were compared using the Poisson test. Deaths are expressed as numbers, percentages, Risk Ratio (RR) and the related 95% CI. Two-tailed <italic>p</italic> values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant for all analyses.

Although TM could theoretically improve HRQL by facilitating early recognition and prompt response to AECOPD, conclusions from previous studies proved controversial. Our results were consistent with those reported by a number of trials suggesting that TM has little effect on HRQL. Nine published studies on home telehealth for COPD evaluated in a systematic review by Polisena et al., in fact, concluded that TM does not improve HRQL when it is compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A number of reasons have been advanced to explain the lack of improvement in HRQL and in psychological well-being in TM-monitored patients; these include the burden of self-monitoring, concerns raised by intrusive surveillance, a perceived lack of user-friendliness, and a reduction in the frequency of traditional face-to-face visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Other studies have, instead, reported that the use of TM can greatly improve HRQL in COPD patients. Bourbeau et al.&#x02019;s study focusing on a program that included telephone consultations with the treating physician demonstrated a significant improvement in the activity and impact subscales and total scores of St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Likewise, in a RCT conducted by Koff et al. who focused on a TM system similar to ours but including a web-based platform for the transmission of patient&#x02019;s data and telephone calls by the care coordinator in the event of clinical changes, the TM group showed a significant improvement in the SGRQ score when it was compared with that of the usual care group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Controversial results can at least in part be explained by the considerable heterogeneity in the studies with regard to methodological aspects, such as primary outcome measures, number of participants, disease severity in the study population, and the instruments to measure health status. It is also true that the data obtained in our study based on the summary composite scores of the generic SF36 (physical and mental) are not fully comparable to those utilized by previous trials based on the disease-specific SGRQ. While SGRQ seems to be more sensitive in detecting differences/changes in HRQL linked to the clinical severity of COPD, the SF36 appears to capture additional information that is not exclusively related to the baseline disease, supporting the opinion that the two indexes should be considered complementary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In line with lack of evidence of improved HRQL, TM did not seem to have a positive impact on patients&#x02019; emotional distress, in particular on the severity of depression and/or anxiety: indeed, although the aetiology of mood disturbances in COPD patients is multifactoral, HRQL has been considered a stronger determinant with respect to other clinical and/or physiological risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Our healthcare related secondary outcomes did not show that TM had any real effect in preventing AECOPD or other cause-related hospitalisations. A Cochrane systematic review of telehealthcare for COPD including only high-quality evidence from RCTs found, instead, a significant reduction in the number of patients requiring hospital admissions and ED attendances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Most of the programs evaluated had, however, introduced an enhanced clinical service to support the technological arm of the trial that included case management by a nurse as well as other interventions making it difficult to isolate the effect of the TM component. Indeed, our results are consistent with those of a recent RCT by Pinnock et al. who investigated the impact of a TM service that was integrated into existing clinical services for COPD patients. The investigators concluded that it was ineffective in postponing admissions and in improving patients&#x02019; QoL and advanced the hypothesis that the positive effect of TM demonstrated in previous studies could have been due to the enhancement of the underpinning clinical service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Some hypotheses explaining why TM did not reduce hospitalization in our study population can be advanced. First, the number of hospital admissions was very low even in the control group [IR: 1,20 (95% CI 0,99&#x02013;1,45)] and this is not surprising given the health authorities&#x02019; efforts to potentiate an integrated care model for chronic COPD patients aiming to provide enhanced long-term home services to reduce need for hospitalization. In this context, there is not much leeway for further reduction in hospitalization as a result of a TM intervention. Second, although variations in HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> that were used as markers of an unstable clinical condition are regarded as reliable predictors of AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], it is reasonable to assume that these physiological parameters cannot always reflect changes in patients&#x02019; health status, leading to underestimation and treatment delay of AE episodes. COPD has, in fact, shown high clinical and functional intra-individual variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] which may reduce the ability of one-dimensional models to recognize a wide range of events (i.e., worsening dyspnea, reduced number of steps per day, etc) associated to an AECOPD. Third, our trial was not powered for the outcome of hospitalization.</p><p>The study produced an interesting result in that it demonstrated that the use of TM was associated with a lower rate of hospital readmission for AECOPD and/or any cause during the first 30&#x000a0;days after hospitalisation [IRR: 0,43 (0,19&#x02013;0,98); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04 and 0,46 (0,24&#x02013;0,89); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, respectively]. In view of the fact that early readmissions are a common occurrence in patients with COPD, which are estimated between 8 and 21.8% of the total number of hospitalizations, and reducing their frequency is considered a high priority of health care organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], study results suggest that TM could be used as an early follow-up care after hospital discharge of COPD patients until the risk of readmission has receded.</p><p>A number of limitations pertaining to this study should be mentioned. First, although COPD has been recently regarded as a heterogeneous disease characterized by high phenotype variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], phenotypic distinctions in the patients were not considered during the randomization process. In particular, since patients&#x02019; history of previous exacerbations was unavailable, we cannot exclude the possibility that the distribution of &#x0201c;frequent exacerbators&#x0201d; was unbalanced between the groups, with a confounding effect on the impact of TM on HRQL. &#x0201c;Frequent exacerbators&#x0201d; have, in fact, been recognized as a distinct clinical subgroup characterized by poorer HRQL as a result of a high exacerbation rate irrespective of the degree of airflow limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Second, it was impossible to blind the study population and personnel to treatment allocation, given the intervention&#x02019;s interactive nature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite its limitations, the study provides useful information for healthcare professionals who are examining the possibility of utilizing TM to optimize AECOPD management. The study&#x02019;s most important findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Adding TM to usual care does not significantly improve patients&#x02019; HRQL in a health care context where care standards are high and medical services are well established;</p></list-item><list-item><p>In this type of situation, TM intervention is not effective in reducing hospitalizations, which is the major factor driving up the healthcare cost of COPD patients;</p></list-item><list-item><p>TM can nevertheless facilitate continuity of care during the hospital-to-home transition, improving outcomes among patients discharged after an AE episode.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In the light of these findings, we would conclude that use of TM to manage AE should not be generalized across of the entire population of COPD patients and efforts should be made to identify specific subgroups that could most benefit from telehealthcare.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>6-min WT</term><def><p>6-minute walking test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ABG</term><def><p>Arterial blood gas</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Acute exacerbations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AECOPD</term><def><p>Acute exacerbations of COPD</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p>COPD assessment test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p>Emergency Department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV<sub>1</sub></term><def><p>Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOLD</term><def><p>Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p>Hospital anxiety and depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>Heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IR</term><def><p>Incidence ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRR</term><def><p>Incidence rate ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTOT</term><def><p>Long-term use of oxygen therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS</term><def><p>Mental component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mMRC</term><def><p>modified Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPI</term><def><p>Multiparametric prognostic index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PaCO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PaO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p>Physical component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFT</term><def><p>Pulmonary function test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Risk ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF36v2</term><def><p>Short form health survey version 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGRQ</term><def><p>St. George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SpO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TM</term><def><p>Telemonitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WD</term><def><p>Walking distance</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators and patients at the investigative sites for their support of this study, in particular Loris Ceron, Local Health Authority of Venezia, Venezia, Italy; Alberto Durigato, Local Health Authority of Treviso, Treviso, Italy; Beatrice Nordio and Alessia Don&#x000e0;, Local Health Authority of Padova, Padova, Italy; Guido Polese, Local Health Authority of Verona, Verona, Italy; and Andrea Rossi, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.
