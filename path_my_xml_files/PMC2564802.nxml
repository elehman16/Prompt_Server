The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score (based on erythrocyte sedimentation rates; DAS28 (ESR)) for the abatacept vs placebo groups at day 197.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomised 3:3:2 to abatacept (&#x0223c;10 mg/kg every 4 weeks, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;156), infliximab (3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;165), or placebo (every 4 weeks, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;110) and background MTX. Safety and efficacy were assessed throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Similar patient demographics and clinical characteristics were present at baseline between groups, with mean scores of &#x0223c;1.7 for HAQ-DI and 6.8 for DAS28 (ESR). At 6 months, mean changes in DAS28 (ESR) were significantly greater for abatacept vs placebo (&#x02013;2.53 vs &#x02013;1.48, p&#x0003c;0.001) and infliximab vs placebo (&#x02013;2.25 vs &#x02013;1.48, p&#x0003c;0.001). For abatacept vs infliximab treatment at day 365, reductions in the DAS28 (ESR) were &#x02013;2.88 vs &#x02013;2.25. At day 365, the following response rates were observed for abatacept and infliximab, respectively: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 72.4 and 55.8%; ACR 50, 45.5 and 36.4%; ACR 70, 26.3 and 20.6%; low disease activity score (LDAS), 35.3 and 22.4%; DAS28-defined remission, 18.7 and 12.2%; good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responses, 32.0 and 18.5%; and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 57.7 and 52.7%. Mean changes in physical component summary (PCS) were 9.5 and 7.6, and mental component summary (MCS) were 6.0 and 4.0, for abatacept and infliximab, respectively. Over 1 year, adverse events (AEs) (89.1 vs 93.3%), serious AEs (SAEs) (9.6 vs 18.2%), serious infections (1.9 vs 8.5%) and discontinuations due to AEs (3.2 vs 7.3%) and SAEs (2.6 vs 3.6%) were lower with abatacept than infliximab.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this study, abatacept and infliximab (3 mg/kg every 8 weeks) demonstrated similar efficacy. Overall, abatacept had a relatively more acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with fewer SAEs, serious infections, acute infusional events and discontinuations due to AEs than the infliximab group. </p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number:</title><p>NCT00095147.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Abatacept is a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator, that modulates the CD80/CD86:CD28 co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> The mechanism of action of abatacept is fundamentally different to that of other biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The study utilised a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled design for the first 6 months to validate efficacy responses, and the study duration allowed for the opportunity to directly compare the safety profile of the active biologic treatment groups over 1 year.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA, were at least 18 years of age, had RA for at least 1 year,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and had an inadequate response to MTX, as demonstrated by ongoing active disease (at randomisation &#x02a7e;10 swollen joints, &#x02a7e;12 tender joints, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &#x02a7e;1 mg/dl using a high sensitivity assay (upper limit of the normal range, 0.5)). All patients had received MTX &#x02a7e;15 mg/week for &#x02a7e;3 months prior to randomisation (stable for at least 28 days) and washed out all DMARDs (&#x02a7e;28 days prior) except for MTX.

No MTX dose adjustments were permitted except in the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). Between days 198&#x02013;365, dose modification was permitted for MTX (&#x02a7d;25 mg weekly) and oral corticosteroids (&#x02a7d;10 mg prednisone or equivalent daily); hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, gold, or azathioprine were also permitted.

Adult patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX were randomised by centre in a 3:3:2 ratio to 6 months of abatacept (approximating 10 mg/kg), infliximab (3 mg/kg), or placebo treatment by intravenous (IV) infusion, on a background of MTX. Assessors, physicians and patients were blinded to the treatment group assignment for 1 year.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional review boards and independent ethics committees at participating sites, and was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before randomisation.</p><p>Treatment with placebo was limited to days 1&#x02013;197 to provide internal validity to the trial design and the clinical response rates of the two active treatment groups. On day 198, placebo-treated patients were reallocated to abatacept (with blinding maintained). Patients initially randomised to abatacept or infliximab continued their treatment. Clinical efficacy and safety assessments are presented for the abatacept, placebo and infliximab groups up to day 197, and for the abatacept and infliximab groups up to day 365 (excluding patients in the placebo group who were reallocated to abatacept at day 198).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study drugs</title><p>Abatacept was dosed according to weight: patients weighing less than 60 kg, 60&#x02013;100 kg, or more than 100 kg received 500 mg, 750 mg, or 1000 mg of abatacept, respectively. Infliximab was dosed at 3 mg/kg for all patients. Abatacept was administered by IV infusion on days 1, 15 and 29, and every 28 days thereafter, up to and including day 337 (with normal saline received on day 43). Infliximab was administered on days 1, 15, 43 and 85, and every 56 days thereafter (normal saline was received at the remaining visit days).

At day 197, the abatacept or infliximab groups were compared with the placebo group by analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) for mean changes from baseline in DAS28 (ESR) and in the SF-36 (PCS and MCS). The model included the change as the dependent variable, with treatment group as a main effect and the baseline score as an additional covariate. The proportion of patients with ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses, LDAS, DAS28-defined remission, a good EULAR response and a clinical meaningful HAQ-DI response was calculated. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was performed to evaluate the differences (and 95% CIs) between the abatacept or infliximab groups and placebo. At day 365, the reference group was changed to infliximab.</p><p>Patients who discontinued the study prematurely were considered as non-responders subsequent to the time of discontinuation for ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses, good EULAR responses and clinically meaningful HAQ-DI responses. For all continuous measurements (mean changes in DAS28, SF-36 and the HAQ-DI score), LDAS and DAS28-defined remission the last observations prior to the discontinuation were carried forward (LOCF). To access the effect of antirheumatic medications on the abatacept and infliximab treatment groups, a predefined sensitivity analysis was conducted on the data with the last DAS28 (ESR) score just prior to the initiation of the additional DMARD, or any increase in MTX or corticosteroid use during treatment days 198&#x02013;365 carried forward.</p><p>Safety was assessed at each visit.

Over the 12-month study, a relative difference in safety was observed, with fewer SAEs, serious infections, acute infusional events and discontinuations due to AEs in the abatacept group than the infliximab group.</p><p>Following 6 months of treatment, abatacept and infliximab on a background of MTX significantly reduced the signs and symptoms of disease (DAS28 (ESR); ACR 20, 50 and 70), and improved physical function (HAQ-DI) and quality of life (SF-36) compared with placebo, in patients with an inadequate response to MTX. The relative efficacy of abatacept and infliximab at day 197 was similar, as the 95% CIs for the treatment difference for DAS28 (ESR) scores, ACR response rates, HAQ-DI responses and HRQoL improvements overlapped. However, by day 365, the 95% CIs for the treatment difference between abatacept and infliximab for the reduction in DAS28 (ESR), good EULAR responses, LDAS, the ACR 20 response rate and the HRQoL physical summary measure did not include zero, suggesting a difference favouring abatacept for these specific endpoints.</p><p>While the onset of response (as assessed by ACR 20 responses), initially appeared more rapid with infliximab, similar response rates were noted with abatacept and infliximab by day 85. Between 6 months and 1 year, abatacept responses were maintained, while those with infliximab were not. The sustained efficacy observed at 1 year compared with 6 months in abatacept-treated patients is consistent with results from other abatacept trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Similarly, the finding that patients treated with infliximab did not sustain response rates over 1 year is also consistent with previous trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> When the impact of adding additional therapies was assessed using a sensitivity analysis according to the last score prior to addition, reductions in disease activity tended to be consistently higher with abatacept than with infliximab.</p><p>Overall, abatacept had a relatively more acceptable safety and tolerability profile than infliximab. Over 1 year, fewer SAEs, AEs, infections, and discontinuations due to AEs or SAEs were observed with abatacept relative to infliximab. Generally, opportunistic infections appeared to be relatively uncommon in this study and were mainly observed in the infliximab group, including two events of TB, an event of <italic>P jiroveci</italic> pneumonia, an event of pseudomonal lung infection and an event of herpes encephalitis. No opportunistic infections were reported in the abatacept group. Autoimmune symptoms or disorders were uncommon (&#x0003c;1%) with abatacept and infliximab. All of the malignancies were reported during the first 6 months, including one in the abatacept group, one in the placebo group and two in the infliximab group.</p><p>The data presented here should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. Although collectively the data support a relatively more acceptable risk-to-benefit profile of abatacept compared with infliximab, the design of this study utilised the infliximab dose of 3 mg/kg, without dose adjustment. At the time of the study, the recommended dose of infliximab (approved labelled starting dose for RA) was 3 mg/kg; however, today regulatory agencies recognise the use of higher doses of infliximab, and physicians use them in a proportion of patients to maintain a durable response. In fact, the dose may be increased in up to 30% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Although higher doses have been associated with an increased risk of AEs in clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Finally, this study was not designed to evaluate the effect of abatacept or infliximab vs placebo on radiographic progression.</p><p>In conclusion, these two biologic therapies with two distinct mechanisms of action have different safety and efficacy profiles; however, abatacept and infliximab both offer clinical improvements to patients with an inadequate response to MTX. Over 1 year, abatacept exhibited a durable response, and had a relatively more acceptable safety and tolerability profile than infliximab, as evidenced by fewer SAEs, serious infections, acute infusional events and discontinuations due to AEs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded and sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
