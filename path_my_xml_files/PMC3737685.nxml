The recommended intravenous induction dose is 2.5 mg/kg, corresponding to the dose producing unconsciousness in 95% of the subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, the major drawbacks of anesthetic induction with propofol are a greater degree of hypotension as compared with other hypnotic agents and inadequate attenuation of the hypertensive response to intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Studies have demonstrated that the propofol requirements for induction are reduced in the presence of an opioid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Fentanyl has been studied extensively and is added during induction of anesthesia to provide analgesia during surgical procedures and to decrease the hypertensive response to intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It is also known to potentiate the hypnotic effect of propofol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Butorphanol is a morphinan, chemically related to levorphanol, and has mixed agonist-antagonist properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It is a kappa-receptor agonist as well as a mu-receptor antagonist, resulting in analgesic and sedative properties without profound respiratory depression or euphoria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The most prominent side-effect is sedation, a property that is generally quite useful in the perioperative period. There is abundant literature on the analgesic properties of butorphanol. Its efficacy as an adjuvant to intrathecal and epidural local anesthetics for intraoperative and post-operative use is well documented.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] However, the sparing effect of butorphanol on induction doses of propofol has not been evaluated in humans earlier. Entropy consists of two distinct variables of electroencephalography (EEG), state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). There is no literature regarding the effect of butorphanol on RE and SE.</p><p>It was hypothesised that butorphanol, due to its sedative effects, would reduce the requirements of propofol at induction comparable to fentanyl. The aim of this study was to compare the propofol induction dose with butorphanol and fentanyl pre-treatment, using clinical end-points and entropy, and to identify the optimal dose of butorphanol that would augment the hypnotic effect of propofol without undue adverse effects such as increased sedation and delayed post-operative recovery. The secondary outcome was to compare the hemodynamic changes during propofol induction with these drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A double-blind, prospective, randomized, comparative study was conducted on 120, American Society of Anaesthesiologistsphysical status I and II patients, aged between 18 years and 65 years, of either sex, undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Approval for the study was obtained from the institute's ethical committee and written and informed consent was taken from the patients after explaining the nature of the study. Exclusion criteria included history of cardiac, cerebrovascular, respiratory, hepatic or renal disease, allergy to the study medications, risk of regurgitation, predicted difficult airway, obesity (Body mass index- (BMI) &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pregnancy. Patients with history of alcohol or opioid abuse and on sedative, anti-convulsant, anti-psychotic and anti-hypertensive medications were not included in the study.</p><p>Patients were kept fasting for 8 h and were not administered any sedative pre-medication on the day of surgery. In the operating room, the patient was connected to the monitor with a DatexOhmeda 7100 workstation and an intravenous line was secured in a peripheral vein. The baseline heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and RE and SE were recorded. The patients were randomly allocated into three study groups of 40 patients each, using a sealed envelope technique. Group F patients received intravenous fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, Group B 20 patients received butorphanol 20 &#x003bc;g/kg and Group B 40 patients received butorphanol 40 &#x003bc;g/kg. The drugs were prepared in the identical syringe and in equal volume by the technician, and the anesthesiologists were blinded to the drug.</p><p>The patient remained undisturbed for 5 min after administration of the study drug and thereafter, the sedation level was assessed using the observer's assessment of alertness scale (OAA/S)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and SE and RE were noted. Patients were observed for nausea, vomiting, pruritis, RR &#x0003c;8 min and SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supplementation through face mask was administered when SpO<sub>2</sub> was &#x0003c;90%. Intravenous lignocaine 40 mg with proximal venous occlusion was administered prior to administration of propofol to alleviate the pain. Anesthesia was then induced with propofol (30 mg/10 s) using a syringe pump till the loss of response to verbal commands and RE and SE were noted. The anesthesiologist who performed all the clinical observations was blinded to the study drug administered. Subsequent muscle relaxation was achieved with rocuronium 1 mg/kg. The patient's lungs were manually ventilated with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 2 min before endotracheal intubation was performed. Following intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 1% isoflurane in oxygen: Nitrous oxide (35%:65%). No stimulus was given to the patient for 5 min post-intubation and RE and SE were noted at 1 min intervals. The HR, SBP, DBP and MAP were also recorded before administration of the study drugs, 5 min thereafter, at the time of induction, for 2 min post-induction and post-intubation for 5 min at 1 min intervals. We also observed the incidence of hypotension (fall in systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;30% from baseline). Hypotension was treated with rapid infusion of 200 ml aliquots of Ringer's Lactate (up to 1000 ml) until restoration of blood pressure to &#x0003e;70% of the baseline. Intravenous ephedrine 5 mg boluses would be administered if there was no response to fluid administration. Sustained hypertension was considered if systolic blood pressure remained &#x0003e;20% above baseline for 3 min post-intubation. It was treated with increase in isoflurane concentration at 0.5% increments. The study concluded 5 min after intubation. The remaining part of the anesthesia regimen was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. All the patients were interviewed on the first post-operative day and asked for any post-operative recall of intraoperative events.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A pilot study was performed on 20 patients for the estimation of sample size. A difference in the propofol induction dose requirement of 0.15 mg/kg was considered as equivalent of the groups. With a true mean difference of 0.09 and standard deviation of 0.1, the estimated sample size with an alfa-error of 0.05 and power of 80% for equivalence of groups was 36 in each group. Forty patients were therefore recruited in each group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS-version 13). Data are expressed as mean with standard deviation for normally distributed continuous variables and median with inter quartile range for ordered categorical variables not distributed normally. Discrete data is expressed as frequency with percentage of total. Normal distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using ANOVA with <italic>posthoc</italic> analysis using Bonferroni test. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used to compare ordered categorical variables. Chi-square test and Fischer exact test were used to compare discrete variables between the groups.

Increasing the dose of butorphanolto 40 &#x003bc;g/kg had no additional reduction in the propofol requirement. The loss of response to verbal commands occurred at higher entropy values in the presence of both fentanyl and butorphanol.</p><p>Lysakowski and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] showed that analgesic concentrations of fentanyl facilitate loss of consciousness (LOC) at lower plasma effect-site concentrations. Mi and co-workers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] also reported that fentanyl pre-treatment potentiated the effect of propofol for achieving the hypnotic end-point. They found lower propofol concentrations in the propofol + fentanyl group compared with the propofol group at responsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and response to mechanical nasal membrane stimulation. The results of the present study are consistent with the results of previous studies. Pre-treatment with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kgreduced the induction dose of propofol to 1.1&#x000b1;0.50 mg/kg.</p><p>Butorphanol has been found to be a good premedicant, providing analgesia along with sedation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Its lack of euphoric effects may be useful for clinical populations prone to drug-seeking behavior.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Because butorphanol is not a controlled substance, its use can reduce administrative liability for abuse and can lower the number of distribution records associated with Schedule II narcotics. It is also cheaper than fentanyl.</p><p>Although its role as an analgesic and premedicant drug is well established in humans, there are only a few animal studies on the dose-sparing effect at induction. Two studies in dogsreported that butorphanol, along with other premedicants, significantly reduced the dose requirement of propofol at induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In another study in cats, premedication with butorphanol or morphine, combined with acepromazine, significantly reduced the propofol dose for induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] There are no reports in humans.</p><p>Fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and butorphanol 40 &#x003bc;g/kg have been reported to be equianalgesic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Butorphanol 40 &#x003bc;g/kg produces more sedation and delays the recovery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] We wanted to identify the optimal dose of butorphanol that would augment the hypnotic effect of propofol without undue adverse effects such as increased sedation and delayed post-operative recovery. In our study, we administered butorphanol in two doses, i.e., 20 &#x003bc;g/kg and 40 &#x003bc;g/kg. We found that the propofol induction dose with butorphanol 20 &#x003bc;g/kg was 1.05&#x000b1;0.35 mg/kg. There was no further reduction in the induction dose of propofol by increasing the dose of butorphanolfrom 20 &#x003bc;g/kg to 40 &#x003bc;g/kg. This could have resulted from the ceiling effect of butorphanol. A similar observation was made by Murphy and colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] who have reported that there is a &#x0201c;ceiling&#x0201d; to the potency of nalbuphine and butorphanol as anesthetic supplements. This ceiling effect seems to be beneficial in minimizing the incidence of various side-effects like respiratory depression with antagonist&#x02013;agonist opioids than with pure agonists.</p><p>Depth of sedation and alertness was assessed using the responsiveness scores of the modified OAA/S.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Higher sedationwas observed in both the butorphanol groups as compared with Group F. This difference could be explained due to the difference in the opioid receptor spectra. Butorphanol is a kappa-receptor partial agonist as well as a mu-receptor antagonist, whereas fentanyl is predominantly a mu-receptor agonist. Butorphanol is therefore associated with more sedation than fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Butorphanol is also associated with less respiratory depression as compared with fentanyl due to its receptor profile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It was observed in our study that fewer patients experienced O<sub>2</sub> desaturation after administration of the study drug in both butorphanol groups. MAP SpO<sub>2</sub> values were also higher in the two butorphanol groups than in the fentayl group, although there was no statistical difference in the three groups.</p><p>Bispectral (BIS) and SE/RE indices have been widely used to estimate the depth of anesthesia and sedation. The administration of opioids together with anesthetics may substantially change the predictive value of these EEG monitors. Sebel and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] commented that the adjunctive use of an opioid analgesic confounds the use of BIS as a measure of anesthetic adequacy when movement response to skin incision is used as the primary endpoint. Miand co-workers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] found higher BIS in the propofol + fentanyl group compared with the propofol group at unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and response to mechanical nasal membrane stimulation.</p><p>Lysakowski and colleagues also reported that LOC occurred at a higher BIS<sub>50</sub> (BIS value at which 50% of the patients lost consciousness) in the presence of an opioid. One possible explanation for this may be that opioids, in the analgesic concentrations used in the study, produce minimal electrophysiological alterations on the cerebral cortex.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Another possible explanation as to why the entropy did not reveal the interaction between the propofol and an opioid may be that non-cortical structures that are undetectable by EEG, such as the locus coeruleus, are involved in the mechanism of the drug effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we found that the entropy values were high when the patients had become unresponsive to verbal commands in all the three groups, a finding similar to previous studies. RE and SE at induction was higher than 60 in all the three groups.</p><p>There was a significant attenuation of hypertensive response to intubation in all the three groups. The major drawback of propofol is reduction in blood pressure with the standard induction dose of propofol. A typical induction dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) results in an approximate 30% reduction in SBP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Reduction in the requirement of induction dose reduces the hemodynamic effects of propofol. The incidence of fall in blood pressure to &#x0003c;30% was lower in all the three groups. The hemodynamic stability with both doses of butorphanol was comparable to fentanyl.</p><p>The recovery profile of the patients was not included in this study due to the heterogeneity of the duration of surgical procedures. The earlier studies have shown that there was no significant difference in the recovery profile between butorphanol 20 &#x003bc;g/kg and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg. Higher doses of butorphanol (40-60 &#x003bc;g/kg) resulted in prolonged sedative effects and delayed discharge.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>We conclude that butorphanol 20 &#x003bc;g/kg reduces the induction requirement of propofol comparable to that of fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and confers hemodynamic stability at induction and intubation. It is therefore an acceptable alternative opioid to fentanyl as an adjuvant to balanced general anesthesia. Increasing the dose of butorphanolto 40 &#x003bc;g/kg does not provide additional advantage.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
