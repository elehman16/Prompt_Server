Patients were recruited over 16&#x02005;months; 83 consented to the trial but only 7 patients were randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011276F1">figure 1</xref>). Two main issues emerged at closure. First, although the number of patients giving their consent increased steadily, there was often a long delay between consent and randomisation. Patients with sickle cell disease have unpredictable pain episodes, some of which may require A&#x00026;E attendances and hospital admissions. Severely affected patients tend to be offered disease-modifying treatment such as hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) or blood transfusions. During the trial period, most patients who had given their consent did not have a sickle cell pain episode that required hospitalisation. One patient was admitted to another hospital which was not a trial centre at the time. Second, there was a low rate of participation by sickle cell disease treatment centres; 27 were approached, 5 did not respond, 12 declined, 10 expressed interest, 4 registered patients and only 2 centres randomised patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011276TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016011276TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Status of centre enrolment at SWIM trial closure</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Centre status</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recruitment started</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interested&#x02014;ready to commence centre-specific approval</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interested&#x02014;not ready to commence centre-specific approval</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Declined&#x02014;do not use PCA for sickle cell pain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Declined&#x02014;staff issues, lack of research support, A&#x00026;E recruitment issues</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No response</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011276F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of patient recruitment at SWIM trial closure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011276f01"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several contributory factors for early closure of the SWIM trial, and potential remedies were identified:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Monitoring of emergency admissions for sickle cell pain at the lead trial centre found that 11 registered patients were not randomised because they presented at A&#x00026;E during weekends or at night when no SWIM trial trained staff were present. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training of A&#x00026;E staff performing randomisation was challenging due to high staff turnover. A SWIM trial-specific GCP training package was developed, which was easier to deliver on a more frequent basis, but there was insufficient time for this to have an impact on randomisation rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A&#x00026;E at the lead centre was closed overnight for a significant proportion of the study due to low staffing levels and safety concerns. Therefore, some registered patients were admitted to other centres. A system to allow randomisation of a registered patient admitted at a different centre was planned which would have improved the randomisation rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A SWIM trial protocol amendment to allow randomisation for repeated admissions had been approved by the trial oversight committees but not implemented before closure.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>The SWIM trial was adopted onto the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) portfolio. Nonetheless, initiation of trial centres was slow and research support was difficult to access. Several interested centres could not participate because they did not use opioid PCA. Other reasons included lack of research infrastructure and anticipated difficulties with randomisation in busy A&#x00026;Es.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Many recruited patients with sickle cell disease did not have frequent hospitalisations for pain episodes, with a longer than anticipated delay between consent and randomisation, although it was encouraging that only 25% of eligible patients declined to participate.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The SWIM trial was conducted within the UK National Health Service (NHS) and was unsuccessful due to lack of interest or capacity at several large sickle cell disease centres, overestimation of the number of eligible patients, and unanticipated delays between registration and randomisation. USA trials in sickle cell disease also failed to recruit.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Explanations cited include complex protocol design, insufficient staff, lack of research support, time constraints of clinical staff, requirement for trained staff at weekends and out of hours, involvement of multiple departments and fewer than expected eligible or consenting patients. These reasons are similar to the SWIM trial; nonetheless, specific strategies have to be adopted in the UK which has a different health service structure and no strong culture of sickle cell disease research to encourage successful participation. Moreover, in a cohort of multicentre trials funded by either the UK Medical Research Council or Health Technology Assessment Programme (HTA), only 31% of the trials achieved their original recruitment target with 53% being awarded an extension, and this did not improve over time.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Some preidentified trial centres did not participate as planned, and there were delays due to various reasons including issues with local research staff and clinical arrangements, logistics and regulatory approvals although cancer trials were more successful because of the previously established National Cancer Research Network.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, it appears that specialty clinical research networks such as those 30 prioritised by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) for clinical research networks subsequent to the earlier ones in the areas of medicines for children, stroke, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease would enhance recruitment.</p><p>There is a clinical need for research to improve treatment and outcomes in sickle cell disease within the NHS. The NIHR CRN portfolio provides funding; however, this is based on patients randomised, rather than patients giving consent and then recruited. In addition, CRN research capacity funds are usually awarded competitively based on research activity. Therefore, research inactive sickle cell disease centres are unlikely to be awarded funds for staff or capacity building to enable participation in trials such as SWIM. A case could be made for research in sickle cell disease to be affiliated to a specialty network to overcome these barriers.</p><p>Many HTA-funded trials incorporate a feasibility phase. The SWIM trial was in response to a priority commissioned funding opportunity, and no preliminary work had been done to identify potential problems in recruitment. Six monthly progress reports highlighted recruitment problems. Plans to address these included an amendment of the original trial design to allow each patient to be randomised on more than one occasion, as opposed to participating only once. This could have increased the accrual rate during the first year by an additional 13 randomisations. An extension of the trial was proposed to the HTA Board; however, this would have required additional funding, hence closure was not avoided.</p><p>These issues need to be addressed otherwise sickle cell disease trials in the UK will continue to fail.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The trial was funded by the HTA Programme of the NIHR in the UK (grant number 07/48/01), and sponsored by London North West Healthcare NHS Trust.
