The aims of postoperative pain management are to provide subjective comfort, inhibit nociceptive impulses, and blunt the neuroendocrine response to pain, thus enhancing early restoration of function. CS patients have additional compelling reasons to be provided adequate pain relief, as early mobilization is a key factor to prevent the risk of thromboembolic disease, and need to be pain-free to care for their newborn and breast-feed them effectively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] To achieve this, various drug combinations have been tried, to provide effective and safe analgesia. Favorable results have been observed with buprenorphine as an adjuvant with intrathecal local anesthetics. Buprenorphine is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid with high affinity at both &#x003bc; and &#x003ba; opiate receptors. Buprenorphine is one of the commonly used additives in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique that blocks the abdominal wall somatic afferents. Multiple trials have demonstrated the efficacy of TAP block as a component of a multimodal regimen, in providing postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery, including CS.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There have been no studies in literature comparing the analgesic efficacy of intrathecal buprenorphine (ITB) with bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block following CS delivery. The present study was designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of ITB with ultrasound-guided TAP block for post-CS delivery pain. The primary outcome was to measure the time to first request for analgesia. The secondary outcome was to measure pain scores, analgesic requirements, and side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ethodology</sc></title><p>Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II pregnant women aged 20&#x02013;40 years requiring elective lower segment CS under spinal anesthesia were recruited for the study. Institutional ethical clearance and patient consent were obtained. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups of thirty each using sealed envelope method ITB group and TAP block group. Pregnant women with contraindications to the neuraxial blockade, body mass index &#x0003e;35, history of the major systemic disease (ASA III or more), history of chronic pain, abuse of drugs or alcohol, and history of allergies to any study medications were excluded.</p><p>On the day of surgery, the patients were shifted to the operating theater and an intravenous (IV) line was secured with the 18-gauge cannula. The monitoring included noninvasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry. Patients were preloaded with 15 mL/kg of Ringer's lactate solution. Basal parameters were recorded, lumbar puncture was performed, and 1.75 mL (8.75 mg) of 0.5% of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 75 &#x003bc;g (0.25 mL) of buprenorphine totaling to a volume of 2.0 mL injected in ITB group and 1.75 mL (8.75 mg) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.25 mL of normal saline totaling to a volume of 2.0 mL injected in TAP group.</p><p>After injection, the patient was positioned supine with approximately 10-degree Trendelenburg tilt and left uterine displacement with a wedge under the right buttock. Patients were supplemented with oxygen (4 L/min) through a facemask and surgery was allowed to proceed after confirming the attainment of sensory blockade of T6. Intraoperative hypotension was considered to be present whenever systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased to &#x0003c;90 mm of Hg or &#x0003c;20% of the baseline whichever appeared first and was treated with ephedrine (3 mg aliquots), as and when necessary. Bradycardia was treated with atropine IV 0.02 mg/kg if heart rate (HR) decreased to &#x0003c;60/min. The attending pediatrician assessed the neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min of delivery of the baby.</p><p>In the TAP group, bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block was performed on the completion of surgery using a GE Healthcare Venue 40 portable ultrasound machine with high-frequency linear array probe of 8&#x02013;12 MHz. The probe was positioned in the midaxillary line between the lower border of the ribs and the iliac crest. The external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis muscles, and transversus abdominis fascia were visualized. A 22-gauge 100 mm Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> needle (B. Braun, Bethlehem, PA, USA) was directed under continuous in-plane ultrasound visualization between internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle into the posterior aspect of the fascial plane. After negative aspiration for blood, 20 mL of the 0.25% of bupivacaine plain solution was injected under ultrasound guidance on each side.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patients were evaluated by an independent observer for pain, sedation, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention. Arrival at the postanesthesia care unit was taken as time 0; the patients were subsequently assessed at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. The pain was quantified on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). Sedation level was evaluated using modified Wilson sedation scale 1 - oriented, 2 - drowsy, 3 - arousable, 4 - unrousable.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] On first request for analgesia, IV paracetamol 1 g stat was given and repeated every 6 hourly thereafter. Tramadol 50 mg IV was given for breakthrough pain. The time for first analgesic request and supplemental analgesic requirements over 48 h was recorded. Forty-eight hours after surgery, the patients were asked to rate on a three-point scale about their satisfaction with pain management 1 - highly satisfied, 2 - satisfied, 3 - dissatisfied.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size was estimated based on the study by Niraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] considering the difference between two means, substituting the values in standard deviation (SD) in the first group - 19, SD in the second group - 18, precision 10%, desired confidence level 95%, the sample size was calculated to be 26 in each group rounded off to 30.</p><p>The data collected were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

However, there was increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and pruritus in comparison with the ultrasound-guided TAP block. The benefits of neuraxial opiates are significant and far outweigh the side effects. The intrathecal procedure is easy to perform, less time-consuming, more predictable, and does not require additional technical skills or extra equipment in comparison with the TAP block. TAP Block as a modality for postoperative analgesia in CS section was inferior to ITB, both with respect to analgesic efficacy and patient satisfaction.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ismail</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What is new in postoperative analgesia after caesarean sections?
