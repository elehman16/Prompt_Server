for shoulder problems in UK primary care estimated the annual prevalence
to be 2.4%, with the rate increasing linearly with age.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It is estimated
that disorders of the rotator cuff account for between 30% and 70%
of the shoulder pain cases that are reported.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The clinical evidence available, regarding
both the natural history and management of rotator cuff tears, is
limited and conflicting; most reports are small scale, (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;cases),
single-centre, retrospective cohort studies.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>Rotator cuff tears can be treated both surgically (arthroscopic
and open) and non-surgically (for example by injection and exercises).
Traumatic tears are uncommon: most patients present through age-related
degeneration of tendon attachment to bone at the proximal humerus.
Surgical repair may be considered for patients with persistent symptoms
who fail to respond to rest and conservative care. Such non-operative
care will usually include physiotherapy and glucocorticoid injections
into the shoulder. </p><p>A rotator cuff repair operation aims to re-attach the tendons
to the bone. The repair may also include an acromioplasty, where
overhanging bone and soft tissue above the tendon are excised, with
the aim of creating more space for the rotator cuff tendons to move
freely. </p><p>In general, two approaches are available for surgical repair:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Open/mini-open surgery
involves the rotator cuff being repaired under direct vision through
an incision in the skin.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Arthroscopic surgery involves the repair being performed
through arthroscopic portals. </p></list-item></list><p>Proponents of arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery suggest that
the procedure may have advantages over standard open techniques,
in that the resulting trauma to the deltoid muscle and overlying
soft tissue is reduced. Arguably, this causes less post-operative
patient discomfort, together with earlier return of movement. However,
the success of the repair depends on the ability of the surgeon
to achieve a secure attachment of tendon to bone. This may be more
easily and reliably achieved by open/mini-open surgery. Other potential
disadvantages of the arthroscopic approach include increased technical
difficulty and longer time in theatre. Only a few, small, non-randomised
studies have directly compared procedures and therefore there is
a need to compare the outcome of the two surgical techniques.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to conduct a pragmatic
multicentre randomised clinical trial to obtain good quality evidence
of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic <italic>versus</italic> open
surgical repair for the treatment of degenerative rotator cuff tears. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Design</title><p>At the outset of the UKUFF trial in 2007, a three-way parallel
group randomised trial began comparing arthroscopic rotator cuff
repair surgery with open or mini-open rotator cuff repair surgery
with a rest-then-exercise programme of non-operative care [UKUFF
Original REC Version Number 07/Q1606/49]. Figure 1 presents the
original version as a flowchart.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Original trial flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2000270-galleyfig1"/></fig><p>The trial was adapted and reconfigured by the funder in 2009,
(after consultation with the trial steering and data monitoring
committees), into a two-way parallel group RCT, due to a high rate
of crossover of patients (85%) from the rest-then-exercise programme
to surgery (UKUFF Reconfigured REC Reference Number 10/H0402/24). A
total of 87 patients were carried through to the subsequent reconfigured
trial. After the reconfiguration, it was calculated that a further 180 patients
should be recruited and followed up for two years as per the original
protocol (providing a total of 267&#x000a0;patients treated with surgery).
It is the reconfigured design that is presented in this protocol.</p><p>UKUFF (reconfigured) is a pragmatic multicentre study involving
20 surgeons from 16 UK centres. It includes patients over 50 years
of age, with a diagnosis of a full thickness rotator cuff tear who
are deemed eligible for surgery. Patients are randomised to either
open or arthroscopic repair, while the surgeons perform their usual
and preferred surgical technique using one of these approaches.
Patients are followed up with telephone and postal questionnaires
for 24 months, and an MRI or USS (Ultrasound Scan) 12&#x000a0;months after
their surgery. The primary outcome is the Oxford Shoulder Score
at 24&#x000a0;months.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The
study is led by clinicians (both surgeons and physiotherapists),
methodologists, statisticians and health economists.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Surgeon eligibility</title><p>Participating surgeons require a &#x02018;minimum level of expertise&#x02019;
for the types of surgery undertaken. For both surgical techniques,
only consultant orthopaedic shoulder surgeons with a minimum of two
years&#x02019; experience in consultant practice can participate. For those
surgeons performing both arthroscopic surgery and open surgery,
only those who have performed a minimum of five cases per year are
considered eligible. The participating surgeons represent a cross-section
of high, medium and low volume practitioners undertaking both arthroscopic
and open surgery. </p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Recruitment and treatment allocation</title><p>Support from local research networks is used, where possible,

However, patients aged 85&#x000a0;years
and over are not expected
to be eligible to participate. Consent is obtained either locally,
by a research nurse, or remotely by the study office in Oxford.
Only when the consent form and the baseline questionnaire have been
returned is the participant entered into the trial and randomised
to one of the surgical options. Randomisation is by computer allocation
at the Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen. Allocation
was minimised using surgeon, age and size of tear. After randomisation,
the participant is irrevocably part of the trial for the purpose
of the research, irrespective of what occurs subsequently. </p><p>Patients are free to withdraw at any time without consequence
to the health care they receive.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Randomised surgery</title><p>Details of the surgical technique used (including method of repair
and theatre equipment used, e.g. types of suture) are recorded on
a standard form, as are the size of the tear, the appearance of
the tendons involved, and the ease and the completeness of the repair.
If circumstances dictate that the allocated surgical technique cannot
be carried out, then any alternative procedure is recorded. The
surgeon contacts the study office if their patient is unwilling
or unable to have the operation on the arranged date. Patient progress
through the study is detailed in Figure 2.</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>UKUFF trial flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2000270-galleyfig2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection and processing </title><p>Outcome assessments involve patient-completed questionnaires
and 12-month post-surgery imaging. </p><sec><title content-type="h3">Questionnaires</title><p>A combination of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS),<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the Shoulder Pain
and Disability Index (SPADI),<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> the
Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5)<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and
the EQ-5D<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> is
used to assess functional outcome and patient-reported quality of
life. These assess a range of symptoms often experienced with rotator
cuff tears, e.g.&#x000a0;pain, weakness and a loss of function. Outcome assessments
are conducted by participant self-completion questionnaires and,
as such, interviewer bias and clinical-rater bias are avoided. This
form of outcome measurement has consistently performed well in comparison with
clinician-based assessments and general health status measures.
All participants, including those who withdraw from their allocated
intervention but who still wish to be involved in the study, are
followed up with analysis based on the intention to treat principle. </p><p>Participants will receive questionnaires at the following time
points: </p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Baseline questionnaire

also collect information to inform a cost-effectiveness element.
Questions relating to information on primary care consultations,
other consultations, out-of-pocket costs and work impact of the
intervention received, are included. The study office in Aberdeen
will contact and follow up participants whose questionnaires have
not been returned.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Post-operative imaging</title><p>High rates of re-rupture of the rotator cuff tear (20% to 54%)
have been reported after surgery, with some reporting a significant
correlation between re-rupture and poor outcome.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Rates of re-rupture
or repair failure may differ between the two surgical techniques.
For this reason, participants will undergo an MRI or USS at 12 months
post operation to assess the state of the rotator cuff repair. These
are arranged by the study office in Oxford and performed locally.
The images are collected centrally and read by an independent consultant radiologist
blind to the type of surgery performed. The results of the scan
are not reported to the participating surgeons. Incidental abnormalities
of clinical significance are reported to the surgeon.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses are based on randomisation of patients,

variables and participant baseline values. Statistical significance
is set at the 2.5% level, with corresponding confidence intervals. All
participants will remain in their allocated group for analysis (intention
to treat). Per-protocol analysis will also be performed.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Economic evaluation</title><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. A simple patient
resource-use questionnaire at baseline and at 12 and 24 months post
randomisation is used to obtain information on primary care consultations,
other consultations, out-of-pocket costs, work impact of the intervention
received and return to work. Unit costs will come from national
sources and participating hospitals. The patient questionnaire is
also used to administer the EQ-5D. The main health economic outcome
is within-trial and extrapolated quality-adjusted life years, estimated
using the EQ-5D. </p><p>Incremental cost effectiveness will be calculated as the net
cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, for arthroscopic surgery <italic>versus</italic> open
surgery. Power calculations (see following section) have been based
on clinical rather than cost effectiveness outcomes, which will
be estimated rather than used in hypothesis testing. Cost-effectiveness
ratios and net-benefit statistics will be calculated. We will report
within-trial cost-effectiveness and explore if the trial produces
sufficient evidence to plausibly model future quality of life or
costs (e.g. based on projected failure rates). We will also extrapolate
long-term cost effectiveness beyond the trial period. </p><p>An important component of this trial will be assessment of cost.
Therefore, an accurate record of procedures at each of the proposed
centres is essential. To evaluate costs of each type of surgery,
information from the operating theatres will be collected. Theatre
managers will be contacted and visited at each site. Resources used,
equipment costs and standard procedures for rotator cuff repairs
will be recorded. Per-case information will also be analysed during the
final analysis. A checklist of equipment, consumables, implants,
time and staff used during each case will be completed by theatre
staff. Information from theatres will be collected by the Oxford
UKUFF office and will be used in a cost comparison between the arthroscopic
and open surgery. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size and feasibility </title><sec><title content-type="h3">Sample size sought</title><p>The sample size was designed to detect a difference in OSS score
of 0.38 of a standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> for the comparison
of arthroscopic <italic>versus</italic> open surgery. This was based
on our experience of using and developing the OSS score in a variety
of settings, from which a three-point difference (0.33 of a <sc>sd</sc>)
would be deemed a clinically important change. Attrition is expected
to be low (10%), as are the effects of clustering of outcomes<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>(intra cluster correlation
(ICC) less than 0.03). While we did not have a direct estimate from
a shoulder trial, other orthopaedic datasets available to our team
supported this low ICC estimate. Both of these factors required
the sample size to be inflated, however, the primary analysis will
be adjusted for baseline OSS score which conversely allows the sample
size to be decreased by a factor of 1-correlation squared.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Our previous studies
showed that the correlation in the OSS score pre surgery to six
months post surgery in patients similar to potential trial participants
was 0.57. Assuming a conservative correlation of 0.5 implied that
the sample size could be reduced by 25%, and still maintains the
same power. Therefore, a study with a total of 267 participants was
considered sufficiently powered to detect a clinically important
change in each comparison, assuming attrition and clustering accounted
for approximately 25% of variation in the data. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Organisation</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Trial Timeline</title><p>The trial began in December 2007 and was stopped in December
