Preventive antibiotic therapy lowers the infection rate after stroke, but the effect of preventive antibiotic treatment on functional outcome in patients with stroke is unknown. The PASS is a multicenter, prospective, phase three, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial of preventive antibiotic therapy in acute stroke. Patients are randomly assigned to either ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g, given every 24 h intravenously for 4 days, in addition to standard stroke-unit care, or standard stroke-unit care without preventive antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study is to assess whether preventive antibiotic treatment improves functional outcome at 3 months by preventing infections. This paper presents in detail the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS) and was submitted while the investigators were still blinded for all outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary outcome is the score on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), assessed by ordinal logistic regression analysis according to a proportional odds model. Secondary analysis of the primary outcome is the score on the mRS dichotomized as a favorable outcome (mRS 0 to 2) versus unfavorable outcome (mRS 3 to 6). Secondary outcome measures are death rate at discharge and 3 months, infection rate during hospital admission, length of hospital admission, volume of post-stroke care, use of antibiotics during hospital stay, quality-adjusted life years and costs. Complications of treatment, serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are reported as safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data from PASS will establish whether preventive antibiotic therapy in acute stroke improves functional outcome by preventing infection and will be analyzed according to this pre-specified SAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Preventive antibiotic therapy lowers infection rate in patients after stroke, but the effect of preventive antibiotic treatment on functional outcome after stroke has not yet been investigated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS) is a phase three randomized clinical trial investigating whether the preventive use of the antibiotic ceftriaxone improves functional outcome in acute stroke patients by preventing infections. We previously published the trial protocol and an update of this protocol; we now present the statistical analysis plan (SAP)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This SAP was drafted without knowledge of any of the outcomes by the investigators and randomization code will not be broken before acceptance of the current paper for publication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Summary study protocol</title><p>PASS is a multicenter prospective, randomized, phase III, open-label, blinded end-point superiority trial (PROBE) of standard care with preventive ceftriaxone treatment compared to standard care without preventive ceftriaxone. Adult patients with stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), a score &#x02265;1 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and stroke onset within 24 hours were included
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients were excluded in case of infection at admission, use of antibiotics within 24 hours before admission, previous hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to cephalosporins or penicillin, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pregnancy or when death seemed imminent. Patients were randomly assigned to either ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g, given every 24 h intravenously for 4 days, in addition to stroke-unit care, or standard stroke-unit care without preventive antibiotic therapy. Randomization was performed through ALEA (online software for randomized trials;
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nl.tenalea.net/amc/ALEA/Login.aspx">https://nl.tenalea.net/amc/ALEA/Login.aspx</ext-link>) and is based on a uniform distribution; weight of the arms is equal (1:1). Randomization is stratified according to study center (academic hospital, large non-academic hospital, or small non-academic hospital) and stroke severity (score on NIHSS 1 to 9 or &#x0003e;9) and performed by using random blocks with a maximum block size of 6; blocks of 2, 4 and 6 are made per stratum combination
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The study has a PROBE design, which implies that blinding is lost, but only as to treatment. Patient and physician were aware of treatment allocation; however, the assessors of outcome were not. Data were collected on admission, during hospital stay, and at 3 months by standardized case record forms. The primary outcome is functional outcome at 3 months follow-up, as assessed on the mRS during a structured telephone interview by a trained assessor blinded for treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes are death rate at discharge and at 3 months, infection rate during hospital admission, length of hospital admission, volume of post-stroke care, use of antibiotics during hospital stay, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Safety outcomes are complications of treatment, Serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). In the initial trial protocol, we presented a binary logistic regression analysis on the dichotomized mRS (0 to 2 versus 3 to 6) as primary outcome, requiring a sample size of 3,200 patients, and a proportional odds model in a secondary analysis of the primary end point
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Blinded for any of the outcomes, we have changed the primary analysis in PASS from a binary logistic to an ordinal logistic regression on the original mRS, enhancing statistical power. The adapted power analysis showed that with identical assumptions on the clinical effect, using a 0.05 two-sided significance level and 80% study power, 2,550 patients were needed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The analysis of dichotomized mRS data will now be the secondary analysis of the primary end point.</p><p>On 23 March 2014, all patients were included and the last follow-up is expected in June 2014. For the complete study protocol and update, we refer to previous publications

The medical-ethical board of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, approved the protocol on 5 May 2010, and 29 Dutch participating centers were added in the course of the study. Due to the change in primary analysis of primary outcome from a binary logistic approach to an ordinal logistic regression analysis and an expected rate of patients lost to follow-up and/or patients with incomplete data of 5%, the total sample size was reduced from 3,200 patients to 2,550 patients in 2014

A distinction will be made among a cardiovascular cause (brain infarction, brain hemorrhage, myocardial- or pulmonary embolism. or another cardiovascular cause), an infection (pneumonia, sepsis or another infection), death by any type of malignancy, death by any other cause (for example, traffic accident), withdrawal of treatment due to a poor prognosis or unknown cause of death.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analysis of primary outcome</title><p>An ordinal regression model on the total range of the mRS will be performed as the first analysis of primary outcome, under the assumption of proportional odds

As the investigators are blinded for all outcome data until the statistical analysis plan is accepted for publication, we chose to use the most important prognostic factors for outcome after stroke: age, stroke severity on the NIHSS, history of stroke, history of diabetes, prior disability as defined on mRS, and stroke type
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Stratification of randomization was performed according to both study center and stroke severity, so we will also include study center as a covariate.

With this SAP, we present the analyses that will be published in the primary publication. By publishing the statistical analysis plan before knowledge of any outcome, we stimulate transparency of scientific conduct and allow others to add timely suggestions for additional analyses.</p><p>Patients in the acute phase of stroke are at risk for infections. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 87 studies showed that infections complicate stroke in 30% of all stroke patients. Pneumonia was associated with mortality with an OR of 3.62 (95% CI 2.80 to 4.68)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The effect of preventive antibiotic therapy on outcome in stroke patients has been investigated in few studies. Two meta-analyses of these studies showed that preventive antibiotic therapy reduced the number of infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The proportion of patients who died and the number of disabled patients were not significantly reduced, but numbers of included patients were small.</p><p>The PROBE design with open-label preventive antibiotics might introduce detection bias for infection. Physicians are aware of the treatment allocation, which potentially influences decisions on nonscheduled treatment (that is, the detection and treatment of patients with infection). This might influence the outcome measure of infection rate. To control for this bias, we will provide a secondary judgement of infection diagnosis by a blinded expert panel, according to CDC criteria. The CDC criteria are restrictive and use ancillary investigations such as blood tests, chest X-rays and culture results to confirm the diagnosis of infection. In clinical practice, for a stroke patient with fever, a cough and abnormalities on auscultation, a physician will often not wait for culture results or refrain from treating pneumonia when a chest X-ray does not (yet) show a consolidation.</p><p>Preventive treatment with ceftriaxone after stroke might improve outcome by preventing infections. A potential beneficial effect on functional outcome might be caused by a direct effect of prevention of infections in patients after stroke, most commonly pneumonia, but also by the result of decreased length of stay on the stroke unit of even in the hospital. A recent study of individual patient data in a meta-analysis of randomized trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention showed that an overall attributable mortality of ventilator-associated pneumonia is 13%, which was mainly caused by prolonged exposure to the risk of dying due to increased length of ICU stay
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Ceftriaxone also has neuroprotective properties, at least in animal studies of stroke, which may be mediated by increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Antibiotics may induce overgrowth of antibiotic resistant pathogens in individual patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the general population, selective antibiotic pressure is an important determinant of emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Previous clinical trials on preventive antibiotic therapy in stroke, antibiotic resistance patterns of bacteria cultured from patients with or without preventive antibiotics were similar, but numbers of patients were low
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previous work has showed that implementation of preventive antibiotics in the ICU did not increase resistance rates in an environment with low levels of antibiotic resistance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We will compare total antibiotic use in both treatment groups during hospital stay and collect stool specimens in a nested case control study that includes 300 patients.</p><p>During the course of the study we changed the analysis of primary outcome on the mRS from a dichotomized analysis toward an ordinal regression analysis. The ordinal regression analysis is increasingly used in stroke trials because of its higher efficiency
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Importantly, our primary outcome (for example, functional outcome on the mRS) was not changed, and the assumptions used in the initial sample size calculation were maintained. By using ordinal regression analysis, the total sample size was lowered from 3,200 patients to 2,550 patients. Using this method enables us to reduce the number of patients without changing the assumptions on the magnitude of the effect on the primary outcome scale from the original sample size calculation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case Record Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DDD</term><def><p>defined daily dose&#x02019;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>last observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRS</term><def><p>modified Rankin Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHSS</term><def><p>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PASS</term><def><p>Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALYS</term><def><p>quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAP</term><def><p>statistical analysis plan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUSAR</term><def><p>suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIA</term><def><p>transient ischemic attack</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAP</term><def><p>ventilator-associated pneumonia.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WFW, JDV performed conception and design of the work and drafted the work.
