In addition, hexetidine 0.1% is available at affordable prices in the local market.

Newton&#x02019;s type II is a diffuse erythema involving part or all of the mucosa, which is covered by the denture.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>We included in the study, patients who were: (1) Confirmed having <italic>C. albicans</italic> in their dentures, (2) aged between 40 and 80 years, (3) healthy, (4) not taking any medication that might affect the oral bacterial flora, and (5) wearing the maxillary full prosthesis for more than 1-year.</p><p>Patients with systemic diseases such as diabetes, nutritional deficiencies and those wearing their dentures for less than 1-year were excluded.</p><p>Sixty patients met the inclusion criteria. They were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups (2 tests and 1 control), of 20 patients each and were asked to avoid cleaning their dentures during the experimental procedure to standardize the study.</p><p>A quantitative microbiological measurement was performed the 1<sup>st</sup> day (D1) from the infected oral mucosa and the fitting side of the dentures.</p><p>Patients in the first group had their dentures soaked in a solution of chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12% (Paroex; Sunstar: Butler, USA) during the night for 8 h (from 10 pm to 6 am) for 4 consecutive nights, the ones of the second group in hexetidine 0.1% (Hextril; Godeck Manufacturer for Parke Davis, France) and the third (control) group in distilled water following the same protocol.</p><p>A second swab collection destined for a new <italic>C. albicans</italic> colony count was taken on the day 4 (D4).</p><p>One investigator carried out microbiological procedures. The Becton Dickinson (New Jersey, USA) Microbiology System, BBL Culture Swab was used.

(1996) detected DS in 72% of denture wearers in an elderly population living in a geriatric institution.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It has been widely accepted that proper routine cleansing of dentures is required to prevent DS and maintain healthy supporting tissues.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Kulak-Ozkan <italic>et al</italic>.

Pavarina <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> established a protocol of disinfection in which 10 min of immersion at 4% concentration solution was totally effective in eliminating <italic>C. albicans in vivo</italic> from complete dentures.

This effect can be attributed mainly to the chemical mechanism of action of this solution against the fungal cell. MacNeill <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> observed that, after the contact with chlorhexidine, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells exhibited a severe cytoplasmic degeneration (fragmentation and clumping of the contents, vacuolization, lipid accumulation and condensation) and fragmentation and desquamation of the cell wall, resulting in cell death.</p><p>Regardless of the effectiveness, the use of chlorhexidine has been limited by some side effects that could affect the patient compliance such as the brown stains on the acrylic resin.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In our study, over the 20 patients of the first group, dentures soaked in Chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12%, 15 showed a total disappearance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (0 CFU/ml) after four nights of immersion (D4), 4 registered a decline in the number of colonies to 20 CFU/ml (result within normal limits) and only one kept an elevated count of 80 CFU/ml.

Jones <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> described the positive effect of hexetidine in decreasing the adherence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The studies of the action <italic>in vivo</italic> of hexetidine on <italic>C. albicans</italic> are rare.

This color can be a major obstacle in the use of chlorhexidine as a daily decontamination product.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Our results showed that among the 20 patients of the second group, dentures soaked in hexetidine 0.1%, only 2 registered a total disappearance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (0 CFU/ml), 16 had reduced number of colonies for more than 80% (3 for more than 60 %), 1 patient went from more than 1000000 CFU/ml before soaking to 120000 CFU/ml at D4 sampling and 1 patient had a higher number of colonies at D4 compared to D1.</p><p>The effect of hexetidine on <italic>C. albicans</italic> is, therefore, variable but is not null. On the other hand, among the 20 dentures soaked in hexetidine, 4 underwent a very light brownish stain (much less than that caused by chlorhexidine). These four prostheses were all old in age. In our opinion, further studies need to be done in order to confirm this point, which may be due to a factor related to the age of the resin.</p><p>The third control group, as expected, the results showed absolute ineffectiveness of the distilled water.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Better antifungal effect of chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12% solution is noted, compared to hexetidine 0.1%, as a disinfection product for infected dentures by <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>However, hexetidine solution presents moderately good results after soaking dentures for 8 h during 4 consecutive nights.
