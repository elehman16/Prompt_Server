The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of non-reticulated HA-based mesotherapy on skin elasticity and complexion radiance. 55 women with cutaneous ageing signs included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population blindly received intradermal micro-injections (50&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.02&#x000a0;mL) of non-cross-linked HA filler with mannitol (Glytone 1, HA concentration: 14&#x000a0;mg/g) in one cheek and saline physiological solution in the other according to hemifacial randomisation in 3&#x000a0;monthly sessions. Elasticity (E1 and E2 stiffness parameters) and dermis thickness were measured by cutometry and 20&#x000a0;MHz echography, before (D0) treatment and 1 (1M) and 3&#x000a0;months (3M) after the last injection. A trained panel blindly scored skin complexion radiance from standardised and calibrated photographs, using 100&#x000a0;mm analogue scales. In the FAS population, only HA filler significantly decreased E1 at 1M (&#x02212;10.9&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.026) and 3M (&#x02212;10.5&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.035) compared with D0; its effect versus the control tended to be more persistent, with a difference between treatments at 3M close to significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.063). E2 also decreased at 1M (&#x02212;8.2&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.027 in the per protocol population, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53) and 3M after HA-treatment only. Dermis thickness significantly increased after HA-treatment at 1M (+3.4&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.028) and 3M (+4&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.008), and after control-treatment at 1M only (+2.5&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.015). The HA filler significantly improved complexion radiance at 3M compared with the control (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.012) and for 51&#x000a0;% of subjects, their skin status.

In particular, decreased synthesis of collagen and elastin and their increased degradation, reduced proliferative capacity of fibroblasts and perturbations in the organisation of elastic fibre network lead to alterations in the mechanical properties of the skin with reduced resilience and elasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Advances in the knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms associated with ageing have led to the development of different approaches to reduce and repair its untoward effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], particularly by using minimally invasive procedures.</p><p>Originally developed to treat vascular and lymphatic disorders, mesotherapy has recently been used for skin rejuvenation. The method consists in multiple and micro-dosed injections of bioactive products into the skin to increase its hydration and reconstruct an optimal physiological environment for the fibroblasts. It is aimed in particular at enhancing cell activity and synthesis of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid (HA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The most common formulation of mesotherapy for facial skin rejuvenation includes repetitive injections of a multivitamin solution in the superficial dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, among the products available for skin rejuvenation by mesotherapy, HA plays an important role in the hydration of the extracellular space due to its ability to attract water molecules and it is thought to create the physiological conditions in the extracellular matrix for proliferation, migration and organisation of dermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinical experience of skin rejuvenation by HA-based mesotherapy suggests this technique is safe inasmuch as it is performed by a trained physician, who follows safe-injection practices with appropriate aseptic techniques to prevent the risk of infection related to inadequate safety measures. Furthermore, several studies suggest it can improve skin hydration, firmness and viscoelastic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, published results from clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in improving viscoelastic mechanical properties of the skin are scarce.</p><p>The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effect of intradermal microinjections of a non-cross-linked HA-based mesotherapy product with mannitol (Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> professional 1), on mechanical properties of facial skin compared with a control product in subjects displaying mild to moderate cutaneous ageing signs. With this aim, we performed measurements by cutometry of mechanical parameters at the dermis level, which is assumed to be the main structure involved in viscoelastic mechanical properties of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and we measured the thickness of the dermis as a secondary endpoint. Other objectives of this study were to compare the effects of HA filler and control on skin complexion, their efficacy self-evaluated by the subjects, and their tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>This clinical, biometrological, single-blind, randomised study was carried out at the Centre de Recherche sur la Peau Pierre Fabre (CRP), Toulouse (France), according to the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines for Good Clinical Practices (CPMP/ICH/135/95). The protocol was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons South-West and Overseas III and the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS). Each volunteer signed a written informed consent.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject selection</title><p>Female volunteers (30&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years), of phototypes I&#x02013;III according to Fitzpatrick classification, with mild to moderate cutaneous ageing signs (mild to visible dehydration, mild to marked sagging/slackening, sallow and/or olive-greenish complexion, no wrinkles to wrinkles at rest and fine lines on the surface) on the face were included. Non-menopausal women had to be under effective contraception since at least 2&#x000a0;months before inclusion and had to have negative pregnancy test results at inclusion and each mesotherapy session. Menopause diagnosis was to be confirmed in menopausal women. Subjects presenting the following criteria were not included: pregnant or breast-feeding women, any cutaneous pathology of infectious, inflammatory, viral and vascular type affecting the face, auto-immune and granulomatous pathologies, diabetes, Osler&#x02019;s endocarditis, wound healing disorders, allergy history to HA or any ingredient of the test product or to any other product used in the study (Anesderm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Septeal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pierre Fabre Dermatologie, Boulogne-Billancourt, France; Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Suncare and Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Post-Op, Pierre Fabre Dermatologie Esthetique, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). Other criteria for non-inclusion were the regular use of hormone or systemic (retinoid&#x02013;based products, immunosuppressants, steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) or local (highly active topical corticoids) treatments that could influence the study results within the 3&#x000a0;months before inclusion, any peeling within the 2&#x000a0;years before inclusion, and any mesolift, lifting, botulinum toxin treatment, HA or other filler injections, previous facial surgery, remodelling or ablative laser procedures within the year before inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatments</title><p>The study product was a HA injectable solution (Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1 professional, Merz Pharmaceutical GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) consisting of 14&#x000a0;mg/mL non-animal non-reticulated HA in phosphate sodium thus providing a viscosity suitable for microinjections and increasing the half-life of the molecule. The HA injectable solution contains glycerol, a strong moisturising agent which also plays a role in skin elasticity and potentiates the action of HA, and mannitol which in particular is known for limiting the degradation of HA by free radicals through its antioxidant action. The product was provided in a pack of two pre-filled sterile 1-mL glass syringes supplied with two 30G &#x000bd; needles. Physiological saline solution (Aguettant<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was used as a control product.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The study consisted of three injection sessions at monthly intervals and three assessment visits, the first one 14&#x000a0;days before the first injection (D0), the second 1&#x000a0;month (1M) after the last injection session and the third 3&#x000a0;months (3M) after the last injection session. The same trained investigator administered HA and control products to all subjects. One hour before each injection session, the subject applied a topical local anaesthetic cream (Anesderm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) on the face. After having removed the cream, the whole face was then thoroughly cleaned with a disinfecting lotion (Septeal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). During each treatment session, the subject randomly received about 50&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.02&#x000a0;mL of study product in one side of the face and the same amount of control product in the other side, to allow intra-individual comparison and thus overcome the problem of inter-individual variations in skin status. Both products were injected manually into the lower part of the cheek, at the level of the dermis/epidermis junction or/and the superficial dermis using the gold standard serial puncture technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], as described by Iorizzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A pattern was applied to the skin to precisely mark injections points, thus allowing reproducibility of serial injections at each time-point. The intervention was single blinded, as the subject was not informed of the injection side of the study product. The difference in viscosity between the study and control products did not allow the investigator performing the injections to be unaware of treatment assignments. Then, the investigator massaged the injection sites to ensure the placement of the product, and reminded the subject of precautions to follow after injection (no makeup during the following 12&#x000a0;h, no exposure to extreme temperatures). The subjects had then to apply a soothing cream (Post-op Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) twice a day during the five following days. They were also instructed to avoid sun exposure during the study and were provided a sunscreen (Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Suncare) to apply in case of exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Skin elasticity and dermis thickness measurements</title><p>Skin elasticity was measured using a Cutometer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> MPA580 (Courage &#x00026; Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The device generated negative pressure of up to 100&#x000a0;mbar at a rate of 20&#x000a0;mbar/s sucking up the skin into a probe of 6&#x000a0;mm diameter aperture, which was put in contact with the skin perpendicularly to the surface. When the pressure was withdrawn at the same rate, the skin returned to its normal shape. The movement of the skin in and out the probe is illustrated in a pressure&#x02013;deflexion curve, which allows the determination of skin stiffness and viscosity parameters. These parameters were determined using a nonlinear skin behaviour model specifically developed by the Pierre Fabre Skin Research Centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and requiring measurements of dermis thickness. Dermis thickness was measured by echography using a high-frequency (20&#x000a0;MHz) ultrasound scanner (Dermcup, ATYS Medical, Soucieu en Jarrest, France) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. E1 and E2 parameters define the stiffness of elastin and collagen fibres, respectively, and the more they decrease the more skin is compliant. Equivalent strain parameter (<italic>&#x003b5;</italic><sub>eq</sub>) corresponds to the strain necessary for collagen fibres extension.</p><p>Biometrological measurements were performed at two pre-specified 2&#x000a0;cm areas on both cheeks in controlled conditions at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C during the three evaluation visits following a 15&#x000a0;min rest of the subject.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Skin complexion assessment</title><p>Skin complexion was evaluated by a panel of 16 experts trained to do the quantitative descriptive analysis. Using this methodology, they had to describe complexion radiance and uniformity with the help of calibrated and standardised photographs of the hemiface, which were cropped to only display the treated area of the cheek. In addition, photographs were rendered anonymous and randomised to allow blind scoring by the panel. The complexion evaluation was based on the identification and the selection of descriptors for establishing a sensory profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fifteen training sessions were necessary to validate panel performance, i.e. the reproducibility, discrimination and reliability of the panellists in descriptive tests. The sensory profile was composed of eight items, one for the global assessment of complexion radiance and seven for the multidimensional analysis of complexion: four items detailed complexion radiance (uniformity, hydration, yellow and pink aspects of the complexion) and three items described general skin complexion (firmness, luminosity/brightness, and quantity of wrinkles). For each hemiface of each subject, randomised cropped photographs corresponding to the three evaluation time-points were presented to the panellists, who blindly scored the eight items using 100&#x000a0;mm visual analogue scales (e.g. from 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;not radiant at all to 100&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very radiant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Evaluation criteria</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary efficacy criterion</title><p>The change in cutaneous mechanical properties induced by the product was evaluated by assessing skin elasticity parameters at the level of the product- and control-treated hemifaces, at D0 and 1&#x000a0;month after the last session of mesotherapy (1M).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary efficacy criteria</title><p>Change in skin elasticity at the level of the control and HA-treated hemifaces was also assessed 3&#x000a0;months after the last session of mesotherapy (3M) to evaluate the persistence of the product effect.</p><p>Change in dermis thickness was also evaluated by echography at the level of the control and HA-treated areas on the cheeks at D0, 1 and 3M.</p><p>The efficacy of the product was also evaluated on skin complexion by scoring its radiance and uniformity at the level of the control and HA-treated hemifaces from standardised and calibrated photographs at D0, 1 and 3M.</p><p>Finally, the subjects self-assessed the global efficacy of the product after each mesotherapy session and at 1 and 3M by using a 5-point scale (aggravation, no improvement, slight, moderate and important global improvement).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>All adverse events (AE) occurring at inclusion and throughout the study were reported from the first evaluation visit (D0).

Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate intensity and expected (haematoma, oedema, papule, erythema or other transient inflammatory reaction): 46.8&#x000a0;% occurred in the HA-treated hemiface and 25.7&#x000a0;% in the control. The most commonly expected adverse event was haematoma, both in the HA and control-treated hemifaces, with a global incidence of 35.7 and 20.5&#x000a0;%, respectively. Four subjects experienced severe haematoma after injection in the HA-treated hemiface, and four others reported a non-expected severe adverse effect (pregnancy, otitis, shoulder tendonitis aggravation, functional ankle impairment), but none was related to the study product. All expected adverse events disappeared within a mean time of 5.9&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Local tolerance to both products was good to excellent in 85&#x02013;100&#x000a0;% of cases throughout the study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This controlled single-blind study using hemifacial treatment randomisation demonstrated the efficacy of a non-cross-linked HA-based mesotherapy product with mannitol (Glytone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> professional 1) in improving dermis mechanical behaviour and complexion radiance of facial skin with a 3-month remanence. In contrast to the control, intradermal microinjections of HA filler induced a significant decrease of E1 and E2 parameters, indicating a decrease of elastin and collagen fibre stiffness and suggesting that this product may significantly improve skin compliance. This effect persisted 3&#x000a0;months after the last mesotherapy injections for E1 parameter and tended to be significant compared to the control. Furthermore, HA injections significantly and sustainably increased <italic>&#x003b5;</italic><sub>eq</sub> parameters in contrast to the control, the effect of which was smaller and did not persist with time. This suggests that non-reticulated HA-based mesotherapy may sustainably regain suppleness to the skin and increase entanglement of its collagen fibres thus restoring the mechanical behaviour of a young skin.</p><p>The significant effect of HA-based mesotherapy on skin elastic properties was coupled in our study with a sustained increase in dermis thickness 1 and 3M after the last mesotherapy session. With the control, a significant effect was observed at 1M only. This transient dermis thickening with both treatments at 1M may be explained by the fact that the mechanical stimulation of microinjections induced dermis micro-inflammation with vasodilatation persisting 1&#x000a0;month after the last injection session. However, as dermis thickening remained significant 3M after the HA treatment only, we may hypothesise that by contrast with the control, HA injections secondarily induced the synthesis of dermis components such as elastin and collagen which may contribute to dermis thickness increase and be responsible for the remanence of this effect. Collagen and elastin fibre synthesis activation and their potential renewal may also explain the effect of HA on skin elastic parameters. The newly formed fibres may be more compliant and their greater number and entanglement may reinforce the collagen and elastin network, which is embedded in a proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan gel to form the dermis. The results of a placebo-controlled study supports this hypothesis, since it demonstrated that injections of stabilised HA into the forearm skin significantly increased the synthesis of type 1 collagen in addition to profibrotic growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another study, which observed an increase in the echogenicity of the subepidermal low-echogenic band by ultrasound analysis after HA-based mesotherapy every week for 4&#x000a0;weeks on the dorsum of the hands, also suggested these changes may be related to an increased density of dermal collagen fibres by fibroblast activation resulting from treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another part of our study was the blinded assessment of skin complexion radiance on standardised and calibrated photographs. For this study, we developed a reliable and reproducible method to objectively describe skin complexion and in particular complexion radiance. To prevent the panellists from being visually influenced by the skin aspect of the non-treated areas, skin complexion was evaluated using randomised and cropped photographs corresponding to the treated area of the cheeks and not to the whole hemiface. With this method, we demonstrated for the first time a positive effect of mesotherapy on skin complexion radiance: HA microinjections induced a significant and sustainable improvement in complexion radiance compared with the control. Other skin complexion parameters such as yellow aspect and hydration also tended to improve after HA injections.</p><p>Finally, HA-based mesotherapy was considered globally efficient by the subjects, as the percentage of the subjects having perceived an improvement after each injection session into the HA-treated hemiface was significantly higher compared with the control-treated hemiface. Particularly, compared with the control, the percentage of subjects having perceived slight to important improvement 1 and 3&#x000a0;months after the third injection of HA was more than twice higher (60 vs 27.3&#x000a0;% and 51 vs 20&#x000a0;%, respectively). HA injections were well tolerated, with a good to excellent local tolerance in &#x0003e;85&#x000a0;% of cases.</p><p>Altogether, our results confirm those of previous studies showing that non-reticulated HA-based mesotherapy can improve skin hydration, firmness and viscoelastic properties. Although our study failed to show higher efficacy of HA filler compared with placebo in improving parameters of dermis mechanical behaviour and skin complexion, its significant effect on skin complexion radiance and the fact that E1 parameter was borderline significantly improved at 3M suggest that statistical significance might have been achieved in a larger study population.</p><p>Only one non-comparative pilot study evaluating the effect of three HA gel microinjection sessions on skin elasticity and dermal thickness of 19 women has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Using the cutometry and echography methods, the authors showed a significant increase in all skin elasticity parameters (gross and net elasticity, skin extensibility, relaxation, fatigability and capacitance) in both cheeks 1 and 3&#x000a0;months after the last injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but they failed to show changes in skin thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Another study evaluating the effect of microinjections of a vitamin/HA solution by histology and electron microscopy of skin biopsies also failed to show changes in epidermal and dermal thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This absence of clinical and histological modification may be due to a too small amount of non-reticulated HA injected into the skin by each micropuncture. The injection material was composed of a 9:1 suspension of a multivitamin solution in a non-conjugated HA gel, but unfortunately its concentration was not indicated, precluding any comparison.</p><p>With regard to skin stiffness, Reuther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] suggested an increase of this parameter, whereas we have shown a significant decrease. Although microinjections were performed at the level of the mid-dermis using a mesotherapy technique, the study product was a non-animal stabilised HA (NASHA) gel and cutometry measurements were performed with a probe with a 2&#x000a0;mm aperture and by applying a 450&#x000a0;mbar negative pressure, i.e. experimental conditions which allow epidermis and stratum corneum evaluation. From a mechanical point of view, dermis is the structure assumed to exert the greatest influence on elastic mechanical properties of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a point which was recently confirmed by comparisons between finite element models and elastographic measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We therefore considered that cutometry measurements at the dermis level were more adapted to the objectives of our study. This is why, according to Agache et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we used a 6-mm aperture probe to specifically measure dermal mechanical parameters and we coupled these measurements with dermis thickness assessments by echography to allow calculation of intrinsic cutometry parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, our study was controlled against physiological saline solution and the products were injected randomly in the two hemifaces to avoid the drawback of inter-individual variations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study objectively demonstrated the efficacy and the tolerance of a non-cross-linked HA filler in sustainably improving skin elastic parameters and complexion radiance. In particular, we showed that intradermally microinjected HA might be of value to improve suppleness of ageing skin, inasmuch as injections are performed by a trained physician with appropriate aseptic measures. It might be worthy of a further study to assess the role of HA in decreasing stiffness parameters and to determine if its action is mainly mechanical or mediated by the activation of dermis components synthesis by fibroblasts.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>M.
