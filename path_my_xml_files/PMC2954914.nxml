Pregnant or lactating patients or individuals with an active infection at the time of enrolment, a contra-indication to PD or participation in any other clinical trial where an intervention is designed to moderate rate of change of residual renal function are excluded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either neutral pH, low GDP dialysis solution (Balance<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or conventional dialysis solution (Stay.safe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for a period of 2 years. During this 2 year study period, urinary urea and clearance measurements will be performed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome measure will be the slope of residual renal function decline, adjusted for centre and presence of diabetic nephropathy. Secondary outcome measures will include time from initiation of peritoneal dialysis to anuria, peritoneal small solute clearance, peritoneal transport status, peritoneal ultrafiltration, technique survival, patient survival, peritonitis rates and adverse events. A total of 185 patients has been recruited into the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This investigator-initiated study has been designed to provide evidence to help nephrologists determine the optimal dialysis solution for preserving residual renal function in PD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number: ACTRN12606000044527</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During the past 30 years, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has become an established form of treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most published observational cohort studies suggest that the medium-term survival (up to 3 to 4 years) of patients treated with PD is at least comparable, and possibly superior, to that of patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, PD is associated with a higher rate of technique failure than HD. As rates of peritonitis have fallen in recent years, an increasing proportion of technique failure is attributable to alteration in membrane function whereby high solute transport is associated with loss of ultrafiltration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, the time sequence of loss of peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity and loss of residual renal function and urine output coincide whereby the two significantly limit an individual patient's capacity to control solute and volume homeostasis.</p><p>A large body of basic research in animal models and peritoneal cell culture systems has suggested that a major contributor to the high technique failure rate is the bioincompatible nature of conventional PD fluids. Such fluids may have a negative impact on host defence as well as having a pro-fibrotic effect on the peritoneal membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conventional PD fluids are considered "unphysiological," based on their acidic pH (5.0-5.8), high lactate concentrations (30-40 mmol/L), high osmolality (320-520 mOsm/kg), high glucose concentrations (31-236 mmol/L), and contamination by glucose degradation products (GDP) generated during the heat sterilization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Such solutions reduce the viability and growth of peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro, alter the turnover of structural collagen, and modify the homeostatic balance of cytokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The viability and function of peritoneal phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, are also impaired by standard peritoneal fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, experimental and clinical exposure of the peritoneal membrane to conventional PD solutions engenders significant histopathological changes over time, including loss of the surface mesothelial cell layer, thickening of the submesothelial compact zone and the development of a progressive vasculopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most of these adverse effects of dialysate on the peritoneal membrane appear to be accounted for by acidic pH and high concentrations of GDPs, since they were largely abrogated in <italic>in vivo </italic>studies by the use of neutral-buffered, low GDP fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to their direct cytotoxicity and stimulation of inflammatory cytokine production, GDPs promote the formation and deposition of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in the peritoneal membrane, which in turn correlates with peritoneal membrane fibrosis and histopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>All of the main industry manufacturers of PD solutions have now released to the market solutions that have low GDP levels (and, incidentally, a neutral or near neutral solution pH). Recent clinical trials with these solutions attest to their lower cytotoxicity for mesothelial cells and their use is also associated with less evidence of local peritoneal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, evidence of a beneficial effect on the morphological and functional changes associated with long-term exposure to PD fluids is not yet available. Nevertheless, a large, retrospective, observational cohort study in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] has demonstrated an association between the use of neutral pH, lactate-buffered, low GDP fluids and superior survival, although this finding was potentially limited by indication bias with residual confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>An alternative means by which the use of neutral pH, low GDP solutions might favourably impact PD patient outcomes relates to improved preservation of native kidney function. In the literature relating to survival of PD patients, there is overwhelming evidence that survival is determined more by residual renal function than by peritoneal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A multi-centre, open-label, prospective, randomized crossover study of conventional, acidic, lactate-buffered fluid with pH neutral, lactate-buffered, low GDP fluid in 86 prevalent CAPD patients from 22 centres in 11 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] demonstrated increases in renal urea and creatinine clearances over a 12 week period. Subsequently, several small, short-term, randomised controlled trials reported that neutral pH, low GDP fluids were associated with either a neutral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] effect on residual renal function. However, these studies were limited by insufficient statistical power, short-term follow-up and single centre designs.</p><p>The current multi-centre, randomised controlled study is designed to ask whether neutral pH, low GDP peritoneal dialysis fluid better preserves residual renal function in PD patients over a 2 year period compared with conventional dialysate.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Ethics approval for the balANZ trial has been obtained from the local Institutional Ethics Committee in all participating centres prior to study initiation and patient enrolment.

The estimated sample size per arm based on this information was 168 (total population 336), giving the study 80% power to detect a difference in slope of RRF versus time of 0.067.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Completion</title><p>Commencing in November 2004, it was initially anticipated that trial recruitment would be completed by December 2008, with final follow-up completed by December 2010. As of 1 October 2008, only 185 patients had been recruited into the study, accounting for 55% of the target. A decision was therefore made by the Trial Management Committee to halt further recruitment and to continue the trial until the last patient enrolled had been followed for 2 years (31 August 2010). Results will be analysed and reported in early 2011. Based on the final number recruited (185), the study has 80% power to detect a difference in RRF versus time of 0.091 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/month.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>A mixed effects General Linear Model will be fitted with residual renal function as the outcome variable and treatment group, time, centre and presence of diabetic nephropathy (Yes/No) as fixed effects terms. Patients will be fitted as a 'random' term in the model. In this way, the model will provide estimates of the rate of decline in RRF (the slope) for each patient and an appropriate framework to model the covariance structure for repeated measures. From this, an overall estimate of the rate of decline in each treatment group will be determined, corrected for centre and presence of diabetic nephropathy. The estimated slopes for the treatment groups will be compared via a t-test. The data will be assumed to be normally distributed and to decline in a linear fashion. However, the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality of residuals will be checked. Major departures from these assumptions will result in the employment of appropriate non-parametric tests or transformation. This analysis will be performed for both the month 12 and month 24 reporting efforts on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary time to event analyses will be analysed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analyses with treatment group, centre, presence of diabetic nephropathy and baseline renal function as covariates. P values &#x0003c; 0.05 will be considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This investigator-initiated, multicentre Australian, New Zealand and Singapore study has been designed to provide evidence to help nephrologists and their PD patients better determine the optimal dialysis solution for preserving residual renal function. Given that numerous studies have demonstrated that PD patients with rapid residual renal function decline are at significantly increased risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], novel treatments for preserving residual renal function in this group (such as with the use of neutral pH, low GDP dialysis fluids) may represent an important strategy for improving clinical outcomes in PD patients. The multicentre nature of the trial will greatly enhance its generalisability.</p><p>One of the significant difficulties encountered to date with the running of the trial has been slower than anticipated recruitment. Some of the reasons for this included initial delays with being able to accommodate patients receiving APD as well as a reluctance by some clinicians to allow patients to be randomised to conventional dialysate because of a firmly held belief that such fluids were inferior to "biocompatible" fluids. The hurdle encountered in recruiting to target in the balANZ trial due to the fact that use of biocompatible fluids is becoming standard in Australasia and many other parts of the world without high level supporting evidence, suggest that it may be extremely difficult for a future larger randomised controlled trial to be mounted if the present study does not prove to be definitive. Nevertheless, it is extremely important to establish high level clinical evidence for the benefits of "biocompatible" fluids compared to conventional dialysates, since they are appreciably more expensive and consequently have important implications for the allocation of limited health resources. Simply relying on biological plausibility and the results of observational cohort studies is fraught with peril due to confounding by indication and other biases. Indeed, there are numerous examples in nephrology practice where firm clinical guideline recommendations based on opinion supported by observational studies have been subsequently over-turned by the findings of randomised controlled clinical trials and systematic reviews (viz. peritoneal dialysis small solute clearance augmentation, serum cholesterol lowering and anaemia correction).</p><p>Although the final balANZ trial population will be just over half that required to provide adequate statistical power according to prospective sample size calculations, it will nevertheless be the largest randomised controlled clinical trial to date of "biocompatible" versus conventional dialysis fluids in PD patients and will be twice the size of the next largest, published controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Whilst the reduced final sample size of 185 will ultimately result in decreased statistical power, the study will still have 80% power to detect a difference in RRF decline of 0.091 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/month. This detectable difference compares favourably with the differences in RRF decline reported between Balance<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>and Stay.safe<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>fluids in other trials, such as Euro-Balance (0.21 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/month over 3 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Balnet (0.80 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/month over 12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the event of a negative study finding, which might potentially reflect a type 2 statistical error, the ability to detect a smaller benefit of biocompatible fluids on residual renal function decline could still be possible as a result of incorporation of the balANZ trial data into a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials of biocompatible fluids versus conventional biocompatible fluids currently being undertaken by the Cochrane Renal Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Such a systematic review may also help to determine whether biocompatible fluids influence patient-level outcomes, such as technique survival and patient survival, for which all studies to date have been significantly underpowered.</p><p>In conclusion, demonstration by the balANZ study of a significant improvement in residual renal function decline with neutral pH, low GDP fluids will provide clinicians with an important new strategy for effectively treating PD patients. On the other hand, a negative study will dissuade clinicians from prescribing more expensive fluids for no clear clinical benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>balANZ: the Balance in Australian and New Zealand peritoneal dialysis patients trial; D/D<sub>0 </sub>glucose: ratio of initial and 4 hour dialysate glucose concentrations; D/P creatinine: dialysate to plasma creatinine ratio at 4 hours; ESRD: end-stage renal disease; GFR: glomerular filtration rate; HD: Haemodialysis; ICH: International Conference on Harmonisation; NHMRC: National Health and Medical Research Council; nUF: normalised ultrafiltration; PAH: Princess Alexandra Hospital; PET: peritoneal equilibration test; RRF: residual renal function; TGA: Therapeutic Goods Administration; UF: ultrafiltration.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>David Johnson is a consultant for Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd and has previously received research funds from this company.
