We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new dispersible-tablet formulation of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine phosphate (DHA/PQP) in comparison to the marketed tablet (Eurartesim) in the treatment of infants with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> malaria. Reported here are the results of a large phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial conducted in African infants (6 to 12 months of age) from Mozambique, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. Primary efficacy endpoint was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28. Analysis was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. A total of 201 patients received the dispersible-tablet formulation, and 99 received the conventional one administered as crushed tablets. At day 28, the PCR-corrected ACPRs were 86.9% (ITT) and 98.3% (PP) in the dispersible-tablet group and 84.9% (ITT) and 100% (PP) in the crushed-tablet group. At day 42, these values were 85.9% (ITT) and 96.5% (PP) in the dispersible-tablet group and 82.8% (ITT) and 96.4% (PP) in the crushed-tablet group. The comparison between survival curves for time to new infections showed no statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> = 0.409). The safety and tolerability profile for the two groups was similar in terms of type and frequency of adverse events and was consistent with that expected in African infants with malaria. A standard 3-day treatment with the new dispersible DHA/PQP formulation is as efficacious as the currently used tablet in African infants and has a comparable safety profile. (This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01992900.)</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>antimalarial agents</kwd><kwd>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</kwd><kwd>infants</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution>Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals (Sigma-Tau)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100009996</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassat</surname><given-names>Quique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="1" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="27"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8018"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The last 15 years have witnessed impressive advances in the global fight against malaria, including in sub-Saharan Africa, where the highest burden of morbidity and mortality is still concentrated (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, an estimated 429,000 malaria-attributable deaths still occurred in 2016, the vast majority of which were among African children, making it clear that major efforts are still required in the fight against this disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). One of the major threats in the global strategy against malaria is posed by the emergence and potential spread of drug-resistant parasites. In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in 2006 the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The artemisinin derivatives are currently the most rapidly acting and potent antimalarials (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The pharmacodynamic effects of ACTs are due to the rapid absorption of artemisinins and their strong activity against several stages of the malaria life cycle from young asexual forms (rings) to early sexual forms (gametocytes) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Eurartesim is a fixed-dose combination composed of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and piperaquine phosphate (PQP) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This partner compound has a different mechanism of action from that of artemisinins and a much longer half-life (several weeks), facilitating the initial clearing of parasites, and a long posttreatment prophylactic effect (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy and safety of Eurartesim for the treatment of uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> malaria has been demonstrated in two phase III trials, respectively conducted in 1,553 African children and 1150 Asian adults and children (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Both studies demonstrated an equivalent efficacy of DHA/PQP versus the comparative ACT. In addition, they evidenced a superiority of DHA/PQP versus the comparative drugs in a longer posttreatment prophylaxis period that suppress new infections from emerging during follow-up.</p><p>In 2011, Eurartesim obtained a marketing approval by the European Medicine Agency for all countries of the European Union, manufactured as film-coated tablets (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The ACT was marketed for its use in children and adults and has been adopted by several countries where malaria is endemic as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Finally, Eurartesim obtained by the WHO the prequalification status on 9 October 2015 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>One of the greatest challenges of malaria treatment is ensuring adequate intake and compliance among young children, the population group most at risk of developing life-threatening episodes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As of today, very few antimalarials are available in good laboratory practice (GLP)-produced pediatric friendly formulations (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Since infants and very young children are generally unable to swallow oral tablets, Eurartesim was administered in previous trials as an oral suspension of crushed tablets mixed with water. However, the bitter taste of the crushed tablet could easily compromise tolerability in this age group, and crushing tablets is a suboptimal preparation procedure, which could result in loss of drug and a reduced dose ingested. To overcome these problems, a new water-dispersible tablet formulation of DHA/PQP was developed for oral administration in infants and young children.</p><p>We present here the results of a multicenter trial in sub-Saharan Africa aiming to assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of the new dispersible-tablet formulation of DHA/PQP with respect to the marketed formulation, administered as a crushed tablet, to infant patients (from 6 to 12 months of age) with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria. These results are part of a large phase II trial, which was designed to also collect pharmacokinetic data for dispersible and crushed formulations of DHA/PQP in African infants with malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patient disposition as presented in the case report forms is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Overall, 443 patients were screened, and 300 were randomized: 201 to receive the dispersible-tablet formulation and 99 to receive the crushed-tablet formulation. However, two patients randomized in the dispersible-tablet group were excluded by all analysis because one of them did not have parasites at day 0 (as determined by a confirmatory blood smear reading) and the other withdrew informed consent before the first drug administration (these patients, respectively, are reported as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;consent withdrawal&#x0201d; by day 28 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of study participants with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria treated with a 3-day course of either dispersible or crushed tablets of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/PQP). *, Two patients randomized in the dispersible treatment group were excluded from all analysis due to unconfirmed malaria diagnosis at day 0 (classified as &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;) and informed consent withdrawal before first study drug administration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zac0011867850001"/></fig><p>The most common reasons for study withdrawal were malaria recurrence (classified as treatment failure) and informed consent withdrawal, occurring with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Repeated vomiting after drug administration was more frequent in the dispersible arm compared to the crushed arm (5% versus 2%), although such a difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.349 by the Fisher exact test). Among patients reported as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, one more patient in the dispersible-tablet group dropped out due to family movement to a another area, while one patient in the crushed-tablet group left the hospital after the first study drug intake.</p><p>The number of patients enrolled in each country and their attribution to ITT and PP populations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The patients excluded from the PP population due to major protocol violations were 28 in the dispersible-tablet group (including the two patients above described, who were also excluded from the ITT population) and 15 in the crushed-tablet group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). All of them fulfilled the <italic>a priori</italic> declared major violations or did not complete the study due to a reason different from malaria recurrence or any other AE causing withdrawal from the study (i.e., consent withdrawal or lost to follow-up). Two more patients were excluded from the PP population (one per each treatment group) since it was not possible to assess their outcome on day 28 not having the patients attended this visit and presenting malaria recurrence at day 42. There were also seven randomized patients presenting baseline parasitemia outside the range indicated in inclusion criteria, but all of these violations were judged as &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d; by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and according to the study protocol these patients were included in the PP population.

A relevant and comparable reduction of HR (heart rate) in both treatment groups was observed at day 2 and at day 7. Related with this reduction, an increase in PR, QT, and QTcF intervals was observed in both groups with a comparable extension. A change in QTcF interval from baseline was detectable at day 2 predose and increased after drug administration, with 22 patients in the dispersible-tablet group (11.1%) and 14 patients in the crushed-tablet group (14.1%) manifesting a QTcF prolongation over 60 ms, none of which included clinical translation. No cases of QTcF prolongation higher than 500 ms were reported. At day 7, the QTcF prolongation tended to normalization, with only one patient in the dispersible-tablet group and two patients in the crushed-tablet group still maintaining QTcF prolongation. Overall, no arrhythmias or any other cardiovascular AEs were reported.</p><p>Two severe adverse events (SAEs) occurred during the study, both judged unrelated to the study treatment. The first SAE involved the death of a 6-month-old male patient enrolled in the crushed-tablet group. He received the full treatment course and was discharged from the hospital after malaria resolution (day 3). At day 27, the child was seen as an outpatient in a peripheral health post, with a history of fever, cough, and diarrhea. After a positive rapid diagnostic test for malaria, he was treated with artemether/lumefantrine. However, a malaria diagnosis was not confirmed by microscopy, and 2 days later the mother reported the child's death. The investigator considered sepsis the most likely cause of death (a diagnosis supported by a verbal autopsy). The second SAE occurred in a male of 11 months enrolled in the dispersible-tablet group. He received the first dose of the study drug, and 20 h later the patient condition deteriorated, with evidence of severe anemia (hemoglobin, 4.9 g/dl) and polypnea. The study treatment was interrupted, and the patient received parenteral quinine for malaria and blood transfusion for anemia. After 4 days of hospitalization, followed by oral treatment with quinine for a further 5 days, the event was resolved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>According to guidelines on the clinical investigation of medicinal products in a pediatric population, there is a need to develop new formulations that allow accurate dosing and enhance patient compliance in infants and young children (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This recommendation becomes even more necessary for the treatment of malaria, as young children and infants are those most affected by the disease, and very few GMP-produced pediatric-friendly formulations are available (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the current standard of care for patients with uncomplicated malaria in Africa (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). ACTs are typically provided in tablet form, which can be challenging to administer to young children who are typically unable to swallow whole pills. To facilitate the administration of ACTs to these individuals, tablets can be crushed and mixed with water. However, this process can result in the loss of active ingredients and lead to underdosing. In addition, crushed antimalarial tablets can be unpalatable since they have a bitter taste causing children to spit them out, thus leading to uncertain and/or subtherapeutic dosing (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Presently, there is only one ACT reported in the last updated version of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (last amended on August 2015), containing arthemether-lumefantrine, which was specifically developed as a dispersible formulation to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of ACT dosing in infants and young children (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need to make available on the market other pediatric formulations of different ACTs and, in this context, a new dispersible formulation of the DHA/PQP fixed-dose combination was developed for oral administration.</p><p>The dispersible-tablet formulation was similar in tolerability, efficacy, and safety to the standard formulation administered as crushed tablet to infants with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria. In particular, PCR-corrected cure rates at day 28 of follow-up were high for both formulations, and no differences were observed in the response to treatment in terms of clearance of asexual parasites and fever, which were rapid in both treatments groups. Follow-up periods longer than 28 days are currently recommended by the WHO for antimalarial drugs with a long half-life (e.g., piperaquine or mefloquine) to allow drug concentrations in the blood to fall below the minimum therapeutic threshold (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In fact, short observation periods can yield an underestimation of recrudescence rates. Hence, analysis of cure rates on day 42 showed that they were still high, suggesting a sustained efficacy for both formulations. Furthermore, substantial differences between the efficacies of the two formulations were not observed for the uncorrected ACPRs at day 42. Because the uncorrected cure rate is mainly affected by new infections in high-transmission areas, this finding indicates a similar prophylactic effect exerted by both formulations.</p><p>The present study confirmed the satisfactory efficacy of Eurartesim previously obtained in phase III trials performed in Africa and Asia (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In particular, the PCR-corrected ACPR at day 28 or the incidence of recurrences were similar to that obtained in African children (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The dispersible formulation was well tolerated, and its safety profile was comparable to the crushed tablet. No new safety issues arose from the present study, and all findings were in line with the former ones. Most of the commonly reported AEs were symptoms of malaria. Similarly, the pattern of changes in laboratory variables was consistent with acute malaria and its resolution, with no differences between treatment groups. The most common drug-related AE was vomiting, and the corresponding frequency was similar to that previously reported in African children treated with crushed or uncrushed tablets (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Importantly, no arrhythmias or other cardiovascular events were reported during the study. QTcF interval prolongations (difference from baseline higher than 60 ms) were observed in 11.6 and 15.2% of patients in the dispersible and crushed groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.381 [chi-square test]). Prolongation of the QT interval was assessed using both Fridericia's and Bazett's correction methods but, notably, both formulas could be biased by the physiological high HR present in infants and exacerbated by the ill status and fever. In fact, baseline evaluations differed drastically (by &#x0223c;60 ms) when the different correction methods were applied. The reduction in HR observed after drug administration could also induce a bias in the estimation of QTc. Accordingly, QTcF recorded at the screening visit was lower than that recorded at day 7 (335 &#x000b1; 16 ms versus 410 &#x000b1; 22 ms), when malaria was resolved and the blood level of piperaquine was below the concentration considered relevant for sustaining QT interval prolongation. These considerations suggest that the QTcF assessment in infants by DHA/PQP could be overestimated. Nonetheless, QTcF never exceeded the normal limits (450 to 470 ms), no cases evolved in rhythm disturbance, and all of the changes observed during therapy were never associated with clinical signs of cardiotoxicity.</p><p>Dispersible tablets are expected to contribute to ease of drug administration in subjects having difficulties in swallowing whole tablets, i.e., infants and young children. Since the dispersible formulations were similar in efficacy and safety to the conventional formulation in the infant population, we believe that this highly efficacious formulation should be made more readily available to all children below 5 years of age. Cost savings are also likely with its use, with the potential benefit of improving the acceptability of the combination once available on the market. It is noteworthy that a recent cost-effectiveness analysis of DHA/PQP for first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in African children showed that the use of this ACT, particularly in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission, is clearly justifiable from both clinical and economic perspectives (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The results presented here are part of a large study that was designed to evaluate also the population pharmacokinetics of piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin in African infants, since it appears important to demonstrate bioequivalence of the new formulation on PK grounds once similar efficacy and safety have been confirmed. The new dispersible formulation of Eurartesim is easy and safe to administer and provides better grounds for an enhanced compliance and effective treatment; hence, this should facilitate drug registration by Regulatory Authorities, prequalification by the WHO and, finally, full adoption in malaria control programs. Further studies are needed to clearly establish the improvement of the new formulation on compliance, hoping that the simplicity of its administration will improve substantially the adherence to the full 3-day course of treatment, therefore impacting the reduction of malaria morbidity and mortality in infants and young children and minimizing parasite resistance to ACTs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Study design.</title><p>Between November 2013 and June 2015, a phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial was performed in seven sites of five African countries: Centro de Investiga&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o em Saude da Manhi&#x000e7;a, Maputo, Mozambique; Kinshasa School of Public Health, University of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; Centre Muraz Bobo-Dioulasso, Nanoro, Burkina Faso; Centre National de Recherche et de Formation en Paludisme, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo, Tanzania; National Institute for Medical Research, Korogwe, Tanzania; and Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic of Barcelona (Spain) and by the National Ethics Review Committee and/or Institutional Review Board at each trial site.

For the other doses, patients should not have been fed in the 3 h before drug intake and for the following 3 h. However, for infants needing food during the restricted periods, this was limited to breast milk or a low-fat maize porridge.</p><p>Patients were kept at the health facility for the 3-day dosing period. Scheduled visits during follow-up were at days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 posttreatment. In case of recurrent parasitemia, rescue treatment was performed according to local guidelines.</p><p>The diagnosis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infection was made at each site by microscopy using standard methods (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Blood slides collected from screening until parasitemia clearance were also read by a centralized laboratory (Centro de Investiga&#x000e7;ao em Sa&#x000fa;de da Manhi&#x000e7;a, Maputo, Mozambique). If parasitemia recurred during the study, the distinction between recrudescence and new infection was made by PCR genotyping (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). PCR analysis was centralized and performed under blind conditions at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. Three polymorphic markers (MSP1, MSP2, and GluRP) were used to distinguish recrudescence from new infections. Recrudescence was defined when at least one identical allele for each marker was detected in the pre- and posttreatment samples. New infections were defined when all alleles for at least one marker differed between the two samples.</p><p>Blood samples for hematology and biochemistry were taken at enrollment and at day 7 and then repeated at day 28 if clinically significant abnormalities were detected at day 7 (analysis of main hematological and biochemical parameters, assessed at days 0, 7, and 28 are summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental material).</p><p>A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded for each patient at enrollment (baseline) and then repeated at day 2 before the last drug administration, as well as after 4 to 6 h of drug intake. An ECG was also recorded at day 7 and repeated at day 28 if clinically relevant abnormalities were detected at day 7. All ECGs were digitalized using an ELI-150 cardiograph (Mortara Instruments Europe Srl, Italy), and ECG reading and analysis were centralized by a cardiac laboratory (Cardiabase, Nancy, France).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-5"><title>Outcomes.</title><p>The main efficacy endpoint was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28. Other efficacy and safety endpoints included the following: (i) day 28, PCR-uncorrected ACPR; (ii) day 42, PCR-corrected and -uncorrected ACPR; (iii) the proportion of patients with early and late treatment failure (ETF and LTF); (iv) asexual parasite density and clearance time; (v) fever clearance time and gametocyte carriage over time; (vi) Kaplan-Maier survival analysis for new infections and recrudescences over time; (vii) AE occurrence; and (viii) changes in hematology, blood chemistry, vital signs, and ECG parameters.</p><p>Treatment outcome was assessed according to the study protocol and further revised by the DSMB to complement the WHO <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy definitions (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). All cases not strictly matching these rules (e.g., patients having taken disallowed drugs or with partially missing data, such as blood parasitemia) were evaluated under blind conditions at the DSMB meetings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-6"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS system software, version 9.2.</p><p>Analyses of efficacy were performed for both the ITT and the PP populations, whereas safety analyses were performed only for the ITT population. The ITT population included all patients taking at least one dose of the study drug. The PP population included all randomized patients who received the full treatment course, completed the day 28 assessment, had an evaluable PCR in case of recurrent parasitemia, and did not meet major protocol violations (e.g., inclusion without a microscopically confirmed diagnosis or the occurrence of severe vomiting or severe malaria). Patients for whom the PCR indicated a new infection were considered failures in the PCR-uncorrected analysis and successes in the PCR-corrected analysis, whereas patients with PCR results indicating a recrudescence were counted as failures in both analyses. Patients for whom the PCR result was not interpretable or missing or not done were imputed as failures in the ITT population and excluded in the PP population. Patients lost to follow up were excluded from the PP population (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).</p><p>The two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference in the PCR-corrected and uncorrected ACPRs at day 28 (or day 42) were generated using the normal approximation method (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The limits of the asymptotic CIs were computed. A CI with continuity correction was also computed to verify the robustness of the conclusions. Whenever the observed counts were small (i.e., not all cells had observed counts of at least five) or there was a disagreement between the results of the two formulas (with or without continuity correction), an exact CI was computed.</p><p>The proportion of aparasitemic patients was computed for each study visit by treatment group. The parasite clearance time was defined as the time elapsed between the first study drug intake and the first of two consecutive evaluations with negative parasitemia. The proportion of afebrile patients was computed at each study visit by treatment group. Early and late treatment failures were summarized by proportion per each treatment group.</p><p>The cumulative risks of new infections and recrudescences were estimated through survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier). In survival analyses of new infections, patients classified as new infections were considered as having reached the event, whereas patients who did not reach the event (i.e., subjects withdrawing from the study or having a recrudescence or with an uninterpretable or missing PCR or classified as a success) were censored at the relevant time. In survival analyses of recrudescences, patients classified as recrudescence were considered to have reached the event, whereas patients who did not reach the event (i.e., subjects withdrawing the study or with a new infection or with an uninterpretable/missing PCR or classified as success) were censored at the relevant time.</p></sec></sec>
