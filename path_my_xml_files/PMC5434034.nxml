The effects of aroma and taste, independently or in combination, on appetite sensation and subsequent food intake, were studied. Twenty-six females (24&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4 years, 20.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9&#x000a0;kg&#x022c5;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) consumed, over 15&#x000a0;min period, one of four sample drinks as a preload, followed by an <italic>ad libitum</italic> consumption of a pasta meal (after 65&#x000a0;min). Sample drinks were: water (S1, 0&#x000a0;kcal), water with strawberry aroma (S2, 0&#x000a0;kcal), water with sucrose and citric acid (S3, 48&#x000a0;kcal) and water with strawberry aroma, sucrose and citric acid (S4, 48&#x000a0;kcal). Appetite sensation did not differ between the S1 (water), S2 (aroma) and S3 (taste) conditions. Compared with S1 (water), S2 (aroma) and S3 (taste), S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) suppressed hunger sensation over the 15&#x000a0;min sample drink consumption period (satiation) (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) further reduced hunger sensation (satiety) more than S1 at 5, 20 and 30&#x000a0;min after the drink was consumed (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), more than S2 (aroma) at 5 and 20&#x000a0;min after the drink was consumed (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), and more than S3 (taste) at 5&#x000a0;min after the drink was consumed (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Subsequent pasta energy intake did not vary between the sample drink conditions. S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) had the strongest perceived flavour. This study suggests that the combination of aroma and taste induced greater satiation and short-term satiety than the independent aroma or taste and water, potentially via increasing the perceived flavour intensity or by enhancing the perceived flavour quality and complexity as a result of aroma-taste cross-modal perception.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Appetite</kwd><kwd>Food intake</kwd><kwd>Aroma</kwd><kwd>Taste</kwd><kwd>Flavour</kwd><kwd>Cross-modal perception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Over-consumption of food, resulting in excessive energy intake, has contributed to the obesity pandemic. Appetite and food intake in humans are controlled by successive but also overlapping sensory, cognitive, hormonal and metabolic signals that influence eating as described in the satiety cascade (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Blundell and Bellisle, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Blundell et&#x000a0;al., 1987</xref>). Within the satiety cascade, &#x0201c;Satiation&#x0201d; is the process which leads to the termination of eating; &#x0201c;Satiety&#x0201d; describes the inter-prandial period during which the feeling of fullness lingers before hunger returns (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Benelam, 2009</xref>). Food flavour, an oral-sensory signal, may play an important role in affecting appetite sensation and food intake. On the one hand, flavour contributes to food palatability which has been shown to stimulate hunger and increase food intake (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Bobroff and Kissileff, 1986</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hill et&#x000a0;al., 1984</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Spiegel et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yeomans, 1996</xref>). On the other hand, flavour <italic>per se</italic> can also be a satiation cue that reduces meal size, and acts as a satiety cue to influence the size of the next meal, through both psychological and physiological mechanisms (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Blundell and Bellisle, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Blundell et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). The flavour modality, which can comprise of both aroma or taste, has been shown to enhance the sensation of fullness, suppress hunger sensation and reduce food intake (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Bolhuis et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Ramaekers et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>There is an increasing interest in the impact of aroma and odour on appetite sensation and food intake. Volatile compounds can reach the olfactory epithelium through one of two routes: orthonasal (via nostril) or retronasal delivery (via nasopharynx) delivery (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Negoias, Visschers, Boelrijk, &#x00026; Hummel, 2008</xref>). Orthonasal odour delivery may be linked to the identification and anticipation of a food reward while retronasal aroma delivery is typically associated with the flavour perception of food during an eating event (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Small, Gerber, Mak, &#x00026; Hummel, 2005</xref>). Orthonasal odour delivery has been reported to stimulate a specific appetite for food containing this aroma, and it had a relatively smaller appetising effect on other foods (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ramaekers, Boesveldt, Lakemond, van Boekel, &#x00026; Luning, 2014</xref>). In contrast, retronasal aroma delivery has been shown to enhance the feeling of satiation and reduce food intake. A more intense retronasal aroma profile led to an increased sensation of satiation when compared with a less intense retronasal aroma profile in yoghurt products (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ruijschop, Boelrijk, De Ru, De Graaf, &#x00026; Westerterp-Plantenga, 2008</xref>). The addition of a creamy aroma to the nasal cavity via a silicone tube (mimicking the retronasal delivery), while consuming a tomato soup, enhanced the sensation of satiation compared with the condition without the creamy aroma (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Ramaekers et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). This resulted in a 9% reduction in the <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake in the soup with the delivery of a longer and more intense tomato aroma, compared with the same soup with a shorter and less intense tomato aroma (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Ramaekers, Luning, et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are five detectable tastes by humans, including sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami and a number of potential other tastes including fatty (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Chandrashekar et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Mattes, 2009</xref>). It is now widely agreed that in humans food intake is controlled by learned satiety (conditioned satiety) whereby we associate the sensation of taste with its metabolic consequences through instinct or learned experiences (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Booth, 2009</xref>). For instance, the learned association between sweet taste and the ingestion of carbohydrates, or between umami and the ingestion of protein, may contribute to the control of meal size (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Chandrashekar et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hogenkamp et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Of all taste, the effect of sweet taste on appetite sensation and food intake is the most studied. Nutritive sweeteners, such as sugars, may not only promote satiation and satiety via their sweetness, but also, via physiological mechanisms due to their post-ingestive feedback (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bellisle, Drewnowski, Anderson, Westerterp-Plantenga, &#x00026; Martins, 2012</xref>). For example, sucrose (135&#x000a0;g), when presented in a drink, increased the subsequent feeling of fullness compared with a water control (J. H. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lavin, French, &#x00026; Read, 2002</xref>). Prolonged consumption of sucrose, over 10&#x000a0;min, decreased the subsequent food intake to a greater extent when compared to the condition where sucrose was consumed over 2&#x000a0;min, suggesting that the temporal profile of sweetness perception may modulate subsequent food intake (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">J. H. Lavin, French, Ruxton, &#x00026; Read, 2002</xref>). A non-nutritive aspartame sweetened drink also suppressed subsequent food intake compared with a water control, but the reduction in food intake after aspartame was smaller than that after sucrose (65&#x000a0;kcal or 90&#x000a0;kcal). This provides the evidence that the post-ingestive consequence of sugars plays a part in providing satiety (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Birch, Mcphee, &#x00026; Sullivan, 1989</xref>) although this was in children. Although the sweet taste <italic>per se</italic> can contribute to satiation and satiety, sweet taste often plays a key role in determining the palatability of food or drink which has been shown to stimulate hunger (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bellisle et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). In some studies, sweet taste had no effect or even increased hunger sensation and food intake, which was potentially due to the palatability from the sweet taste neutralising or even overriding the satiation and satiety signals (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Black et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Blundell and Hill, 1986</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Holt et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">King et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Flavour perception is the combination of multisensory modalities, of which aroma and taste are the two primary drivers (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Auvray and Spence, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 2015</xref>). Taste or aroma does not only affect the perceived flavour as an independent modality, but the combination of taste and aroma can also change both the intensity and quality of the perceived flavour as a result cross-modal association (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 2015</xref>). Congruent taste and aroma modalities, when presented together, increased the perceived flavour intensity more than the sum of the independent taste and aroma (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Hewson et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfeiffer et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Aroma-taste cross-modal association was supported by neural imaging studies. Overlapping areas in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been shown to be activated by taste or aroma modality (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rolls, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Small et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Small et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), whereas a lateral anterior region of the OFC was activated only by the combination of aroma and taste but not by a single aroma or taste modality (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">de Araujo, Rolls, Kringelbach, McGlone, &#x00026; Phillips, 2003</xref>). Potentially, aroma and taste do not only affect appetite and food intake independently but also as a synergistic combination of both modalities. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Warwick, Hall, Pappas, and Schiffman (1993)</xref> reported that the combination of vanilla aroma and aspartame in a meal decreased the subsequent hunger sensation, compared with a nutritionally same but unflavoured meal. However, the effect of the combination of aroma and taste modalities, in comparison to the independent effect of aroma or taste modality, on appetite sensation and food intake has not been reported previously, as far as the authors are aware.</p><p>The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the impact of aroma and taste, independently and in combination, on appetite sensation and subsequent food intake. A flavoured drink model was constructed with different combinations of strawberry aroma and taste substances (sucrose and citric acid). Appetite sensation was evaluated during and after consumption, and food intake at the next meal measured. Sucrose and citric acid may interact with some aroma at a physicochemical level, resulting in changes in the aroma delivery to the nasal cavity. Therefore, the atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) was used to measure any change in the in-vivo strawberry aroma release which may influence appetite sensation and food intake (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, Linforth, Harvey, &#x00026; Blake, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design for evaluating appetite sensation and subsequent pasta intake</title><p>The study was a single-blind, randomised crossover experiment. A &#x0201c;preloading paradigm&#x0201d; was used to investigate the effects of aroma and taste, independently and in combination, in a liquid preload, on self-reported appetite sensation and subsequent pasta meal intake. Water without any taste or aroma substances was used as a control preload in parallel to the three sample drinks.

The study was explained to all participants who were given the opportunity to ask questions. All participants signed written informed consent prior to participation.

Each participant completed all the four sample drink conditions on 4 separate days during their luteal phases (days 18&#x02013;25 of a menstrual cycle) over 2 to 3 menstrual cycles. This was to minimise the differences in their appetite status across different phases of the menstrual cycle (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hirschberg, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Between any two session days, there was a time interval of at least 3 days. At least 24&#x000a0;h prior to each visit, participants were required to refrain from intense exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption and any medication including the oral contraceptive pills (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Astbury, Taylor, &#x00026; Macdonald, 2011</xref>). They were also instructed to eat the same self-chosen dinner on the evening before each session day, between 20.00 and 21.00&#x000a0;h. Participants were then required to fast until arriving in the laboratory the next morning. Water consumption was permitted while fasting.</p><p>On each of the four test sessions, participants arrived at the laboratory at 08.45&#x000a0;h. Participants were requested to remove heavy shoes or clothing, and their body weight and height were assessed. Baseline appetite sensation was reported at 09.00&#x000a0;h using the Visual Analogues Scales (VAS). Each participant was then provided with a standardised breakfast to consume within 20&#x000a0;min. At 11.00&#x000a0;h, participants were provided with one of the four sample drinks to consume over a 15&#x000a0;min period.

At 12.20&#x000a0;h (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;min), participants were served a pasta meal to consume freely, until they felt comfortably full. Unlimited water was allowed during the pasta meal. No other food or drink consumption was permitted. Participants were required to stay quietly in a waiting room, when not required to undertake study-related activities.

Compared with S1 (water), S2 (aroma) and S3 (taste), the drink containing both aroma and taste (S4) induced a greater satiation effect, as indicated by a greater reduction in the hunger sensation over the 15&#x000a0;min sample drink consumption period (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5, 10 and 15&#x000a0;min). S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) also induced satiety (hunger suppression) more than S1 (water) at 5, 20 and 30&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20, 35 and 45&#x000a0;min), more than S2 (aroma) at 5 and 20&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20 and 35&#x000a0;min), and more than S3 at 5&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;min). Subsequent pasta energy intake, 65&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;min), did not differ between the sample drinks with an independent aroma or taste stimuli, with the combination of both and the water control.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that sucrose was used in this study rather than non-nutritive sweeteners. Non-nutritive sweeteners like stevia, saccharin or aspartame, have secondary taste attributes or aftertastes, such as bitterness and metallic taste (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Chandrashekar et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Such secondary taste or aftertastes may reduce the palatability/acceptance of the sample drinks, and they are not congruent to the strawberry aroma, both of which are likely to affect the study results and conclusion. Sucrose was chosen as it provided a pure and clean sweet taste that is congruent to the strawberry aroma, however, it contains 4&#x000a0;kcal&#x022c5;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> energy. In the current study, S3 (taste, 48&#x000a0;kcal) did not affect appetite sensation and subsequent pasta meal energy intake differently from S1 (water, 0&#x000a0;kcal) or S2 (aroma, 0&#x000a0;kcal), suggesting neither the energy difference (48&#x000a0;kcal) nor the addition of taste or aroma alone had major impact on appetite sensation and subsequent food intake. Energy in liquid beverages seems difficult to be perceived by the human body and the liquid energy often failed to induce satiation and satiety compared with the energy in solid foods, especially when the energy content is relatively low (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Almiron-Roig et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Drewnowski and Bellisle, 2007</xref>). Participants did not compensate for the small energy difference (48&#x000a0;kcal) between the sample drinks at the subsequent meal. This is in line with previous literature showing that adult participants do not compensate for the energy in a sucrose preload by eating less at the subsequent meal, when the sucrose preload was smaller than 50&#x000a0;g (200&#x000a0;kcal) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Woodend, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Birch and Deysher, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The combination of sugar and citric acid (taste) had no noticeable effect on the self-reported appetite sensation and subsequent food intake. Sugars have been shown to reduce hunger and increase fullness through their sweet taste and energy content (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Woodend, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lavin and Read, 2000</xref>) and may stimulate hunger and food intake via their enhancement on a food's palatability (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Holt et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). However, little is known about the effects of citric acid and its sourness on appetite sensation and food intake. Further investigations can be done to understand the independent effect of citric acid and the interaction of sucrose and citric acid on hunger sensation and food intake.</p><p>Aroma stimuli alone in water (S2) did not affect the self-reported appetite sensation at any time point over the study period and the subsequent pasta energy intake when compared with the water control (S1). Retronasal strawberry aroma delivery has been shown to increase the subjective feeling of satiation, but this effect was observed with the simultaneous delivery of sweet taste from a milk drink (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ruijschop et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The retronasal aroma in drink S2 (aroma) was delivered in water without the presence of a noticeable taste stimuli. It may be that retronasal aroma only induces satiation when presented with a congruent taste.</p><p>The combination of aroma and taste in a sample drink reduced the sensation of hunger to a greater extent than the independent aroma or taste in a drink over the 15&#x000a0;min sample drink consumption period and until at least 5&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed. One may suspect that an increase in the aroma release from S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) as a result of the aroma-taste physiochemical interaction might have contributed to the greater satiation effect (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ruijschop et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). However, this was not the case in the current study. APCI-MS analysis of in-vivo strawberry aroma release showed that there was no significant difference in the release of strawberry aroma between S2 (aroma) and S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste). This indicated that citric acid or sucrose did not affect the physical chemistry of the strawberry aroma release. This is in agreement with the current literature that noticeable physicochemical interactions between aroma and taste only appear at relatively high concentrations of both (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Friel et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfeiffer et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The observed difference in hunger sensation between the sample drink conditions does not seem to be caused by the difference in energy content nor the palatability because S3 (taste) and S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste), sharing the same energy content (48&#x000a0;kcal) and similarly liking ratings, affected the hunger sensation differently. Instead, the difference in the hunger sensation was more likely to result from the difference in flavour perception between the sample drinks. S4 (taste and aroma) was perceived as the most intense in the perceived overall flavour, and it also suppressed hunger sensation more than S1 (water), S2 (aroma) and S3 (taste) over the sample drink consumption period and for a short time after the sample drink was consumed. This suggests that adding the two modalities, aroma and taste, together to a drink reduced the hunger sensation to a greater extent than the independent aroma or taste, potentially via increasing the overall perceived flavour intensity of the drink. Increasing the perceived intensity of a flavour modality (aroma or taste) has been shown to enhance satiation and reduce food intake (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Bolhuis et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ruijschop et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Increasing the perceived flavour intensity may result in an increase in the overall oral sensory exposure which has been shown to reduce food intake (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Bolhuis et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">de Wijk et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Viskaal-van Dongen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, the observed greater hunger suppression effect of the combined aroma and taste than the independent aroma or taste, may not only be due to a quantitative increase in the flavour intensity but also due to a qualitative change in the flavour quality and complexity as a result of aroma-taste cross-modal perception. In a previous study, when strawberry aroma, citric acid and sucrose were presented in a drink, participants perceived the flavour of the drink as more intense than the sum intensity of strawberry aroma, citric acid and sucrose presented alone (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfeiffer et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the current study, the combination of aroma (strawberry aroma) and taste (citric acid&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;sucrose) probably resulted in something more than the sum perception of aroma and taste. APCI-MS analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the release of aroma volatiles from the drink to the nose due to the presence of taste substances (sucrose&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;citric acid). This suggested that the cognitive process of aroma and taste association, rather than a physiochemical interaction between aroma and taste, might have contributed to the observed hunger suppression. The cross-modal association of aroma and taste results in a more complex flavour perception (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Auvray &#x00026; Spence, 2008</xref>). Increasing the complexity of retronasal aroma has been reported to enhance satiation. Participants felt more satiated when consuming a yoghurt with a multi-component strawberry aroma (more complex), compared with the same yoghurt with a single-component strawberry aroma of the similar intensity.</p><p>Based on the current study, whether the hunger sensation was reduced as a result of a simple addition of aroma and taste intensities, or due to a change in the perceived flavour quality via cross-modal association is inconclusive. Future experiments could be carried out to further examine this hypothesis. For example, the perceived overall flavour intensity and the palatability of a drink containing a single modality (aroma or taste) could be kept the same as the flavour intensity of a drink containing both aroma and taste modalities, when comparing their effect on appetite sensation and food intake. Alternatively the effect of an incongruent aroma-taste combination on appetite sensation could be studied in comparison to a congruent aroma-taste combination with the similar flavour intensity and palatability. Because the cross-modal association between aroma and taste depends on the congruency of aroma and taste, and non-congruent aroma and taste do not show the same perceptual association that affects the flavour quality.</p><p>The mechanism behind the finding that the addition of more flavour modalities reduced hunger sensation is unknown. It may be due to the combination of physiological and psychological mechanisms. Adding flavour modalities may reduce hunger sensation by influencing the hormonal signals for satiation or satiety. <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Massolt et&#x000a0;al. (2010)</xref> reported that participants felt less hungry and more satiated after tasting or smelling chocolate compared with the control which involved no tasting nor smelling, and this correlated with a decrease in the blood ghrelin level. In addition, in the current study, participants might be consciously aware of the distinctly different flavour characteristics between the sample drinks. It is likely that participants might have some cognitive belief or expectation about the satiating effect of the sample drinks, which contributed to the difference in appetite sensation, to some extent. The greater reduction in the hunger sensation from a drink with more flavour modalities, hence more intense and complex flavour, might be driven by a learned association (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gibson &#x00026; Brunstrom, 2007</xref>). Participants may have gradually learnt that food with more intense or complex flavour profile may be more nutritionally rich, and therefore, more satiating. Further investigation is required to explain the mechanism behind the study finding and to investigate whether the effects that have been noted are sustained at a similar level over repeated exposure.</p><p>Compared with the water control, the sample drink S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) reduced the hunger sensation over the 15&#x000a0;min sample drink consumption period (satiation) and continued to suppress the hunger sensation until 30&#x000a0;min (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45&#x000a0;min) after the sample drink consumption (satiety). However, this did not result in a significant reduction in the subsequent pasta meal intake. This may be because the difference in appetite sensation ratings was not significantly different between the sample drink conditions immediately before the subsequent pasta meal (t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;min). If the time interval between the sample drink preload and the subsequent pasta meal is shortened, a significant reduction in subsequent meal energy intake might occur under the S4 (aroma&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;taste) condition compared with the water control.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taste or aroma stimuli presented alone in a drink preload neither influenced satiation nor satiety, as measured by the appetite sensation and subsequent pasta meal energy intake, compared with the water control. The combination of aroma and taste in a drink induced greater satiation (hunger suppression) than the water control and the drink with the independent aroma or taste. The combination of aroma and taste in a drink briefly further enhanced satiety (hunger suppression) compared with the water control (at 5, 20 and 30&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed), the drink with only aroma (at 5 and 20&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed) and the drink with only taste (at 5&#x000a0;min after the sample drink was consumed). A quantitative increase in the perceived flavour intensity and a qualitative enhancement of the perceived flavour quality as a result of cross-modal association may have contributed to the observed hunger suppression effect of the drink with both aroma and taste. However, subsequent pasta meal energy intake did not differ between the drinks that varied with respect to the presence of aroma and taste stimuli. This study suggests that cross modal flavour enhancement (without the addition of extra energy) may facilitate the development of food or drinks that contribute to the reduction of hunger.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group
