early childhood. It is caused by non-progressive damage to the developing brain before,
during, or shortly after birth. Spastic CP is the most common form of CP (accounting for
approximately 70&#x02013;80% of cases of CP) and 50% of children with spastic CP have diplegia. In
spastic diplegic CP, the lower extremities are severely affected but the upper extremities
are only mildly impaired, intelligence is usually normal, and epilepsy is not common<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with CP have neurodevelopmental
disorders, such as spasticity, contracture, reduced coordination, selective voluntary
control, and muscle weakness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among
these, muscle weakness is a major motor problem for children with CP<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle weakness is more pronounced distally and the hip extensors,
knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors are relatively weaker than their antagonists<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscle strength and resistance training programs have been used as therapeutic
interventions to increase muscle strength and to improve muscle function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.

for this study. The children were both inpatients &#x00026; outpatients coming for
rehabilitation to the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH), Yangon, Myanmar. The inclusion
criteria were: ages between 4 and 12&#x02005;years (mean age: 6.07 &#x000b1; 2.74&#x02005;years); GMFCS levels I and
II, with the muscle tone of hip and knee extensors lower than grade +1 of the Modified
Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the ability to follow verbal commands. Children were excluded if
they: (i) had received a nerve block injection or orthopedic surgery; (ii) had hip and/or
knee flexion contracture greater than 10 degrees; or (iii) had unstable seizures and other
medical conditions.

Medical Technology, Yangon (UMTY), Myanmar. All subjects and parents/caregivers received
explanations regarding the purpose and procedures of the study before voluntarily agreeing
to participate. All parents/caregivers were required to give written informed consent for
participation before the start of the study procedures, and were reminded that they had the
right to withdraw from the study at any time. All subjects in the study were able to
continue their usual therapy at the NRH.</p><p>The study design was one group pretest-posttest design. All forty children in this study

could lift in one time, GMFM dimension D and E were assessed at baseline before the start of
training program and after the completion of six weeks training program. All forty subjects
were given strength-training program, which included progressive resistance hip and knee
extension one session (45 minutes) per day, three times a week for total six weeks. The
intervention procedure involved passive stretching of hip flexors, adductors, hamstrings,
triceps surae for 15 minutes as warm-up. The main exercise, extension exercise for both hip
and knee extensors with weight cuff, was done ten times for each muscle group on each side
for 30 minutes. For hip extensors, the subject was lying prone, the weight cuff was placed
just above knee joint and the subject was asked to lift the thigh with weight to full
extension. The subject was lying supine with knees slightly bent, a foam roll or a pillow
was placed under knees, the weight cuff was placed just above ankle joint and the subject
was asked to lift the lower leg with weight to full extension for knee extensors. The
intervention procedure was finished with passive stretching of hip flexors, adductors,
hamstrings, triceps surae for 15 minutes as cool-down. The intervention procedure is shown

The strength-training program was performed 10 repetitions for each muscle group on
each side, one session per day for three days per week up to 6 consecutive weeks. A daily
diary of physical activity of each subject was kept by the parents or caregivers during the
study period. After 6 consecutive weeks training program, the subject was discharged. The
parents or caregivers of each subject were requested to ask the subject to perform the same
main exercise program at home by the guidance of a written home exercise program. All
subjects were requested to visit the study area at once per every 2 weeks up to 6 weeks
(three times) as follow up. This study was firstly proposed to assess all outcome measures
at the end of 6 weeks training and at the end of 6 weeks follow up (total 12 weeks) but
there were only 7 subjects who were able to come all three times of follow up. More than 75%
of the subjects were not able to completely come all three times of follow up because most
of the subjects in this study were from suburbs of Yangon and other rural areas of Myanmar.

extensors and knee extensors improves gross motor function of children with spastic diplegic
CP (GMFCS level I &#x00026; II) in Myanmar. The results of this study supported the
effectiveness of prescribing strength-training program on hip and knee extensor muscle
groups of lower limbs in patients with spastic diplegic CP as a method to enhance their
functional abilities and to increase their gross motor function. After 6 consecutive weeks
of strength-training program, the subjects were found to achieve increased mean values of
maximum weight for training for all muscle groups and GMFM dimension D and E. Many studies
reported that muscle strength and gross motor function activities significantly improved
after strength-training program. Domiano et al. reported that children with spastic diplegia
increased quadriceps femoris muscle strength through heavy resistance exercise, three times
per week for 6 weeks using ankle weights at load of approximately 65% of each child&#x02019;s
maximum isotonic force production<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. MacPhail &#x00026; Kramer stated that there was
a direct relationship between knee extensor strength and gross motor ability, which meant
improvement in muscular strength, was associated with improvement in walking efficiency and
functional abilities in adolescents with CP<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Functional outcomes of
strength training in spastic cerebral palsy by Domiano and Abel, the results of their study
reinforced the relationship of strength to motor function in children with CP and further
demonstrated the effectiveness of strengthening in this population<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the randomized clinical trial of strength training in
young people with cerebral palsy by Dodd et al., home-based, 6 weeks strength training
program on knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors was effective in increasing muscle
strength and GMFM-D and E of young people (mean age 13&#x02005;years 1 month, SD 3years 1 month:
range 8 to 18&#x02005;years) with spastic diplegic CP (GMFCS level I to III)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dodd et al. also reported that strength training programs
could increase strength and may improve motor activity in people with CP without adverse
effects in their study of a systematic review of the effectiveness of strength training
programs for people with CP<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A pilot
study using repeated measure design of the effects of progressive resistance training for
children with CP by Morton et al. also found that muscle strength and GMFM dimension D and E
increased immediately after 6 weeks training program using free weights<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, all subjects exhibited increased muscle strength (increased amount of
training weight in pounds) and GMFM dimension D and E from baseline to the certain extent
until the end of 6 weeks strength training program. Although this study was first proposed
to assess the outcomes measures at the end of 6 weeks training and at the end of 6 weeks
follow up (total 12 weeks) but there were only 7 subjects who were able to come all three
times of follow up and the result of those 7 subjects were not calculated in the results.
The results of the present study supported the effectiveness of prescribing strength
training program on muscles of lower limbs in patients with spastic diplegic CP as a method
to enhance their functional abilities and to increase their gross motor function. The
current physical therapy program including strength training program was as effective as the
previous studies, but with much shorter time and utilized unsophisticated and inexpensive
equipment which was available in the most of the Physiotherapy Departments in our country.
Therefore, the adoption of this regime into clinical practice was feasible. The limitations
of this study were absence of control group, not using standardized assessment of muscle
strength, not using GMFM-66 with gross motor ability estimator (GMAE) software, not
involving other physiologic types of CP and presence of weakness that the subjects were able
to take usual therapies from the NRH that might have influenced the outcome measures. In
conclusion, the results of this study suggested that a simple method of strength training
program might lead to improve muscle strength and gross motor function in children with
spastic diplegic CP. This simple methodology could provide powerful motivation to these
patients group to encourage more active lifestyle and allow increased activity and
participation within family and community settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our sincere thanks to all subjects and their families for their
