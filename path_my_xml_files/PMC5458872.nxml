Sleep is an essential aspect of daily life for which occupational therapy services may be warranted (<xref rid="bibr15-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Green and Hicks, 2015</xref>), and there is a great need to expand the profession&#x02019;s understanding of sleep-related interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective at reducing insomnia symptom severity, including in populations with comorbid conditions (such as posttraumatic stress and depression); however, there is a lack of professionals qualified to deliver the intervention (<xref rid="bibr28-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).

United States military personnel have been engaged in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq since October 2001, and many have returned with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, pain, and anxiety, which commonly co-occur with insomnia in veterans (<xref rid="bibr33-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Pietrzak et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Troxel et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Sleep disturbance is the most frequently reported symptom of PTSD, occurring in as many as 90% of cases, and is associated with increased nighttime sleep disruptions such as nightmares, which in turn can exacerbate PTSD symptoms (<xref rid="bibr17-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).

Researchers have developed substantial empirical support for multicomponent CBT-I as an effective treatment for insomnia (<xref rid="bibr13-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Geiger-Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), and it is demonstrated to be effective in the presence of comorbid conditions such as PTSD, depression, pain, and anxiety (<xref rid="bibr27-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber and Carney, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).

Yet there have been no studies which have evaluated the delivery of CBT-I to veterans with service-connected injuries in the context of a college environment, despite calls for the study of CBT-I within community-based settings (<xref rid="bibr46-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Vitiello et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Occupational therapists are concerned with sleep as a cornerstone of health and wellbeing, and an important consideration for practice and research. Also, it has been suggested that CBT-I is within the profession&#x02019;s scope of practice given the nonpharmacological and behavioral nature of this approach for managing insomnia (<xref rid="bibr1-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">AOTA, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Leland et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

Feasibility and pilot study work is common preparation for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).

In general, a feasibility study assesses whether the study and all of the components can be completed, and whether the researchers should proceed with the line of inquiry. The accompanying pilot study used to assess feasibility may be a non-randomized study, which may support future randomized and/or larger studies. A non-randomized pilot study may include testing an intervention, but participants are not randomized to a control or intervention group. The current study was a feasibility study that included a non-randomized pilot study (Eldridge et&#x000a0;al., 2016) in which we documented indicators of: process (for example recruitment and retention rates); resources (for example physical capacity and time to deliver REST); management (for example inter-departmental collaboration and data management); and scientific aspects (for example treatment effects, safety, and participant satisfaction) using the recommendations of <xref rid="bibr41-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Thabane et&#x000a0;al.

Firstly, group intervention can be therapeutic via establishing the cohesiveness of the group, instilling hope, and allowing for interpersonal learning (<xref rid="bibr8-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Dopke et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Falk-Kessler et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>). Secondly, veterans often face difficulties with campus integration, in large part due to their unique backgrounds and experiences when compared to traditional college students (<xref rid="bibr9-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Eakman et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, a group approach could allow for the development of a sense of comradery and peer support throughout program delivery. Thirdly, group CBT-I has demonstrated promise as an effective method for treating insomnia comorbid with mental health conditions such as depression in veterans (<xref rid="bibr8-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Dopke et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Perlman et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The 1:1 occupational therapy was included within REST because 1:1 intervention is the gold standard in the delivery of CBT-I for chronic insomnia (<xref rid="bibr31-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Perlis et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><sec id="sec7-0308022617691538"><title>Group sessions</title><p>The team developed the seven group intervention sessions using the sleep workbook (<xref rid="bibr4-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Carney and Manber, 2009</xref>), supporting literature (<xref rid="bibr27-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber and Carney, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Perlis et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), and clinical reasoning. The group sessions were delivered by a registered and licensed occupational therapist who had received advanced training in multicomponent CBT-I. Group sessions included didactic education delivered with PowerPoint presentations addressing sleep architecture, models of insomnia, sleep drive, circadian rhythm, stimulus control, sleep restriction, nightmares and image rehearsal techniques, sleep beliefs, constructive worrying, and sleep hygiene. Group discussions addressed these topics, emphasizing dysfunctional sleep beliefs and the role of meaningful activity for improving sleep. Additionally, each session started and ended with a meditation practice, led by a yoga therapist and mindfulness expert. Meditation was included weekly because it is linked to relaxation and stress reduction, allowing for better sleep (<xref rid="bibr47-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Winbush et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Each participant was provided with a copy of the <xref rid="bibr4-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Carney and Manber (2009)</xref> sleep workbook and assigned weekly readings from the book.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-0308022617691538"><title>Sleep diary</title><p>Each individual was required to record their sleep on a daily basis in line with best practice standards for CBT-I (<xref rid="bibr31-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Perlis et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Participants recorded their daily sleep starting two weeks prior to the intervention. This was done electronically as each participant received a daily email with a link to their electronic sleep diary, which included questions based upon consensus sleep diary recommendations (<xref rid="bibr5-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Carney et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Key sleep diary variables were: time in bed; time individual tried to sleep; amount of time it took to fall asleep; number of awakenings per night and total duration of awakenings; last awakening; time out of bed; alcohol and caffeine use. Daily sleep diary data were then used to calculate variables such as total time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). This allowed the occupational therapist to work with each participant during 1:1 sessions to enhance adherence to sleep prescription (that is, sleep restriction therapy). Additionally, all participants received a commercially available electronic activity monitor (Fitbit Flex) and were encouraged to wear it daily throughout the intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="sec9-0308022617691538"><title>Individual occupational therapist-led CBT-I (1:1 occupational therapy)</title><p>Each participant was scheduled to meet weekly for eight weeks with a registered and licensed occupational therapist who had also received advanced training in CBT-I. These sessions differed substantially from the group occupational therapy sessions in that they were used to develop, monitor, and reach personalized sleep-related goals based upon sleep restriction and stimulus control therapies and sleep hygiene recommendations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0308022617691538">Table 2</xref>). A component unique to the 1:1 occupational therapy sessions includes calculating SE to monitor an individual&#x02019;s progress, and for the occupational therapist to use in clinical reasoning for adjustments in weekly sleep restriction therapy (SRT) goals. SE was calculated as (TST/TIB) &#x000d7; 100, and indicates the percentage of time an individual was actually asleep (TST) while in bed (TIB) based upon weekly averages. Additionally, 1:1 occupational therapy sessions were used for: goal setting around stimulus control and sleep hygiene; discussing participant-specific daily routines used for building sleep drive and adhering to stimulus control; brainstorming ideas to stay awake and to arise at the set wake time in adhering to SRT; and addressing personal issues not appropriate for the group sessions. The occupational therapist who led the group sessions and the occupational therapist who provided 1:1 support met weekly to discuss issues related to participants&#x02019; progress. Consultation in reviews of participants&#x02019; response to treatment was obtained from a clinical psychologist with extensive expertise in CBT-I delivered to veterans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10-0308022617691538"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Two baseline assessments of the outcome variables (Baseline 1 and Baseline 2) were collected one week apart immediately prior to delivery of the REST pilot intervention.

In total, a convenience sample of eight veterans, which was deemed an ideal number for facilitating an effective group process, completed the baseline assessments and seven completed the intervention and post-assessments. On average, participants who completed the intervention attended 5.9 of the seven group sessions and 6.8 of the eight total 1:1 occupational therapy sessions. Missed classes were due to schedule conflicts. The online data collection tools and processes (for example Qualtrics for daily online sleep diary, pre- and post-test assessments) and data analytic software were sufficient for data collection, use in 1:1 occupational therapy sessions to monitor response to treatment, and analyses of treatment effects.

However, one participant dropped out of the study due to poor adherence and attendance. A second participant disclosed a diagnosis of bipolar disorder; SRT was withheld from this participant due to increased risk of a manic episode (<xref rid="bibr27-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber and Carney, 2015</xref>). All other participants were able to successfully complete all aspects of the intervention and engage in both the group occupational therapy and 1:1 occupational therapy.</p><p>In regard to the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure employed during 1:1 occupational therapy, participants on average showed a total increase of 8.50 in performance across the five areas of occupation and a total increase of 6.86 in satisfaction with performance across the same five areas. Of all occupations, sleep performance improvements (4.00) and sleep satisfaction improvements (5.14) were greatest. All participants who completed the intervention indicated they were &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; with group sessions, individual sessions, and the REST program overall.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec16-0308022617691538"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present feasibility and pilot study indicates that REST, a sleep improvement program based upon multicomponent CBT-I and led by occupational therapists, is feasible to deliver within a college setting and capable of reducing insomnia symptom severity in military veterans with service-connected injuries. Feasibility was evaluated in line with recommendations from <xref rid="bibr41-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Thabane et&#x000a0;al. (2010)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr42-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Tickle-Degnen (2013)</xref> to assess for successful implementation of prospective intervention studies and to reduce threats to the validity of those studies. One key process indicator of feasibility is adequate recruitment, because it ensures participant characteristics and sample sizes sufficient for future study implementation. Recruitment in the present study was facilitated because a majority of REST participants were receiving services through the New Start for Student Veterans (NSSV) program (<xref rid="bibr9-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Eakman et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), a post-secondary supported education program for veterans with service-connected injuries housed in the university&#x02019;s occupational therapy department, and all authors were affiliated with the department. Also, the NSSV program has affiliations with other university-based veteran service providers and veteran-related programs in the community at large, which facilitated recruitment. Together, these factors offer a relatively high level of assurance for successful recruitment in future REST interventions.</p><p>Program attendance and ability to complete the REST intervention was on par with other studies delivering CBT-I to veterans. Our withdrawal rate was 12.5%, which compares favorably to withdrawal rates in veteran clinical samples, ranging from 20% to 24% (<xref rid="bibr32-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Perlman et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Trockel et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The intervention resulted in no adverse events, indicating its relative safety within the sample under study. Unique to the present study, however, was the delivery of the intervention to veterans with service-connected injuries in a community-based university setting utilizing both group and individual occupational therapist-led CBT-I. The prevalence of mTBI and PTSD in the present sample, in addition to accommodating varied class schedules, added a level of challenge in assuring group occupational therapy and 1:1 occupational therapy service delivery. Meeting reminders sent by electronic text messaging, flexibility in rescheduling 1:1 occupational therapy meetings, and weekly face-to-face reminders appeared to be useful in garnering a high level of attendance for those who completed REST across the eight weeks of implementation. Participant report of satisfaction with the program was also relatively high, indicating the combined group and 1:1 occupational therapy approach was well received as delivered, and therefore future interventions based upon the REST model could expect completion rates comparable to the present study.</p><p>An electronic daily sleep diary was developed exclusively for the present study and allowed for email invitations to be sent each morning to participants&#x02019; smart-phones and home computers to complete daily sleep diaries. This, in combination with manual reviews of daily sleep diary completion rates twice per week, with an additional email prompt for diary completion when indicated, appeared to result in very few days of missed sleep diary data, and therefore enabled effective monitoring and progress of SRT within weekly 1:1 occupational therapy sessions. Beyond this, use of an internet-based survey tool to collect pretest and posttest outcome data provided automated reminder prompts, resulting in no missing data.</p><p>In sum, the adequacy of REST pilot processes, resources, and management enabled effective program delivery and afforded reliable data in determining that the REST intervention may be capable of reducing insomnia symptom severity in veterans with service-connected injuries. Notably, the large majority of REST participants in the sample indicated the presence of mTBI, PTSD, and/or orthopedic injuries associated with military service. Furthermore, participants on average reported probable PTSD based upon the PCL-C-6 and probable moderate depression based upon the PHQ-9 at the outset of REST, indicating the presence of significant mental health issues as comorbid conditions associated with their chronic insomnia. This finding was anticipated given that elevated insomnia symptom severity in veterans is often associated with service-connected injuries and persisting mental health complaints (<xref rid="bibr48-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Wright et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The scientific aspects of the REST intervention were most favorable, including very large treatment effect sizes in both subjective assessments of insomnia (MOS-Sleep and PROMIS-SD) when comparing pretest to posttest data. Subjective assessments of sleep difficulties are recommended as indicators of treatment efficacy within CBT-I studies because they reflect subjective complaints associated with insomnia such as difficulties falling asleep and maintaining sleep (<xref rid="bibr13-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Geiger-Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). MOS-Sleep baseline scores indicated the presence of severe insomnia, whereas baseline PROMIS-SD <italic>T</italic>-scores indicated participants&#x02019; sleep complaints were one standard deviation higher than found in in the general population. Following the completion of REST, participants on average fell below the clinical threshold for insomnia in the case of MOS-Sleep and below the national average for sleep complaints in the case of PROMIS-SD, indicating substantial reductions in insomnia symptom severity. The very large effect sizes evidenced by MOS-Sleep and PROMIS-SD also indicate that as few as 10 participants per condition could be sufficient for detecting a treatment effect within a controlled trial using these indicators.</p><p>Sleep disturbances associated with PTSD are of significant concern for veterans due to the high incidence of PTSD and associated nightmares which are characteristic of this population (<xref rid="bibr17-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Within the present study, a medium effect size in PTSD-related sleep disturbances as assessed by the PSQI-A was found, indicating the REST intervention may serve a role in decreasing sleep disturbing factors such as nightmares, nighttime terrors, panic, and anxiety. Though participants in our study were briefly exposed to information on image rehearsal therapy for nightmares, it is likely that the combined use of stimulus control and SRT employed as part of REST&#x02019;s approach to multicomponent CBT-I was the more salient factor given findings of CBT-I&#x02019;s efficacy in reducing nightmares (<xref rid="bibr27-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Manber and Carney, 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, we are unable to identify the relative contributions of each component of the REST intervention, an issue common to multicomponent CBT-I studies (<xref rid="bibr46-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Vitiello et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Of the sleep-related outcome measures, REST participants demonstrated the greatest improvement in their dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.20). Dysfunctional sleep beliefs are associated with the development and perpetuation of insomnia in both behavioral and cognitive models of chronic insomnia (<xref rid="bibr3-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Carney and Edinger, 2006</xref>). Sleep beliefs within behavioral models are posited to motivate behaviors that can worsen insomnia, such as taking naps to make up for lost sleep. Naps are viewed within the military, however, as a critical tool for maintaining service members&#x02019; operational readiness in the face of extended periods of sleep loss (<xref rid="bibr44-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Troxel et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and this was therefore a belief REST participants endorsed highly at the onset of treatment.</p><p>Within cognitive models of insomnia, beliefs that a poor night&#x02019;s sleep will result in poor functioning the next day can lead to sleep-related anxiety, thereby extending sleep onset latency and decreasing total sleep time. A substantial component of REST was challenging and reframing dysfunctional sleep beliefs through ongoing group education and discussions and 1:1 occupational therapy goal setting and monitoring. We believe this emphasis played an instrumental role in veterans&#x02019; beneficial response to REST. Nonetheless, future study is needed to determine if reframing dysfunctional sleep beliefs in veterans serves a mediating role in the effectiveness of multicomponent CBT-I. Also, it will be important to discern if the combination of group and 1:1 CBT-I was a significant factor in generating the very large effect size found in the present study.</p><p>Unique to the present study was the assessment of occupational performance using PROMIS measures and the COPM. These indicators of participation reflect a broader range of daily life activities than the insomnia-related outcomes. A large effect size was found in participants&#x02019; ability to participate in social roles and activities (such as leisure, family, and work activities), indicating REST may have been of benefit to participants in this regard. Though trends towards improvement were seen in satisfaction with participation in social roles and pain interference, these indicators did not achieve statistical significance. One explanation may be that we adopted the four-item short versions of these measures, and therefore the scores may be limited in their sensitivity to change. Future testing of the REST intervention should benefit from longer (for example, eight-item) or computer-adapted test versions of these assessments, as well as increasing the size of the sample under study to detect a treatment response.</p><sec id="sec17-0308022617691538"><title>Limitations and lessons learned</title><p>A limitation of the present study is that we did not have direct access to participants&#x02019; medical records and therefore relied solely on self-report in terms of medication use. There were two participants who indicated a physician-prescribed medication change during REST. Though those medications are not indicated in the treatment of insomnia, we cannot rule out medication change as a possible factor influencing treatment effects upon insomnia in the two cases.</p><p>Feasibility and pilot studies are done to support the preparation of future larger randomized trials to determine the efficacy and then effectiveness of the intervention (<xref rid="bibr10-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Eldridge et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). From the current pilot study, we did identify processes we intend to modify in planning for a controlled clinical trial. Firstly, we will incorporate a structured approach to weekly mindfulness training, encourage daily practice, and embed an item within the online daily sleep diary to monitor mindfulness practice. Secondly, we will modify the daily sleep diary by trimming some content (such as caffeine use) and incorporate mid-day and evening reminders to better ensure timely sleep diary completion. Thirdly, we will build in additional time before and after group sessions to allow for unstructured socialization as this appeared to positively affect the group process amongst the veterans. An additional limitation is with regard to the feasibility testing. While we recorded information regarding REST processes, resources, management, and scientific indicators, we did not set a priori criteria to indicate whether or not each item should be identified as feasible or not feasible. Any future study will include such pre-identified criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec18-0308022617691538"><title>Future research</title><p>In addition to the suggestions for future research indicated above, the development and delivery of REST offers avenues for future inquiry. Firstly, given the intimate nature of sleep and sleep-related routines, qualitative research designs could address the ways in which participants&#x02019; significant others might support or hinder adherence to the behavioral changes required for stimulus control and SRT. For example, SRT often requires modifications to participants&#x02019; time to bed, which may affect couples&#x02019; nightly routines. Secondly, REST utilized an eight-week protocol, which is in line with other CBT-I interventions, though this may not be sufficient time to establish an ideal amount of total sleep time for some individuals. An extended CBT-I protocol could therefore be tested. Thirdly, because of page limitations, this paper did not report subjective response to treatment indicators such as TST, SE, sleep onset latency, and wakening after sleep onset, or follow-up indicators of treatment outcomes. Such indicators will be important to report in future publications and to include within controlled clinical trials. Lastly, given occupational therapists&#x02019; concern for sleep difficulties in other populations (such as older adults), additional feasibility and pilot studies are needed in order to develop and test effective sleep-promoting interventions (<xref rid="bibr24-0308022617691538" ref-type="bibr">Leland et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec19-0308022617691538"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This was a single-arm feasibility and pilot study to assess REST, an occupational therapist-led program to reduce insomnia symptom severity in United States post-9/11 veterans with service-connected injuries in college. Pilot study indicators of process, resources, and management were supportive of the feasibility of delivering the REST intervention as a controlled trial. Scientific indicators were favorable, including statistically significant benefits in terms of reduced insomnia symptom severity (MOS-Sleep and PROMIS-SD), reduced nightmares (PSQI-A), fewer dysfunctional sleep beliefs (DBAS-10), and greater ability to participate in social roles and activities (PROMIS-AP), with trends towards improved satisfaction with participation in social roles, reduced pain interference, and improved performance and satisfaction in occupation, especially sleep. Preliminary evidence indicates REST may reduce sleep difficulties and improve participation in US military veterans with service-connected injuries attending college.</p></sec><sec id="sec20-0308022617691538"><title>Key findings</title><p>
