Because subjective responses to drugs may predict drug addiction, identifying alleles that influence acute response may also provide insight into the genetic risk factors for drug abuse. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for the subjective responses to amphetamine in 381 non-drug abusing healthy volunteers. Responses to amphetamine were measured using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We used sparse factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data to ten factors. We identified several putative associations; the strongest was between a positive subjective drug-response factor and a SNP (rs3784943) in the 8<sup>th</sup> intron of cadherin 13 (<italic>CDH13</italic>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.58&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), a gene previously associated with a number of psychiatric traits including methamphetamine dependence. Additionally, we observed a putative association between a factor representing the degree of positive affect at baseline and a SNP (rs472402) in the 1<sup>st</sup> intron of steroid-5-alpha-reductase-&#x003b1;-polypeptide-1 (<italic>SRD5A1</italic>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.53&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), a gene whose protein product catalyzes the rate-limiting step in synthesis of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone. This SNP belongs to an LD-block that has been previously associated with the expression of <italic>SRD5A1</italic> and differences in SRD5A1 enzymatic activity. The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the genetic basis of subjective responses to stimulant drugs using a GWAS approach in a modestly sized sample. Our approach provides a case study for analysis of high-dimensional intermediate pharmacogenomic phenotypes, which may be more tractable than clinical diagnoses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH grants, DA007255 (ABH and MCW), HG006265 (to BEE), HG002585 (to MS), DA02812 (to HdW), and DA021336 and DA024845 (to AAP).

Candidate gene studies are inherently limited in their ability to generate novel hypotheses compared with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the first GWAS for subjective response to acute administration of a drug of abuse in humans, using a laboratory-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design to quantify subjective response to <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine in 381 healthy non-drug abusing participants, and testing for associations with 5.4 million (typed and imputed) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome.</p><p>Our study differs from most published GWAS in its use of complex multi-dimensional phenotypes rather than a binary diagnosis such as drug dependence or abuse. We obtained responses on three questionnaires, administered over six time points, in three sessions, after placebo or one of two doses of drug. Such multi-dimensional &#x0201c;intermediate phenotypes&#x0201d; have many advantages over binary diagnoses. Drug abuse is a heterogeneous phenotype that consists of a series of stages, each influenced by a variety of environmental and genetic factors <xref rid="pone.0042646-Kirisci1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, intermediate phenotypes can be measured under carefully controlled conditions, e.g., laboratory conditions, and may be directly linked to genetic variants and resulting from specific biological processes. For this reason, intermediate phenotypes are hypothesized to show stronger genetic associations than binary diagnoses, potentially allowing for smaller sample sizes <xref rid="pone.0042646-Goldman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For example, a GWAS of electroencephalogram (EEG), which is an intermediate phenotype for brain-related clinical endpoints, reported genome-wide significant associations using just 322 participants <xref rid="pone.0042646-Hodgkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, acute responses to pharmacological perturbations often yield alleles of relatively large effects <xref rid="pone.0042646-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Exclusion criteria were: past year Axis I Disorder, history of mania or psychosis, less than a high-school education, smoking more than ten cigarettes per week, drinking more than three cups of coffee per day, lack of English fluency, or medical contraindication to amphetamine administration. Participants were inexperienced stimulant users: only 24% reported any previous use of stimulants and less than 2% reported 50 or more lifetime uses. Participants were asked to abstain from drugs and alcohol for 24 hours, nicotine for 12 hours and to fast for 12 hours prior to each session. At the start of each session, participants provided urine (ToxCup, Branan Medical Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) and breath samples (Alcosensor III, Intoximeters Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA; piCO+ Smokerlyzer, Bedfont, Rochester, UK) to confirm drug, alcohol and nicotine abstinence, and female participants were tested for pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phenotyping</title><p>Participants completed three randomized 4-hour study sessions, separated by at least 72 hours, during which they received placebo or <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine (10 or 20 mg) under double-blind conditions. They completed questionnaires measuring subjective effects before and 30, 60, 90, 150 and 180 minutes after ingesting the capsule; heart rate and blood pressure were also measured at these times; these procedures have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0042646-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s009">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Subjective responses were measured using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) <xref rid="pone.0042646-Johanson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) <xref rid="pone.0042646-Foltin1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) <xref rid="pone.0042646-Chait1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042646-Lynskey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, 22 phenotypes were obtained in four categories: 1) physiological: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, 2) POMS scales: Friendliness, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Anger, Elation, Confusion, Vigor, 3) DEQ scales: Feel Drug, Feel High, Want More, Like Drug, Dislike Drug, and 4) ARCI scales: Amphetamine, Benzedrine Group (BG), Marijuana, Lysergic Acid (LSD), Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG) and Pentobarbitol-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group (PCAG). Each of these 22 phenotypes was measured at six time points during three sessions (placebo, 10 and 20 mg), totaling 396 phenotypic values for each participant. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Chicago and was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data summarization and dimension reduction</title><p>First we imputed missing phenotype values using probabilistic principal components analysis <xref rid="pone.0042646-Roweis1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042646-Verbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> with five principal components, using the R <xref rid="pone.0042646-R1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> package ppca <xref rid="pone.0042646-Stacklies1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This approach exploits correlations among phenotypes to impute missing values. In the final dataset 98.74% of phenotype values were observed and 1.26% were imputed.</p><p>In addition to the primary outcome phenotypes, several demographic measures were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s004">Table S1</xref>). We examined the correlations between these demographic measures and the outcome phenotypes. We observed strong correlations between age, gender, and BMI and multiple response measures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, we did not see strong correlations between current or past drug use and any of the response measurements in this sample of light drug users. For each outcome phenotype we derived a corrected phenotype by taking the residuals of a linear regression model, using age, sex and BMI as covariates.</p><p>Amphetamine treatment significantly affected most of the phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s005">Table S2</xref>). Exploratory data analyses of each phenotype using both individual data and the mean values showed the expected drug effects across the entire sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), but we observed substantial variability at individual data points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Average phenotypic values obtained at baseline, before the drug was administered (0 min), were similar across the three sessions. Average phenotypic values obtained at the second time point (30 min) typically showed minor drug effects, whereas phenotypic values at each of the remaining time points changed in a dose-dependent manner. Although the mean values at the last four time points were generally consistent with the expected time course (increasing to a peak, and then slowly decreasing) these time-points were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and the differences among these means were generally small compared with the difference from the mean at the 0 time point, particularly in the non-placebo sessions. Therefore, we summarized the six measurements for each phenotype in each session, for each individual, using two numbers: (i) the first time point (0 min), which we refer to as the <italic>baseline</italic> measure; and (ii) the mean of the last four time points (60, 90, 150, 180 min) controlling for the first time point (0 min), which we refer to as the <italic>response</italic> measure. Note that, by construction, these two summary values are uncorrelated.</p><fig id="pone-0042646-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0042646.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Elation (POMS) example phenotype.</title><p>Panel A shows the mean (SEM) scores on the POMS Elation scale at each time point before and after administration of placebo or <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine (10 and 20 mg).

Factor loadings were quite similar using this approach; however, we observed some evidence of early drug effects for some measures in a subset of participants at the 30 minute time point, and thus we chose to omit the 30 minute time point to avoid controlling for drug response.</p><p>The above process yielded a baseline and response measure for each of the 22 phenotypes in each session (placebo, 10 mg, and 20 mg). Next we sought to combine information across sessions and phenotypes to yield a small number of phenotypes that efficiently captured the primary patterns in the whole data; this process is commonly referred to as <italic>dimension reduction</italic>. Combining data across correlated measurements reduces environmental noise and measurement error. We chose to perform dimension reduction using sparse factor analysis (SFA) <xref rid="pone.0042646-Engelhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which is a variant of factor analysis that attempts to improve interpretability of factors (summary measures) by encouraging each factor to be a summary of a small subset of all data points. Because SFA is based on a normal model, we transformed each baseline and response measure to follow the standard normal distribution (using a quantile-quantile transformation) and applied SFA to these transformed data. After experimenting with different numbers of factors we chose eleven factors as providing the most reproducible and interpretable results, yielding an 11 by 381 matrix of measurements. Of the 11 factors identified, one was strongly correlated with age, and so we disregarded that factor for all subsequent analysis. Each of the remaining factors (F1&#x02013;F10, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s002">Figure S2</xref>) captured distinct, and generally interpretable, features of the data. For example, F1 almost exclusively consists of measurements of response from the 10 mg session, and so we refer to this factor as &#x0201c;10 mg response&#x0201d;. Factor F2 is primarily a function of baseline measures of positive affect from all three sessions (e.g., positive loadings on Friendliness, Elation, and Vigor; negative loadings on Anxiety and Confusion), and we refer to this factor as &#x0201c;positive affect at baseline&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s006">Table S3</xref>). Although some factors might be considered better candidates for being influenced by genetic factors than others, we conducted association mapping on all 10 factors since a non-genetic factor should produce null results. The interpretability of factors obtained using SFA compared favorably to alternative dimension reduction techniques such as PCA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s009">Supporting Information S1</xref> for further discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Genotyping and quality control</title><p>DNA was extracted from blood at the General Clinical Research Center at the University of Chicago. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 array at the Functional Genomics Core Facility (Vanderbilt University, Memphis, TN, USA). The arrays were passed through the Affymetrix apt-geno-qc package, and DM call rate, contrast QC metric, and genotypic gender were computed. Genotypes were called with the Birdseed <xref rid="pone.0042646-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and CRLMM <xref rid="pone.0042646-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> algorithms.

Imputation brought the total number of SNPs to 7,573,542 SNPs per individual. We removed SNPs that had a MAF&#x0003c;0.05 in our sample because they had low power to identify associations; this left each individual with 5,476,100 SNPs.

First, to reduce potential problems due to non-normality, each factor was quantile-quantile transformed to a standard normal distribution (<italic>quantile normalized</italic>).

Finally, these residuals were again quantile normalized to form the final 10 factors that were used for association testing.</p><p>We tested for association of each factor with each SNP by linear regression of the factor against SNP genotype. For imputed SNPs and missing genotypes we used the posterior mean genotype <xref rid="pone.0042646-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

None of the SNPs implicated by the above studies were strongly associated with our factors, nor were any of the above-mentioned SNPs in strong LD with rs3784943. Thus, while this gene has attracted significant attention, particularly in the psychiatric genetics literature, these studies have not converged on a single genetic regulator or putative mechanism of regulation for this gene for possibly corresponding phenotypic effects. Intriguingly, it has recently been reported that <italic>CDH13</italic> knockout mice show decreases in conditioned place preference to cocaine (J. Drgonova, SFN abstract <underline>#871.11/D64</underline>), which is highly consistent with a difference in the subjective response to amphetamine that we observed.</p><p>The association between <italic>CDH13</italic> and sensitivity to the subjective effects of amphetamine may provide insight into the mechanism by which an allele influences the risk for drug dependence. Drug dependence develops through many stages, including initial experimentation with drugs, continued use, dependence, withdrawal and relapse <xref rid="pone.0042646-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Genetic variants might influence risk by impacting one or more of these stages <xref rid="pone.0042646-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Whereas a genetic association with the diagnosis of drug dependence provides little insight into which stage is under genetic control, our intermediate phenotype approach suggests that rs3784943 affects magnitude of the initial subjective response to the drug. This would be expected to influence an early stage in the addiction process in which early experimentation with drugs progresses to more frequent drug use. Further studies are needed to assess whether this SNP might also influence the subjective response to other drugs of abuse.</p><p>Our strongest association with a baseline factor was between rs472402 and factor F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Another SNP (rs248797; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042646.s008">Table S5</xref>) that is in strong LD with rs472402 (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.73) has been identified as a <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL for the <italic>SRD5A1</italic> gene in human monocytes <xref rid="pone.0042646-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;19</sup>) and is also in moderate LD (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3&#x02013;0.7) with several SNPs that have been identified as <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs for <italic>SRD5A1</italic> in post-mortem samples from cerebellum and parietal cortex <xref rid="pone.0042646-Gamazon1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>.

Finally, <italic>SRD5A1</italic> has also been suggested as a positional candidate gene based on a linkage study for cocaine dependence and major depressive episode <xref rid="pone.0042646-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Taken together these results suggest that SNPs in <italic>SRD5A1</italic> could influence subjective positive affect by modulating both expression and enzymatic activity of <italic>SRD5A1</italic> and thereby altering allopregnanolone levels in the brain.</p><p>While techniques that aggregate information using dimension reduction are attractive, the results must be both interpretable and biologically meaningful. Our results here illustrate how SFA can yield more interpretable data summaries than other methods, such as PCA, facilitating the systematic aggregation of a large collection of phenotypic information without sacrificing interpretability. Regardless of the dimension reduction technique used to identify putative associations, it is important to examine the raw phenotypes to determine how a given SNP correlates with the underlying phenotypic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In both of the potential associations presented in this study, the phenotypes that loaded onto the factor overlapped well with, but were not identical to, the phenotypes that were influenced by the identified SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042646-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>This study has several strengths and limitations. One limitation is that we used a relatively small number of participants to test a large number of putative predictors (genotypes). Despite the small sample, there is credible evidence that intermediate pharmacogenomic phenotypes might be more likely to have larger effect alleles <xref rid="pone.0042646-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another potential limitation of this study was the use of participants that were not heavy drug abusers and thus might not have been at the highest genetic risk for developing drug abuse. Although our study was based on the idea that genetic variability in a population of healthy young adults is representative of the larger population, it is possible that our ascertainment procedures excluded relevant genetic variants. Similarly, we chose modest doses that were administered orally, whereas drug users typically ingest higher doses with faster routes of administration (intranasal, intravenous, or inhalation). Lastly, differences in drug metabolism may constitute an uncontrolled source of variability. Reducing the complex phenotype data to a small number of baseline and response factors is a strength of our study because baseline differences might otherwise confound our measurement of drug response. We chose to compute associations for factors representing both drug-independent and drug-dependent phenotypes because we believed that genetic associations with either baseline or response measurements are potentially interesting, although of course our primary motivation for the study was to study drug response.</p><p>While intermediate phenotypes have many advantages, a major limitation is that replication samples are seldom available. We were unable to identify any suitable replication dataset for the association between the SNP (rs3784943) in <italic>CDH13</italic> and positive subjective response. Replication of this result was challenging because a suitable study would have included administration of a stimulant drug, under similar conditions and corresponding dosage, and would have had to collect the same or related measurements of subjective response. In addition, the associated SNP had a fairly low minor allele frequency and only a moderate effect on the phenotype, so a relatively large dataset would be needed to have sufficient power for replication. Alternatively, our results can be viewed as replicating prior associations with <italic>CDH13</italic>, however the lack of convergence on a single SNP or haplotype across studies is a cause for concern. Because of these limitations, the results from <italic>Cdh13</italic> knockout mice and other biologically based studies of <italic>CDH13</italic> function may be the best route for further investigation and replication of our results.</p><p>Replication of the association between the SNP (rs472402) in <italic>SRD5A1</italic> and baseline positive affect appeared to be a more tractable problem because multiple GWAS datasets that include measurements of personality traits are available. Although our questionnaires were designed to detect differences in mood state, the effect persisted regardless of session or time point, which is consistent with a difference in trait independent of drug or session effects. We examined SNPs in strong LD with rs472402 in subjects from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Mental Health (NIH/NIMH) bipolar genetics studies with personality trait data consisting of the ZKPQ (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1007) and TCI (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;944) subscales <xref rid="pone.0042646-AllieyRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>; none of our analyses provided evidence of replication. However, the differences in the phenotypes and the study design were substantial between these studies and our own; this may indicate a poor fit for replication. We also considered the baseline sessions from smaller datasets collected in our lab using similar methodology but testing different drugs, however none of these datasets showed convincing evidence for replication. Taken together these results do not support the association between rs472402 and baseline positive affect.</p><p>In conclusion we have performed the first GWAS of the subjective response to a drug of abuse and identified two interesting associations. <italic>CDH13</italic> has previously been associated with a number of substance abuse and other psychiatric phenotypes and is also supported by data from knock-out mice. Replication in independent datasets will be important to establish the role of <italic>CDH13</italic> in drug addiction, and to determine the extent to which initial drug responses are related to the etiology of addiction. <italic>SRD5A1</italic> is similarly supported by prior evidence including corroborating genetic studies, gene expression and enzymatic activity data, but the lack of replication of this result is a cause for concern. We were motivated to perform this study using a relatively modest sample size because we believed that intermediate pharmacogenomic phenotypes might be influenced by alleles that contribute a larger fraction of the genetic variance. This study reflects both the utility and challenges of such phenotypes for discovery and enrichment of our understanding of complex psychiatric constructs such as drug abuse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042646.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
