One assessed the efficacy of rituximab for primary progressive (PP) MS while the other three focused on relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. In the PPMS study, rituximab delayed time to confirmed disease progression (CDP) in pre-planned sub-group analyses. The increase in T2 lesion volume was lower in the rituximab group at week 96 compared with placebo. For the RRMS studies, an open-label phase I study found that rituximab reduced the annualized relapse rate to 0.25 from pre-therapy baseline to week 24, while in the randomized placebo-controlled phase II trial, annualized relapse rates were 0.37 in the rituximab group and 0.84 in the placebo group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04) at week 24. Rituximab dramatically reduced the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain MRI scans for both RRMS studies. Off-label rituximab as an add-on therapy in patients with breakthrough disease on first-line agents was associated with an 88% reduction when comparing the mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions prior to and after the treatment. Although frequent adverse events classified as mild or moderate occurred in up to 77% of the patients, there were no grade 4 infusion-related adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Author&#x02019;s conclusion</title><p>Despite the frequent mild/moderate adverse events related to the drug, rituximab appears overall safe for up to 2 years of therapy and has a substantial impact on the inflammatory disease activity (clinical and/or radiological) of RRMS.

It is an immune-mediated chronic disorder in which activated T cells have been implicated, causing areas of myelin damage, and oligodendrocyte and axonal loss. These demyelinated areas or plaques accumulate over time and contribute to disability progression.</p><p>Clinically, there are different phenotypes of MS. The most common is the relapsing-remitting (RR) form characterized by the development of acute symptoms or relapses of neurological deficits followed by a complete or incomplete recovery, also called remission. Relapse rate and development of new MS lesions on repeat brain MRI scans are the main outcome measures when evaluating efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in MS. Progression of disability is another typical outcome measure of drug efficacy. After a variable number of years, most patients develop a secondary progressive course (SP) characterized by a progression of the neurological disability associated or not with superimposed relapses. Other less common types include the primary progressive (PP) form, in which there is slow progression of disability and neurological symptoms without relapses, and the progressive-relapsing (PR) form, in which patients suffer an insidious disability progression from onset with some rare superimposed relapses. In PPMS, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of promising drugs use progression of disability as the main primary outcome measure, while accumulation of new lesions on repeat brain MRI scans is a secondary outcome measure.</p><p>Approved treatments for relapsing forms of MS, such as glatiramer acetate and the three subtypes of interferon beta, have been developed for their effect mostly on T cells in the pathogenesis of MS. However, not all the patients benefit from these therapies as some continue to experience disease activity while compliant to their medication.</p><p>Recent evidence has shown that B cells and humoral immunity also play a key role in MS pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0066308-Cross1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066308-Duddy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Thus therapies targeting B cells have been investigated as promising MS treatments in the past few years <xref rid="pone.0066308-Antel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 molecule expressed on mature B cells that effectively depletes these circulating B cells <xref rid="pone.0066308-Reff1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Profound CD20+ B cell depletion is expected to alter B-cell-mediated antigen presentation and resulting activation of T cells, antibody production, and possibly Epstein-Barr virus circulation, a virus that is harbored in B cells and has been implicated as potentially linked to MS pathology.</p><p>The use of other monoclonal antibodies for MS, such as natalizumab, have been accompanied by some concerns due to the development of a disabling and often fatal neurological complication, known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by JC virus infection in the brain <xref rid="pone.0066308-LangerGould1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066308-Clifford1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066308-Vermersch1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but there is limited information about the effect of other monoclonal antibodies in development for MS not only regarding safety, but also efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab for the treatment of patients with any form of MS.

In study 2, the proportion of patients with relapses was reduced in the rituximab group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;69) at week 24 compared to the placebo group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;35) (14.5% vs. 34.3% respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) and at week 48 (20.3% vs. 40%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). The unadjusted and adjusted annualized relapse rates were similar. The adjusted annualized relapse rate at week 24 was 0.37 for the rituximab group and 0.84 for the placebo group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04) while at week 48 relapse rates were 0.37 and 0.72 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08) respectively. Although study 4 <xref rid="pone.0066308-Naismith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> was not designed to examine relapse rate reduction authors found a relapse rate before treatment of 1.27 compared to 0.23 during treatment.</p><p>In terms of the radiological outcomes, three out of four studies included the number of Gad-enhancing lesions. For study 1 <xref rid="pone.0066308-BarOr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, the mean number of Gad-enhancing lesions was 1.31 at trial entry and decreased to 0.73 at week 4, 0.05 at week 48 and 0 at week 72. In study 2 <xref rid="pone.0066308-Hauser1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the mean number of Gad-enhancing lesions at weeks 12,16,20 and 24 was 5.5 in the placebo group and 0.5 in the rituximab group, with a reduction at each study time point beginning at week 12 (with p-values from 0.003 to &#x0003c;0.001). Considering the brain MRI scans obtained at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24, 80.3% of the rituximab-treated subjects had no Gad-enhancing lesions compared to 51.4% in the placebo group. In study 3 <xref rid="pone.0066308-Hawker1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, new Gad-enhancing lesions were not considered as contrast was not administered after baseline. In study 4 <xref rid="pone.0066308-Naismith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> 74% of the three post-treatment MRI scans were free of Gad-enhancing lesions. Mean number of Gad-enhancing lesions per month prior to treatment was 2.81 while after treatment it was 0.33.</p><p>The selected studies were heterogeneous and their primary and secondary outcomes as well as inclusion criteria were different. Not all studies were placebo-controlled and the characteristics of relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive patients are difficult to interpret together as the epidemiology and disease course vary for both. Considering all these facts, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate for the scope of this systematic review.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>This systematic review aimed to address the question of whether rituximab is efficacious and safe for use in MS patients. However, caution must be considered since there were several differences between the selected studies including the use of different outcomes, and different inclusion criteria (RRMS vs. PPMS).</p><p>Our systematic review addressed four different issues:</p><list list-type="simple" id="list2"><list-item><label>1</label><p>Is rituximab effective in reducing the time to confirmed disease progression (CDP)?</p></list-item></list><p>Only one of the studies used CDP as an outcome. Rituximab appeared to reduce progression by a marginal amount although the difference did not achieve statistical significance except in pre-planned analysis comparing young patients (under age 51 years) to older patients, and in those comparing patients with baseline Gad-enhancing lesions compared to those without baseline Gad-enhancing lesions. Another study explored disease progression comparing EDSS at the end of the study with baseline EDSS. Most patients (21/30) remained stable.</p><list list-type="simple" continued-from="list2"><list-item><label>2</label><p>Is rituximab safe?</p></list-item></list><p>All the studies reported higher proportion of patients with AEs in the rituximab group compared to placebo with the first infusions. These infusion-related AEs decreased with subsequent infusions. There were three deaths in one of the studies (two in the placebo group and 1 in the rituximab) and in another study there was one death, none of them related to the drug (aspiration in a patient with history of brainstem lesions and the other one due to homicide). There were no grade 4 adverse events related to the infusions or infections. Most of the AEs that patients presented were classified as grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate).</p><p>These results show that the use of rituximab for MS patients is accompanied by frequent but not serious adverse events that usually are reduced with subsequent infusions, and thus that rituximab is safe enough for these patients. However, the limited number of patients included in these studies and the relatively short duration of treatment and observation do not allow detecting long-term use-associated side effects. From the experience with the use of other monoclonal antibodies in MS, it has been observed that some adverse events such as PML appear more frequently after two full years of treatment. Thus, two year studies are likely to underestimate the true risk of this serious adverse event.</p><p>Rituximab has been widely used in other diseases such as rheumatologic or hematologic diseases typically combined with other drugs that affect the immune system. A study in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis described four patients from an estimated population of 129,000 exposed patients. Authors conclude that there is an increased risk of PML and they estimate the risk to be one per 25,000 treated individuals <xref rid="pone.0066308-Clifford2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Another retrospective study evaluated the inclusion of rituximab in the treatment protocols for non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphomas. They found an increased risk of PML up to 2.2 per 1,000 patient-years. These analyses did not adjust the risk for concomitant treatment with broad spectrum immunosuppressive agents known to increase PML risk, so causality and true risk restricted to rituximab are difficult to establish <xref rid="pone.0066308-Tuccori1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The main adverse events described with the use of rituximab are infusion-related reactions. The risk of infections and hematological events (such as neutropenia) is markedly reduced compared to conventional chemotherapy used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia <xref rid="pone.0066308-Plosker1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does rituximab reduce the relapse rate?</p></list-item></list><p>Two of the four studies addressed this question. They showed that rituximab substantially reduced the relapse rate by week 24 and this reduction was observed also at week 48 (after one course of treatment) for one study and at week 72 for another (i.e. after 2 courses of therapy). Another study observed an important reduction also at week 52 although this study was not designed for relapse rate reduction.</p><p>The reduction in the relapse rate observed in patients receiving rituximab in study 2 <xref rid="pone.0066308-Hauser1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (56% at week 24 and at week 52) and in study 1 <xref rid="pone.0066308-BarOr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (75% reduction from pre-therapy to week 24 and 87% from pre-therapy to week 48) was similar or greater than the one observed in the pivotal trials of natalizumab. Compared with placebo, natalizumab reduced relapse rate by 68% at one year and this effect was maintained at 2 years <xref rid="pone.0066308-Polman2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

In the pivotal trial combining natalizumab and interferon beta-1a vs. placebo plus interferon beta-1a, the reduction in the relapse rate was 54% <xref rid="pone.0066308-Rudick1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which was not greater than the effect seen in the monotherapy trial.

This means a reduction of 88% or greater when comparing the number of Gad-enhancing lesions before and after treatment or in the comparison between rituximab and placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0066308.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
