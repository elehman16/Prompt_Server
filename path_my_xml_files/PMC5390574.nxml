Regenerative periodontal therapy aims to reform and reconstitute the supporting tissues of teeth, which have been lost due to periodontal disease and trauma. Several regenerative therapeutic procedures have been developed for this purpose; and have met with partial or marginal success. These include root surface biomodification, use of various types of bone grafts, GTR, and combination of the above.</p><p>Platelet-rich plasma is an autologous volume of plasma with 4&#x02013;5 fold increase in platelet concentration, and is a proven source of growth factors such as PDGF, TGF, IGF, VEGF, EGF, platelet-derived angiogenesis factor, and platelet factor IV.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The positive impact of PRP on bone healing is attributed to angiogenic, proliferate and differentiating effect of PDGF and TGF present in high concentration. However, there is pausity of information about the clinical efficacy of PRP in repair and regeneration of periodontal defect. Ten patients (6 males and 4 females) in the age range of 25&#x02013;45 years with 20 intrabony defects were enrolled for this study. The defects were randomly grouped into two groups as control (Group A) and experimental (Group B) groups. All the patients completed the study period. No significant complication was observed in any of the treated groups. The parameters and variables assessed were PI, GI, PGM, PPD, CAL in three and six months and radiological assessment was done only at the end of six months.</p><p>The plaque and gingival index were assessed at baseline, three months and six months in order to monitor patient's oral hygiene and its effects on the soft tissue as this goes a long way in achieving the desired objective. The results of our investigation showed a statistically significant decrease in the plaque index from baseline to three months and at the end of six months in control (Group A) as well as experimental group (Group B), which is in accordance with the study by Dori <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, no statistically significant difference was recorded between both the groups suggesting that there was maintenance of good oral hygiene throughout the study in all groups and all patients were very well motivated as oral hygiene plays an important role in determining the treatment outcome. The maintenance of good oral hygiene and significant reduction in plaque index throughout the study period reflected in gingival health. The result showed a significant reduction in gingival index from baseline to the end of third month and sixth month in both control and experimental groups. However, as in the case of plaque index no statistically significant difference was noticed between both the groups suggesting that there was no untoward soft tissue reactions and inflammation in control and experimental sites throughout the study period.</p><p>The gold standard for evaluating regeneration is histologic assessment. But this is often not done in clinical trials due to ethical consideration. Surgical re-entry, which is considered next best, also cannot be performed due to morbidity and ethical reasons. Hence, surrogate treatment outcome measures such as PPD, CAL, and radiographic bone level are often used to indirectly assess the healing and regeneration of periodontal lesions in clinical trials. These measures do not provide the direct proof for new bone formation, new attachment, and regeneration.</p><p>The changes in PPD reflect the cumulative effect of the response of gingival tissue to the treatment by way of gingival recession and clinical attachment gain. PPD indicates the volume of subgingival area, which harbors the pathogenic microbiota and favors disease activity. Hence, it becomes an important variable to be measured for the long term maintenance of periodontal health. The result of the present investigation showed a mean probing depth of 7.30 &#x000b1; 0.94 mm at baseline, which got reduced significantly to 5.20 &#x000b1; 0.79 mm at the end of three months and 3.40 &#x000b1; 0.88 mm at the end of six months in Group A (control) indicating that there is progressive reduction in PPD at sites treated with open flap debridement (OFD). These findings confirm earlier reports by Heitz- Mayfield LJA <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that OFD results in reduction of periodontal pocket depth. Group B, which was treated with PRP alone, also showed statistically significant reduction in PPD from baseline to three and six months&#x02019; time interval (8.00 &#x000b1; 1.24 at baseline, 5.30 &#x000b1; 1.16 at three months, 3.70 &#x000b1; 1.06 at six months). However, when compared with Group A, there is no statistically significant change in PPD between the groups suggesting that application of PRP has no added benefit over traditional OFD in reducing PPD. So far a clinically reliable treatment outcome measure for regenerative periodontal therapy apparently has not been established. Change in CAL following regenerative therapy is the single most commonly used outcome measure in regenerative therapy. This is based on reported correlation between gain in CAL and gain in bone height by various clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The results of our study showed a mean CAL gain of 1.70 mm at three months and 3.50 mm at six months compared to baseline, which was statistically significant. This is in accordance with the study by Heitz- Mayfield <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In group B (1.90 mm at three months and 3.70 mm at the end of six months), the CAL gain was also statistically significant at the end of three and six months period. However, group A when compared with group B showed no statistical significance suggesting that PRP is not superior to open flap debridement. Continuous radiographic evaluation of alveolar bone changes following regenerative procedure is a non-surgical painless alternative to direct bone measurement, which is done by re-entry procedures. Radiographic variables assessed in our study were extent of defect fill and defect resolution using image analysis software (Autocad analysis). As the radiographic changes cannot be appreciated at three months interval they were recorded at six months interval. Our results showed that the mean defect fill for Group A was 0.80 &#x000b1; 1.3 mm, which is in accordance with the study by Yukna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, when compared with Group B (0.80 &#x000b1; 0.79 mm) there was no statistical difference suggesting that the use of PRP alone is not superior to OFD relating to defect fill. This might be because the presence of appropriate cell types, matrix, and signaling molecules are the key to regeneration of tissues. The periodontal ligament cells are reported to be critical in periodontal wound healing and currently periodontal regeneration is based on the concept of promoting repopulation of the wound and the adjacent root surface with cells of periodontal ligament. Periodontal wound healing is a spacio-temporal phenomenon where not only the presence of cell matrix and signaling molecules matters but also the appropriate tissue for the interaction of these elements. The cells of periodontal ligament contain stable cells, which normally remain quiescent in tissues in G0 and G1 phase waiting for appropriate phase to divide.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The polypeptide growth factors are reported to have a short half-life and their action is dose dependent. Some of the factors such as PDGF may have an inhibitory effect in cell proliferation at higher concentration.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The failure in our study for PRP to show superior regeneration compared to OFD may be because of conducive environment for the above described complicated time dependent periodontal wound healing phenomena.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Comparing percentage of defect fill between Group A and Group B - it was not found to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>L<sc>imitations of the study</sc></title><p>Our study used surrogate outcome measures, which are not a very reliable measure of periodontal regeneration. The intrabony defects included in our study were not identical in width and depth as the dimension of the defect influence the treatment outcome.
