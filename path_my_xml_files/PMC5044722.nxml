Primary outcome measures included myocardial-specific proteins (troponin-I, creatine kinase-MB), urinary-specific kidney proteins (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, alpha-1-microglobulin, glutathione transferase-pi, glutathione transferase alpha), serum proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta), norepinephrine, and cortisol levels. They were measured within 5 min of starting anesthesia (T<sub>0</sub>), at the end of surgery (T<sub>1</sub>), 12 h after surgery (T<sub>2</sub>), 24 h after surgery (T<sub>3</sub>), 36 h postoperatively (T<sub>4</sub>), and 48 h postoperatively (T<sub>5</sub>).

The pathogenesis of cardiac injury is multifactorial but related mainly to surgical stress response and sympathetic nervous system overactivity with consequent elevation of plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine that lead to impairment of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand balance whereas the etiology of renal injury is due mainly to elevation of renin levels as a result of sympathetic overactivity in addition to nephrotoxic, inflammatory, and hemodynamic components.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Decreasing these injuries is likely to improve outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Consequently, different measures have been adopted to reduce the incidence of these cardiac and renal injuries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The use of &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists as adjuncts during general anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation has become popular in recent years. Both clonidine and dexmedetomidine have sympatholytic, analgesic, and sedative effects. However, dexmedetomidine has a relatively high ratio of &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;1 activity (1620:1) and so is considered a more selective &#x003b1;2 receptor agonist (8 times more selective than clonidine).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Variable experimental studies have shown protective effects of these agents on cardiac and renal injuries.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, there are limited data concerning the impact of the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine on postoperative cardiac and renal injuries in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to evaluate cardiac and renal protective effects of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries. We hypothesized that dexmedetomidine may reduce postoperative cardiac and renal injuries in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The current prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between June 2012 and February 2014 on 50 American Society of Anesthesiologists Class II or III patients scheduled for cardiac surgery by using CPB. Written informed consent was obtained from patients and the Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The study was registered with PACTR201507000984471. The exclusion criteria included age &#x0003e;75 years, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &#x0003c;55%, preexisting severe LV hypertrophy, cardiomyopathies, Grade II (pseudonormal filling) and Grade III (restrictive filling) diastolic dysfunction, preoperative atrial fibrillation, pericardial disease, drug dependence, cerebrovascular diseases, use of alpha-2 agonists, type I diabetes mellitus, renal disease, significant pulmonary disease, and hepatic insufficiency. Thorough clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and laboratory investigations were performed as a routine diagnostic checkup. The patients were randomized to dexmedetomidine group that received a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine initiated 5 min before CPB (1 &#x000b5;g/kg over 15 min, followed by 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h) until 6 h after surgery, whereas the control group received an equivalent volume of physiological saline. Randomization was done through using a random number table generated by Microsoft Excel. An independent statistician was assigned to perform central randomization to ensure proper concealment of the study management from patients and investigators until the release of the final statistical results.</p><p>All preoperative medications, except angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, were continued until the morning of surgery. Oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin in diabetic patients were omitted in the morning of surgery. Oral diazepam 5-10 mg was given the night before surgery and morphine 0.1 mg/kg intravenously 30 min before surgery. Upon arrival to the operating room, standard monitoring (5 lead ECG, SpO<sub>2</sub> probe, and noninvasive blood pressure) was applied. A 20-gauge arterial cannula was inserted under local anesthesia in the radial artery and a triple lumen central venous pressure (CVP) catheter inserted into the right internal jugular vein under complete aseptic technique.</p><p>Induction of anesthesia in both groups was performed by propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg and fentanyl 3-5 &#x000b5;g/kg titrated according to hemodynamics. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by giving cis-atracurium 0.1 mg/kg and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1 minimum alveolar concentration in 50% oxygen and air, fentanyl 3-5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h, and cis-atracurium 2 &#x000b5;g/kg/min. The bispectral index scale (BIS) electrode (BIS-Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) was positioned on the patient's forehead to monitor the depth of anesthesia where BIS value was kept between 45 and 55 in both groups through modulating isoflurane concentration. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 45 mmHg. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) along with CVP were continuously monitored. The pressure transducers were zeroed against atmospheric pressure and maintained at the midaxillary level. MAP was maintained above 60 mmHg by vasoconstrictors (phenylephrine 50-100 &#x000b5;g or norepinephrine 5-10 &#x000b5;g), and CVP was kept constant within normal range by intravenous fluid infusion. Maintenance of normothermia was achieved with fluid warming and forced-air warming (Bair-Hugger). Blood glucose level was maintained to normoglycemia (70-150 mg/dl). One investigator was blinded regarding the anesthetic study drug during conduct of the study by covering the infusion pump, lines, and by numeric codes during the whole process of data evaluation. In addition, physicians who were in charge for postoperative care of the patients and for their discharges from ICU and hospital were effectively blinded to the study protocol.</p><p>Primary outcome measures included myocardial-specific proteins (troponin-I &#x0201c;cTn-I&#x0201d;, creatine kinase-MB &#x0201c;CK-MB&#x0201d;) and urinary-specific kidney proteins (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase [beta-NAG], alpha-1-microglobulin [alpha-1-M], glutathione transferase-pi [GST-pi], glutathione transferase alpha [GST-alpha]). They were measured within 5 min of starting anesthesia as a baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), at the end of surgery (T<sub>1</sub>), 12 h after surgery (T<sub>2</sub>), 24 h after surgery (T<sub>3</sub>), 36 h postoperatively (T<sub>4</sub>), and 48 h postoperatively (T<sub>5</sub>). Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [TNF-&#x003b1;] and interleukin-1 beta [IL-1&#x003b2;]), norepinephrine, and cortisol levels were measured at the same time points. Furthermore, creatinine clearance and serum cystatin C were measured before starting surgery as a baseline and at days 1, 4, 7 after surgery. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged, and the serum was separated, divided into aliquots, and placed in Eppendorf tubes and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assay. Commercial kits were used for the determination of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] Kit; Biomed, Diepenbeek, Belgium) based on ELISA. Recordings were done on a plate reader (General Elisa System Technology, Menarini Labs, Badalona, Spain) for the automatic ELISA technique in triplicate.</p><p>High-performance liquid chromatography method was used for the assay of serum norepinephrine and cortisol levels.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay time, hospital stay time, major postoperative complications, and 30-day mortality.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A preliminary study at our hospital had shown that for patients scheduled for cardiac surgeries, the mean values of cardiac Tn-I and creatinine clearance were 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.15 ng/mL and 99 &#x000b1; 17 mg/L, respectively. With a two-sided type I error of 5% and study power at 80%, it was estimated that 22 patients would be needed in each group in order to detect a difference of 0.16 ng/mL for cardiac Tn-I, and 20 patients might be needed in each group in order to detect a difference of 20 mg/L for creatinine clearance. We preferred to study 25 patients in each group in order to decrease the chance of insufficient power in case the observed variability was higher than expected. Numerical data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and categorical variables are reported as numbers. Statistica for Windows version 10.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify normal distribution of data. Distribution of residuals testing was done to confirm that analysis of variance (ANOVA) was appropriate to our data. Data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis using two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. This was followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test, if a difference between groups had been detected. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant (SigmaStat, Systat Software, Richmond, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Patients&#x02019; baseline data and operative characteristics were comparable in both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patients, baseline data and operative characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-395-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Patients in the dexmedetomidine group had a lower concentration of myocardial-specific proteins (cTn-I, CK-MB) at most time points after surgery except at 48 h postoperatively (T<sub>5</sub>) where the concentrations were comparable and near baseline values in both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Changes in cardiac troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-395-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Similarly, dexmedetomidine group patients developed lower levels of kidney-specific urinary proteins (beta-NAG, alpha-1-M, GST-pi, GST-alpha) at most time points after starting surgery whereas the levels in both groups were comparable and near baseline data at T<sub>5</sub> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Changes in kidney-specific urinary proteins</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-395-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;) increased significantly in both groups at all time points after starting surgery but were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group at all these points [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines&#x02019; tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, norepinephrine and cortisol levels</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-395-g004"/></table-wrap><p>Furthermore, plasma norepinephrine and cortisol levels increased significantly at most time points after starting surgery in both groups but were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group.

Furthermore, dexmedetomidine group showed higher creatinine clearance and lower serum cystatin C in addition to better postoperative characteristics. However, postoperative outcomes did not show significant difference between both groups.</p><p>It is well known that cardiac surgeries induce systemic inflammatory response and sympathetic nervous system activation that may potentially induce injuries to most body organs including the heart and kidney.
