A total of 73, 15&#x02013;45-year-old, women with hair loss participated in this 4-month study. Simple randomization using Random Allocation Software was done to put the participants in four groups to receive coadministration of zinc sulfate and calcium pantothenate, zinc sulfate, calcium pantothenate, and 2% minoxidil solution.

Different aspects were analyzed; changes of hair density and thickness measured by dermatoscope was an important tool to estimate the efficacy of the treatments. All participants and the blinded dermatologist separately evaluated the clinical outcome based on a seven-point scale questionnaire. Interestingly, the calcium pantothenate group participants&#x02019; assessments tended to be higher compared with experts&#x02019; assessments. It may be because of improvements occurred after 4 months of treatment including an increase in hair thickness and controlling hair loss which resulted in participant contentment and may lead to overestimation of clinical effects of calcium pantothenate.</p><p>Many other studies investigating minoxidil in women with hair loss have confirmed a good treatment response;[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] however, it should be considered that positive effects of minoxidil will disappear after discontinuation of drug administration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, patients usually have low compliance to use topical medications rather than oral supplements which have fewer side effects, too.</p><p>The study had some limitations including; the participants were not blinded to treatment, because of differences in medications; the stage of hair loss and the effect of treatment regimens based on this stage were not determined. Further studies are therefore required to resolve these limitations with a large double-blinded study.</p><p>According to participants&#x02019; satisfaction, the coadministration of zinc sulfate capsules and calcium pantothenate tablets when administered in a pulse therapy may result in hair growth as it provides basic nutrients needed for hair growth. Because of availability, affordability, no serious side effects and patients&#x02019; desire to use oral medications instead of topical ones; this combination could be a good choice for controlling hair loss, especially in initial stages.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>A<sc>UTHORS</sc>&#x02019; C<sc>ONTRIBUTION</sc></title><p>Prof. Mansour Siavash contributed in the project idea, study design, supervision, data analysis and manuscript preparation; Dr. Fereshteh Tavakoli contributed in study design and conduct, data analysis and manuscript preparation; Dr. Fatemeh Mokhtari contributed in study conduct and manuscript preparation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Research Council and Ethics Committee of School of Medicine of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are indebted to Research Council and Ethics Committee of School of Medicine of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences for its financial and spiritual supports, and also the participants who take part in the study.
