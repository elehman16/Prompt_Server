These strokes and TIAs are referred to as cryptogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One of the known risk factors for ischaemic stroke is atrial fibrillation (AF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current guidelines state that orally administered anticoagulation therapy (OAC) should be prescribed in case AF of any duration above 30&#x000a0;s is detected after ischaemic stroke/TIA on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or lasting at least 30&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] on a 24-h Holter monitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, as AF is often asymptomatic and paroxysmal, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] the detection of AF with the currently advised standard work-up using a 24-h Holter recording is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Consequently, recently published research indicates that AF episodes may be missed using this standard evaluation. In the CRYSTAL-AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and EMBRACE trials, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] it was demonstrated that prolonged ECG monitoring yielded significantly higher percentages of detected AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">It has been discussed that it is uncertain if subclinical AF, especially short episodes, require anticoagulation in patients with cryptogenic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several trials (NCT02313909, NCT02427126 and NCT02239120) have started to randomise patients with cryptogenic stroke between non-vitamin K orally administered anticoagulants (NOACs) and aspirin. Awaiting the results of these trials and possible amending of the guidelines, the diagnosis of AF after cryptogenic stroke remains to have therapeutic consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The diagnostic method, therefore, remains important.</p><p id="Par8">In the CRYSTAL-AF trial, an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) showed significantly higher detection rates of AF after 6-month follow-up in patients with cryptogenic stroke. However, placement of an ICM is costly and has some limitations, as it brings in the risk of pocket infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In the EMBRACE trial, a 30-day, event-triggered, loop recorder showed significantly higher rates of AF after 90&#x000a0;days of follow-up. Indeed, the device was moderately well-tolerated as 60% of all participants completed the full month of wearing the device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In the past 5&#x000a0;years, smartphone-connected ECG devices have been developed. One of these devices is the Kardia Mobile (Alivecor, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). This a handheld ECG device that transmits and stores a single-lead ECG on a smartphone. It has been cleared by the United States Food And Drug Administration (FDA) and has received a European Union CE mark for the detection of AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The device is easy-to-use, non-invasive, electrically safe and can be used on demand. It does not introduce the risk of pocket infection, does not have to be worn on the body and is cheaper than an ICM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, it does not, in contrast with an ICM, necessitate trained health care staff or a dedicated hospital room to hand the device to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the Kardia Mobile may be a more feasible alternative for prolonged ECG monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients. However, the clinical effectiveness of the Kardia Mobile in detecting AF in cryptogenic stroke patients has not been investigated before.</p><p id="Par11">Therefore, the Mobile phones in cryptogenic strOke patients Bringing sIngle Lead ECGs to detect Atrial Fibrillation (MOBILE-AF) trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of the Kardia Mobile device for AF detection in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA and to compare this with the effectiveness of regular follow-up for AF detection.</p><p id="Par12">In this paper the design and rationale of the study are presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p id="Par13">For this study, patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA who have been treated at one of the participating centres (see the list in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) will be asked to participate.

To our knowledge, this is the first and only clinical trial that uses the Kardia Mobile for this indication. The Kardia Mobile is a validated device that is non-invasive and easy to use. Because of its negligible burden on the patient, its low cost and the fact that it can be used by patients on demand, without the presence of trained health care staff, in our opinion it has potential to improve the yield and cost-effectiveness of AF detection in this population.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Subclinical AF after cryptogenic stroke and subsequent risk of recurrent stroke</title><p id="Par58">Currently, there is scientific uncertainty about the causal relationship between subclinical paroxysmal AF following cryptogenic stroke and the subsequent risk of recurrent stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, clinical AF has been a long-known independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More recent trials in patients without prior ischaemic stroke and implanted pacemakers or ICDs demonstrated that subclinical paroxysmal AF also increased ischaemic stroke risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One of these trials, the ASSERT trial, found a 2.5-fold increased risk in patients who experienced episodes of subclinical AF lasting more than 6&#x000a0;min. This risk tended to increase in patients who experienced longer or more frequent episodes of subclinical paroxysmal AF. However, the authors noted that the study was underpowered to draw conclusions about this particular question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Detecting subclinical AF after cryptogenic stroke</title><p id="Par59">In the CRYSTAL-AF trial, 12.4% of paroxysmal AF was found after 12&#x000a0;months in patients wearing an ICM. Of these episodes, 79% were asymptomatic. The median value of maximum duration of an AF episode was 11.2&#x000a0;h. A total of 61% of all AF episodes was longer than 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the EMBRACE trial no data on AF symptoms are given. Of the 284 patients randomised to the 30-day ECG monitoring, 56 (19.7%) had AF of any duration. A total of 44 patients (15.5%) had at least one episode which lasted longer than 30&#x000a0;s. A total of 28 patients (9.9%) had at least one episode which lasted longer than 2.5&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The Kardia Mobile produces a PDF in which 30&#x000a0;s of measurement are shown. Therefore, the duration of an paroxysmal AF episode cannot be adequately determined by the Kardia Mobile. However, we consider it likely that a 30-s recording of AF on the Kardia Mobile will be part of a longer during episode of AF. In comparison, in the CRYSTAL-AF trial 61% of patients with detected AF had episodes which lasted longer than 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As we expect that most patients will perform a Kardia Mobile measurement twice daily, the chances that the Kardia Mobile will detect sporadically occurring AF episodes lasting only several minutes are low.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Prevention of recurrent stroke</title><p id="Par61">Determining the percentage of anticoagulants users, the percentage of recurrent strokes and the percentages of major bleedings are secondary objectives of the MOBILE-AF trial. At the end of the CRYSTAL-AF TRIAL, 10.1% in the ICM group and 4.6% of all control group patients used OAC. Recurrent stroke occurred in 5.2% in the ICM group and 8.6% in the control group. These results may indicate that OAC in patients with subclinical AF indeed lowers the risk of recurrent stroke. However, no data were shown about the relationship between duration or frequency of AF episodes and recurrent stroke. Furthermore, the study was underpowered to draw conclusions about this specific relation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It therefore remains unclear whether subclinical AF in cryptogenic stroke is of clinical importance. For this reason, we leave the decision to start OAC to the discretion of the patient&#x02019;s treating cardiologist. We will, however, carefully monitor percentages of patients in which OAC was described, as well as the main effect (stroke recurrence) and side effect (major bleedings) and, therefore, included these in our secondary objectives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Prediction of AF occurrence</title><p id="Par62">There are a number of publications available about prediction of the occurrence of mainly paroxysmal AF after cryptogenic stroke or TIA. One is a paper by Rodriguez-Yanez et al., who evaluated 372 patients with cryptogenic stroke. Pro-BNP levels were determined within 24&#x000a0;h of stroke onset. Patients were followed-up for 2&#x000a0;years for the development of AF. The authors concluded that a pro-BNP level&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;360&#x000a0;pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 98.6%. Overall, 5.6% of all stroke patients were found to have AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is a relatively low percentage, compared with the CRYSTAL-AF (12.4% after 1&#x000a0;year) and EMBRACE (16.2% after 90&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This might be explained by the frequency of monitoring: follow-up was done by taking elective 12-lead 10-s ECGs. No continuous monitoring was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, as our trial involves more frequent ECG monitoring, we would like to corroborate that a pro-BNP level&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;360&#x000a0;pg/mL has indeed a high negative predictive value.</p><p id="Par63">A second is a paper by Gladstone et al., who evaluated 237 patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA. They assessed the number of atrial premature beats (ABP) on the 24-h Holter monitoring which was part of the standard work-up of cryptogenic stroke. They found that the number of ABPs was strongly and independently associated with the development of subclinical AF within 90&#x000a0;days after cryptogenic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We would like to also confirm these findings in our population.</p><p id="Par64">A third is a paper by Tsang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], who investigated the relationship between left atrial diameter and volume and the development of AF. They found that an increase in left atrial volume was independently associated with the development of AF. Although this study was not performed in patients who had experienced a cryptogenic stroke, we believe that this might also be true for our population. We therefore would like to verify the study&#x02019;s findings in our population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">To our knowledge, these three predictors have not been combined into a prediction score yet. We would like to combine the three predictors and develop a prediction score for the occurrence of paroxysmal AF after cryptogenic stroke or TIA in order to individualise monitoring strategies for these patients.</p><p id="Par66">Summarising, we present a study that is designed to investigate the effectiveness of the Kardia Mobile to detect AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke. The Kardia Mobile is a device with serious potential to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness. The first results can be expected end 2018.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
