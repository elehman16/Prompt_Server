balance and ankle instability in adult men with functional ankle instability. [Subjects
and Methods] Twenty eight adults with functional ankle instability, divided randomly into
an experimental group, which performed visual feedback balance training for 20 minutes and
ankle joint exercises for 10 minutes, and a control group, which performed ankle joint
exercise for 30 minutes. Exercises were completed three times a week for 8 weeks. Bio
rescue was used for balance ability. It measured limit of stability at one minute. For
ankle instability was measured using Cumberland ankle instability tool (CAIT). This
measure was performed before and after the experiments in each group. [Results] The
experimental group had significant increase in the Limit of Stability and CAIT score. The
control group had significant increase in CAIT score. While the Limit of Stability
increased without significance. [Conclusion] In conclusion, visual feedback balance

sports-related injuries. These injuries frequently involve the lower extremities, with
sprains of ankle joints, which damage the lateral ankles due to inversion, accounting for
85% of the incidents<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among patients with ankle-joint sprains, 20% to 40% progress into
functional ankle instability, which refers to repetitive ankle sprains or re-damage, and
complain of the subjective feeling that the ankle may give way during daily activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional ankle instability is one of the
main causes of activity disorder, the symptoms of which include pain, edema, muscle
weakness, deterioration of proprioception, and lack of balance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The deterioration of proprioceptive sensibility causes difficulties
in postural control and induces instability in the ankle joints. Balance ability refers to
the ability to maintain one&#x02019;s center of gravity over the base of support during static and
dynamic movements, and deterioration in balance ability increases ankle instability as well
as lateral movements in ankle joints. Thus, balance training, proprioceptive-stimulation
training, muscle-strengthening exercises, and manual therapy are used to increase the
stability of ankle joints. In particular, balance training is a widely used treatment method
to improve posture control, proprioception, and balance ability as well as to increase the
stability of the ankle joints<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, visual feedback balance training was conducted rather than simple balance
training. Balance training that utilizes visual feedback has been reported to improve
balance ability through constant repetitive autonomous modification while the participant
performs motor tasks and experiences constant stimulation of motor plan and motor control
abilities. Furthermore, it has been reported to compensate for instability and absorb
impacts on the ankle joints through strategic movements of the knee joints that induce
horizontal and vertical movements of the center of gravity according to the visual
feedback<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study aimed to determine the effects of visual feedback
balance training on the balance and ankle instability of male adults with ankle
instability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted from May to July 2015 after receiving approval from the Bioethics
Committee of Daegu University. All of the subjects understood the purpose of this study and
gave their written consent before participating. The participants were 28 adult male
subjects who had functional ankle instability determined by the Cumberland Ankle Instability
Tool (CAIT) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=13)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.0 (&#x000b1; 2.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.7 (&#x000b1; 1.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177.4 (&#x000b1; 6.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.0 (&#x000b1; 4.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.1 (&#x000b1; 16.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.9 (&#x000b1; 6.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CAIT (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.6 (&#x000b1; 4.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.3 (&#x000b1; 3.2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CAIT: Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>). Twenty eight subjects were divided into two groups randomly. The selection
criteria were as follows: men in their 20s who had experienced an ankle sprain at least
once, those who felt giving way in their ankle joints, those with a CAIT score below 24
points, and those who could support their body weight fully while conducting the tasks in
this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: those with no other particular diseases
than ankle instability, those who had experienced ankle joint surgery in the past. In this
study, subjects were divided into an experimental visual feedback balance training group,
and an exercise control group, which conducted muscle stretching and muscle strengthening
exercises. Examination was conducted prior to intervention, and a post-examination was
conducted after 8-weeks of intervention.</p><p>For the visual feedback balance trainer, a Bal Pro (Man&#x00026;Tel Co., Korea) was used. The
visual feedback balance trainer consists of a screen, a pressure sensor that can sense the
horizontal movements of weight loads on the foothold, a tilt sensor that can perceive the
angle of the knee joint, and a main body containing programs to process the information
perceived by the tilt sensor. The pressure sensor at the foothold can sense the body weight
centers of patients to help them move horizontally using a finger-shaped cursor on the
screen during the game as the body weight is moved to the right or left. A tilt sensor
detects the angle of flexion and extension of the knee joints. For example, when the knees
are bent, a cursor is raised, and when the knees are extended, a cursor descends, thereby
performing training to touch various fruits arranged randomly on a tree on the screen<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The visual feedback balance training was conducted three times a week for 8 weeks. Each
exercise timespan was 30 minutes. Out of the 30 minutes, 20 minutes were allocated for
balance training, while 10 minutes were allocated for exercise treatment of the ankle
joints. The control group applied stretching and muscle-strengthening exercises. The
exercise was conducted three times a week for 8 weeks, and the intensity was adjusted
gradually according to the patient&#x02019;s condition.</p><p>For postural adjustment ability, center of pressure was measured using Biorescue (RM
Ingenierie, Rodes, France). The element measured included the Limit of stability (LOS) to
evaluate the balance ability. High value indicated good balance ability. LOS were measured
for one minute. Ankle instability was measured using CAIT. CAIT has been reported to have
high reliability and validity. This evaluation tool is composed of 9-item questionnaire
according to degree of instability ankle. CAIT enables classification according to a score
between 0 and 30, where scores greater than or equal to 28 points no instability and defined
as having an unstable ankle below 24 points. High score indicated good ankle stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using the SPSS program version 18.0. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test was used to test for normality. To identify the changes in each parameter between
before and after training of the two groups, a paired t-test was used. Statistical
significance was accepted for values with p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The measurement results of the LOS showed that the experimental group had a significant

instability. One cause of ankle instability is a lack of balance ability. Most injuries to
ankle joints occur when people land on irregular surfaces. Thus, balance ability is more
important than muscle strength in preventing a recurrence of instability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study aimed to determine the effect
of visual feedback balance training on balance ability and ankle instability in male adults
with functional ankle instability to assess whether it can be recommended as a new therapy
method.</p><p>The present study found that the increase in balance ability of male adults with functional
ankle instability in the experimental group was statistically significant. This result
indicated that the training stimulated proprioception in the subjects as they moved their
own body weight and returned back to their original positions with stability, thereby
increasing sensory nerve signal transmission, followed by an increase in balance abilities
and motor control of the muscles around the knee joints. Previous studies on balance
training with visual feedback with regard to healthy adults and elderly adults reported
significant improvements in postural balance ability, which is consistent with the present
study&#x02019;s results<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the present study showed that the CAIT score increases
were statistically significant in both the experimental and the control groups because the
training improved muscle strength around the ankles and thereby reduced subjective feelings
of ankle instability. The present study&#x02019;s results were consistent with those of previous
studies, in which balance training and muscle strengthening exercises increased muscle
activity around ankles, including the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus muscles, as well
as isokinetic muscular strength, improving ankle stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the present study was conducted only
with male adults with ankle instability; no female patients with ankle instability were
included. Second, follow-up observations were not conducted to identify changes over
time.</p><p>The present study results showed that balance training with visual feedback effectively
improved balance ability and ankle instability in male adults with functional ankle
instability. In addition, the balance training increased patients&#x02019; interest and
participation rate in treatment more than existing therapy methods. Therefore, balance
training with visual feedback can be recommended as an efficient training method for
patients with ankle instability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>WB</given-names></name><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of balance training by knee joint motions on
