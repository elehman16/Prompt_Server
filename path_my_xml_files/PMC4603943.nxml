Guidelines have confirmed the right of informed shared decision-making. However, previous research has shown that the implementation of informed shared decision-making is suboptimal for reasons of limited resources of physicians, power imbalances between patients and physicians and missing evidence-based patient information. We developed an informed shared decision-making program for women with primary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The program provides decision coaching for women by specialized nurses and aims at supporting involvement in decision-making and informed choices.</p><p>In this trial, the informed shared decision-making program will be evaluated in breast care centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the informed shared decision-making program with standard care. The program comprises an evidence-based patient decision aid and training of physicians (2&#x000a0;hours) and specialized breast care and oncology nurses (4&#x000a0;days) in informed shared decision-making. Sixteen certified breast care centers will be included, with 192 women with primary DCIS being recruited.</p><p>Primary outcome is the extent of patients&#x02019; involvement in shared decision-making as assessed by the MAPPIN-O<sub>dyad</sub> (Multifocal approach to the &#x02018;sharing&#x02019; in shared decision-making: observer instrument dyad). Secondary endpoints include the sub-measures of the MAPPIN-inventory (MAPPIN-O<sub>nurse</sub>, MAPPIN-O<sub>physician</sub>, MAPPIN-O<sub>patient</sub>, MAPPIN-Q<sub>nurse</sub>, MAPPIN-Q<sub>patient</sub> and MAPPIN-Q<sub>physician</sub>), informed choice, decisional conflict and the duration of encounters.</p><p>It is expected that decision coaching and the provision of evidence-based patient decision aids will increase patients&#x02019; involvement in decision-making with informed choices and reduce decisional conflicts and duration of physician encounters. Furthermore, an accompanying process evaluation will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of decision coaches in German breast care centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN46305518?q=spupeo&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=1&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN46305518</ext-link>, date of registration: 5 June 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0991-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Decision-making</kwd><kwd>Patient participation</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd><kwd>Breast neoplasms</kwd><kwd>Intraductal carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based medicine</kwd><kwd>Informed choice</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Women with breast cancer want to participate in treatment decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The German guideline recommends mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery combined with (neo-) adjuvant treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Benefits and harms of treatments vary between options and differently impact patients&#x02019; physical and psychosocial quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, women&#x02019;s values and preferences are essential. Treatment decisions should not be left exclusively to the physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>So far, women&#x02019;s preferences to participate have rarely been considered in a structured manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This might contribute to dissatisfaction with medical treatment decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The National Cancer Plan of the German Ministry of Health and breast cancer treatment guidelines explicitly ask for patient participation in medical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, the German patients&#x02019; right act clearly defines patients&#x02019; rights to complete and unbiased information on benefits and harms of all treatment options including the option not to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Evidence-based patient decision aids (ptDA) and the consideration of women&#x02019;s preferences are key issues in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some women feel overloaded by the plethora of information, usually given in a single consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The model of shared decision-making (SDM) comprises evidence-based patient information and weighing of pros and cons of treatment options while taking women&#x02019;s values and preferences into account. Barriers that might hamper the implementation of informed SDM have been identified. They comprise structural deficiencies in care settings, communication or time issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Patients experience discontinuity in the process of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] possibly due to a substantial mismatch in knowledge, different role models or social and cultural backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Patients often do not feel prepared to participate in decision-making due to their limited knowledge. In SDM, acknowledgement of patients&#x02019; preferences and values is as important as knowledge about treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Even if women decline to participate in decision-making, they often wish detailed information about their disease and treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In case of declining, the decision can be delegated to the health care team at any time. SDM comprises the sharing of the decision-making process, but not necessarily the sharing of the decision-making itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, women have the right of non-information.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>State of research</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Shared decision-making and decision coaching by specialized breast care nurses</title><p>One opportunity to overcome some of these barriers is the inter-professional model of informed shared decision-making that facilitates patients&#x02019; involvement in treatment decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Health care professionals support the decision-making process as decision coaches, which may be defined as &#x0201c;<italic>health professionals who provided information on options and facilitated progress in decision making in preparation for discussion with the practitioner who would ultimately be responsible for making the decision with the patient&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The majority of projects on SDM have focused on the education of the physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Some studies have shown that specialized nurses who acted as decision coaches successfully enhanced patients&#x02019; decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nurses have shown competences in explaining medical information, supporting patients and sharing the information with physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At the Dartmouth-Hitchcock-Medical-Center in New Hampshire, USA, specially trained nurses and social workers prepare patients for decision-making in a structured manner. A consultation in the hospital&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Center for Shared Decision Making&#x0201d; is mandatory, for example, for breast cancer patients who take part in the <italic>Comprehensive Breast Program</italic>. This includes a pre-visit distribution of decision aids into the standard care path and a continuing care coordinator who guides patients through the decision and care process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In Germany, nurses have already been involved in patient education in a structured manner within the scope of the disease management programs for diabetes mellitus, asthma and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. So far, neither the implementation of SDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] nor SDM involving breast care nurses or oncology nurses as decision coaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] has been implemented in oncology care settings. Specialized nurses successfully completed at least an additional 1-year training in care of breast cancer (oncology) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. SDM has not yet been included into the curricula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effects of evidence-based patient decision aids on patient participation in decision-making</title><p>Evidence-based patient information (EBPI) has frequently been neglected in the scope of SDM. EBPI is a prerequisite for informed SDM processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The combination of SDM and evidence-based ptDA enables women to make informed choices defined by Marteau as relevant knowledge about the treatment options and a positive attitude congruent to their chosen treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Previous research has shown that the exclusive provision of written ptDA improves breast cancer patient&#x02019;s knowledge and reduces decisional conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, the exclusive provision of evidence-based ptDA for patients is not enough to enhance patient empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In Germany, strategies to improve evidence-based patient participation have been explored, for example, within the care of multiple sclerosis patients. Kasper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] evaluated an evidence-based ptDA on immunotherapy in patients with multiple sclerosis. The study could not show a difference in preference matches between intervention and control group. K&#x000f6;pke et al. showed that an interactive educational intervention increased informed choices and slightly increased the autonomy preference toward an active role in patients&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. According to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) autonomy preference only indicates behavioral intention and not the behavior itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The TPB explains how peoples&#x02019; behavioral intentions are influenced by social norms, their attitudes toward the behavior and their perceived behavioral controls. The behavioural intention is strongly associated with the prediction of the behavior itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Collins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] reported that a decision aid on breast cancer reduces decisional conflict in women facing a treatment decision on surgical options.</p><p>Within the scope of the German healthcare system, evidence-based treatment and patient guidelines for breast cancer have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, these guidelines do not provide adequate risk communication on treatment options and especially harms. PtDA that adequately consider criteria for EBPI are still rare within the German healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation of SDM</title><p>Measurements for SDM in inter-professional settings remain challenging. A variety of instruments exist to measure preconditions, the SDM-process and outcome parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, none of these instruments focus on the inter-professional specifics of measuring team processes and triangular SDM-processes among, for example, doctors, nurses and patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Previous work</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Development</title><p>We developed a program (decision coaching) to facilitate informed SDM in oncology. The decision coaching will be provided by specialized breast care or oncology nurses combined with evidence-based ptDA. We address women who are facing a primary treatment decision on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p><p>We chose DCIS, which is associated with a great extent of uncertainty. Women with DCIS have distinct information needs about the disease and its treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Every year 6,500 women are diagnosed with DCIS in Germany. The number of cases has been increasing since the introduction of the national mammography screening program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Without screening, DCIS is rarely diagnosed. Due to its symptomless nature, it usually is an incidental finding. Approximately, 20&#x000a0;% of the malignancies detected by screening are DCIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. DCIS is limited to the mammary ducts and associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. The prognosis is unknown, but not all DCIS will progress to invasive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Treatment is usually recommended for all woman with DCIS because it is impossible to predict which DCIS will develop into invasive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>We developed our program following the UK Medical Research Council&#x02019;s (MRC) guidance for the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and applied the Theory of Planned Behavior. Our program comprises an evidence-based ptDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], a curriculum for specialized nurses and a workshop for physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We developed our curricula according to the six-step approach for the development of curricula in medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The evidence-based ptDA for the primary treatment decision on DCIS has been developed according to the criteria for EBPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pilot trial</title><p>Each component of the intervention was separately piloted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Finally, feasibility and acceptability of the complete program has been evaluated in a phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>Two breast care centers (four nurses and five physicians) in Berlin, Germany, recruited up to 6 patients with DCIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. All encounters with patients and nurses were videotaped and analyzed. In sum, the study showed that the program is feasible and acceptable. However, we also identified barriers. The physician workshop revealed the physicians&#x02019; desire to discuss treatment options; in standard care, usually only the recommendation of the tumor board is communicated to the patient, which is in line with medical guidelines. This option is often seen as the only possible treatment. Therefore, an open decision-making process is inhibited. Physicians also unveiled patients&#x02019; supposed expectation of doctors. According to their opinions, patients expect clear treatment recommendations. Both professional groups - nurses and physicians - pointed out that it is not necessary to ask patients for their preferences because they already know which option would be the best for the patients. Although each woman fulfilling the inclusion criteria should have been asked for study participation, not all women were asked for participation because physicians were concerned that some women might be overburdened by SDM due to age or educational background. Another barrier consists in the predefined number of specific surgical procedures that lead to a doubtful incentive for breast care centers. Physicians were concerned about offering women all treatment options since they had to justify their treatment to the certification body that defines the quality indicators.</p><p>We address the potential barriers in our educational intervention by discussing the possible impact of personal attitudes and giving advice on how to communicate the recommendation of the tumor board. In addition, we developed supplementary material such as prompt cards and fact sheets to structure the decision coaching sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to assess efficacy of the decision coaching program. The key hypothesis is that women who receive an evidence-based ptDA and decision coaching by specially trained breast care or oncology nurses are more involved in decision-making compared to standard care.</p><p>We also hypothesize that women in the intervention group will make more informed choices based on their preferences and values.</p><p>Further objectives are to assess if women&#x02019;s decisional conflicts will decrease and if the duration of physician encounters will be shortened.</p><p>Alongside the trial, the processes, facilitators and barriers to implementation will be qualitatively assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This protocol is reported following the criteria of the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and the MRC-Framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

To avoid contamination, allocation will be carried out on the level of the breast care centers rather than the individual patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The trial is designed as a superiority cluster randomized controlled trial with a parallel group design and 1:1 allocation ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study will be conducted in certified breast care centers. Breast care centers in Germany in the federal states of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hessen, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Lower Saxony will be invited for participation by sending an email with brief information and personal contact details. Usually, breast cancer patients are referred to breast care centers to verify diagnosis and provide treatment. Certified centers offer quality assured care based on evidence-based medical treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. That implies that breast care centers have to treat a predefined number of patients per year. The diagnoses and treatment recommendations have to be made by a multi-professional healthcare team. Usually, the tumor board&#x02019;s treatment recommendation is made prior to the primary treatment of DCIS and before talking with patients about treatment options. In most breast care centers, patients are only offered this treatment recommendation. Breast care centers are continuously evaluated, using predefined quality indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Certification guidelines require the involvement of breast care nurses or oncology nurses in patient care.

For the evaluation of our main hypothesis, we will use the observer instrument &#x0201c;Multifocal APProach to the sharing IN Shared Decision-making&#x0201d; (MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As an instrument for the assessment of the primary outcome the observer-based instrument MAPPIN-O<sub>dyad</sub> of the MAPPIN-inventory will be applied. It assesses the mutual SDM behavior of physicians and patients based on video recordings.</p><p>Informed choice would have been a suitable endpoint, too. The intervention addresses the enhancement of patient participation, which is part of SDM. The estimation of patient participation requires an analysis of the decision-making process and its communicative details. Informed choice is an outcome measure, which correlates with patient participation, but it is not congruent. Therefore, the process itself is the primary endpoint of the study, and further outcome variables have been defined as secondary endpoints. A list of all outcomes is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcome parameters</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_991_Figa_HTML" id="MO2"/></table-wrap></p><p>MAPPIN-O<sub>dyad</sub> is one part of the MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM inventory that enables the appraisal of medical decision communication with three perspectives: physician, patient and observer. The aim of the instrument is to assess the extent of patient participation. All three perspectives consist of the same SDM criteria contained in analogous items. The relevant evaluation unit is the dyad of physician and patient. Physician and patient assess how they perceived the mutual SDM process. The observer rates the SDM behavior of the physician and patient and of the interaction of the dyad (physician and patient) based on video recordings.</p><p>The multifocal approach with dyad as evaluation unit is unique for SDM process assessment inventories. Other instruments either skip at least one perspective (for example, SDM-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] or focus the action of only one conversational partner, mostly the physician (for example, dyadic OPTION, OPTION 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In fact, a triangular measurement of SDM including the whole decision-making process and all participants (physician, nurse and patient) would be desirable. However, such instruments do not exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Originally, MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM has been developed to assess the communication between physician and patient. Meanwhile an adapted version for the decision talk between health care professionals and patients has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Therefore the observer-based MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM-inventory (MAPPIN-O<sub>dyad</sub>) considering the interaction of the patient with both, the physician and the nurse, will give a holistic view of the SDM process (see below). The decision-making process in the IG comprises the decision coaching by the nurse and the patient-physician consultations. In the control group (CG), the decision-making process comprises the patient-physician consultations.</p><p>The revised version of the instrument (MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM<sub>revised</sub>) is available, comprising a set of nine SDM indicators per perspective, which cover the international consensus of the essential SDM competencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>Both MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM questionnaires (healthcare provider and patient) and the observer instrument comprise 11 items (one indicator has three components). Six indicators outline the chronological order of an SDM talk. Three indicators contain meta-communicative components. All indicators are assessed on a five-point-scale from 0 to 4 (for example, observer instrument: &#x02018;competence was not observed&#x02019; to &#x02018;excellent performance&#x02019;).</p><p>For the primary outcome in the IG, two trained raters will independently rate MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM<sub>dyad</sub> for the whole decision-making process, consisting of two talks (nurse-patient and physician-patient). In a second step, they build a consensus. In the last step, we will calculate mean values of the final scores for the primary endpoint.</p><p>In the CG, the decision-making process is limited to the patient-physician consultations. The rating procedure is identical to the IG, but the decision-making process comprises only one consultation (physician-patient).</p><p>Test quality of an observer-instrument consists of several data.

The reliability and validity of the observer data are relevant as well. Previous research has shown adequate interrater-reliability (mean T&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45). Validity calculations were conducted by sensitivity and specificity measurement in comparison to one SDM-expert.

Otherwise, missing values will be imputed as described below.</p><p>Physicians or decision coaches might not record their encounter with patients so that no video material for analysis will be available. If no part of the decision-making process has been recorded, the overall mean score values of MAPPIN-O<sub>dyad</sub> will be imputed in the calculation of the primary endpoint. It is expected that only very few cases of imputation will occur (maximum of about 5&#x000a0;% in each group). A secondary sensitivity analyses will be performed after excluding patients with imputed values of the primary outcome.</p><p>Secondary outcomes will be analyzed with a complete case analysis. Questionnaires exceeding 20&#x000a0;% of missing values will be excluded from analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].

The process evaluation contributes to a deeper understanding of the relation between the components of the intervention and the intervention effectiveness or failure. We used the guidance for process evaluation of cluster-randomized trials by Grant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. It includes the following process evaluation components: trial delivery, intervention implementation and the responses of targeted participants. Following Grant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], we distinguish between clusters and individuals to address the specifics of a cluster-randomized trial.

As yet, decision coaches have not been implemented in standard care in oncology in the German healthcare system. An environmental scan of L&#x000e9;gar&#x000e9; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] reveals that inter-professional approaches of shared decision-making are lacking. The intervention has advantages such as the low-threshold offer for patients and continuity of care. The strength of the study is that our outcome focuses on the mutual SDM behavior of all involved parties. However, we could not take into account the perceived SDM behavior of the involved parties in our primary outcome, since no validated compound measure for inter-professional SDM exists.</p><p>Our primary endpoint assesses the extent of SDM of the whole decision-making processes. Each process is based on two talks in the IG and one talk in the CG due to our structural intervention. Talking with two health care professionals may result in higher overall SDM performance. Hence, systematic differences in this outcome are possible. In the IG, the decision-making process is split. In this respect, focusing only one talk would skip part of the whole process. Applying one holistic measurement for the process in the IG will meet this doubt.</p><p>In addition, using MAPPIN&#x02019;SDM for decision-making processes comprising two talks has not been validated yet. To estimate construct validity, interrater reliabilities will be computed and the consensus ratings of two independent raters will be used to calculate the primary endpoint.</p><p>The study has limitations, since blinding of clusters, women and assessors is not possible. Since the allocation of women is not concealed, a selection or participation bias may occur.</p><p>The potential selection bias of participating women is challenging. Physicians might not ask every eligible woman, because of implicit assumptions of eligibility for example, age or educational background. This issue will be discussed with all participating physicians. The number of eligible women will be monitored in all centers. In addition, strategies to speak to eligible women will be discussed and a guideline for physicians will be provided.</p><p>One further limitation is that some breast care centers already involve specialized nurses in counselling of women prior to the treatment decision. Because we only focus on the physician consultation in the control group, we might overlook the SDM behavior of nurses that would lead to an improvement of the extent of SDM in the control group. We will record if nurses are part of the usual counselling process prior to randomization, but the extent and quality of possible nurse counselling regarding SDM will not be quantified. Within the scope of process evaluation, we video tape these nurse encounters, too.</p><p>The video recordings might influence healthcare professionals due to the artificial situation. However, this effect might occur in both groups.</p><p>The cluster design has been chosen to avoid contamination between study arms. However, breast care nurses are organized in networks and might exchange information about the study intervention.</p><p>We defined seeking a second opinion as exclusion criterion. Women might have already been included in the study in the center they visited first and should not be asked for participation a second time.</p><p>In summary, the results will indicate if decision coaches will improve informed shared decision-making in oncology and which resources and conditions are necessary to implement the new model in certified breast care centers in Germany.</p><sec id="Sec44"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>Modifications or amendments that have an impact on the conduct of the study will be documented and unveiled in further publications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All members of the research team will practice professional secrecy.
