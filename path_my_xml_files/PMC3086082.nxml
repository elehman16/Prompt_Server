Patients were monitored monthly for safety assessments. Modified Rodnan skin scores (MRSS) were assessed every 3 months. Pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, echocardiography and skin biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-four patients completed 12 months of therapy. 171 adverse events (AE) with possible relation to imatinib were identified; 97.6% were grade 1 or 2. Twenty-four serious AE were identified, two of which were attributed to study medication. MRSS decreased by 6.6 points or 22.4% at 12 months (p=0.001). This change was evident starting at the 6-month time point (&#x00394;=&#x02212;4.5; p&#x0003c;0.001) and was seen in patients with both early and late-stage disease. Forced vital capacity (FVC) improved by 6.4% predicted (p=0.008), and the diffusion capacity remained stable. The improvement in FVC was significantly greater in patients without interstitial lung disease. Health-related quality of life measures improved or remained stable. Blinded dermatopathological analysis confirmed a significant decrease in skin thickness and improvement in skin morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with imatinib was tolerated by most patients in this cohort. Although AE were common, most were mild to moderate. In this open-label experience, improvements in skin thickening and FVC were observed. Further investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibition for dcSSc in a double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial is warranted.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT00555581</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem, fibrosing disorder in which vasculopathy, autoimmunity and inflammation lead to morbidity and increased mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Abnormal signalling through the transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and the platelet-derived growth factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> axes contributes to this pathological fibrosis. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against c-Abl, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and other tyrosine kinases and is a therapy of interest for SSc because of its ability to interfere with both TGF&#x003b2; and platelet-derived growth factor signalling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>Combined inhibition of both TGF&#x003b2; and PDGFR signalling by imatinib has been shown to decrease the production of extracellular matrix proteins by both scleroderma and normal skin fibroblasts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> In murine models of both early and established cutaneous fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, imatinib treatment was beneficial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Similar effects were seen with nilotinib and dasatinib, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that also block c-abl and PDGFR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>Case reports of the use of imatinib in patients with SSc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> and mixed connective tissue disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> have suggested clinical benefit.

Patients were stratified by disease duration defined as onset of first symptom of SSc apart from Raynaud's phenomenon: group 1 (n=20) less than 4 years and group 2 (n=10) 4&#x02013;10 years.</p><p>All subjects were over 18 years old, had a stable modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) of 16 points or more in the month between screening and baseline visits, and had disease duration of less than 10 years. Exclusion criteria included treatment with immunosuppressive therapies 3 months before baseline (including prednisone equivalent &#x0003e;10 mg), pregnancy, serious medical conditions, diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) less than 30% predicted, or ejection fraction (EF) less than 50% (see supplementary material, available online only).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an investigator-initiated phase IIa, single-centre, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of imatinib in patients with dcSSc as assessed by the number of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the MRSS after 12 months of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO on pulmonary function testing (PFT) after 1 year of treatment, change in the short form 36 mental and physical components and change in scleroderma health assessment questionnaire disability index.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the Hospital for Special Surgery and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines. Patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. An independent data and safety monitoring board regularly reviewed safety data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00555581).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Patients were assessed at monthly visits for AE ascertainment, interval history, physical examination and clinical laboratories, and were to call our centre for issues between visits. AE were listed according to the National Cancer Institute's common terminology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> The MRSS was measured at screening, 1 month later at baseline and every 3 months. MRSS measurements were performed by the same physician at each visit (RS or both RS and JKG) PFT with measurement of FVC and DLCO were performed at baseline and following 12 months of therapy and are available on 22 completers.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Treatment</title><p>All patients were treated with imatinib at a target dose of 400 mg daily by mouth for 12 months. Dose modifications and interruptions were made for AE and were recorded. After 12 months of treatment, imatinib was stopped for 3 months. Patients were reassessed and offered entrance to an extension phase of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Dermatopathology</title><p>Four-millimetre punch biopsies of lesional forearm skin were performed before and after 12 months of treatment in 24 completers. The post-treatment biopsy was taken 1 cm adjacent to the original biopsy. Nineteen pairs were bisected. Half were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and half were stored for RNA extraction. The five final samples were prospectively reserved and submitted in entirety for RNA extraction to preserve adequate RNA quantity for microarray and follow-up confirmatory studies. The six patients who did not complete the study did not have follow-up biopsies. Sections were stained with H&#x00026;E, anti-&#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin, Masson trichrome and elastin using standard techniques. A dermatopathologist (CM), blinded to before or after treatment status, compared the paired specimens.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint was a description of AE and SAE, and for this descriptive data are provided. No power calculation was performed for safety measurements, because there was no statistical analysis to be performed without a comparison group. The MRSS was the primary efficacy endpoint. Given a 5&#x000b1;8 unit difference in MRSS, based on a minimally clinically important difference of 5 points,26 a sample size of 30 was needed for a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 90% power. Analysis of all patients remaining on medication and reaching efficacy endpoints at months 3 (n=27), 6 (n=26), 9 (n=26) and 12 (n=24) is shown below as per our predefined protocol. A post-hoc modified intent-to-treat analysis including all patients with follow-up data, was also performed and was not different (not shown). In the case of missing data points, we utilised last observation carried forward. Paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare outcome measures before and after treatment, and unpaired t tests were used for comparisons between groups of patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-three patients were screened, 35 met entry criteria and five declined consent.

One patient with severe ILD and pulmonary artery hypertension died from pneumonia and respiratory failure. As the patient was not neutropenic, had tolerated imatinib without evidence of fluid overload for 11 months, and there was no apparent volume overload during the event; the death was not felt to be medication related. Thirteen of the 24 SAE, including all seven hospitalisations for haemorrhagic cystitis, occurred in a single patient and were primarily complications of previous treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide with autologous stem cell transplant. The haemorrhagic cystitis was a pre-existing problem before trial entry. One imatinib-related SAE was fluid overload with bilateral pleural effusions, which required hospitalisation for diuresis. This episode occurred in the context of the patient receiving fluid resuscitation for a severe haemorrhoidal bleed. The patient subsequently tolerated reintroduction and treatment with imatinib 300 mg daily with concomitant furosemide administration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Chest radiography and echocardiography</title><p>Postero-antero and lateral chest radiographs and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment.

One patient with ILD developed increased infiltrates on the follow-up study, which was further evaluated with high resolution CT and found to be unchanged from baseline.</p><p>Three patients had echocardiographic changes during the course of the trial, two of which were of clinical significance. One patient, who did not complete the trial, developed cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure at a point when she had largely discontinued the medication. The patient's treating physicians felt the cardiomyopathy was a result of ischaemic heart disease and was tachyarrhythmia mediated, and the investigators attributed this SAE as possibly related to imatinib. Two additional patients had declines in EF as noted on surveillance echocardiography from baseline normal EF to EF of 50&#x02013;55%. One patient followed up with a cardiac MRI and was found to have a normal EF of 60%. The other patient underwent a multigated image acquisition scan, which confirmed the decline in EF. This patient had experienced disease progression in pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations, and the cardiomyopathy was felt to be most likely related to the progression of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Modified Rodnan skin score</title><p>There was a significant improvement of the MRSS over the course of 1 year with treatment with imatinib.

This study represents the largest prospective trial of imatinib in dcSSc reported to date. Our results indicate acceptable safety and tolerability, and suggest the potential efficacy of imatinib for cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations of dcSSc, as well as benefit in patient-derived subjective outcomes. The strengths of this study include the number of patients treated, its prospective design and its relatively long duration. The obvious weakness is the open-label design and lack of a control group, making attribution of improvements in clinical outcomes as well as of AE and SAE uncertain. Furthermore, this was a heterogeneous population in terms of disease duration, organ system involvement and previous treatment history, making it difficult to compare this experience with trials including only early active SSc patients.</p><p>While patients in our trial had relatively early disease (mean disease duration 3.4 years), we prospectively elected to enroll 10 patients with later disease (4&#x02013;10 years), appreciating that this subgroup is also in need of better therapies. Their inclusion in this pilot study was necessary to establish the tolerability and safety of this potentially antifibrotic therapy in later-stage patients, which would be requisite for their inclusion in future controlled studies. We recognise that including this subgroup adds to the difficulty in interpreting the significance of the improvements observed in our trial. Encouragingly, however, similar improvements were also seen in patients with very early (&#x0003c;18 months) disease duration. Nevertheless, definitive conclusions regarding efficacy cannot be drawn from an open-label experience, especially noting that spontaneous improvements in skin scores can be seen even in patients with early stage dcSSc in clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> or observational studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Although the blinded dermatopathological assessments support our clinical findings, attribution of these improvements to treatment is uncertain without a longitudinal control group.</p><p>A large number of AE and SAE were recognised during this 1-year trial, which may relate in part to our patients' significant disease burden. However, 80% of patients enrolled were able to complete a full year of therapy. This number compares favourably to what has been observed in other clinical trials in scleroderma,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> but not surprisingly is less than what has been seen in trials of CML.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Oedema, myalgia and fatigue were frequent side effects, but were manageable, and infrequently led to withdrawal from our study. Cardiac toxicity has been reported as a rare complication of imatinib in CML, particularly in patients with concurrent risk factors for cardiomyopathy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> making it an important concern in SSc. Two patients in our study did develop cardiac issues that were not felt to be likely related to imatinib given the individuals' clinical contexts; nevertheless, vigilance for this potential complication is prudent.</p><p>Our recognition of improvement in indices of pulmonary function during this 1-year trial is of unclear significance. There was a statistically significant improvement in FVC and stabilisation of DLCO at 1 year. However, not all of our patients had ILD, and the clinical significance of this improvement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> in patients without appreciable ILD at baseline is uncertain. One possible explanation is that this observed improvement in FVC may relate to amelioration of chest wall tightening rather than effects on parenchymal lung disease. Importantly, a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis did not show benefit of imatinib therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>In conclusion, this study represents the largest and longest open-label trial of imatinib in SSc. Side effects were common, but most patients tolerated the medication. Signals of potential efficacy were observed in MRSS, FVC and patient-derived quality of life indices. These findings cannot be definitively attributed to medication effect in an uncontrolled trial but deserve further investigation. A prospective randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial is warranted to define more clearly whether there is a role for tyrosine kinase inhibition in the treatment of dcSSc.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> This study was supported by the Rudolph Rupert Scleroderma Program at the Hospital for Special Surgery and by Novartis Pharmaceuticals who provided drug as well as partial financial support.
