A wide variety of therapeutic approaches to alleviate affective and behavioral problems of child-adolescent abuse cases have been recently introduced by researchers among them and as a new option is trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) in abused children. TF-CBT was first introduced by Deblinger <italic>et al</italic>. and was basically designed to lessen the sexually abused children problems. The method was then utilized for other hurtful experiences such as physical and mental abuse.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have made comparisons between TF-CBT and other therapy methods such as supportive therapy, child-centered play therapy, and community-based therapy which reported remarkable recoveries for abused children after TF-CBT.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this modality, the child is managed in a controlled environment to re-expose to signs which recall him/her the unpleasant experiences.

Since we could not find studies assessing TF-CBT effects on social self-efficacy in our data search, similar studies are mentioned afterward.
