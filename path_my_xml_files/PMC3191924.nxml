Direct assessment includes detection of the drug in biologic fluids, direct observation, and detection of biological markers. The common advantage of direct methods assessment is greater certainty that the drug has been consumed because there is no reliance on the truthfulness of the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-5-475">2</xref> Direct methods are not utilized as often as indirect methods because of cost feasibility. Detection of metabolites or drugs in biologic fluids such as blood or urine is a quantitative measure. This method of measurement is very accurate as it can confirm recent use of medication by detecting the levels in bodily fluids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-5-475">11</xref> Disadvantages include a limited time frame to use this measure, kinetic variations among individuals, high cost, and inconvenience to the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-5-475">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> Direct observation assessment includes visually observing the patient consuming the medication. Advantages of this type of assessment include visual confirmation of medication consumption. However, direct observation is impractical for daily use and patients can hide pills in their mouths and later throw them away.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-5-475">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref></p><p>Indirect methods of assessment, such as questionnaires, diaries, clinical response, prescription refills, electronic medication monitors, and pill counts, rely upon self-assessment by the patient, but the uncertainty about whether a patient has, in fact, consumed the medication is a disadvantage of indirect assessment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-5-475">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> Questionnaires and diaries are the most basic level of self-reporting. They are advantageous because they help with recall, are effective in a clinical setting, and are efficient in understanding a patient&#x02019;s medication regimen. These methods are subject to recall bias and misinterpretation of questions may lead to over estimation of patient adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-5-475">12</xref> In general the rate of medication refill is an accurate method to evaluate medication adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> The rates of prescription refills are a rapid and easy way to measure medication adherence. In a Health Maintenance Organization or Universal Health Care system this is an effective way for physicians and health care providers to gain a scope of adherence. The major disadvantage to this methodology is that obtaining the medication is not equivalent to consuming or utilizing the medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> Electronic monitoring of medication adherence is achieved through the use of the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). MEMS has the ability to record and stamp the time of opening medication bottles, dispensing drops, or activation of canister.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> This type of device provides accuracy and precision on the exact timing of medication and regimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-5-475">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> While MEMS is a valid and reliable measure, there are many disadvantages to this method of analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-5-475">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref> First, the removal of the medication cap does not confirm that the patient actually took the medication. In addition, the poor health of smokers indicates that many of these individuals take a variety of medications for smoking attributable conditions. Therefore many smokers do not use individual medication bottles due to the number of medications they are prescribed; it is easier to use pill boxes for organization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-5-475">12</xref> These logistics suggest a major barrier in the use of MEMS for smokers and tobacco cessation medication adherence. In addition, MEMS technology is fairly expensive and unfeasible outside of clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-5-475">14</xref> Due to disadvantages and inconsistencies in other measures, the pill count is a commonly used indirect adherence measure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ppa-5-475">15</xref></p><p>Pill counts are an established, objective method for assessing medication adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-5-475">16</xref> However, they are limited by a number of factors. Notably, pill counts are typically conducted in-person and can be a burden to participants by requiring them to come to a clinic and remember to bring their medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-5-475">17</xref> In-person pill counts may also be inaccurate if participants remove medications from their container in anticipation of a pill count. Unannounced pill counts completed by telephone may be a viable and more practical alternative. Unannounced telephone pill counts have been examined as an alternative to in-person pill counts in other health domains,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-5-475">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-5-475">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-5-475">20</xref> but to our knowledge, have not been examined as a tool for assessing adherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Given the potential for pharmacotherapy adherence to improve tobacco treatment outcomes but the lack of objective, practical assessment tools, this study examined unannounced telephone pill counts for assessing adherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy by comparing telephone counts to in-person counts completed approximately 4 days later. Demographic, psychosocial, and medication/treatment-related differences were also examined between participants who had perfectly concordant vs discrepant telephone and in-person pill counts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Parent study</title><p>The parent pilot trial, described in detail elsewhere, examined a behavioral intervention to encourage medication compliance among African-American smokers taking varenicline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ppa-5-475">9</xref> Participants were recruited through clinic-based efforts, including lobby recruitment and the use of posters and flyers, as well as through a tracking database of participants ineligible for another study who had given their consent to be contacted for future studies.

Findings from this study suggest that unannounced telephone pill counts may be a viable and practical alternative for objectively measuring pharmacotherapy adherence in smoking cessation clinical trials.</p><p>Unannounced telephone pill counts may be more feasible to implement than in-person counts and have a number of advantages over other approaches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-5-475">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-5-475">19</xref> Unannounced telephone pill counts minimize many challenges associated with office-based pill counts (eg, dumping pills in anticipation of a pill count, forgetting medication for the office visit) and reduce participant burden (eg, time and travel), which allows for more regular monitoring of medication taking. Nearly half of the participants in this study were contacted on their first attempt, with the majority being contacted on the first or second attempt. Telephone pill counts also cost less than in-person counts. The cost per telephone pill count in this study was $2.18 compared to $7.24 for the in-person counts. These figures are similar to a study conducted by Kalichman et al which found that phone-based pill counts cost $7.65, on average, compared to $19.61 for in-person counts, and suggests that telephone pill counts are more cost effective to implement than in-person counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-5-475">20</xref></p><p>Pill boxes were used in this study to simplify and improve the accuracy of the pill count protocol &#x02013; ie, participants opened each pill box compartment and reported the number of pills remaining; they did not have to remove varenicline from pill bottles, sort, and count their medication using pharmacy trays, an approach that may be prone to lost pills and counting errors. Although other studies have shown that pill boxes may lead to increased error and misreporting,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-5-475">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-5-475">20</xref> pill boxes appeared to be useful in this study. The mean rate of adherence to varenicline was 92%. This is consistent with research showing that adherence to medications is higher among participants who use a pill box compared to those who do not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ppa-5-475">47</xref> We did not have a no-pill box comparison group in this study, and cannot conclude that the use of pill boxes led to increased adherence. However, pill boxes are a method of organization; participants can open a compartment to easily determine whether they have taken the medication on a given day compared to a pill bottle where the determination of whether medication has been taken is more difficult. Given the use of pill boxes as a common adherence aid and previous research that has found that pill boxes increase medication adherence by as much as 5% compared to a no-pill box condition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ppa-5-475">47</xref> we speculate that pill boxes used in conjunction with unannounced telephone monitoring could improve medication adherence and, in turn, increase rates of smoking abstinence. Pill boxes may also be preferred over other methods of medication monitoring. In a community-based sample of predominately low-income African-American women with hypertension, one-third preferred a pill box over a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic bottle cap that records the exact date and times that bottles are opened,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ppa-5-475">48</xref> suggesting that pill boxes may be a better tool for monitoring adherence in some populations.</p><p>The study has limitations. First, this is a pilot study with a small sample size comprised of mostly African-American women recruited from a single community health center; therefore results may not generalize to a more diverse sample. Second, due to the small sample size and the relatively low number of participants with discrepant counts, comparisons between participants with concordant and discrepant pill counts were limited in the power to detect statistically significant differences and the differences found should be interpreted with caution. Finally, it is possible that participants anticipated having their medications counted during the Month 1 refill visit and removed pills after the unannounced telephone pill count. We safeguarded against this possibility by blinding participants to both pill counts. In addition, we achieved concordance rates for pills counted that are similar to those achieved in studies where in-person counts were completed immediately following telephone counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-5-475">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-5-475">20</xref></p><p>Further research is needed among a larger and more diverse sample to confirm and improve the generalizability of the findings. Research is also needed to compare the utility of unannounced telephone pill counts for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy with other objective methods of medication monitoring &#x02013; eg, MEMS, immediate in-person unannounced pill counts. Studies in other health domains have found a high degree of concordance between unannounced telephone pill counts and electronic (MEMS) monitoring,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-5-475">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-5-475">18</xref> but this should be confirmed with smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Each method has its respective advantages and disadvantages. Telephone pill counts may be preferred among some populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ppa-5-475">48</xref> and may lend themselves best to non-nicotine therapies &#x02013; ie, varenicline, bupropion. Methods for monitoring use of NRTs &#x02013; ie, nicotine gum, patch, nasal spray, inhaler, and lozenge &#x02013; warrant further attention.</p><p>In conclusion, better strategies are needed to monitor medication adherence in smoking cessation clinical trials. Unannounced telephone pill counts may represent one such approach. Telephone pill counts are feasible and may reduce burden and costs compared to in-person counts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Contributors: None to report.</p><p>Funder: This study was supported by a grant from the (University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS) and a contract from (Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY) (GA3051YA).
