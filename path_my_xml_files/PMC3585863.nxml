Recent work suggests that with ageing skeletal muscle tissue becomes less sensitive to the main anabolic stimuli, i.e. food intake and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The proposed blunted muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion, coined &#x0201c;anabolic resistance&#x0201d;, has been suggested to represent a key factor responsible for the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Consequently, many research groups have started to look for dietary strategies that stimulate post-prandial muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Dietary protein has been identified as the main factor driving the muscle protein synthetic response to food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, other macronutrients may modulate the post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion.</p><p>Previous work suggests that carbohydrate co-ingestion with protein stimulates post-prandial muscle protein accretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The latter could be attributed to the higher energy intake and/or the greater post-prandial insulin release following carbohydrate co-ingestion. In agreement, higher insulin concentrations have been reported to stimulate muscle protein synthesis rates under conditions of hyperaminoacidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, there is an on-going debate on whether circulating insulin levels regulate muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Based on a series of clamp studies that assessed muscle protein synthesis rates at various levels of circulating insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it has been proposed that insulin is merely permissive, rather than modulatory, to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in healthy young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, this paradigm regarding the proposed permissive role of post-prandial insulin concentrations may not be applicable in older individuals. Higher insulin concentrations may be required to allow an appropriate post-prandial rise in muscle protein synthesis rates in the elderly population. The stimulation of endogenous insulin release following food intake represents a key factor driving post-prandial perfusion, allowing subsequent amino acid delivery to the muscle, facilitating amino acid uptake and/or activating anabolic signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The decreased insulin sensitivity observed with ageing is associated with blunted endothelial-dependent vasodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has therefore been proposed that senescent muscle is more resistant to the stimulating effect of post-prandial insulin levels on muscle perfusion and, as such, amino acid delivery to the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In agreement, work by Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has shown that local insulin administration in older adults increases muscle protein synthesis rates. These studies suggest that increasing post-prandial insulin release following food intake may augment amino acid delivery to the muscle, thereby increasing post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates in the older population.</p><p>We hypothesize that co-ingesting carbohydrate increases the post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of a meal-like bolus of protein in healthy older men. Therefore, we selected 24 older men (age: 75&#x000b1;1 y) in whom we determined the muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of 20 g dietary protein with or without 40 g carbohydrate during a 6 h post-prandial period.

Subjects completed a health and activity questionnaire and underwent an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) to screen for type 2 diabetes according to the criteria set out by the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Venous plasma glucose and insulin concentrations determined during the OGTT were used to determine the oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

A polytetrafluoroethylene catheter was inserted into a heated dorsal hand vein after which the hand was placed in a hot box (60&#x000b0;C) to allow arterialized venous blood sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. After a basal arterialized blood sample was collected, a fasting muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle. Subjects then ingested a single bolus of test drink containing 20 g intrinsically L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine labeled casein. In the PRO-CHO group, 40 g carbohydrate (50% dextrose monohydrate; Avebe Food, Veendam, the Netherlands, 50% maltodextrin; AppliChem GmbH, Darmstand, Germany) was added to the test drink. The consumption of the test drink with or without carbohydrate marked the beginning (<italic>t</italic>= 0 min) of a 6 h post-prandial assessment period.

The L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichment in the casein fraction averaged 37.4 mole percent excess (MPE). The casein protein met all chemical and bacteriological specifications for human consumption. Subjects received a total beverage volume of 450 mL, which provided 20 g casein protein.

Collagen, blood, and other non-muscle fibre material were removed from the muscle fibres under a light microscope. The isolated muscle fibre mass was weighed, and 35 volumes (7 &#x000d7; dry weight of isolated muscle fibres &#x000d7; wet/dry weight ratio) of ice-cold 2% perchloric acid were added. The tissue was then homogenized by sonification (3 &#x000d7; 10 sec with 10 sec in-between time intervals) and centrifuged (at 1160 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C). The supernatant was collected and processed in the same manner as the plasma samples, such that tissue-free L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichment could be measured by using its TBDMS derivative on a GC-MS. The protein pellet was washed with 3 additional 1 mL washes of 2% perchloric acid, dried, and hydrolysed in 6 M HCl at 120&#x000b0;C for 15 to 18 h. The hydrolysed protein fraction was dried under a nitrogen stream while heated to 120&#x000b0;C. A 50% acetic acid solution was then added, and the hydrolysed protein was passed over a Dowex exchange resin (AG 50W-X8, 100&#x02013;200 mesh hydrogen form; Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) by using 1M HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O and 2 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH as eluents. The NH<sub>4</sub>OH fraction was collected and used for further analysis. L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichment was determined by derivatisation to its <italic>N(O,S)</italic>-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester. The enrichment of the derivative was measured by GC-C-IRMS (MAT 253; Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) by using an HP-Ultra 1 GC-column (no. 19091A-112; Hewlett Packard, USA), GC Isolink, and monitoring of ion masses 44, 45 and 46. By establishing the relationship between the enrichment of a series of L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine standards of variable enrichment and the enrichment of the <italic>N(O,S)</italic>-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl esters of these standards, the muscle protein-bound enrichment of phenylalanine was determined. Standard regression curves were applied to assess the linearity of the mass spectrometer and to control for the loss of tracer.

In case of a significant interaction between time and treatment, Bonferroni post-tests were applied to locate the differences. Differences between treatments in iAUC of plasma glucose and insulin, muscle free and protein-bound L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichments and mixed muscle FSR were analysed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student&#x02019;s t-Test. Correlations between plasma and muscle free L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichments were assessed by calculation Pearson&#x02019;s correlations coefficients. Statistical significance was set at P&#x0003c;0.05. All calculations were performed by using the PASW statistics 18.0.3 software package.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Plasma glucose and insulin</title><p>Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the PRO and PRO-CHO experiment are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

We compared the post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response after ingesting a single meal-like (20 g) amount of dietary protein with or without 40 g carbohydrate in healthy older men. Carbohydrate co-ingestion strongly stimulated post-prandial insulin release. However, carbohydrate co-ingestion did not augment the post-prandial use of the ingested protein derived amino acids for muscle protein synthesis during a 6 h post-prandial period in healthy older men.</p><p>Previous work suggests that co-ingestion of other macronutrients with protein may modulate the post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the present study, we assessed whether post-prandial muscle protein accretion following the ingestion of a meal-like amount of casein protein could be augmented by adding 40 g carbohydrate. Therefore, we applied specifically produced intrinsically L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine labeled dietary protein which allowed us to assess the metabolic fate of the ingested protein towards its incorporation into muscle protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Importantly, this allows us to investigate the impact of carbohydrate co-ingestion in a more physiological (i.e. bolus feeding) setting. Carbohydrate co-ingestion strongly elevated plasma insulin concentrations with peak values of 138&#x000b1;18 vs. 34&#x000b1;5 mU <sup>.</sup> L<sup>-1</sup>, in the PRO-CHO and PRO experiment, respectively. After 90 min, plasma insulin concentrations no longer differed between experimental conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the greater insulin response seemed to modulate the plasma amino acid kinetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Carbohydrate co-ingestion attenuated the post-prandial rise in plasma amino acid concentrations, mainly the branched chain amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Plasma [1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichments were also significantly lower in the PRO-CHO vs. PRO experiment, during the first 90 min after protein ingestion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The attenuated rise in plasma phenylalanine concentration and [1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine enrichment following carbohydrate co-ingestion coincided with the greater rise in circulating insulin levels, implying that (muscle) tissue amino acid uptake was accelerated during the early post-prandial phase in the PRO-CHO experiment.</p><p>An insulin induced stimulation of amino acid uptake could allow a more rapid provision of amino acids available for muscle protein synthesis. In accordance, we observed a tendency for a greater incorporation rate of dietary protein derived L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine into skeletal muscle protein during the first 2 hours after protein ingestion when carbohydrate was co-ingested (P=0.13; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The suggested impact of carbohydrate ingestion on muscle protein accretion during the early post-prandial phase was not maintained. Incorporation of dietary protein derived L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine into skeletal muscle protein during the 6 h following protein ingestion did not differ between experimental conditions and averaged 0.0213&#x000b1;0.0024 and 0.0185&#x000b1;0.0010 MPE in PRO-CHO and PRO, respectively (P=0.30; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). From these data we can conclude that carbohydrate co-ingestion may accelerate, but does not modify the metabolic fate of dietary protein derived amino acids for muscle protein synthesis over a 6 h post-prandial period in older men.</p><p>Our results suggest that the post-prandial insulin response following ingestion of 20 g casein only was already sufficient to maximize insulin-mediated stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. This finding is consistent with Greenhaff <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] who demonstrated that under clamp conditions insulin concentrations of merely 5&#x02013;15 mU<sup>.</sup>L<sup>-1</sup> are already sufficient to allow maximal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis rate during hyperaminoacidemic conditions in healthy young men. However, the latter has been questioned for the older population, as insulin resistance in senescent muscle has been associated with impaired insulin stimulated endothelial-dependent vasodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that higher post-prandial insulin concentrations are required to maximize the muscle protein synthetic response to food intake in the older population. Though the present data indicate that a greater post-prandial insulin response in the older population may accelerate the use of dietary protein derived amino acids for muscle protein synthesis, this does not modulate the total 6 h post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response. Discrepancies between the present results and previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] may be attributed to differences in study design with the other studies using a continuous supply of extra amino acids and/or carbohydrate rather than a single bolus. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response cannot be further increased in the elderly population. Recently, we showed that by ingesting more protein (35 over 20 g), post-prandial dietary protein derived amino acid incorporation rates can be further improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Though we can only speculate on the impact of carbohydrate co-ingestion and/or greater insulin release on post-prandial muscle protein synthesis following ingestion of greater amounts of dietary protein, these combined findings may be used to suggest that more protein dense meals should be consumed by elderly and/or more clinically compromised populations.</p><p>The observation that additional carbohydrate ingestion is not required to optimize post-prandial muscle protein synthesis is of important clinical relevance. With a proposed blunted muscle protein synthetic response in the elderly population, the need for proper dietary intervention is well recognized. Therefore, protein supplementation is presently being used in clinical practice to prevent or attenuate muscle loss in the older population. However, in the light of preventing excess energy intake and hyperglycemic blood glucose excursions it has been questioned what food products or specifically designed nutritional supplements would be preferred to maximize post-prandial muscle protein accretion. The present study shows that large amounts of carbohydrate are definitely not required to maximize post-prandial muscle protein accretion to the ingestion of a single 20 g bolus of dietary protein, suggesting that products high in protein and low in carbohydrate are as effective to stimulate muscle protein synthesis without increasing energy intake.</p><p>We conclude that carbohydrate ingestion may accelerate, but does not further augment post-prandial incorporation of dietary protein derived amino acids into muscle protein in healthy elderly men. This implies that ingestion of carbohydrate is not required to optimize post-prandial muscle protein accretion in the older population. This has important clinical relevance for the development of clinical nutrition for the elderly population.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; FSR: Fractional synthetic rate; HOMA: Homeostasis model assessment; MPE: Mole percent excess; OGIS: Oral glucose insulin sensitivity; OGTT: Oral-glucose-tolerance test.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors report that there are no financial or non-financial conflicts of interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LBV and LJCvL conceived of the study; HMH, BTW, AK, BBLG and AdL carried out the human intervention study; HMH and BTW performed the statistical analysis; JAB and APG performed the biological analyses; HMH and LJCvL drafted the manuscript.
