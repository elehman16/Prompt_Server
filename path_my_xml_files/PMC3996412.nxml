training on balance ability of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Forty
stroke patients were allocated equally and randomly to an experimental group and a control
group. The experimental group undertook 30 minutes of training therapy and 30 minutes of
walking exercise on stairs with flat surfaces. The control group undertook 30 minutes went
of training therapy and 30 minutes of walking exercise on a flat surface. All the
participants had five training sessions each week for four weeks. A Biorescue system was
used to measure the weight-bearing footprint, anterior length in the limit of stability,
posterior length in the limit of stability, surface area ellipse of Romberg, and length of
Romberg before and after the training. [Results] With regard to changes in the
weight-bearing footprint, the anterior length in the limit of stability, and the posterior
length in the limit of stability, there were significant differences on both the paretic
and nonparetic sides, and there were also significant differences in the surface area
ellipse of Romberg and length of Romberg after the intervention. [Conclusion] The
experiment results showed that walking exercise on stairs is effective in enhancing
balance performance. The same exercise can be applied to patients with other types of
neurological disorders to improve their balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Strokes</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Stair gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with hemiplegia due to stroke develop asymmetric postures the lower limbs on their

will make them independent from others when they perform daily living activities and is
something that must be emphasized in treatment processes for these patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking and balance in stroke patients are
ability are very closely related. Therefore, walking training is considered to greatly
affect the locomotion of stroke patients<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients frequently use stairs during their daily lives. Walking on stairs has been
reported to require more dynamic effort compared with walking on a flat surface because each
step begins from the toes and the sole rather than the heel. In addition, upward and forward
forces are required to support the person&#x02019;s weight, and the ability to control against falls
is required when going down the stairs. Thus, a sense of balance and the power are required
when walking on stairs during<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Improving the balance of stroke patients is an important objective in treatment programs
for patients. Previous studies have used diverse balance training methods involving, for
example, lateral weight training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,

lacking. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of stair
walking training on the balance ability of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in Hospital K in Daegu City, Korea, from March 1 to March 30,

for four weeks. The therapy room was soundproof, and the indoor temperature was kept at
25&#x000b1;5&#x02005;&#x000b0;C to maintain a stable condition of paralysis. The stair walking training in the
therapy room was carried out on stairs with steps that were 0.8&#x02005;m wide and 10&#x02005;cm high and
treads that were 38&#x02005;cm deep. Before the experiment, the study was explained to study the
subjects, and they agree to participate.</p><p>Prior to the walking exercise, the participants in both groups received 30 minutes of
general physical therapy that consisted of a joint exercise, muscle strengthening exercise,
and a stretching exercise. The experimental group then undertook stair walking training with
a physical therapist for 30 minutes in the therapy room.</p><p>Each subject in the experimental group stood in front of the stair walking training
apparatus and the therapist then assisted the patient during stair climbing by fixing the
ischium on the patients paretic side, helping popliteal flexion, and supporting the ankle if
the ankle joint was unstable. During stair descent, patient with left hemiplegia maintained
stability by supporting the lower limb above the knee joint with his/her left hand while the
physical therapist held the waist of the patient with his/her hand. When the patient&#x02019;s foot
came into contact with the stairs, the forefoot was placed first to assist weight bearing by
the knee. To prevent falls, the patient was permitted to hold the safety bar on the stairs
if nesessary<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. When any patient
complained of pain or showed abnormalities of breathing, feelings of fatigue, or vertigo
after the beginning walking training, the walking training was immediately stopped. The
control group carried out 20&#x02005;m reciprocating walking training for 30 minutes on an flat
indoor flat surface, which was hard and free of obstacles.</p><p>In the present study, a balance ability measuring and training system (analysis system
using biofeedback, AP1153 BioRescue, France) was used to measure the balance ability of the
subjects. The balance ability measuring and training system is suitable for static and
dynamic measurement of the balance ability of patients, general people, and athletes. This
system can be used to observe the moving path line of the center of pressure during certain
movements to determine the length (mm) of the moving path line, the average speed of the
movements (cm/s), and the area of the movements. In the present study, the patient was
instructed to spread his/her legs to around 30&#x000b0; in an upright standing position and look
forward. The measuring method was explained via the monitor and demonstrated before
measurement. The patient was instructed to keep his/her balance for one minute while looking
forward. The distribution of weight bearing on the paretic and nonparetic sides, the total
distance of movements of the center point of the body, and the area of the movements were
then measured. To compare the patient&#x02019;s static balance, the limit of stability in a static
standing position within which the patient could maximally move his/her center of gravity
while keeping balance in the direction instructed by the monitor using the ankle strategy in
an upright standing position was measured.</p><p>For data analysis, SPSS Win 12.0 was used. A t-test of corresponding samples was conducted
to determine the balance ability index of the two groups before and after the exercise. For
comparative analysis between the groups before and after the training, a t-test of
independent samples was conducted. The significance level (&#x003b1;) was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>With regard to changes in the weight-bearing of footprint, there was significant difference

after they took park in stair walking training (experimental group) or walking training on a
flat surface (control group) for four weeks.</p><p>With regard to changes in balance ability, the weight-bearing footprint of the experimental
group showed significantly larger differences than that of the control group. The anterior
length in the limit of stability, and the posterior length in the limit of stability showed
significant increase on both the paretic and nonparetic sides (p&#x0003c;0.05), and significantly
smaller differences than those of the control group were observed for the surface area
ellipse of Romberg and length of Romberg (p&#x0003c;0.05). The movement of the distribution of
weight bearing on the paretic and nonparetic sides toward the center of gravity is the
experimental group in likely due to the ankle strategy. Using this strategy in a static
standing position in which the maximum degree of voluntary weight bearing is high improves
balance ability by enhancing the proprioceptive sense of the ankle joint or the function to
appropriately distribute weight so that the distance of static movements of weight can be
increased.</p><p>The assessment of the speed, accuracy, and support level of weight shifts of stroke
patient&#x02019;s is the only information used to examine the recovery of balance ability in stroke
patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with hemiplegia
due to stroke not only develop asymmetric standing postures because of difficulties in
postural balance control but also show postural sway. As a result, the postures of these
patient&#x02019;s becomes more unstable, leading to them concentrating their weight on the
nonparetic side. This causes deterioration in the ability to maintain postural balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the most important focus in
the treatment of hemiplegia patients is on improving balance by imposing weight loads on the
lower limb on the paretic side, leading to symmetric standing postures<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jeong<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that symmetric weight distribution affects the limit of
stability, which is important for postural and balance control. Eng et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the ability of stroke patients
to support weight is was related to the ability to perform functional activities. They also
noted that the ability of stroke patients to move weight asymmetrically to the left and
right in static standing positions is closely related to motor functions and stages of
independent living as well as the period of hospital stay. This is because the ability to
shift weight bearing forward, backward, leftward, and rightward in a standing positions from
the paretic side is directly connected to walking. Lay et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the quadriceps femoris muscle was strengthened when
ascending a slope slope way ascending and that it reduced diverse postural sway in a static
standing position. You et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
improved results of safety limit indexes for balance in chronic stroke patients after the
application of one stair climbing training session. After the stair walking training, lower
limb on the paretic side was able to support more weight in functional postures and in the
middle of stance phases during walking, providing more stable support. The findings of You
et al. are consistent with those of the present study. In contrast to previous studies that
examined improvements in stability limit indexes after single-session experiments, the
present study investigated the ability of four weeks of training to improve the weight
distribution, stability limit indexes, and sway of stroke patients.</p><p>The balance ability of the stroke patients in the present study was improved through stair
walking training. The stair walking training likely improved the stability of the patient&#x02019;s
pelvis and trunk and contributed to an increase in lower limb muscle strength. It also
improved the weight-moving ability of the other side during stance phases, thereby
increasing the patient&#x02019;s balance ability. Clinicians can use the results of the present
study to improve the balance ability of stroke patients through balance training. The
results also provide objective evaluation data for the prediction of the functional
activities and quality of life of stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the University Research Grant of the Korean Nazarene University
