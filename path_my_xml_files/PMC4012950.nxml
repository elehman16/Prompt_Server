In response, the FDA developed a set of 9 GWs it sought to embed on all cigarette packaging in the US. After the 6<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the mandate in 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Washington DC Circuit ruled against it in 2012. The constitutionality of this legislation will likely be decided by the Supreme Court in the future, but in March, 2013, the FDA indicated that it would not ask the Court to review the federal appeal. By not challenging the ruling, the FDA avoided the possibility of a defeat that could have effectively ended government efforts to place GWs on cigarette packaging. Although one cannot be certain of the legal standard that the courts will apply in evaluating future efforts, one likely analysis hinges on whether GWs are judged to &#x0201c;directly advance&#x0201d; the government's interests in protecting Americans from the negative health effects of smoking <xref rid="pone.0096315-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This standard was applied by the DC Circuit, which argued that &#x0201c;The FDA has not provided a shred of evidence &#x02026; showing that the graphic warnings will &#x02018;directly advance&#x02019; its interest in reducing the number of Americans who smoke.&#x0201d; Some legal scholars believe that, if this standard is applied by the Supreme Court, &#x0201c;even without evidence of the impact of graphic warnings on behavior, strong evidence that they affect behavioral intent, and that intent predicts behavior, should be sufficient for the warnings to be upheld&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0096315-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (p. 334). The current project speaks to this legal standard by utilizing experimental methods to examine the effects of GWs on behavioral intention. It expands prior research by critically examining the role that smoking history and individual differences have as factors that might moderate the effect of GW exposure on behavioral intention. We explore this question using a community sample of young adults, as this is the age group in which smoking is most prevalent <xref rid="pone.0096315-US1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and so it also the group that is most likely to encounter GWs on cigarette packaging.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Current Evidence</title><p>Many tobacco researchers have advocated for the use of GWs as an important step in reducing smoking rates <xref rid="pone.0096315-Borland1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096315-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This position is supported by evidence that smoking rates have decreased in countries that have mandated GWs <xref rid="pone.0096315-Borland1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Azagba1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096315-White1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Naturalistic investigations of this kind can provide insights into the potential influence of GWs in the US, but they can be limited in two important respects. First, in terms of legal standards, courts have at times have been hesitant to draw strong inferences from data generated in countries other than the US <xref rid="pone.0096315-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, a concern expressed by The DC Circuit. If international data are similarly dismissed or viewed critically in future decisions, data on behavioral intention may be the FDA's best option to establish a government interest. Second, in terms of empirical standards, naturalistic reports have limited ability to document the influence of individual difference factors. Even if GWs have reduced smoking in other countries, national trends might hide unwanted or unintended effects. As early as 1976, Rogers and Mewborn documented that exposure to antismoking communications can have the unintended consequence of increasing smoking-related intentions, an effect now commonly referred to as a &#x0201c;boomerang effect&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0096315-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is on this basis that some have argued against GW mandates <xref rid="pone.0096315-Ruiter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Through aggregate reporting, naturalistic investigations could fail to detect subgroups for which such boomerang effects can be anticipated.</p><p>Experimental studies can provide the precision needed to identify individual difference factors that alter the influence of GWs on intention, but the current literature has given limited attention to this question. This is due in part to a practical constraint: many experiments employ sample sizes that lack the statistical power needed to test for the moderating effects of individual difference factors <xref rid="pone.0096315-Goodall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096315-Sabbane1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Compounding this limitation, the majority of studies have focused on one of two different classes of dependent variables. One class relates to self-reported reactions to GWs, with research identifying factors that increase message acceptance, perceived effectiveness and believability <xref rid="pone.0096315-Hammond2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Research of this type is critical to the design of impactful GWs, but it also is limited in that research participants often are unable to identify the factors that will influence their actual behaviors <xref rid="pone.0096315-Nolan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>A second class of variables relates to the beliefs and expectations that might be shaped by GWs. Research of this kind suggests that GWs can increase perceptions of the harm of smoking <xref rid="pone.0096315-Fathelrahman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096315-McCool1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, decrease the desirability of the smoking social image <xref rid="pone.0096315-Golmier1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, lower the desirability of cigarette purchases <xref rid="pone.0096315-Thrasher1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, increase negative affective reactions to smoking cues <xref rid="pone.0096315-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and improve recall for other health information <xref rid="pone.0096315-MacKinnon1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These changes all suggest that GWs will promote more negative and less positive attitudes towards smoking. However, changes in attitudes do not always translate into changes in behavioral intention, and modern attitude-behavior models assume this step is critical for attitudes to influence behavior <xref rid="pone.0096315-Fishbein1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. At present, evidence for the influence of GWs on intention is mixed. Some research suggests GWs decrease smoking intentions <xref rid="pone.0096315-Goodall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Kees1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, some has documented null or inconsistent effects <xref rid="pone.0096315-Nonnemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and some has revealed evidence of boomerang effects, whereby exposure to GWs increases smoking intentions <xref rid="pone.0096315-Sabbane1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The equivocal nature of experimental research on behavioral intention points to the need for studies that utilizes larger sample sizes, to determine if variability in smoking history can account for some the heterogeneity found in the published literature.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Smoking History</title><p>Young adults differ considerably in their experience with cigarettes, and so it seems unlikely that GWs will exert uniform influence on all members of this age group, independent of their smoking experiences. The majority of young adults who have not tried a cigarette will never initiate this action <xref rid="pone.0096315-US1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This suggests that, on the whole, one should expect floor effects in younger adults who have never smoked a cigarette. This group has relatively low risk of smoking, and so GWs might have little ability to further suppress behavioral intentions. The same might be expected for young adults who have smoked in the past but who have successfully transitioned into inactive smokers. Exposure to GWs might also be of limited use to those who have become daily smokers &#x02013; but for different reasons. A simple image-based intervention lacks the components typically required to promote smoking cessation in daily smokers <xref rid="pone.0096315-Fiore1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and so it seems unlikely that GWs alone can dent the strong intention to smoke among daily smokers cf., <xref rid="pone.0096315-Malouff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>This analysis suggests that GW effects on young adults might be concentrated among those who occupy the middle range of smoking experience &#x02013; those who have smoked in the past but have not transitioned into daily smokers. However, this &#x0201c;middle range&#x0201d; is a heterogeneous group <xref rid="pone.0096315-Substance1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Some young adults who smoke occasionally are in the early stages of experimenting, whereas others are in a stable pattern of intermittent use <xref rid="pone.0096315-McDermott1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This analysis suggests that GW effects will be concentrated in those who do smoke but do so less than daily. However, it is important to note that two forms of intention are predictive of smoking decisions. One pertains to the willingness to smoke in situations that promote smoking <xref rid="pone.0096315-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Pomery1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and the other to the more proactive intention to quit <xref rid="pone.0096315-Bledsoe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Occasional smokers who are in the early stages of trying cigarettes may not have developed identities as smokers, and so they might not feel they need to &#x0201c;quit&#x0201d; a behavior they don't believe they have begun <xref rid="pone.0096315-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The more they have smoked, however, the less they can engage in that logic. This suggests that GWs might shift from primarily diminishing willingness to smoke in the future among occasional smokers that are in early stages of smoking, to influencing intentions to quit smoking among those who are in a more stable patter of occasional tobacco use.</p><sec id="s1b1"><title>Adaptive versus Defensive Responding</title><p>The above predictions follow from an <italic>adaptive-response hypothesis</italic>, as they assume that those in the middle group are largely open and responsive to the information presented by GWs, though in different ways based on their past experiences. Running contrary to these assumptions are predictions that follow from a <italic>defensive-response hypothesis</italic>. This perspective on GWs is based on a large body of experimental research indicating that individuals who have engaged in risky behaviors in the past tend to react more defensively to risk-prevention messages <xref rid="pone.0096315-Albarracn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096315-Liberman1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In the domain of smoking, for instance, research suggests that smokers disengage from antismoking messages more than nonsmokers <xref rid="pone.0096315-Kessels1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and are more critical of message content <xref rid="pone.0096315-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In at least some instances, defensive reactions to prevention messages can be so strong as to produce boomerang effects <xref rid="pone.0096315-Bensley1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is based on findings such as these that some have argued against GW mandates <xref rid="pone.0096315-Ruiter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>It is unclear which groups might be most prone to reacting defensively, but the general prediction would be a stronger boomerang effects among those who would be most clearly threatened by GW message content. This might point to daily smokers as the likely candidates, although this group could evidence a &#x0201c;ceiling effect,&#x0201d; in that their smoking intention can go no higher than the normal baseline. Among occasional smokers, however, defensive reactions might be more pronounced the more cigarettes smoked over the course of their lifetime. It is these more active occasional smokers that could feel most directly criticized by antismoking GWs. Alternatively, boomerang effects might be linked, not to smoking history, but to individual difference factors that are predictive of defensive message processing. A review of the literature suggests three strong possibilities: (1) <italic>psychological reactance</italic>, which can cause individuals to resist negatively framed messages that are perceived as overly coercive <xref rid="pone.0096315-ErcegHurn1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Rains1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, (2) <italic>self-esteem</italic>, which can cause individuals to become more committed to risky behaviors in the face of critical health information <xref rid="pone.0096315-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Blanton1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and (3) <italic>sensation seeking</italic>, as a predictor of more fearful responding to social stimuli <xref rid="pone.0096315-Franken1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Lissek1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, which might lead to a documented &#x0201c;fear control&#x0201d; response that can promote defensive rejection of prevention messages <xref rid="pone.0096315-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096315-Witte1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The current study critically examined the adaptive-response and defensive-response hypotheses, by testing if the effect of GW exposure on smoking-related intentions was moderated, either by smoking history or by any of these three individual difference factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Summary of Hypotheses</title><p>We predict that GW exposure will only influence smoking-related intentions for certain subgroups of young adults, and we test competing predictions for the patterning of these effects. If adaptive response predictions hold, GW effects will be concentrated in the group of occasional smokers, although it might differentially target willingness to smoke in the future versus the intention to quit, based on severity of past smoking history. If defensive response predictions hold, GW exposure will cause boomerang effects, with stronger effects observed either in groups that have engaged in heavier smoking (i.e., occasional smokers who have longer lifetime histories of smoking and possibly daily smokers) or in those with personal characteristics that promote rejection of risk-prevention messages (e.g., psychological reactance).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol for this study, including online recruitment, informed consent, and data collection, was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Connecticut.

Smoking intention was measured prior to the manipulation with two questions; one assessing smoking expectation (&#x0201c;Do you think you might smoke a cigarette sometime soon?&#x0201d;) and another assessing smoking willingness (&#x0201c;If a friend offered you a cigarette, would you think about smoking it?&#x0201d;).

Because there are missing cells that do not or cannot contain data (e.g., individuals who have not smoked in their lifetime but who have smoked recently), it was not possible to investigate how these lifetime and recent smoking history might interact with one another and with GW-exposure in the prediction of behavioral intention. To address this, we employed an analytic approach in which the effects of the two smoking history variables were examined in two steps.</p><p>The <italic>first step</italic> applied standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods to the entire data set to assess the independent and interactive effects of lifetime smoking history and GW-exposure on behavioral intention, after which simple main effects tests were conducted to determine if the effects of GW-exposure were concentrated within groups defined by lifetime smoking history <xref rid="pone.0096315-Jaccard1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The <italic>second step</italic> employed exploratory simple main effects analysis. These were focused on determining if any effects of GW-exposure were further concentrated within subgroups defined on the basis of their recent smoking history. One analysis was conducted on the subgroup with moderate lifetime smoking history and another was conducted on the subgroup with heavy lifetime smoking history. Each time, analyses tested for simple main effects of GW-exposure for different groups defined by their recent smoking history.</p><p>This two-step approach thus made it possible to determine if the effects of GW-exposure occurring within groups defined by lifetime smoking history (analyzed in the first step) were concentrated in specific groups defined by recent smoking history (analyzed in the second step). This process allowed a detailed understanding of how smoking history moderated the influence of graphic warnings on the intention indices, despite the fact that it was not possible to formally test for the interaction of lifetime smoking history, recent smoking history and experimental condition in a single factorial analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Smoking intention</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>First Step: Lifetime Smoking History</title><p>A 2 (Experimental Condition: GW Exposure, Control) X 3 (Life History: None, Moderate, Heavy) ANCOVA was performed on post-manipulation smoking intention, treating pre-manipulation smoking intention as a covariate and controlling for age and sex.

No statistically significant interaction effects were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Principal Findings</title><p>GW exposure was found to lower the intention to smoke in young adults with a moderate lifetime smoking history (between 1 and 100 cigarettes) and raise the quit intentions in those with a heavy lifetime smoking history (100 or more cigarettes), with each effect concentrated in the subsample of occasional smokers (who had smoked some but not all of the previous 30 days). No evidence was found to suggest defensive &#x0201c;boomerang&#x0201d; effects on intention, either for those with more extensive smoking histories or for those with high scores on individual difference measures linked to defensive processing of risk-prevention messages (e.g., psychological reactance). These findings support the adaptive-responding hypothesis and challenge the defensive-responding hypothesis, suggesting that even the young, occasional smokers who might be predicted to react defensively to the graphic nature of antismoking tobacco warnings instead responded with diminished interest in smoking in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses</title><p>The primary contributions of the current study are its attention to behavioral intention as an outcome and its consideration of individual difference factors that might alter the influence of GWs on this outcome. The effects of GWs on intention that we observed reinforce findings from (1) naturalistic studies documenting decreases in smoking rates in countries that mandate GWs on cigarette packaging and (2) other laboratory studies showing beneficial effects of GW exposure on health-related cognitions. In so doing, they may bolster claims of a government interest in mandating GWs on cigarette packaging in the US <xref rid="pone.0096315-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition, our attention to individual difference factors addresses a limitation of many past studies, in that it identified two groups of young smokers who might be especially responsive to GWs: (1) occasional smokers who are still in an early, &#x0201c;experimental&#x0201d; stage with cigarettes, and (2) occasional smokers who have adopted a more stable pattern of occasional use.</p><p>As with any study, however, there are limitations to the current investigation. Most critically, exposure to GWs was carried out online, and only state changes in intentions were assessed. As Hammond, Driezen and Bourdreau (2013) note, &#x0201c;there is no way to replicate &#x02018;real world&#x02019; exposure to health warnings in an experimental study&#x0201d; and we acknowledge this limitation with the current investigation <xref rid="pone.0096315-Hammond4" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> (p. 100). The current results also are limited because, although they advance our understanding by pointing to potential moderators of GWs on behavior, more exhaustive studies that track actual behavior change over time will be needed before stronger conclusions can be made. Our study was further limited in that it did not utilize probability-based sampling methods. Investigations utilizing larger and more representative samples might uncover defensive reactions in subgroups that our study failed to represent in sufficient numbers. Finally, the current study investigated the influence of the GWs that were part of the original FDA effort. If the FDA again seeks to mandate GWs, it will need to investigate reactions to the new labels it develops. The current study introduces a methodology that might be of use in these efforts; one that models change in behavioral intention and the moderating effects of individual difference factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications</title><p>Despite these limitations, the findings are suggestive of ways to maximize the influence that GWs exert on young adults. Concentration of effects among the occasional smokers points to the need for greater understanding of these individuals. Edwards and colleagues (2010) followed a sample of occasional smokers, aged 18 and older. Their group was comparable to the subsample in our study that had a heavy lifetime smoking history and an occasional recent smoking history (i.e., all had smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30 days and 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) <xref rid="pone.0096315-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. They found that members of this group were at considerable risk of continuing to smoke (as 45% remained occasional smokers at one-year follow up) or of increasing their smoking (as 17% transitioned to becoming daily smokers). Perhaps because occasional smokers perceive their behavior as low-risk, intention to quit was lower in this group than in a comparison group of daily smokers. It is thus encouraging that in the current study, GWs influenced the quit intentions of the occasional smokers who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. As Edwards and colleagues point out, however, there is great heterogeneity among occasional smokers &#x02013; not just in terms of past smoking history &#x02013; but also perceived physical addiction and intentions to quit at some point in the future <xref rid="pone.0096315-McDermott1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our findings suggest that occasional smokers are responsive to GW messages, whether they have moderate or heavy lifetime smoking histories. These two groups only differed in whether they reacted to the GWs in this study with a decreased willingness to smoke in the future if opportunities arise or an increased intention to quit. One interpretation of this difference is that occasional smokers who are still in an early stage with cigarettes might not perceive their diminished interest in smoking as an intention to &#x0201c;quit,&#x0201d; per say, as they do not yet think of themselves as smokers. In contrast, occasional smokers who have adopted a more stable pattern of occasional use might appreciate that they have become smokers, and so they frame this cognitive change in terms of a quit intention.</p><p>Regardless of the meaning of these shifts, more should be known about the factors that shape the ways that occasional smokers react to and processes the dangers of smoking that can be communicated by GWs. This understanding might lead to better message targeting of messages to this most-responsive of groups. For instance, Brown, Carpenter and Sutfin (2011) conducted focus groups on a sample of 18&#x02013;25 year olds who had smoked occasionally for a stable period of at least 6 months <xref rid="pone.0096315-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. They found that, although many recognize the general risks of smoking, the group as a whole tended to minimize the health and addiction risks of their actions. Given the current finding that this same group will be most strongly influenced by GWs, there may be benefit to targeting their misperceptions with GWs. This would mean designing GWs that focus more on the dangers of &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; or occasional smoking than was done in the original FDA effort. Six of the 9 GWs in that campaign drew attention to the long-term effects of smoking; risks that might not be perceived as relevant among occasional smokers (e.g., risks of cancer, heart diseases and death). Two other messages focused on the dangers of smoke to babies and children and one noted the benefit of quitting. Had the GWs targeted the belief structure underlying occasional smoking, the effects might have been stronger than was observed in the current study. Ultimately, this is an empirical question and one deserving of future investigations. Research should determine if occasional smokers are more influenced by GWs that focus attention on extreme health risks (that many may believe to be more relevant for heavy smokers) or on dispelling some of their misperceptions about the risks of what they perceive to be relatively low-risk smoking.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0096315-Andrews1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Andrews CL (2012) Graphic tobacco warning case can present SCOTUS opportunity on commercial speech doctrine.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096315-Kraemer1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
