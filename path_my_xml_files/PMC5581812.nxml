A total of 195 YB (Charolais, Limousin, and Rouge-des-Pr&#x000e9;s breeds) from 6 farms implementing or not prophylactic antimicrobial treatments (PROPHY or absence) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experiment groups based on time of detection of BRD and first-line marbofloxacin regimen, early adjusted dose [Early 2 (E2)] or late standard dose [Late 10 (L10)]. Each YB was administered orally a reticulo-rumen bolus, allowing continuous monitoring of ruminal temperature. In the E2 group, YB presenting early signs of BRD, i.e., an increase in ruminal temperature over 40.2&#x000b0;C and persisting more than 12&#x02009;h, confirmed by a clinical examination showing no or mild signs of BRD, were given 2&#x02009;mg/kg of marbofloxacin. In the L10 group, YBs presenting moderate or severe signs of BRD at visual inspection, confirmed at clinical examination, were given 10&#x02009;mg/kg of marbofloxacin. If needed, YBs were given a relapse treatment. The YBs were followed for 30&#x02009;days. The proportions of first and relapse treatments were calculated, as well as the therapeutic efficacy at day 10. In the E2 group, the first-line treatments&#x02019; proportion was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), while the relapse treatments&#x02019; proportion tended to be higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08), than in the L10 group. Evolution of clinical scores (CSs) of diseased YB was followed for 10&#x02009;days. In both groups, CS and rectal temperature decreased significantly 24&#x02009;h after treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Treatment incidences (TI) representing antimicrobial consumption assessed on used daily doses (UDD) were calculated. Antimicrobial consumption of marbofloxacin and relapse treatments were not significantly different between the groups. These values were strongly influenced by the recourse to a prophylactic antimicrobial treatment, accounting for more than 90% of the antimicrobial amount in the herds implementing prophylaxis. The higher number of treatments in the groups treated on the basis of ruminal temperature monitoring, the accuracy of the detection method, and the necessary conditions to implement precision antimicrobial therapy in the field are discussed in this article.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antimicrobial use</kwd><kwd>decreased regimen</kwd><kwd>early treatment</kwd><kwd>fluoroquinolone</kwd><kwd>cattle</kwd><kwd>bovine respiratory disease complex</kwd><kwd>veterinary precision medicine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7114"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial use (AMU) in veterinary medicine may lead to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially transferred to humans, representing a public health hazard (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Given the necessity of maintaining available antimicrobials, the context of sustainable use&#x02014;as little as possible, and as much as necessary&#x02014;represents a driver for new approaches of antimicrobial therapy in veterinary medicine (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In food producing animals, the treatment of bovine respiratory diseases (BRD) represents one of the major uses of antimicrobials (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Because of the high prevalence of bacteria as involved pathogens, treatment of BRD generally includes an empirical antimicrobial drug (AMD) therapy, applied with a wide variety of classes; among them the most frequently used are penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Current practices of treatment of BRD consist of (i) treating the entire cohort of animals before the onset of BRD (prophylactic treatment) and (ii) treating the entire cohort of animals in which only a small number of animals expresses clinical signs (metaphylactic treatment or control) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The advantages of these mass medication strategies are the control of the infection dissemination and a good survival rate with regards to the group, promoting the prevention and/or delay of BRD in the group. However, such strategies also have the disadvantage of subjecting a potentially large proportion of animals to AMDs potentially able to contaminate the food chain and/or the environment with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants (bacteria and genes). The other therapeutic approach to treat BRD focuses on (iii) curative treatments of only the animals presenting clinical signs of illness (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This approach limits the number of animals exposed to antimicrobials. However, it is usually seen as the &#x0201c;late approach,&#x0201d; and delay in treatment initiation may impact animal welfare, as the clinical signs possibly reflect extensive pulmonary damage which had time to develop prior to treatment (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, in this late approach, dosages of antimicrobials needed to achieve bacterial cure are generally high. Considering the uncertainty regarding the causal agent and time of disease onset, labeled doses are determined by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose determination experiments. These doses generally target a cluster of pathogens and consider the highest minimal inhibiting concentration reported (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These conditions lead then to routine use of a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; antimicrobial dose.</p><p>Recent studies have stressed the interests of early therapeutic interventions, when the infectious bacterial load is still low, suggesting that the dose of antibiotics may be modulated concurrently with the infectious bacterial load. A relation between the size of bacterial inoculum and the antibiotic dose needed to achieve bacterial elimination was first discovered by Eagle in 1949 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Since then, this so-called &#x0201c;Eagle effect&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inoculum effect&#x0201d; has been observed in experimental models of infections, showing that the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams, including third-generation cephalosporins, could be reduced against high bacterial loads compared to low bacterial loads of different bacterial species, including <italic>Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In a calf experimental model of BRD, we observed high bactericidal activity of an adjusted marbofloxacin dose administered &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; on low inoculum of <italic>Mannheimia haemolytica</italic> compared with a late administration, even at a fivefold higher dose (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the lack of diagnostic tools allowing identification of pathogens and bacterial load in field conditions constitutes a major barrier to implement such an early treatment strategy. An alternative could be to monitor early signs of BRD, such as increase in core body temperature, which has been demonstrated to appear before clinical signs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Combining appropriate doses of AMD and early detection of BRD could thus result in a reduction in AMU.</p><p>The objective of our study was to assess in a field experiment the therapeutic effectiveness of an infection-stage adjusted antimicrobial therapy given at the early stage of BRD, compared to a standard therapy, i.e., a single injection of 10&#x02009;mg/kg marbofloxacin administered after observation of clinical signs, as recommended by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>The research protocol was compliant with the European Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (CVMP/VICH/595/98-FINAL) and has been submitted to the French National Food Safety Agency, under the reference ENR/KLD/EC-00710-0. All procedures were performed in accordance with the European Directive (2010/63/EU) and French Regulations (Decree no. 2013-118; articles R214-87 and R214-137 from Rural Code) related to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. However, because all the procedures involving animals were conducted in commercial farms, and therefore do not fall under the scope of the European Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (article 1-5), ethics committees established under the French Regulations do not examine approvals of such protocols. The study was conducted in western France from December 2014 to March 2015. In 6 commercial fattening units, 195 ruminant young bulls (YBs) of Charolais, Limousin, and Rouge-des-Pr&#x000e9;s breeds, aged between 7 and 10&#x02009;months and with an average body weight of 299&#x02009;kg were recruited (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Before their arrival at the fattening unit, YBs were transported over a distance less than 500&#x02009;km from their birth farm to the sorting facility place. YBs were given eprinomectin Pour-On (Eprinex, Merial, Villeurbanne, France) and were also administered orally a reticulo-rumen temperature bolus (San&#x02019;phone, Medria SAS, Chateaugiron, France). YBs were then transported by truck for travel distance less than 50&#x02009;km to the fattening unit. At the time of arrival, YBs were separated into pens containing 7&#x02013;12 animals. In the six fattening units, each pen was randomly assigned to one of the two experiment groups, Early 2 (E2) and Late 10 (L10), characterized by the different methods of detection of BRD and curative antimicrobials treatment regimens. In 3 fattening units, considered at high risk of BRD occurrence, a prophylactic antimicrobial treatment (PROPHY) was administered to each YB, at the sorting facility. Overall, four groups of animals were studied: PROPHY-E2, PROPHY-L10, E2, and L10. YBs were housed in straw-bedded barns facilities and had free access to water and food. Enrollment of the YB started on the first day on feed and lasted 30&#x02009;days.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the herds, number of

We hypothesized that such regimen could be sufficient to achieve the cure of YB presenting an increase of ruminal temperature, as a proxy for onset of BRD. The fluoroquinolone antibiotic marbofloxacin was chosen to test this hypothesis in the field situation because a set of experiments previously conducted with this antibiotic in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models have already demonstrated its validity in experimental and controlled settings.</p><p>The treatment protocol implemented in the L10 group corresponded to a traditional field situation and served as a control for comparison with the alternative protocol implemented in the E2 group. The therapy implemented in our L10 group was based upon the detection of clinical signs of BRD, in which YBs were administered marbofloxacin at the dose recommended in the SPC. The results observed in this control group (incidence rate, curative percentage, and relapse rate) were in agreement with those obtained in other field studies allowing relevant comparisons with the low dose/early treatment group of the present study (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>For the early detection group, we observed that the proportion of first-line and relapse treatments were increased compared to the late detection groups, raising the question of the relevance of a therapeutic protocol combining early detection and infection-stage adjusted dose. This question of relevance can be discussed as two sub-questions: the validity of our hypothesis that a low early AMD dose would be as effective as a high late AMD dose and of the appropriateness (specificity and precision) of the body temperature to initiate an early treatment.</p><p>First, our approach was based on the assumption that the intensity of clinical signs was well correlated with the size of the bacterial load and axiomatically, that a treatment initiated before occurrence of moderate or severe clinical signs will be associated with a lower pathogen load to eliminate. It has been shown in a calf experimental model of pneumonia that the values of CS, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and lung consolidation were correlated with each other (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). While previous work on rodent pneumonia models (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and our model of pneumonia in calves confirmed this relationship (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), neither the pathogen agents responsible for BRD nor the size of the inoculum at the infectious site were specified under the conditions of this field study. Although <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> are one of the most common agents of BRD in France (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), North America (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and Australia (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), viruses are also often isolated and may be responsible for BRD with a similar clinical picture to what we observed.</p><p>Second, the specificity of our detection protocol based essentially on ruminal temperature monitoring to trigger an AMD treatment and the precision of its precocity compared to the occurrence of clinical symptoms are likely the most important factors generating uncertainty about the very necessity of initiating an AMD treatment, and consequently an overuse of AMD. We have to acknowledge that we are facing a lack of specific and precise tools to (i) quickly identify pathogens (viruses or bacteria) responsible for respiratory infection and (ii) assess the bacterial load at the infectious site. Hyperthermia <italic>per se</italic> is likely not specific enough to trigger an early infection-stage adjusted dose AMD treatment only on the YBs that should have been ineluctably treated later on with a higher dose. In the absence of an ideal diagnostic tool, we defined for body temperature a threshold based on the information observed in the experiment we conducted in calves and data from the literature to define the onset of early treatment in the field (elevation of ruminal temperature above 40.2&#x000b0;C for more than 12 consecutive hours, confirmed by a rectal temperature &#x0003e;39.7&#x000b0;C at the time of clinical examination (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)). The rectal temperature value of 39.7&#x000b0;C is commonly used as the threshold value for diagnosis of abnormal temperature in YB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) To ensure that YBs detected early when presenting an increased rectal temperature and no clinical signs of disease different from BRD, a physical examination was performed. Therefore, the follow-up of ruminal temperature and clinical examination before inclusion minimized the risk of including YBs not presenting BRD. Early detection of disease was confirmed by the CS and rectal temperature values at the time of inclusion, which were lower in the E2 compared to the L10 groups. However, it has been shown that clinical signs of BRD were not systematically observed in YB presenting ruminal hyperthermia (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Hence, it is very likely that we included YB in E2 groups that subsequently would not have presented clinical signs, explaining the higher proportion of first-line treatments in the E2 groups.</p><p>Furthermore, hyperthermia and clinical signs observed in the included animals are not pathognomonic of bacterial respiratory infection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is possible that some treated animals did not show any bacterial infection. As an illustration, it is commonly accepted that viral infections precede and may lead to bacterial infections; host response to a viral infection will generate an increase in temperature, and then could lead to a too early treatment. In such a case, because marbofloxacin exhibits a rapid elimination half-life (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), effective concentrations will not be maintained until the appearance of bacterial infection. Such a situation may have lead in our protocol to an increase in the proportions of relapse treatments, and also in first-line treatments. If this hypothesis is correct, an option would consist of using for early treatment an AMD product (substance or formulation) combining both inoculum-dependent pharmacodynamic properties (inoculum effect) and appropriate pharmacokinetic properties, i.e., a longer duration of action than the about 24&#x02009;h in the current study.</p><p>Assuming that <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> were actually involved at the time of the early treatment, the accuracy of the reduced fluoroquinolone dose needs to be put into perspective. The selected marbofloxacin dosage for the present trial was based upon PK/PD evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and in a mice model (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) previously published. This dosage was also successfully tested for the treatment of an experimental lung infection with <italic>Mannheimia haemolytica</italic> in calves (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In this study, calves were treated with 2&#x02009;mg/kg of marbofloxacin 6&#x02013;10&#x02009;h after inoculation of the pathogen in one group, or treated with 10&#x02009;mg/kg at 36&#x02013;40&#x02009;h after inoculation in a second group. Efficacy of this decreased regimen administered early was found to be as good as a higher regimen at a later stage of illness and was associated with the size of the inoculum at the time of treatment. Similar results were observed in various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conducted with fluoroquinolones, stressing the existence of an inoculum effect (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the present study, the selected dosage was the lowest dose ensuring bactericidal efficacy, assuming that early detection allowed operating on a low bacterial inoculum. In fact, we cannot rule out that at the time of initiation of our early treatment, the inoculum load to eradicate was actually higher than in our previous experiment, explaining a higher relapse rate. If this hypothesis is correct, the dose for an early treatment could be adjusted (increased) to take into account that body temperature is only a surrogate of the bacterial load to eradicate.</p><p>One of the goals of the present study was to assess the overall AMD consumption for the two tested treatment strategies. The method of evaluation of antimicrobial consumption was based on the reflection paper on collecting data of consumption developed by the European Medicines Agency (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and on previous research conducted in livestock production (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Using indicators shared by regulatory agencies and other research units will allow comparison of drug consumption between our study and future studies using the same methodology. For each drug, UDD was assigned with the principles used by the European Medicines Agency to determine the defined daily dose for animals. In herds implementing prophylactic treatment, the proportions of first-line and relapse treatments were decreased, but without significant difference, compared with herds not implementing prophylactic treatment. These results suggest that prophylactic antimicrobial treatment decreased the proportion of clinical BRD, but might not prevent their occurrence. Furthermore, prophylactic treatments represented more than 90% of the total amount of antimicrobials. This observation suggests that rationalization of prophylactic antimicrobial treatment might significantly reduce global antimicrobial consumption without altering the control of BRD in herds. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that treatment incidences of UDD have been calculated in a field study with YBs; therefore, it was difficult to compare the amount of antimicrobials used with other studies.</p><p>In the present study, antimicrobial treatments were prescribed by a veterinarian following a clinical examination, and all the antimicrobial classes are approved in food producing animals. To limit the impact of antimicrobial consumption on selection of resistant bacteria, antibiotic prophylactic practices should be limited to YB at high risk of presenting BRD, and a thorough evaluation of the risk factors for BRD should be performed prior treatment initiation. Finally, the use of critically important antimicrobials, such as marbofloxacin, must be supervised by veterinarians and should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, in addition to epidemiological and clinical data evaluation, to ensure their efficacy and limit the spread of AMR.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the monitoring of the evolution of body temperature of YB, as a proxy of early detection of diseased animals, is not sufficient to currently recommend treatment with an early infection-stage adjusted regimen with a rather short-action antibiotic such as marbofloxacin. Transfer in the field of the &#x0201c;early detection/infection stage adjusted antimicrobial treatment&#x0201d; remains complex and seems to depend on both PD (inoculum effect) and PK (duration of action) properties of the drug. But more importantly, it also depends on the implementation of early and precise diagnostic tools, and research should be encouraged in this direction. Specific biomarkers correlated with the bacterial load, and pathogen specific tests at the animal&#x02019;s side, are of great interest to encourage veterinary precision antimicrobial therapy, i.e., optimized preventive or curative therapeutic approach (right animal, right drug, right dose, and right time) based on identification of biomarkers of disease and use of technologies of disease monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The research protocol was compliant with the European Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (CVMP/VICH/595/98-FINAL) and has been submitted to the French National Food Safety Agency, under the reference ENR/KLD/EC-00710-0.
