Parenting stress may therefore be regarded as an outcome variable in its own right. This study investigated whether a sensitizing intervention influences stress reported by parents of prematurely born children until the children were age nine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Preterm infants (N =146, birth weight &#x0003c;2,000&#x000a0;g) were randomized to intervention (N =72) with the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP) or a preterm control group (N =74) that received standard hospital care. A term reference group comprised 75 healthy, full-term neonates. Parents reported on the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) when the children were 6&#x000a0;months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7&#x000a0;years old and on the PSI-Short Form (PSI-SF) at age 9. Main outcomes were the mother&#x02019;s and father&#x02019;s reports of total, child and parent-related stress. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed using linear mixed models (LMM), taking dependency in the data caused by twin pairs and repeated measures into account. Response rates were high across all follow-ups, and still reached 85% from mothers and 72% from fathers at 9&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mothers in the intervention group reported better longitudinal development of child-related stress than mothers of preterm controls, as they perceived their children as being more adaptable and less moody throughout childhood until the age of seven. Less stress in the intervention group was revealed by cross-sectional analysis of maternal reports at all ages, while fathers reported similar differences at ages three and five. Parents in the intervention group reported stronger agreement on several stress scores on several occasions. Fathers with high interventional participation (mean 54%) reported significantly less stress at age nine than those who participated less. Both parents in the intervention group reported levels of stress similar to those experienced by the term reference group at all follow-ups, while differences between the preterm control and term reference groups increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This early intervention reduces stress among parents of prematurely born children to a level reported by parents of term-born children and enhances agreement between parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials Gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00222456">NCT00222456</ext-link>, 05.09.2005.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Early intervention</kwd><kwd>Preterm</kwd><kwd>Parenting stress</kwd><kwd>Longitudinal study</kwd><kwd>Long-term follow-up</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>High levels of parental stress have frequently been reported when children are born preterm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prematurely born children are at increased risk of behavioral problems compared to term-born infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Reducing the levels of stress is important not only for improving parental psychological health but also because it may improve the efficacy of interventions that target these children&#x02019;s behavioral problems
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These interventions thus justify the assessment of parenting stress as an important outcome in the evaluation of an early intervention program
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Parenting stress has been defined as a mismatch between perceived resources, expectations and actual caregiving demands
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and covers stress from different origins that places the parent-child relationship under lasting pressure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Schappin <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] concluded that stress experienced by parents of preterm infants has gradually decreased over the last thirty years, probably due to increased quality of care for preterm infants. On the other hand, Treyvaud <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] recently reported that parents of very preterm children continue to report more child- and parent-related stress lasting until children&#x02019;s age of (hereinafter &#x02018;age&#x02019;) seven. This may indicate that parents of prematurely born children find it just as difficult to interpret and adapt to the immature expressions of a preterm-born infant today as they did 30&#x000a0;years ago, irrespective of their child&#x02019;s medical condition. The gap between normal parental expectations and infant expressive capacity needs to be reduced following the birth of a preterm child.</p><p>Abidin has described stress as a multidimensional concept; cumulative, highly influenced by the environment, and a result of transactions between parent and child that promote negative feelings in the parent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Based on this model, the Parenting Stress Index-Full Form (PSI-FF) was created to capture (a) stress related to the parent&#x02019;s personality and vulnerability; (b) child characteristics as perceived by the adult; (c) life events and; (d) the extent of supportive environment that parents experience. The PSI-FF distinguishes between different aspects of perceived stress in child and parental dimensions, and the Child Domain in particular reveals parental perceptions of stress related to children&#x02019;s individual characteristics.</p><p>Several studies have reported that high levels of parenting stress may disrupt parental sensitivity and responsiveness and lead to ineffective, dysfunctional parenting with possible negative impacts on child development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis concluded that significantly more child-related stress was reported by parents of prematurely-born children than those of term-born, in areas such as distractibility/hyperactivity, demandingness and acceptability among children at ages between 1&#x000a0;month and 12&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These results are in accordance with studies that have reported prematurely-born children to be more demanding than term-born because of immature expression; poor self-regulation and restricted capacity to interact socially in environments that are noisy, bright or are generally characterized by non-optimal stimuli
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A premature birth may also disturb the maturation of parental attachment bonds, which are regarded as an essential part of the parental behavioral system, preparing adults for caregiving
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Parental bonding is supposed to have a special impact on parents&#x02019; capacities to cope with stress, as significant associations have been reported between low levels of stress and parental reports of a preferred parental bonding type (high level of care and low level of control) at age seven
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Parental attachment bonds may be regarded as complementary to the infants&#x02019; care-seeking attachment and deal with emotional ties that involve the development of feelings of love
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Parental attachment is in line with Abidin&#x02019;s construction of an Attachment subscale in the PSI-FF, which is loaded with questions that address parents&#x02019; perceived difficulties in establishing an emotional closeness to the infant
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Prematurity has been found to be a strong predictor of diminished caregiving quality, while research has reported a weak impact of prematurity on the development of child attachment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All aspects mentioned above underline the importance of strengthening parents&#x02019; ability to cope with the delivery of a preterm child and to manage this stressful situation.</p><p>Several interventions that aim to ameliorate these problems have been investigated. Key components of interventions, all of which involve efforts to improve parental outcomes and subsequently child outcomes, have been described as psychosocial support, parent education and therapeutic developmental interventions targeting the infant
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The meta-analysis by Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that interventions that were able to enhance parental sensitivity were the most effective
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study evaluates whether a modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] could strengthen parents&#x02019; perceptions of their preterm child and prevent the increased levels of parenting stress that have repeatedly been reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The MITP was designed to facilitate social availability and interactions with the newborn infant and thereby strengthen parental enthusiasm, pleasure and empowerment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Our group has previously reported lower levels of parenting stress in the intervention group until age two
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the intervention appears to improve the children&#x02019;s socio-emotional and behavioral development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that preterm intervention (PI) parents would continue to report less stress throughout childhood, as stability in parents&#x02019; perception of parenting stress is well documented
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The following questions were addressed: 1) has the early intervention influenced the longitudinal development of parenting stress as reported by mothers and fathers? 2) are there cross-sectional differences between the preterm groups in mothers&#x02019; and fathers&#x02019; reports of parenting stress at any age until nine, when controlled for repeated measures? 3) how is the development of stress reported by parents in the two preterm groups compared with that reported by parents of term controls?</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>This study is a part of the Troms&#x000f8; Intervention Study on Preterms (TISP); a randomized, controlled study of preterm infants with birth weight (BW) &#x0003c;2000&#x000a0;g, recruited between March 1999 and September 2002 (R&#x000f8;nning, Ulvund, Dahl &#x00026; Kaaresen, 1998, unpublished research protocol). Preterm infants were randomized into blocks of six by using computer-generated numbers, to form an intervention group (PI, N =72) and a preterm control group (PC, N =74), and stratified according to gestational age (GA) &#x0003c;28 and GA &#x02265;28&#x000a0;weeks.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] aimed at 1) enhancing parents&#x02019; understanding of their child&#x02019;s expressions, and 2) promoting a sensitive, positive and practical transaction between parents and child. Eight nurses were trained to perform the intervention and each family was guided by the same nurse during all the sessions. Each intervention consisted of 7&#x000a0;hour-long sessions with parents and their baby during the last week before discharge, and 4 home visits at 1, 2, 4, and 12&#x000a0;weeks post-discharge
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The modification of the MITP included an initial session during which parents could vent their feelings about their preterm child. Mothers participated in all sessions while the fathers&#x02019; mean participation rate was 6.5 sessions (SD =3.4), which constituted 54% of the intervention program. In the first session the parents and the intervention nurse investigated the child&#x02019;s capacities, focusing on the baby&#x02019;s readiness and social communication abilities. During the following sessions, the parents were helped to recognize and be sensitive to behavioral cues, signs of disturbed regulation and stress in the child&#x02019;s physiological, motor and state organization. The guidance was given while they observed the infant together, and all comments, questions and suggestions from the parents were appreciated. Finally, this understanding was applied to daily care by helping parents to make adjustments to their child&#x02019;s strengths and vulnerabilities, in order to reduce stress levels and maximize the parents&#x02019; social engagement with their babies. During the four home visits, these topics were revisited and fine-tuned to individual needs, especially in connection with the child&#x02019;s temperament, which was one of the main topics of the third home visit. The families had no other contact with the intervention nurses. All sessions were documented by logbooks written by the interventionists, and implementation according to the intervention manual
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] was ensured by logbook reviews carried out by the study director (JAR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p>At the ages of 6&#x000a0;months, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7&#x000a0;years, parents completed the Parenting Stress Index-Full Form (PSI-FF, third edition) while the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) was used when the children were 9&#x000a0;years old
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The PSI-FF consists of 120 questions covering three main dimensions of stress (child, parent and life stress) while the PSI-SF consists of 36 questions extracted from the parent- and child-related dimensions. A five-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; made up the response alternatives on both questionnaires. At 6&#x000a0;months, only one parent reported (mostly mothers) while mothers and fathers reported separately on all the subsequent occasions.</p><p>The PSI-FF consists of two main dimensions: Child Domain (47 items covering the subscales: Distractibility, Adaptability, Reinforces Parent, Demandingness, Mood and Acceptability), and Parent Domain (54 items covering the subscales: Perceived Competence, Isolation, Attachment, Health, Role Restriction, Depression and Relation to Spouse). A Total Stress (TS) score was also computed on the basis of all items except the life-stress questions. The PSI-SF is reported as a Total Stress score and by three subscales, each of which consists of 12 items: Parental Distress (PD), Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI) and Difficult Child (DC). Some questions in both questionnaires are used to calculate a Defensive Responding score, which indicates the degree of possible inconsistent/denial reporting from respondents.</p><p>Both PSI-FF and PSI-SF are frequently used in research
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the correlation between Total Stress scores on these two measures is described as high (0.87)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The PSI-SF, DC subscale consists solely of items from the Child Domain in PSI-FF, and the Parental Distress subscale items from the Parent Domain. The P-CDI subscale includes items from both the Child and Parent Domains and focuses on the parental perception of transactions with their child and their expectations about the child&#x02019;s behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Norwegian versions of both PSI-FF and PSI-SF were translated by R&#x000f8;nning and Abidin, and were used in this study with the permission of Abidin and Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc. (PAR). The questionnaires have some literal differences, in that questions in the PSI-SF may be perceived as more negative and definitive than those in the original PSI-FF format. The Life Stress (LS) questionnaire is part of the PSI-FF and was also used at age nine. The LS questionnaire consists of 22 items covering major life events in the family that are assumed to be challenging, even though they not are directly associated with child or parental challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Follow-up procedures</title><p>All the participating children received the same medical, developmental, and psychosocial assessments with recommendations about contacting other services if needed (age 6&#x000a0;months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9&#x000a0;years). Questionnaires were sent to the families approximately two weeks before each assessment.

In the longitudinal analysis, time was treated as a continuous variable. In the cross-sectional analysis, predicted mean group differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. These analyses were also based on a longitudinal model, but in these cases time was treated as a categorical variable
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. By varying the reference time point in the analysis, predicted group differences could be calculated. To assess agreement between parents, intraclass correlations (ICC) were computed, and the difference between the two independent intraclass correlation coefficients for the PI and the PC groups was tested as described by Alsawalmeh and Feldt
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The impact of variable intervention participation by fathers was analyzed by LMM and adjusted to take into account the clustering effects of twin pairs, and effect sizes in this case was given by Pearson correlations.

The overall results indicated that the intervention reduced maternal stress, but to a lesser degree affected paternal stress in the intervention group. Different longitudinal patterns between the preterm groups were reported by PI and PC mothers on dimensions addressing child characteristics. PI mothers perceived their children as displaying higher adaptability and happiness throughout childhood than did PC group mothers. In addition, stress in the PI and PC groups was reported at quantitatively different levels at different follow-ups. PI mothers reported less total and child-related stress at all ages while PI fathers reported a similar difference from PC fathers at age five. The intervention may also have heightened the parental agreement within families as a stronger association between mothers and fathers responses was repeatedly found in the PI group compared with the PC group. Finally, parents in the PI group reported similar levels of parenting stress to those of terms at all follow-ups, while longitudinal and cross-sectional differences between the PC and TR groups increased with age. Thus, our main hypothesis was supported, as parents in the PI group reported stress below the levels of the PC group throughout childhood, and in fact was comparable to parents of term-born children.</p><p>In answer to the first question, a stress-subduing effect was found in the PI group concerning maternal perception of child-related stress in such aspects as adaptability and mood. More stress reported in these aspects of parenting stress has in particular been associated with difficulties in the parent-child relationship
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The intervention had a sustained focus on support of early parent-child relationships. Parents were asked to initiate and facilitate social interactions whenever the child seemed to be &#x02018;available&#x02019; but also to be sensitive to the child&#x02019;s signs of distress and need for &#x02018;time-out&#x02019;. This may have initiated better-timed transactional patterns between PI mothers and their infants compared to the PC group. At the first follow-up (6&#x000a0;months) mothers in the PC group more often reported their children as fussy and in a bad mood when they woke up than the PI mothers did. This difference had disappeared by age one. However, from age two onwards, mothers in the PC group reported increased stress related to their children&#x02019;s mood and adaptability, while the PI group mothers reported diminishing levels of stress until age seven. These results were dependent on the mothers&#x02019; answers to several PSI questions, but were strongly influenced by one item throughout childhood: &#x02018;I feel that my child is very moody and easily upset&#x02019;. Accordingly, reports from mothers at age one and later show that the PC mothers perceive less happiness, fewer smiles and fewer emotional responses from their children than the PI mothers. It has already been shown that premature babies may be less successful in showing strong positive arousal responses (for example, smiles) than full-term infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This suggests that the intervention had an influence on maternal stress, in terms of how mothers perceive their child and on their emotional relationship. The following paragraphs briefly discuss possible underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Heightened levels of stress are supposed to negatively affect maternal responsiveness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Laucht, Esser <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] studied the impact of maternal responsiveness on behavioral development in premature children. They found that problems such as anxiety and depressive mood decreased with age in children with highly responsive mothers, but increased where less sensitive mothering behavior was observed. We might speculate whether the intervention enhanced the ability of PI mothers to acquire realistic expectations and a deeper understanding about their children&#x02019;s cues and need for support. Olafsen <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] found that mothers who had participated in the intervention reported a strong association between stress and their children&#x02019;s regulatory competence at 6&#x000a0;months. This may be an early indication of a more sensitive and synchronous interactional parent-child style. They may have been better able to read their child&#x02019;s cues and &#x02018;do what it takes&#x02019; to help their child in its immature regulation efforts. Another interventional aspect which may have decreased parenting stress in the PI group is the incorporation of the initial ventilation session, which may have strengthened the parents&#x02019; feelings of security and helped to improve their self-confidence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The session may also have influenced these parents&#x02019; establishment of a more robust parental attachment, which has been described as a powerful antecedent of the quality of mothers&#x02019; sensitive behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The importance of maternal attachment has been documented by Coppola, Cassibba <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in connection with mother&#x02019;s sensitivity at age 3&#x000a0;months. This was particularly powerful in mother-infant dyads with prematurely born children.</p><p>Even though maternal perceptions of child-related stress throughout childhood created the most significant differences between the preterm groups, the first reported difference appeared in parent-related stress, on the subscale Attachment at 6&#x000a0;months. Giving birth to a preterm child has been described as having a negative impact on maternal attachment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The prolonged stay in the hospital and the NICU environments disrupts the natural physiological contact between mother and child. Borghini <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] found that only 20% of mothers of preterm infants had a secure attachment representation at children&#x02019;s age of 6&#x000a0;months compared to 53% of mothers of terms. According to Abidin, the PSI subscale Attachment was designed to assess the intrinsic motivation of parents in their roles as mothers or fathers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and this concept appears to be closely related to the development of a caregiving system as described by Walsh
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PC mothers reported significantly higher stress scores than PI mothers on several questions at 6&#x000a0;months, for example, &#x02018;it takes a long time for parents to develop close, warm feelings for their children&#x02019; and &#x02018;sometimes my child does things that bother me just to be mean&#x02019;. These statements illustrate that a difference in experienced closeness and understanding of the child may have emerged between the PI and the PC mothers as early as 6&#x000a0;months post-discharge, with an impact on parental perception of stress.</p><p>Evans <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] found that experiential avoidance and prenatal expectations were important predictors of maternal attachment and responsiveness styles. They suggested that avoidance could be used as a coping mechanism among mothers who struggled to deal with the new situation, but also as a predictor of weaker maternal attachment and responsiveness. As already mentioned, premature children may more often be characterized by a more serious expression than full-term children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This may be associated with reports of emotional instability, observed for example as changeable moods, as have been more frequently reported among preschool preterms children than terms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We therefore think that both maternal attachment and the infants&#x02019; expressions of emotionality might have been positively altered by the intervention. The toddlers may have regulated their mother&#x02019;s feelings by their degree of susceptibility. When mothers in the PI group, guided by their new understanding of their individual child, were able to initiate interactions and elicit positive emotional expressions from their child, it may have become easier for them to establish an emotional closeness to the child and reduce their experiences of stress.</p><p>Deater-Deckard
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] emphasized that parenting stress is experienced as negative feelings toward both oneself and the child. More PC mothers expressed such negative feelings in terms of fewer smiles and lack of positive responses from their infants at age one than PI mothers. This produced a significant difference on the subscale &#x02018;Reinforces parents&#x02019;. This may be due to different expectations between these groups of mothers, but could also be a sign of subdued expressions of happiness among infants in the PC group, possibly influenced by a weaker emotional closeness to their mothers in these early months of life.</p><p>The early differences between the preterm groups included a difference in maternal experience of competence at age one, and subsequently significant differences in both competence and all child-related dimensions from age two until seven. Parental education has been found to be one of several key components in early interventions for preterm infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the MITP offered PI parents plenty of practical information and insights. We wonder whether the gradually increasing differences in maternal reports of stress between preterm groups, and a perception of poorer mother-infant adjustment among PC mothers, could be related to transactional mechanisms affecting the establishment of early parent-child synchrony and parental support of their child&#x02019;s regulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Feldman <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] found that better synchrony in early parent-child interactions at age 3&#x000a0;months predicted higher self-regulation skills among the children at age two. This was particularly important for children who were perceived by their parents as being difficult to manage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This makes sense, as the difference between groups in stress concerning adaptability, distractibility, demandingness and acceptability were most evident at ages three, five and seven. Hauser-Cram <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reported similar increases in child-related stress among parents of children identified with disabilities. They identified variations in children&#x02019;s self-regulation skills and mother-infant interactional skills as critical components.</p><p>PI fathers&#x02019; reports of stress seemed to be less affected by the intervention than those of PI mothers. The fewer significant differences between PI and PC fathers may also be influenced by great variability in father&#x02019;s interventional participation. Negative correlations between paternal stress and PI father&#x02019;s participation rates were evident on several measurement occasions. At age nine, correlations between stress and participation were significant in paternal perception of the child, father-child interactions, and their overall reports of stress. Similar correlations between paternal stress and the intervention participation have previously been reported by Kaaresen <italic>et al.</italic> at age one
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This may indicate that the associations are effects of intervention, but they may also be influenced by other factors such as differences in fathers&#x02019; motivation, knowledge, and so on. Interestingly, the highest negative correlation between reported stress and fathers&#x02019; participation were related to participation in the four home visits (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;-0.34). If this is a unique intervention effect it highlights the importance of including home visits in early intervention programs, in line with a recently published review
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The inclusion of fathers may also have promoted a higher degree of shared perception of stress between PI parents compared with PC parents. Morgan <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] argues that better agreement regarding roles and challenges would be likely to produce more similar levels of parenting stress within families. A stronger agreement in the PI group was evident, especially at ages two and nine. A further interpretation of these results is difficult, since until recently, fathers have not been taken into account as independent informants in studies of parenting stress and child developmental outcomes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we compared parenting stress between the preterm groups and the term reference group. Parents in the PI group reported child- and parent-related stress similar as TR parents, while both longitudinal and cross-sectional differences between the PC and the TR group throughout childhood did emerge. Even though the meta-analysis by Schappin <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that parents of preterm children have become less exposed to increased parenting stress during the past few decades
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], our findings cannot confirm that conclusion. On the other hand, the occurrence of increased parenting stress frequently reported by parents of prematurely born children seemed to be eliminated by this intervention.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of this study is the high participation rates that were maintained throughout the study period, reaching 85% among mothers and 72% among fathers across groups even at age nine. Although randomization generated a high degree of equality between preterm groups in aspects of birth, medical and socio-economic variables, PI mothers did have an average of one year more education than the PC mothers. Maternal education has previously been reported to be negatively correlated with parenting stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] but in the latest meta-analysis by Schappin <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] maternal educational levels were not found to influence any aspect of parental stress. Nevertheless, all our analyses controlled for the difference of one year in mean maternal education. A limitation related to the construction of the study lies in the nature of self-reported questionnaires. Data collected by the PSI questionnaire are a result of parents&#x02019; subjective perception of stress on a specific day. An inclusion of biological parameters, such as the measurement of cortisol, may have safeguarded against faulty conclusions. Data may also be influenced by the way questions are asked in the two questionnaires. In the PSI-SF, questions are expressed more directly (more directly problem-orientated formulations), which may have amplified differences between respondents in their perceptions of greater or less stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>We have previously reported interventional influences on the longitudinal trajectories and cross-sectional differences on children&#x02019;s behavioral outcomes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Parenting stress is known to be closely correlated with children&#x02019;s behavioral development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and relationships between parenting stress and child behavior outcomes will be reported in papers to follow. This study demonstrates how an early child-centered and family-focused intervention may reduce parenting stress across childhood. This is a finding, not only concerning families taking care of prematurely born children but possibly also for other children and families at risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As hypothesized, we conclude that this sensitizing intervention reduced maternal parenting stress and positively influenced mothers&#x02019; perceptions of their children&#x02019;s adaptability and happiness. Different longitudinal patterns in child-related stress were reported by PI mothers than by PC mothers throughout childhood. In all PSI main dimensions, significantly higher levels were reported by PC mothers and fathers at every age until the age of five. Stronger correlations were found in parenting stress reported by parents in the PI group than the PC group, indicating more shared perceptions of their children after intervention.</p><p>Finally, both parents in the PI group reported parenting stress similar to the term reference group at all follow-ups, whereas differences between the PC and TR group increased with age throughout childhood.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRIB</term><def><p>Clinical Risk Index for Babies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ES</term><def><p>effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p>gestational age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>intraclass correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMM</term><def><p>linear mixed models</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LS</term><def><p>Life Stress</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MITP</term><def><p>Mother-Infant Transaction Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICU</term><def><p>neonatal intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC group</term><def><p>preterm control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>Parental Distress</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI group</term><def><p>preterm intervention group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI</term><def><p>Parenting Stress Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI</term><def><p>DC, subscale in PSI-SF named Difficult Child</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI-FF</term><def><p>Parenting Stress Index-Full Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI</term><def><p>P-CDI, subscale in PSI-SF named Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI</term><def><p>PD, subscale in PSI-SF named Parental Distress</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSI-SF</term><def><p>Parenting Stress Index-Short Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNAP</term><def><p>Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TISP</term><def><p>Troms&#x000f8; Intervention Study on Preterms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TR group</term><def><p>term control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSS</term><def><p>Total Stress Score.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>IPL carried out the statistical analyses, interpretation of the data and drafted the paper.
