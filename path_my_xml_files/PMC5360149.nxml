During this phase III open-label study, 60 subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive HZ/su through SC or IM routes in a 0, 2&#x000a0;month schedule. Vaccine response rates (VRRs) and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE)-specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms were recorded for 7 and 30&#x000a0;d after each vaccination and graded 1&#x02013;3 in severity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study. At one month post-dose 2, VRRs were 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 88.1&#x02013;100) in both groups; anti-gE antibody GMCs were 44126.1&#x000a0;mIU/ml (95% CI: 36326.1&#x02013;53601.0) and 45521.5&#x000a0;mIU/ml (95% CI; 37549.5&#x02013;55185.9) in the SC and IM groups, respectively. Injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) were common, and observed more frequently following SC administration. Grade 3 redness and swelling were more frequently observed after SC administration. Fatigue and headache were the most frequently reported general symptoms for both routes of administration. Ten and 7 unsolicited AEs were reported in the SC and IM group, respectively. Two unsolicited AEs (1 in SC; 1 in IM) were considered related to vaccination by the investigator. Three non-fatal SAEs considered unrelated to vaccination were reported during the study. Administration of the HZ/su vaccine candidate resulted in a substantial immune response that was comparable between SC and IM subjects, but local reactogenicity may be greater for SC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>adjuvant</kwd><kwd>adjuvanted vaccine</kwd><kwd>herpes zoster</kwd><kwd>HZ/su vaccine</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>intramuscular</kwd><kwd>subcutaneous</kwd><kwd>reactogenicity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><ref-count count="27"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes Zoster (HZ) is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Primary VZV infection causes varicella (chickenpox) and usually occurs in childhood, after which the virus lays dormant in the affected ganglia, often for decades, until reactivation.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> HZ is typically characterized by a vesicular rash in a unilateral dermatomal distribution that is usually accompanied by radicular pain.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The incidence of HZ increases with age,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2-4</sup></xref> at least partly due to age-related decline in VZV-specific immunity.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> HZ risk begins to increase particularly in adults &#x02265; 50&#x000a0;y of age (YOA).<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In Japan, HZ incidence has been reported to be 4.15 per 1,000 person-years,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> comparable to the incidence rates reported in the US and Europe.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8-11</sup></xref></p><p>The herpes zoster recombinant subunit candidate vaccine (HZ/su), consisting of VZV glycoprotein E (gE)<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and the proprietary AS01<sub>B</sub> adjuvant system,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> when administered intramuscularly (IM) has shown an age-independent vaccine efficacy of 97% in the prevention of HZ, with a clinically acceptable safety profile.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In Japanese subjects, IM administration of 2 doses of HZ/su resulted in a substantial immune response,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> comparable to other study populations.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16-18</sup></xref></p><p>In some countries, notably Japan, subcutaneous (SC) vaccine administration is preferred over IM vaccination.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> As previous investigations with other vaccines have suggested that both vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity may be impacted by the route of administration,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20-21</sup></xref> this study was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the HZ/su candidate vaccine in Japanese adults 50 YOA or older when HZ/su was administered SC compared to IM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Demographics</title><p>A total of 60 subjects were enrolled in the study (30 subjects each in the SC and IM groups; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).
