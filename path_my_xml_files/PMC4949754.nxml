Previous research has shown that multidisciplinary management of chronic disease can improve patient outcomes. The effect of multidisciplinary self-care management on quality of life and renal function of patients with diabetic kidney disease has not yet been well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary self-care management program on quality of life, self-care behavior, adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment, glycemic control, and renal function of adults with diabetic kidney disease. A uniform balanced cross-over design is used, with the objective to recruit 40 adult participants with diabetic kidney disease, from public and private out-patient settings in French speaking Switzerland. Participants are randomized in equal number into four study arms. Each participant receives usual care alternating with the multidisciplinary self- care management program. Each treatment period lasts three months and is repeated twice at different time intervals over 12&#x000a0;months depending on the cross-over arm. The multidisciplinary self-care management program is led by an advanced practice nurse and adds nursing and dietary consultations and follow-ups, to the habitual management provided by the general practitioner, the nephrologist and the diabetologist. Data is collected every three months for 12&#x000a0;months. Quality of life is measured using the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life scale, patient self-care behavior is assessed using the Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy is evaluated using the Medication Events Monitoring System. Blood glucose control is measured by the glycated hemoglobin levels and renal function by serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Data will be analyzed using STATA version 14.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The cross-over design will elucidate the responses of individual participant to each treatment, and will allow us to better evaluate the use of such a design in clinical settings and behavioral studies. This study also explores the impact of a theory-based nursing practice and its implementation into a multidisciplinary context.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01967901">NCT01967901</ext-link>, registered on the 18th of October 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0279-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetic nephropathies</kwd><kwd>Diabetic nephropathy</kwd><kwd>Interdisciplinary studies</kwd><kwd>Multidisciplinary care</kwd><kwd>Self-care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006387</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leenaards</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is becoming a global health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that affects largely the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite advances in pharmacology and management strategies, it remains associated with high morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Non-adherence to the treatment regimen is thought to be the major cause for the poor control and the complications in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multidisciplinary management of chronic disease has been shown to improve patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Up to our knowledge, few studies addressed specifically the multidisciplinary management of DKD and none evaluated the effect of multidisciplinary self-care management on renal function. A multidisciplinary self-care management program (MSMP) could optimize self-care, and improve the outcomes of patients with DKD.</p><p>DKD affects approximately 30 to 40&#x000a0;% of diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is a progressive disease associated with multiple co-morbidities, major complications and increased health costs. Its main complications include renal failure, and cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The frequent hospitalizations associated with the progression of the disease and dialysis increase considerably the health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further, decreased kidney function was found to be associated with a highly compromised health related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The management of DKD aims at improving patient outcomes such as functional status, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], preventing the progression of kidney disease and cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients, with multiple chronic diseases, like DKD, living at home, are expected, on daily basis, to fulfill their own self-care activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients are in general unable to accomplish their self-care effectively without assistance and guidance for acquiring symptom monitoring and interpretation skills, setting priorities and decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to a meta-analysis, chronic disease self-management programs have shown to improve patients&#x02019; clinical outcomes, like glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis documented that diabetes mellitus self-management programs may improve the patients quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The use of multidisciplinary management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), have been recommended starting at an early stage of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several systematic reviews of the literature or meta-analysis confirm the effectiveness of multidisciplinary clinic based nurse-led management programs, multidisciplinary home visit management programs, and multidisciplinary home tele-management programs of various chronic diseases, such as heart failure, diabetes, and kidney disease, in improving one or more patient outcomes such as reducing costs, re-hospitalization rates and mortality, increasing health literacy, and adherence to treatment, ameliorating patients functional status, self- care abilities and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Few of the multidisciplinary chronic disease trials used strategies to improve patient self-care as their primary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These studies addressed mainly heart failure patients and did not include home visits in their intervention. One study addressed self-management strategies in the multidisciplinary management of DKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, this study did not evaluate the effect of the intervention on kidney function, did not investigate a role for an advanced practice nurse (APN), and did not include home visits. Considering the constant and predicted increase in the aging population, the increasing prevalence of DKD, its clinical significance, and its impact on the daily life of patients and on the health care system, a MSMP is a promising approach for improving patients&#x02019; outcomes and stabilizing the kidney function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aim</title><p>The present study is designed to evaluate the impact of a MSMP on quality of life, self-care behavior, adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment, glycemic control, and renal function in adults with DKD. The study protocol adheres to the SPIRIT reporting guidelines. A SPIRIT checklist is provided as an additional file (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>The research hypotheses are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The participants with DKD enrolled in the MSMP demonstrate a significant improvement in their quality of life, self-care behavior, adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy, glycemic control, and renal function as compared to the usual standard care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A high self-care behavior is associated with a high quality of life and an improved glycemic control.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study is using a uniform and strongly balanced cross-over design. The cross-over design is recommended for an efficient comparison of treatments when recruiting fewer participants in order to attain the same level of statistical power or precision as a randomized controlled trial. It is for use more importantly in chronic disease where treatment aims at slowing the progression of the disease, improving quality of life and preventing complications. Thus, the patient responses to each treatment are then compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], because in cross-over design, each participant will receive the treatment and serve as his own control. Further, a review of randomized control trial (RCT) interventions designed to improve outcomes of patients with multi-morbidity showed that interventions had mixed effects. Patients with chronic diseases enrolled in the RCTs present heterogeneity of co-morbidities, therefore comparisons between two groups of patients seem to be difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The strongly balanced and uniform design represents the ideal cross-over design that is able to overcome the statistical bias of the first order carry-over effect and minimize that of the second order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the present study, we considered the effect of the second order carry-over to be negligible. Each participant is receiving the standard usual care (UC) and the MSMP at different time periods during the course of the trial, as described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> on &#x0201c;Cross-over plan of participants enrolled in the MSMP study&#x0201d;. This design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of an intensive multidisciplinary follow-up as compared to the standard usual follow-up. The study is being conducted in public and private out-patient settings in the French speaking part of Switzerland. Patients are followed up in the nephrology out-patient service of the public teaching hospital, namely the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), in the diabetology out-patient service of a private medical center, namely Clinique La Source, and in private practice.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cross-over plan of participants enrolled in the MSMP study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Design</th><th>Period 1<break/>0&#x02013;3 months</th><th>Period 2<break/>3&#x02013;6 months</th><th>Period 3<break/>6&#x02013;9 months</th><th>Period 4<break/>9&#x02013;12 months</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sequence ABBA (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10)</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence BAAB (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10)</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence AABB (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10)</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence BBAA (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10)</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>B&#x02009;=&#x02009;MSMP</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td><td>A&#x02009;=&#x02009;UC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study intervention</title><p>Patients who have accepted to participate are enrolled in the study for 12&#x000a0;months. Each participant receives UC twice over three months at different time intervals, depending on the cross-over sequence he or she was assigned to. In addition, each participant receives the MSMP twice over three months at different time intervals. Therefore, participants cross-over every three months for a total of three times as described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> on &#x0201c;Cross-over plan of participants enrolled in MSMP study&#x0201d;.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Usual care period-UC</title><p>During this period, participants receive the UC management that consists of a follow-up by their general practitioner, nephrologist and/or diabetologist. The participants continue to visit their nephrologist every three months, on average. Other healthcare professionals such as a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, a podiatrist, a psychologist, and a social worker may be consulted as needed. Depending on previous hospitalizations or on earlier referrals made by their general practitioner, or diabetologist, participants might have been exposed, prior to the commencement of the study to diabetes education and, or dietary intervention. However, we assume that they have not been exposed to self-care management programs because the self-care management approach of the current study is a pioneer one in the French speaking part of Switzerland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The multidisciplinary self-care management program period- MSMP</title><p>During this period, participants continue to see their general practitioner, usual nephrologist and/or diabetologist. In addition, they receive multidisciplinary care, led and coordinated by an APN. The MSMP care consists of nursing care by a nurse specialized in diabetes care from the out-patient service of a private medical center, namely the Clinique La Source and follow-ups by a private practice dietician. A diabetes specialized nurse is delivering the main nursing intervention because most of the patients&#x02019; expected daily self-care activities are related to diabetes management and a nursing knowledge and an expertise in this area is essential for a successful follow-up. Patients who were not followed-up by a diabetologist prior to their enrollment in the study, are systematically referred to a diabetologist resident in the CHUV for one basic consultation. The diabetes specialized nurse and the dietician, adopt as recommended, a self-care management approach that is patient-centered responding to patients&#x02019; preferences, needs and values, supporting patients in informed decision-making, and developing problem-solving skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The program consists of two dietary consultations, three nursing consultations at home and/or at the out-patient clinic, and two nursing telephone follow-ups, under the supervision of the study diabetologist. Participants receive a follow-up every two weeks, by one of the MSMP healthcare member, that is the diabetes specialized nurse, a dietician, a nephrologist or a diabetologist. This frequency was adopted based on the results of a retrospective cohort of patients with diabetes mellitus (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26,496) that evaluated the effective frequency of contact with a physician that would help achieve the targeted patient clinical outcomes such as glycemic control and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The intervention starts with a consultation with the nurse who completes a comprehensive initial assessment and shares it with the multidisciplinary team.

This person is a nurse and a PhD nursing candidate. The APN role has been fashioned based on Hamric et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The APN is based in the CHUV nephrology service. She coordinates the consultations of the dietician and the diabetes specialized nurse. She provides guidance to the diabetes specialized nurse and the dietician, assisting them in tailoring care based on evidenced-based intervention and safeguarding a self-care management approach. She discusses each participants care plan and goals with the diabetes specialized nurse before and after each consultation. In addition, the APN discusses each care plan and patient progress with the study diabetologist and the participant&#x02019;s nephrologists. Both of these specialty physicians may discuss patient management with the general practitioner and recommend changes in the medication regimen. The APN also coordinates the participant care with other healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, and social workers, as needed. Due to the dispersion of the multidisciplinary team between public and private sectors, and in order to facilitate the communication flow and ensure timely sharing of participants care information, needs and progress, an electronic application was developed. This application aimed at sending, directly, the specific assessment and follow-up forms filled by the diabetes specialized nurse to the APN and/or the dietician. Due to this immediate sharing of information, the APN is constantly informed and updated on patient care and the diabetes specialized nurse&#x02019;s comprehensive assessment is available to the dieticians before her first encounter with the participant. In addition, the APN is responsible for the efficacy of the study, its data collection, and management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The role of the study diabetologist</title><p>The multidisciplinary team benefits of a diabetologist who acts as a consultant for the study.

She also discusses participants&#x02019; care plan with the respective nephrologist and may recommend a change in the patient&#x02019;s diabetic medications or antihypertensive regimen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The role of the diabetes specialized nurse</title><p>Orem&#x02019;s Self-Care Deficit Theory as described in the section entitled &#x0201c;the science of the development and exercise of self-care agency&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], was used to inform the diabetes specialized nurse&#x02019;s role. Specific evidence-based practice nursing assessment and follow-up forms and educational materials were identified and adapted to the purpose of the study and its specific patient population. All of these forms and materials were translated into French, and approved by the study team. In the MSMP, the diabetes specialized nurse institutes a self-care program. Her role consists of providing a comprehensive initial clinical and psychosocial assessment of the participant, an evaluation of the participant medication safety use, and the development of a care plan collaboratively with the participant who will identify a priority treatment goal. The participant rates his or her confidence of potentially attaining the goal and sign a contract with the diabetes specialized nurse. The diabetes specialized nurse then develops nursing interventions that will help the participant meet the goal. Nursing interventions include tailored teaching, counseling and support. All participants receive evidenced based educational material on how to best protect their kidneys, that was conceived for the purpose of the study. Participants are asked to contact the diabetes specialized nurse during working hours for any question related to the MSMP and the emergency department of the CHUV outside working hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The role of the dietician</title><p>All participants are screened and evaluated by one of the two dieticians of the study.

At the end of the study, the multidisciplinary team will remain available for follow-up if desired by the general practitioner.

Also, the recruited diabetes specialized nurse believes in the intervention, the importance of fostering self-care, and is confident in being able to execute the nursing role as required by the protocol. The diabetes specialized nurse follows up all patients included in the study and throughout the whole study period. To ensure efficacy and internal consistency, care was structured by using electronic forms for data entry on patient assessment and follow-up. All the specific assessment forms and follow-up forms were transformed into electronic questionnaires. Hence, few questions, relevant to the patient assessment, are mandatory in order to proceed to the following questions. Rendering questions mandatory ensures completeness of the comprehensive patient assessment, without missing information. All the verbal communications within the multidisciplinary team is also documented electronically. Each patient signs with the diabetes specialized nurse, a contract describing his or her priority goal. The contract includes a description of the barriers and the plan for attaining the goal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Power calculation</title><p>Patients&#x02019; quality of life is our main outcome. Multiple chronic diseases are associated with compromised quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our patient population suffers from two chronic conditions, i.e., diabetes and kidney disease. Quality of life degrades with the continuous decline of the kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, improvement of patients&#x02019; quality of life is one of the main goals of the management of DKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis documented that diabetes self-management programs may improve patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the American Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] recommends the measurements of quality of life as an endpoint in diabetes self-care management programs.

Few studies have employed an experimental prospective design to evaluate multidisciplinary management in DKD to date. Therefore, to elucidate the effect of a multidisciplinary management of DKD, randomized trials are needed. The present study offers to patients with DKD at an early stage of the disease, a six months individualized patient care as part of a multidisciplinary self-care management including clinic and home nursing visits. A balanced cross-over design is used in this study. This design has rarely been used in behavioral and nursing studies. However, cross-over designs are recommended for understanding each patient&#x02019;s response to different treatments. Thus, it will be possible to better evaluate the efficacy of such designs in clinical settings and behavioral studies. Recruitment from the DKD population is challenging as this population presents multi-morbidities. Adding nursing visits, home visits, dietary visits and telephone follow-ups at a frequency of one every two weeks, is constraining to some patients.</p><p>One of the study limitations can be attributed to the role of APN. She delivers the coordination of care as part of the study MSMP intervention and is directly involved in outcome data organization. She is overseeing data collection when not blinded to treatment allocation. However, outcomes measurements were carried out by the participant himself for the self-reported questionnaire and by an independent laboratory for the clinical outcomes. These measures prohibited the APN from influencing data collection directly.</p><p>This study will shed the light on an advanced role for nurses in Switzerland. It is also evaluating the impact of integrating a theory based nursing role into practice. The roles of the APN, the diabetes specialized nurse, and the flow of the coordination among all team-members is designed in a way that meets the dynamics of the Swiss healthcare system, while at the same time introducing a new role for nurses. In addition to the usual medically delegated tasks, the nurse has the opportunity to exercise her critical thinking and demonstrate her role in the multidisciplinary team through her assessment, competencies in patient follow-up and coordination of care. One strength of this study is the fostering of collaboration between the public and the private sector in Switzerland. However, this collaboration adds a major challenge to patient care coordination. This is due to the fact that the multidisciplinary team in this study is not based at the same place. Some team members are working in the public sector, some others in the private sector and at differing locations. Therefore, the multidisciplinary team collaboration is &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; and proper communication is essential to make up for the lack of a physical setting for encounters and constant exchange. To improve coordination of participants&#x02019; visits to different healthcare professionals, the appointments with the dieticians and the diabetes specialized nurse were centralized with the APN. As each of these providers had other patients outside the study to look after, coordination of appointment may present as a limitation. When participants miss an appointment, rescheduling becomes constraining and much exchanging is necessary in order to achieve a successful rescheduling. In an exploratory study, using focus groups with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the lack of individualized and coordinated care were the most often reported perceived barriers to effective implementation of self-care plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Beyond these difficulties, results of this study will highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary care with self-care management as a primary goal, for ensuring an individualized collaborative approach, in which the patient plays a major role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADDQoL, audit of diabetes-dependent quality of life; APN, advanced practice nurse; CHUV, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois/University Medical Center Vaud; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKD_EPI, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration; DKD, diabetic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; MEMS, Medication Events Monitoring System; MSMP, Multidisciplinary self- care management program; RCT, Randomized controlled trails; R-SDSCA, revised summary of diabetes self-care activities questionnaire; UC, usual care</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12882_2016_279_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT Checklist.
