This study evaluated telephone health-mentoring targeting home-based walking (tele-rehab) compared to usual waiting time (usual care) followed by group PR.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>People with COPD were randomized to tele-rehab (intervention) or usual care (controls). Tele-rehab delivered by trained nurse health-mentors supported participants&#x02019; home-based walking over 8&#x02013;12 weeks. PR, delivered to both groups simultaneously, included 8 weeks of once-weekly education and self-management skills, with separate supervised exercise. Data were collected at three time-points: baseline (TP1), before (TP2), and after (TP3) PR. The primary outcome was change in physical capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) with two tests performed at each time-point. Secondary outcomes included changes in self-reported home-based walking, health-related quality of life, and health behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 65 recruits, 25 withdrew before completing PR. Forty attended a median of 6 (4) education sessions. Seventeen attended supervised exercise (5&#x000b1;2 sessions). Between TP1 and TP2, there was a statistically significant increase in the median 6MWD of 12 (39.1) m in controls, but no change in the tele-rehab group. There were no significant changes in 6MWD between other time-points or groups, or significant change in any secondary outcomes. Participants attending supervised exercise showed a nonsignificant improvement in 6MWD, 12.3 (71) m, while others showed no change, 0 (33) m. The mean 6MWD was significantly greater, but not clinically meaningful, for the second test compared to the first at all time-points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Telephone-mentoring for home-based walking demonstrated no benefit to exercise capacity. Two 6-minute walking tests at each time-point may not be necessary. Supervised exercise seems essential in PR. The challenge of incorporating exercise into daily life in COPD is substantial.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pulmonary rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>physical capacity</kwd><kwd>self-reported walking</kwd><kwd>structured self-management-based education</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory condition with systemic effect,<xref rid="b1-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> exacting a substantial burden of increasing breathlessness and physical restrictions on individuals.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This is of concern, as more physically active people with COPD have a lower risk of hospitalization and all-cause mortality<xref rid="b3-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and these individuals experience better physiologic function.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an intervention shown to help people with COPD improve their physical and psychosocial health, and is advocated as an integral component of COPD management.<xref rid="b5-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Supervised exercise is regarded as a key component of PR.

Of the 362 individuals referred, most (73%) were inpatients referred by the respiratory nurse specialist or physiotherapists, with 23% referred directly by respiratory physicians, 4% by general practitioners and community nurses, and 3% by other hospital ward-based doctors. Of the 297 not included in the study, nearly two-thirds declined an appointment, citing health or travel issues as the main barrier to attendance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-11-1991">Figure 1</xref>). Although we had planned to recruit 74 individuals, we made a decision to cease recruiting in order to complete the follow-up TP3 assessments as scheduled.

No participant changed groups during follow-up.</p><p>Of those 65 individuals randomized, 25 (38%) withdrew (12 interventions and 13 controls) during the study, with males (n=17, 68%) being more likely to withdraw than females (<italic>P</italic>=0.005). The majority withdrew prior to PR commencing (ten in intervention and ten controls). &#x0201c;Ill health&#x0201d; was named by nearly half as the reason for withdrawing, time constraints by a quarter, with the remainder citing travel issues, giving no reason, or just failure to keep appointments.</p><p>Eighteen trained nurses delivered the mentoring for tele-rehab. There were a total of 231 telephone contacts, with a mean of 7&#x000b1;3 calls per individual, each lasting a duration of 17&#x000b1;9 minutes per call and 7&#x000b1;6 days between calls. Contact with tele-rehab participants could not be made on 38 occasions and data were not recorded for 18 calls. Of 287 walking action plans set, 48% were completed, 27% not completed, and 25% not recorded. The principle reasons for not completing the walking program were being unwell or time constraints.</p><p>At the first PR session, only 31 (74%) of the 42 participants remaining by this stage expressed intention to attend the supervised exercise sessions, despite all having consented to do so at recruitment. However, only 16 (38%) actually commenced supervised exercise (ten in intervention and six controls), attending only a mean of 5&#x000b1;2 sessions of a possible eight. A preference to exercise at home was stated as the main reason for not commencing supervised exercise, followed by travel issues. Of those who commenced supervised exercise, a greater proportion was female (75%), did not have a partner (63%), had moderate or severe COPD (82%), and were in the intervention group (63%). A median of 6 (4) sessions were attended, with ill health cited as the predominant reason for nonattendance.</p><p>At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group subjects for demographic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-11-1991">Table 2</xref>) or outcome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-11-1991">Table 3</xref>) measures, or between those who withdrew and those who completed all data collections.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome at different time-points</title><p>There was a significant difference between groups for the change in the 6MWD over the first time period between TP1 and TP2, that is the effect of Tele-Rehab or usual waiting time (median 0 versus 12 meters, <italic>P</italic>=0.01).

Others have similarly concluded that self-management focusing on education<xref rid="b36-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> or self-management per se has minimal effect on physical capacity.<xref rid="b37-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Our data support the conclusions of the latter authors that this is due to participants not exercising at sufficient intensity and, as our results indicate, not walking at a sufficient frequency. In contrast, in a recent cohort study of home-based PR with once weekly supervision, participants exercised for at least 5 days per week, for 30 to 45 minutes, and at a higher intensity than our participants did, resulting in a statistically and clinically significant increase in physical capacity.<xref rid="b38-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Thus, a more demanding program, if enforceable, could have produced better outcomes.</p><p>It is possible that our tele-rehab intervention was not of sufficient duration or number of calls. A systematic review of telephone interventions for physical activity in adults, many with chronic conditions although not COPD, suggested that 12 or more calls over a 6&#x02013;12-month period was effective in improving physical activity and dietary behavior.<xref rid="b39-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Our study fell short of this demanding schedule, being of only 2 months&#x02019; duration with an average of seven calls per individual. Additionally, many of our participants did not complete their walking plans (27%) because they were unwell. It may be that this strategy is just not feasible for those with moderate to severe COPD because of the degree of illness these people experience. Our data revealed a strong correlation between self-reported walking and diary-recorded walking, pointing to the validity of these questions routinely used in Australian physiotherapy clinical practice.</p><p>This study has also reinforced the conclusions drawn from our previous study: a mere hour of supervised exercise added to the CDSMP (the structured education component of our PR approach) does not result in clinically important changes in physical capacity or self-reported physical activity.<xref rid="b21-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This was exacerbated by the low attendance rate at supervised exercise offered separately to the education component in the clinical facility where the study took place. Despite emphasizing the importance of the supervised exercise sessions, compliance even with commencing was low (38%), suggesting that participants may have perceived this to be an &#x0201c;optional extra&#x0201d;. Attendance at exercise sessions may have been improved if this was seen to be a priority and if the importance of supervised exercise was reinforced by peers.<xref rid="b40-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> It is obviously necessary that participants understand that attending higher intensity supervised exercise is paramount<xref rid="b5-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and without this they cannot expect to experience the benefits of PR. Our study supports the wider literature that supervised exercise is an essential component of PR, and it is likely that exercise sessions of substantial intensity, occurring at least twice per week, are needed to improve physical capacity.<xref rid="b5-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>This study lends support to the presence of a learning effect for the 6MWD.<xref rid="b41-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The proportion of people walking further in our study was approximately two-thirds at each of the three time-points, in contrast to the variability of 50%&#x02013;87% reported in the Field Walking Tests Technical Standards.<xref rid="b41-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> However, the increment was half that reported by others<xref rid="b42-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and while statistically significant, it is less than half the MICD.<xref rid="b28-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Nevertheless, this small change may be important, for example, in a situation where reaching a threshold distance for 6MWD determines suitability for interventions. We would then concur with Holland et al<xref rid="b41-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> that conducting two walking tests and recording the longest distance is recommended. However, if the MICD is to be the benchmark by which efficacy is measured and not 6MWD per se, our results suggest that a second test is not really required.</p><sec sec-type="methods|discussion"><title>Study limitations and implications for future practice and research</title><p>There were some limitations to our study. First, despite community nurses being trained in core self-management support skills (motivational interviewing,<xref rid="b43-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> problem-solving,<xref rid="b44-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> action planning,<xref rid="b45-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and communication skills), we do not know the extent of fidelity to the intervention. Recording of telephone calls was an intent but proved to be logistically difficult in practice and was discontinued. If this is to happen in trials set in clinical practice, the equipment must be simple and quickly performed. Second, the tele-rehab intervention may have been better delivered by health professionals, such as physiotherapists who are skilled in the management of exercise, movement, and function for people with COPD. Additionally, individuals may require prior experience of structured exercise as well as integrating this into daily activities.<xref rid="b38-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Future research may indicate how many supervised sessions are initially required. Third, walking plans may need to be a combination of health professional prescription and self-set criteria, rather than wholly self-set as in the CDSMP paradigm that this study followed; &#x0201c;tough love&#x0201d; may be required. Fourth, while we did address barriers to exercise and physical activity as they arose, we did not investigate illness or exercise perceptions, that is, how people with COPD perceive their condition and their ability to exercise. Perceptions about exercise have been positively correlated with physical capacity<xref rid="b46-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and the same may hold true for illness perceptions and response to PR. This should be addressed prior to PR commencing, as should issues, such as anxiety and depression, which have now been shown to influence physical activity.<xref rid="b47-copd-11-1991" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Furthermore, it was not possible to recruit the number of individuals suggested by the a priori power analyses during the duration of the study. Therefore, nonparametric tests were used where possible. However, due to small cell sizes, results of chi-square tests may not be accurate. Future studies may want to replicate results with larger sample sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this small but insightful study, there was no benefit to a tele-rehab phase prior to group-based PR. Structured education with self-management skills development (the CDSMP), diary-recorded walking plans, and 1 hour of weekly supervised exercise added little. Two 6MWD tests may not always be necessary, despite a small learning effect. Supervised exercise is a mandatory component of PR. However, ongoing incorporation of exercise into daily life is also essential and there is a huge challenge to achieving this in people with COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported in part by the Royal Hobart Hospital Research Foundation Grant, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia; a Department of Health and Human Services Grant, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia; and a University of Tasmania Research Enhancement Grant, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.
