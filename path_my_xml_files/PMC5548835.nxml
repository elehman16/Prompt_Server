Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of all lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Long-term prognosis for these patients is poor, since the majority present with advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and half of the patients initially treated for early-stage NSCLC subsequently relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Immunotherapy is a new paradigm for the treatment of NSCLC. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody that inhibits the interaction between PD-1 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/PD-L2 receptors. Pembrolizumab received approval from the US FDA in October 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) &#x02265;50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<italic>ALK</italic>) genomic tumor aberrations, and no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic NSCLC.</p><p id="Par8">The KEYNOTE-024 trial demonstrated that patients with metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS &#x02265;50% treated with pembrolizumab 200&#x000a0;mg every 3&#x000a0;weeks had superior overall survival (OS) compared with patients who received standard-of-care (SoC) treatment, with a hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41&#x02013;0.89; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with pembrolizumab than with SoC (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37&#x02013;0.68; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Grade 3&#x02013;5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were less common with pembrolizumab than with SoC.</p><p id="Par9">The introduction of new oncology therapies can result in financial pressure for US healthcare payers. This is the first economic evaluation of pembrolizumab in first-line NSCLC and is designed to inform value-based reimbursement decisions for payers. The analysis used KEYNOTE-024 data to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with SoC chemotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC expressing high levels of PD-L1 from a US third-party public healthcare payer perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">A partitioned-survival model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] was developed to project expected costs and outcomes for pembrolizumab compared with SoC. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; the incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained was also determined. The model was developed in Microsoft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA).</p><p id="Par11">Efficacy, safety and utility data were derived from KEYNOTE-024, with a cut-off date of 9 May 2016. This phase III randomized controlled trial compared pembrolizumab with the investigator&#x02019;s choice of five platinum-based regimens in first-line metastatic NSCLC.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Target Population</title><p id="Par12">The target population in the model was based on the KEYNOTE-024 trial population: patients aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years (mean age 64&#x000a0;years); diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC without <italic>EGFR</italic>-activating mutations or <italic>ALK</italic> translocations; no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic NSCLC; PD-L1 TPS &#x02265;50%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par13">Patients in KEYNOTE-024 were randomized to pembrolizumab 200&#x000a0;mg once every 3&#x000a0;weeks for up to 35 cycles or platinum-based chemotherapy for 4&#x02013;6 cycles. Non-squamous patients in the SoC arm without progressive disease after completion of chemotherapy were eligible to receive pemetrexed maintenance. The SoC regimens included pemetrexed&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;carboplatin, pemetrexed&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cisplatin, gemcitabine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cisplatin, gemcitabine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;carboplatin, and paclitaxel&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;carboplatin (Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM] 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Treatment was continued for the specified number of cycles or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, patient withdrawal, or investigator decision. PFS was assessed according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), version 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review (BICR). Patients receiving SoC with verified progressive disease could switch to receive pembrolizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients were eligible to switch if they had documented progression, did not stop chemotherapy for any other reason than progressive disease, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1 at time of progression and had at least 30&#x000a0;days of survival after SOC treatment. Clinically stable patients considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator were eligible to continue pembrolizumab beyond progression. Patients treated with pembrolizumab were assumed to be treated for a maximum of 2&#x000a0;years as per trial protocol and FDA-approved label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Model Structure</title><p id="Par15">The model evaluated the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with SoC as first-line treatment in the target population (ESM 2). A partitioned-survival model was constructed with three mutually exclusive health states, progression-free (starting state), progressive disease, and death (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Outcomes and costs of AEs, toxicity grade 3&#x02013;5, were incorporated and weighted by their observed incidence. The time in each health state was used to estimate cumulative total costs and health outcomes over the time horizon for a cohort of patients receiving each intervention.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Model states and transitions. <italic>AEs</italic> adverse events</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40273_2017_527_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Scenario analyses explored the effect of shorter time horizons (5 and 10&#x000a0;years), in view of the short life expectancy of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year, with rates of 0 and 5% explored in scenario analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a US third-party public healthcare payer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Clinical Parameters</title><p id="Par18">The model effectiveness parameters were estimated from KEYNOTE-024 patient-level data for time-on-treatment (ToT), PFS and OS.</p><p id="Par19">Parametric functions were fitted to the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier (KM) ToT, PFS and OS data, in line with published guidelines, to extrapolate from the trial duration (median follow-up 11.2&#x000a0;months; range 6.3&#x02013;19.7&#x000a0;months) to the 20-year time horizon. The survival curve fitting was carried out in line with UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit (DSU) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The parametric models fit were the Weibull, the exponential, the log-normal, the log-logistic and the Gompertz distributions. Statistical tests based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), combined with visual inspection (comparing fitted distributions to study KM plots), were used to select the best-fitting parametric distributions for the base case. Finally, the clinical plausibility of the extrapolated results was considered in selecting the final distribution functions for the model. Alternative parametric functions were tested in scenario analyses.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Time-on-Treatment</title><p id="Par20">ToT data from the KEYNOTE-024 trial were analysed to determine treatment duration and cost, since patients deriving clinical benefit could continue pembrolizumab beyond progression.

A simplified two-stage approach as described by Latimer and Abrams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Latimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was implemented to perform an OS analysis adjusting for switching in the SoC arm. Through this approach, OS treatment effect estimate was adjusted to correct for the bias induced by treatment switch.</p><p id="Par23">Two datasets are available for use in the OS analysis: (1) the intention-to-treat (ITT) dataset included patients who switched from SoC to pembrolizumab following disease progression, and (2) a &#x02018;switching-adjusted&#x02019; dataset used the two-stage adjustment method to adjust the survival benefit of patients who switched to pembrolizumab,</p><p id="Par24">The ITT dataset was used in the base-case analysis, as it better represented the real-world situation given the existing FDA approval of pembrolizumab as second-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The EQ-5D questionnaire was administered at treatment cycle 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and every third cycle as long as patients were on study treatment, as well as at the treatment discontinuation visit and at a 30-day post-treatment safety follow-up visit. The generic health statuses assessed from the EQ-5D questionnaire were converted to population-based utility values using published algorithms. For the base-case analysis, US-based scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were applied to US patients, UK-based scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for UK patients and EU-based scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for all other patients. Two approaches of defining health state utilities were considered: time-to-death and progression-based health states. The time-to-death approach, recently described by Hatswell et al.

Pembrolizumab was associated with lower HCRUs than SoC. The progression-free state HCRU in the KEYNOTE-024 was described in detail in Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to test the robustness of the model with respect to uncertainty in model input parameters. In this analysis, each key parameter was assigned a theoretical probability distribution. Correlated parameters were assigned a joint distribution. For example, the two parameters in the Weibull function fitted to ToT were assigned a multivariate-normal distribution. The PSA was performed using a second-order Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations. DSA ranges and parameter distributions used in the PSA are detailed in ESM 6.</p><p id="Par38">Multiple scenario-based sensitivity analyses were also performed. One such analysis explored the impact of differing practice patterns implied by selection of alternative OS data. In particular, analyses representing settings where PD-1 inhibitors are unavailable as second-line or later treatment were explored using a two-stage adjustment of the treatment OS that removed the effect of switching treatment from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. Additional scenario-based sensitivity analyses adjusted the model time horizon, the discounting of costs and outcomes, and the impact of PD-L1 testing costs, as well as the application of alternative plausible parametric functions to the extrapolation of OS, PFS and ToT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Model Validation</title><p id="Par39">The modelling process followed good practice.

Evaluation covered not only the conceptual model but also the model data, assumptions, methods, analyses and results. The panel feedback was used to provide insight into what AEs were important for inclusion in the model, It also provided verification to the modelling approach, analysis plans, clinical plausibility of clinical inputs (e.g. hospitalization rates for AEs), duration of treatment effects and modelled outcomes such as projections of OS and PFS. Where consensus was not achieved, the panel provided guidance on the scope of sensitivity analyses.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">The cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus docetaxel has already been demonstrated in a second-line setting for patients with NSCLC and a TPS &#x02265;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This economic evaluation compared pembrolizumab with SoC platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC expressing high levels of PD-L1. Base-case results indicated that, compared with SoC over a 20-year time horizon, pembrolizumab would be expected to result in an additional 1.31 LYs and an additional 1.05 QALYs gained, without adjustment for treatment switching, at an additional cost of $US102,439, giving an incremental cost of $US97,621/QALY gained or an incremental cost of $US78,344/LY gained. The main driver of the increased cost with pembrolizumab was the drug acquisition cost. Sensitivity analysis indicated the results were most sensitive to the extrapolation of PFS, OS and ToT, and cost in the progression-free state. The analysis was specifically conducted for the population indicated by the pembrolizumab label supported by KEYNOTE-024. The results are not generalizable to lower PD-L1 levels (TPS &#x0003c;50%).</p><p id="Par49">There has been no general agreement on a cost-effectiveness ratio threshold for the USA. Braithwaite et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] cite multiple decision rules, including the commonly cited $US50,000/QALY gained and the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] of three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per disability-adjusted life-year, which is estimated to equate to $US171,660 in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Their analyses suggested a range for the willingness-to-pay threshold (adjusted to $US, year 2016 values) of $US122,360&#x02013;340,000 and $US140,392&#x02013;382,536 for LYs gained and QALYs gained, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A more recent analysis by Neumann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] recommended using an ICER range of between $US100,000 and $US150,000/QALY gained, although analyses should allow for examination of multiple thresholds up to $US200,000/QALY gained. The Institute of Clinical and Economic Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] recently made a recommendation of a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds between $US50,000 and $US150,000 per QALY. The base-case ICER for pembrolizumab of $US97,621/QALY in the current analysis falls within these ranges of acceptable thresholds. Results from the PSA showed an 87% probability that the ICER would be below $US150,000/QALY. Hypothetical modelling and simulated data have suggested the partitioned-survival model may have some potential for bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, an empirical analysis using real-world data from three clinical trials found that the partitioned-survival approach produced ICER estimates similar to those generated by Markov modelling in metastatic NSCLC, indicating that the suggestion of consistent bias is unfounded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Additionally, the two-phase piecewise model for OS extrapolation has been noted as a preferred approach by the NICE Evidence Review Group compared with fitting a parametric function distribution over the entire time horizon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The base-case analysis included patients who switched from SoC to pembrolizumab after progression in KEYNOTE-024. This is consistent with real-world clinical practice, as pembrolizumab is currently indicated in the USA as second-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, such switching has the effect of diluting the survival benefit with pembrolizumab while increasing costs in the SoC group (as some SoC patients receive pembrolizumab as second-line treatment). A scenario analysis using OS data adjusted for switching resulted in higher estimates for LYs and QALYs gained with pembrolizumab, with a slightly higher ICER ($US114,194/QALY), compared with the base case ($US97,621/QALY).</p><p id="Par51">A key strength of this analysis is its use of efficacy and safety data from a randomized controlled trial directly comparing pembrolizumab and SoC. However, the analysis also has several limitations. Resource use from the clinical trial may not represent that of real-world clinical practice. Like all clinical trials, KEYNOTE-024 was conducted in a selected patient population that met trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, and may not reflect patients seen in real-world clinical practice. Similarly, KEYNOTE-024 was primarily conducted in large, urban, academic centres within and outside the USA, where clinical practice may differ from that in community practices and other treatment locations. In KEYNOTE-024, 37.4% of non-squamous patients received pemetrexed continuation maintenance. This compares with data from the Flatiron database, which found 26.6% of non-squamous patients receiving induction therapy received continuation maintenance therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. As the impact on efficacy associated with these different rates is not known, the bias to the ICER results is also unknown. In the SoC arm, 43.7% of patients had within-trial switching to pembrolizumab and 49.7% received PD-1 inhibitors, including indirect switching. Estimations from the Flatiron database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (in patients diagnosed between 1 October 2015 and 31 August 2016) indicated the percentage of patients who received PD-1 inhibitors as subsequent therapies was 49.0% in patients with PD-L1 &#x02265;50% metastatic NSCLC who received platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy. The switching rate in the trial was similar to that in real-world evidence.</p><p id="Par52">The costs of grade 3&#x02013;5 AEs with an incidence rate &#x0003c;5% in both treatment groups were not included in the analysis, leading to underestimation of AE costs. However, the bias is not expected to be large considering the low incidence rate of the excluded AEs. In addition, sensitivity analyses have been conducted to vary the AE costs by &#x000b1;50%, and the results indicated this variation in AE costs only had a small impact on the ICER.</p><p id="Par53">The analyses indicated pembrolizumab was cost effective at its published list price. Any hypothetical discount does not qualitatively change this result. Further sensitivity analyses showed that pembrolizumab would be cost effective under the threshold of $US100,000/QALY if its cost increased up to 3%, and cost effective under the threshold of $US150,000/QALY if its cost increased up to 59%.</p><p id="Par54">Evaluation using cost-effectiveness analyses does not guarantee affordability. Understanding the potential budget impact is also necessary. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] reported a budget impact analysis to evaluate the cost burden associated with pembrolizumab in treating first-line metastatic NSCLC to US payers. It projected the incidence of metastatic NSCLC to be 313 patients for a health plan with 1&#x000a0;million members. Assuming an 80% PD-L1 testing rate and 30% prevalence of PD-L1 &#x02265;50% within these patients, 55 patients were projected to be eligible for pembrolizumab treatment. These analyses showed a budget impact of pembrolizumab of $US0.12 per member per month.</p><p id="Par55">At data cut-off from KEYNOTE-024 for this analysis, the median follow-up in the trial was &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year; therefore, extrapolation was necessary to model a lifetime time horizon. Uncertainty is inherent in this process, and although several survival curve options were explored in scenario analyses, longer-term data will be important to test the model results in future clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">Compared with SoC platinum-based chemotherapy, pembrolizumab showed significantly longer OS and PFS and fewer treatment-related AEs in patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS &#x02265;50%. The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that pembrolizumab improves life expectancy and expected quality-adjusted life time and can be considered a cost-effective option compared with SoC in these patients with biomarker-identified metastatic NSCLC from a third-party US public payer perspective.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title><bold>Data availability statements</bold></title><p id="Par57">Several datasets were used for this analysis: (1) efficacy, safety, patient-reported outcomes and healthcare resource utilization data collected in phase III KEYNOTE-024 trial.
