<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and individuals with a mental illness (35&#x02013;90%).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Comparatively, the population smoking rate in Australia is 15%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Therefore, evaluating tobacco control approaches for effectiveness with disadvantaged social groups is a priority.</p><p>Cigarette manufacturers use the cigarette pack to promote their product in a number of ways. The cigarette pack is highly visible to the user and others,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and reinforces brand image.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Packaging distinguishes brands from competitors and communicates brand imagery, character and values.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Pack design can also be used to target segments of the market. For example, packs targeting women typically use bright graphics and feminine colours, descriptor terms such as &#x02018;slim&#x02019; and &#x02018;thin&#x02019; and packaging with increased height and decreased width compared with standard packaging.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To engage the youth market, pack designs are novel, with fashionable designs and attractive imagery, have innovative pack construction (ie, pack shape and method of opening) and promote &#x02018;mild&#x02019; taste or &#x02018;smoothness&#x02019;.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Economy packs that emphasise quality are important for targeting low-income smokers, and often use design elements such as printing product price on packaging.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Packaging has been particularly important in markets such as Australia where stringent advertising restrictions have long prohibited traditional avenues of advertising and promotion of brand and product.</p><p>Design elements of the cigarette pack are constructed to capture starter smokers, encourage brand-switching and brand loyalty and to expand market share.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Packaging colours, product descriptors, brand imagery and logos have all been shown to impact on the perceptions and experiences of the product.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A colour code for tobacco products is well established: lighter packaging colours are perceived to contain a product that is less harmful to health. Numerous studies have shown that smokers associate the colour &#x02018;red&#x02019; with high strength and harshness, &#x02018;blue&#x02019; as being mild and anything progressively lighter as healthier or less harmful.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Similarly, many countries have banned the use of descriptor terms such as &#x02018;light&#x02019;, &#x02018;mild&#x02019; and &#x02018;low tar&#x02019; as cigarettes labelled with these terms are falsely perceived as being less harmful to health, and easier to give up.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Replacement terms such as &#x02018;gold&#x02019;, &#x02018;silver&#x02019; and &#x02018;smooth&#x02019; were still perceived as less harmful than regular varieties, suggesting that removal of both colours and descriptor terms may be more effective than the removal of either alone in reducing false beliefs about tobacco risk.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Health warning labels (HWLs) that use pictures, supportive text and take up larger portions of the pack space have been shown to increase the effectiveness of the warnings in communicating risk and promoting cessation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Specifically, in a cross-sectional survey in the USA, Bansal-Travers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> found that participants selected larger, pictorial and loss-framed HWLs as the most effective in communicating health risks.</p><p>Evidence from plain packaging simulation studies shows that progressively plainer cigarette packaging, incorporating larger HWLs and fewer branding elements, was perceived as less attractive,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reduced false beliefs about tobacco risk<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and was associated with cessation intentions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Wakefield and colleagues have conducted a number of online simulation experiments, exposing participants to pack conditions which vary by brand, degree of plain packaging<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and HWL size.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The studies found that packs with progressively fewer branding elements were perceived as less appealing overall,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> larger HWLs combined with plain packs reduced adolescents&#x02019; positive ratings of packs,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and presentation of plain packs compared with branded packs increased participant intentions of not purchasing a pack.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, none of these studies examined differences in effects by socioeconomic status (SES). Additionally, best&#x02013;worst<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and experimental auction<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> studies have found plain packs featuring large graphic HWLs were the most effective pack type in reducing demand and promoting cessation among adult smokers.</p><p>The Australian Government's <italic>Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011</italic> legislated mandatory plain and standardised packaging on cigarettes sold in Australia, which include dark colour, pictorial and supportive text HWLs that cover at least 75% front-of-pack and 90% back-of-pack, have all logos and branding removed and use only specified font styles and sizes.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The policy also limits pack and stick dimensions. The legislation was introduced to reduce product appeal, increase the effectiveness of health warnings and reduce misperceptions about the harms of smoking. The first study to examine effects of plain packaging during the roll-out phase using a computer-assisted telephone survey found that compared with smokers smoking from branded packs, smokers with plain packs were more likely to perceive their tobacco as being lower in quality and satisfaction, to think about and prioritise quitting and to support the plain packaging policy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, this study had a low representation of disadvantaged smokers, did not examine effects by SES and did not control for novelty of HWL content. While there is evidence of reduced appeal for plain packaging compared with branded packaging of tobacco products within the general population, it is important to investigate whether similar effects are likely to occur for groups experiencing social and financial hardship. The aim of this study was to examine brand appeal and purchase intentions associated with branded cigarette packs compared with the new design, Australian plain packs, among a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A two-by-two packaging type (branded vs plain) by brand name (Winfield vs Benson &#x00026; Hedges (B&#x00026;H)) factorial experimental design was used, thereby randomly exposing participants to one of a possible four cigarette pack conditions. Each participant completed a uniform series of pack ratings within the experimental condition they were assigned. Data were collected using a touchscreen computer between March and December 2012.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and sample</title><p>As the target population for the study was smokers with high social disadvantage, the sample was drawn from a service outlet of a large, national non-government, social and community service organisation (SCSO). The service provides &#x02018;emergency relief&#x02019; welfare such as food vouchers, grocery items and financial aid to individuals experiencing various forms of social and financial hardship in a large catchment area of Western Sydney, New South Wales.

SCSO staff explained that a touchscreen computer survey about smoking was being conducted, and if clients were interested, they were led to a private room where a research assistant (RA) provided further detailed information. The RA provided assistance to complete the survey if required. As the survey was anonymous, survey completion was taken as implied consent. Participants were reimbursed for their time with an $A20 grocery voucher.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Smoking status</title><p>Smoking status was assessed by asking &#x02018;Do you currently smoke tobacco products?&#x02019; with response options (1) &#x02018;yes, daily&#x02019;, (2) &#x02018;yes, at least once a week&#x02019;, (3) &#x02018;yes, but less often than once a week&#x02019; and (iv) &#x02018;No, not at all&#x02019;, followed by asking &#x02018;Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes or a similar amount of tobacco in your life&#x02019; (yes/no/not sure). Those who reported to smoke daily, or who reported to smoke occasionally as well as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life were classified as current smokers. Once smoking status was assessed, non-smokers exited from the survey.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Presentation of experimental conditions</title><p>The study was conducted on a Dell Latitude XT3 (2.50&#x02005;GHz processor) touchscreen computer, using Digivey V.4 software.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Participants were randomly allocated to one of the four cigarette pack conditions by Digivey's randomise function, which uses a pseudo random number generator provided by the underlying programming language (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random(v=vs.90).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random(v=vs.90).aspx</ext-link>). Branded pack conditions replicated cigarette packs available for purchase at the time of survey; plain pack conditions tested the new plain packaging design, combining plain packaging stripped of branding elements with larger HWLs. The four pack conditions were: (1) branded Winfield Blue 25; (2) plain Winfield Blue 25; (3) branded B&#x00026;H Smooth 25 and (4) plain B&#x00026;H Smooth 25 (see figure 1). Within each pack condition, respondents were presented with a standard set of items to rate their assigned pack. All pack conditions featured the same graphic image and text HWL: &#x02018;smoking causes peripheral vascular disease&#x02019; that first appeared on Australian cigarette packs in 2006. The brands used were two of the most popular brand variants in the Australian mainstream (Winfield (Blue 25)) and premium (B&#x00026;H (Smooth 25)) cigarette markets.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Plain pack digital images were created using specifications outlined in the Australian Government's <italic>Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011</italic>, while images of branded packs were supplied by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Victoria, Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Brand appeal</title><p>While viewing the assigned pack image, respondents were asked to rate packs on various pack, smoker and taste characteristic statements (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013004078TB1">table 1</xref>).

Exploratory data analysis indicated that there may be a potential pack type by brand name interaction, that is, the relationship between packaging types (branded vs plain packaging) differed for the two different cigarette brand names. As the study had limited statistical power to assess interaction effects, we did not formally test this, but undertook analysis considering the four pack conditions separately, rather than as a factorial design. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used as a global assessment of differences in factor scores among the four pack conditions. If the p value for this test was &#x0003c;0.1, pairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank sum test were undertaken to compare median scores between branded packaging and plain packaging for each of the two brand names.

Branded packaging was viewed as more appealing, smokers of these packs were rated in a more positive way and the cigarette taste was preferred compared to cigarettes in plain packaging. No differences between branded and plain packaging relating to negative smoker or negative harm characteristics were detected. Finally, plain packaging reduced cigarette purchase intentions in comparison with branded packaging among smokers. The overall results of this study are supportive of previous plain packaging simulation research conducted with general population samples, suggesting that plain packs are viewed less favourably on measures of brand appeal than branded packs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>One notable finding of this research, demonstrating the importance of branding in the tobacco market, was a possible interaction effect between packaging type (branded vs plain) and brand name (Winfield vs B&#x00026;H). Plain pack images were rated consistently lower than branded images on measures of positive pack, positive smoker and positive taste appeal for the Winfield condition, but no differences were detected for the B&#x00026;H condition. It might be expected that plain packaging of B&#x00026;H cigarettes is unlikely to have much effect among socially disadvantaged smokers as this brand is positioned as a premium product at a high price point,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> with apparent low penetration among this smoker group: only 1.6% of participants reported regularly using B&#x00026;H cigarettes compared with 9% in the general population.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Comparatively, engagement with the &#x02018;mainstream&#x02019;, value-for-money Winfield brand is much higher among socially disadvantaged smokers: participants reported regularly using this brand at the same rate as the general population (19%).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Plain packaging has the potential to show stronger effects for brands that are personally relevant to the individual smoker.</p><p>Similarly to Wakefield <italic>et al</italic>'s previous simulation studies, this study found no difference between plain and branded cigarette packaging on negative harm ratings. This may indicate that the removal of branding elements such as colours, logos and fonts on packs is more effective in reducing brand appeal associations rather than tapping into negative harm perceptions. It is also likely that the measures used in this study, intended to assess brand appeal, were not adequate to assess negative harm perceptions related to packaging. It may also be the case that effects on perceived harm are stronger among youth than among adults, as previous simulation studies indicate plain packaging reduces false beliefs about smoking among adolescents<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and increases cessation intentions among young adults.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our study also found that the presentation of plain packaging, compared with branded packaging, reduced purchase intentions among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, consistent with previous simulations conducted with general population smokers.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Implications</title><p>The results of this study support the move towards plain packaging policies for cigarettes. Most research used in the development of plain packaging policies was conducted with general population samples, with limited data to indicate how socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, who have among the highest smoking rates, may respond to this tobacco control policy. The current study indicates that socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers are likely to respond similarly to the general population, with plain packaging reducing brand appeal ratings and purchase intentions among these smokers. Further research, particularly in low-income countries, could provide insight about the possibility of disseminating this policy internationally.</p><p>Early research in Australia indicates plain packaging makes tobacco less appealing and increases the urgency to quit smoking<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; however, it will be important to monitor impact over time. Plain packaging policies have the potential to reduce smoking initiation. Associations with brand identity and appeal are motivating factors in smoking uptake among youth.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> There are documented cases of cigarette rebranding, for example, the development of the Camel &#x02018;smooth character&#x02019;, to appeal to young adult smokers with the explicit intentions of increasing market share and prevalence of smoking among youth.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Plain packaging policies prevent this kind of brand targeting and have the potential to reduce uptake among youth by reducing brand appeal and purchase intentions. It will also be important to assess the use of any avoidance strategies, such as pack stickers and cigarette cases and to monitor whether these are temporary solutions, or whether ongoing changes to policy are required.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The primary limitation of the study is its reliance on a convenience sample limiting its external validity and generalisability. However, socially disadvantaged groups are notoriously difficult to recruit and retain in health research.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Recruitment challenges were overcome by accessing community services as recruitment sites and using convenience samples. As a result, this study is the first to obtain a large sample of socially disadvantaged smokers&#x02019; responses to a simulation of a one-off exposure to an important tobacco control policy development. Since the policy has been implemented, socially disadvantaged smokers&#x02019; day-to-day experience is one of being exposed to these plain packs multiple times a day, and so the findings from this study may underestimate the real-world effects of this change. This study was also limited by the measurement of purchase intentions rather than actual behaviour, the use of only two cigarette brands for comparison. Use of a wider range of brands for comparison is recommended for research in countries considering implementing plain packaging. Although the study employed a computer image instead of actual packs, previous packaging research demonstrates that results are generally consistent regardless of stimulus presentation modality.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The outcome measures used in this study pose an additional limitation. Although they were selected for the purpose of comparing results with previous plain pack research,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> they have not been evaluated for validity or reliability and this should be assessed in the future.</p><p>As this study tested the Australian Government's new plain pack design, which combines plain packaging with larger HWLs, we were unable to distinguish which factor (plain packaging or larger HWLs) produced the observed results. Previously, Wakefield <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> examined the importance of branding versus HWL size on cigarette packaging, concluding that plain packaging reduced elements of brand appeal far more than increasing the size of HWLs. In their study, when packs were plain, increasing the size of HWLs above 30% did not reduce brand appeal further. This finding suggests that the effects observed in the current study are more likely due to stripping the pack of branding elements, than increasing the HWL size. Finally, the last 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months of survey occurred during the policy roll-out phase and participants may have already been exposed to and purchased plain packs. Prior exposure may have allowed participants to become familiar with the new pack designs, and may explain why participants did not rate packs differently on negative harm and smoker measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study support plain packaging policy, and show this strategy has the potential to reduce positive associations with cigarette packs among a group of highly socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. It will be important to monitor the long-term outcomes of plain packaging policy, particularly with regard to uptake of smoking in disadvantaged groups. Further plain pack research in low-income countries is recommended, to support the potential dissemination of the policy internationally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e183" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004078.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e184" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004078.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Social and Community Service Organisation and its clients involved in this research, as well as Melinda Hickey, Jessica Masey and Jodie Schroder for their roles in recruiting clients into the project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AG led data collection, analysis and manuscript write-up.
