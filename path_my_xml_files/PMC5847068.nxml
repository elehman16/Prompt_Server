Disrupting reconsolidation of these memories has been proposed as a treatment strategy in SUD (Taylor and Torregrossa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>; Torregrossa and Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>). When retrieved, consolidated memories enter an instable state, after which they are reconsolidated back into a stable long-term memory. By disrupting this reconsolidation process (Nader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>; Torregrossa and Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>), it is hypothesized that substance-related memories become weaker and therefore have a less profound effect on addictive behavior, reducing substance-seeking and taking behavior(Milton and Everitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Memory reconsolidation is a process that involves a sequence of molecular changes, including NDMA receptors, (nor)adrenergic signaling, glucocorticoid receptors, GABA, and several intracellular signaling molecules (Tronson and Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2013</xref>; Taylor and Torregrossa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>). Most preclinical studies used pharmacological agents to disrupt reconsolidation of addiction-related memories, including the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. When administered following memory reactivation, propranolol reduces drug-seeking behavior in animals (Bernardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Milton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>), whereas in humans, it impairs reconsolidation of drug-related words (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2011</xref>) and it reduces craving in substance-dependent patients (Saladin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>; Lonergan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">While several pharmacological agents have proven to be highly effective in animals, the translation of these effects to humans is problematic due to a variety of reasons. For example, these pharmacological agents may not disrupt all of the Pavlovian representations influencing instrumental substance-seeking behavior (Milton and Everitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>). Moreover, many pharmacological agents that block memory reconsolidation are highly toxic and unsuitable for human use (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015a</xref>; Beckers and Kindt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). Most importantly, a precise timing between the administration of a pharmacological agent and memory retrieval is crucial for a successful blockage of memory reconsolidation (Barbara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>; Elsey and Kindt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>). Therefore, behavioral interventions targeting reconsolidation of substance-related memories may be better suited for the treatment of SUD, because behavioral interventions are not hampered with these limitations associated with pharmacological blockage of reconsolidation.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of a novel memory retrieval (MR)-working memory (WM) protocol to disrupt the reconsolidation of substance-related memories. In most clinical studies, WM training is used as an adjunctive intervention for the treatment of SUD aimed at increasing executive functioning (Bickel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). These interventions have small to moderate effects on reducing substance use (Houben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Rass et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>; Verdejo-Garcia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>) and impulsive behavior in stimulant drug dependence(Bickel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). In addition, several studies have demonstrated that a high WM load during retrieval of substance-related memories reduces craving for cigarettes (May et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>) and food (Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemps and Tiggemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; McClelland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>; Steel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>). A possible explanation for these effects is that a high WM load following memory retrieval interferes with the reconsolidation of those memories as it has recently been demonstrated that a WM task after the retrieval of trauma-related memories (thus during memory reconsolidation) reduces intrusion of these memories (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>). This effect has been attributed to competition between WM resources that are both needed for successful WM performance as well as memory (re)consolidation, including, but not limited to, overlapping regions in the medial prefrontal cortex (Bechara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>; Laroche et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2000</xref>; Barsegyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Sierra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2017</xref>). However, it remains to be investigated whether a WM task also interferes with reconsolidation of addiction-related memories.</p><p id="Par6">In the current study, 57 non-treatment seeking problem drinkers were included and randomized to a MR-WM condition or a WM-MR condition. All participants underwent three intervention sessions, preceded by a baseline assessment session and a post-intervention assessment session. In the MR-WM condition, a 30-min WM training took place following a short memory retrieval session, whereas in the WM-MR condition, WM training took place before the memory retrieval session. It was hypothesized that a high WM load following memory retrieval (that is, within the reconsolidation time-window) would disrupt the reconsolidation of these memories, whereas a high WM load preceding memory retrieval (that is, outside the reconsolidation time-window) would not disrupt the reconsolidation of these memories.</p><p id="Par7">Since modulation of reconsolidation is expected to alter alcohol-related memories, the primary outcome measures were conditioned responses (e.g., craving and physiological reactivity) during memory retrieval on the day before and the day after the 3-day intervention. It was expected that participants in the MR-WM condition would show greater reductions in retrieval-induced craving and physiological reactivity, and a greater reduction in alcohol intake and craving at follow-up, compared to participants in the WM-MR condition. In addition, participants in the MR-WM conditions, compared to participants in the WM-MR condition, were expected to show greater reductions in desire for alcohol and alcohol intake at 1-week follow-up and 1-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par8">Fifty-seven heavy drinkers (27 females) were included in the study. Participants were recruited through internet and poster advertisement in the local community of Amsterdam and the Psychology faculty of the University of Amsterdam. After providing informed consent, participants received an online screening questionnaire, to assess age, alcoholic beverage of preference, and drug use in the last 12&#x000a0;months. Participants were asked to indicate whether they wanted to stop drinking, whether they wanted to reduce their drinking, or whether they did <italic>not</italic> want to change their drinking. In addition, alcohol use severity was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1993</xref>). Participants who indicated to have used a certain drug more than 40 times in the past 12&#x000a0;months were asked to fill-out the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT; Berman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>) to assess drug use severity. Inclusion criteria were an age between 18 and 40, a total AUDIT score of 12 or higher, and a preference for beer or wine. Participants were excluded if they had a DUDIT score of 12 or higher or when they were not motivated to change their drinking. Participants received a monetary compensation or research participation credits upon completion of the study. The study was approved by the psychology ethics committee of the University of Amsterdam.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par9">Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition, stratified by gender, age (18&#x02013;29 or 29&#x02013;40), and AUDIT scores (12&#x02013;19, 20&#x02013;26, 27&#x02013;33, 34&#x02013;40) and scheduled for five consecutive sessions.

In session 1 and session 5, pre- and post-intervention measures of retrieval-induced desire for alcohol and changes in skin conductance levels (SCL) and heart rate were taken as described below. In sessions 2, 3, and 4, the MR-WM training or WM-MR training was performed (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants were instructed not to consume any alcohol during the 5&#x000a0;days of the experiment. Compliance to this instruction was assessed using the Timeline Followback (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1992</xref>) at session 5 and a breathalyzer test for alcohol at the start of each session. Participants with a positive breathalyzer test or participants that indicated to have drank something after one of the intervention days were excluded from analyses.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The experimental design.

The Desire for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ; Love et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1998</xref>) was used to assess craving on three subscales: craving related to the desire for alcohol, craving related to the negative reinforcement of alcohol, and craving related to the loss of control over drinking. The stage of motivation to change drinking patterns (e.g., pre-contemplation, contemplation, or action stage) was assessed using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ; Heather et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1991</xref>). After filling out the questionnaires, all participants underwent a 30-min MRI scan and an approach-avoidance task, of which the results will be presented elsewhere.</p><p id="Par12">For the WM task and memory retrieval session, participants were taken into a sound-attenuated room.

At 1 and 4&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up, participants received an online questionnaire to DAQ, alcohol intake in last 7&#x000a0;days (TLFB), and drug use in the last 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Memory retrieval protocol</title><p id="Par16">The computer-assisted alcohol memory retrieval paradigm was modified from a protocol by Hammarberg et al.

The retrieval session started with the baseline assessment of craving using the DAQ, followed by a short relaxation exercise. Next, the memory retrieval started with the presentation of four alcohol-related pictures that were all shown for 30&#x000a0;s. Subsequently, participants were instructed to read out loud two personalized scenarios of alcohol-related situations. These 30-s scenarios were based on information provided by the participants prior to the start of the experiment and described a pleasant alcohol-related memory and a memory of a situation that induced strong feelings of craving. Thereafter, the in vivo exposure phase started in which participants were instructed to open a box that was in front of them, to take out the alcohol, to poor the alcohol into a glass, and to smell the alcohol three times. Participants had 30&#x000a0;s to perform each instruction. At the end of the memory retrieval sessions, craving was assessed again using the DAQ. More details of the task are described in the supplementary methods.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The memory retrieval session was fully computer-assisted and consisted of the baseline assessment of craving, the presentation of four alcohol pictures, the reading of two personalized scenarios of alcohol-related memories, and the handing of alcohol (holding, pouring, smelling).

In short, participants performed a total of 76 trials that took approximately 30&#x000a0;min. Task difficulty was individually adapted so that all participants successfully completed the task that was rewarded with &#x020ac;10. The complex chessboard task assesses the ability to both maintain (remember) and manipulate a sequence of blue and green squares that light up in a random order and have to be repeated in a specific order (first the green squares, then the blue squares). WM load in this task is measured by the maximum length of the chessboard sequence that is successfully remembered and manipulated.

Chi-square tests were used to test whether the experimental groups significantly differed in the readiness to change stage and drug use (cocaine, amphetamine, speed, heroine, XTC, LSD, ketamine, cannabis) in the past 12&#x000a0;months that was measured on an ordinal scale (no drug use, 1&#x02013;2 times, 3&#x02013;5 times, 6&#x02013;10 times, 11&#x02013;20 times, 21&#x02013;40 times, or more than 40 times).</p><p id="Par21">To test for the effect of intervention condition on retrieval-induced craving, repeated measures analyses were performed on the total DAQ scores with condition as between group factor and session (session 1 versus session 5) and retrieval phase (pre- or post-retrieval) as within group repeated measures factor. Only significant results on total DAQ scores were followed-up by three separate repeated measurements ANOVAs on the three different subscales to assess whether differences in craving were specifically related to craving for alcohol-related to desire, craving for alcohol-related to negative reinforcement, or craving for alcohol-related to loss of control.</p><p id="Par22">Mean SCL and heart rate were calculated for each retrieval phase (craving before retrieval, relaxation, exposure to alcohol pictures, alcohol memory imagery, alcohol handing, and craving after retrieval). The effect of intervention condition on SCL and heart rate was tested using a repeated measures ANOVA with intervention condition as between group factor, with session (session 1 and session 5) and the six retrieval phases as within group repeated measures factor. Planned polynomial contrast was used to assess the curve characteristics.</p><p id="Par23">The same analyses were done for the data (retrieval-induced desire for alcohol, SCL, and heart rate) acquired during the intervention sessions, with sessions 2, 3, and 4 (instead of session 1 and 5) as repeated measures factor.</p><p id="Par24">To test for the long-term effects of the intervention on overall craving and alcohol consumption, repeated measures analyses were performed on the total DAQ scores (and in case of a significant effect also on the three subscales of the DAQ) and weekly alcohol intake with intervention condition as between group factor and time (baseline, 1-week follow-up, and 1-month follow-up) as within group repeated measures factor. Simple planned comparisons were used to test for changes compared to baseline.</p><p id="Par25">In order to analyze WM capacity, the first 12 trials (nine chessboard trials and three rectangle trials) were excluded from analyses because participants typically need a certain number of trials to reach an optimal difficulty level (Dovis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>). The remaining 64 were divided into four blocks of 12 chessboard trials and 4 rectangle trials. For these four blocks, the mean length of the chessboard sequence was calculated, as well as the number of errors in the chessboard trials and rectangle trials.

It was hypothesized that a high WM load following alcohol-related memory retrieval would disrupt the reconsolidation of those memories, leading to reductions in retrieval-induced subjective craving and physiological reactivity as well as reductions in craving and alcohol intake 4&#x000a0;weeks later. However, we did not find any experimental support for this. In contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, we did find that a high WM load <italic>prior</italic> to memory retrieval (the original control condition) significantly reduced retrieval-induced desire for alcohol, as well as alcohol craving related to negative reinforcement and behavioral control at 1-month follow-up. However, we did not observe a significant reduction in alcohol intake. Also, retrieval-induced SCL were most strongly modified in the MR-WM condition. During the intervention sessions, we observed that a high WM load prior to memory retrieval led to a smaller increase in SCL during retrieval, which could be related to less emotional arousal induced by memory retrieval.</p><p id="Par50">The findings of the current study do not support our original hypothesis that a high WM load interferes with the reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories. While the WM task took place immediately after memory retrieval and within the reconsolidation window, it is difficult to assess on a behavioral level whether reconsolidation actually took place (Hutton-Bedbrook and McNally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>). Previous studies suggest that the critical condition for inducing memory reconsolidation, instead of memory extinction, is a prediction error (e.g., a mismatch between what is expected based on previous experiences and the actual state of events) (Sevenster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>). It has previously been demonstrated that an instruction &#x0201c;not to drink&#x0201d; after participants have been instructed to prepare a drink successfully induces a prediction error in hazardous drinkers (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015b</xref>). Similarly, we aimed to induce a prediction error by instructing the participants to drink the alcohol in session one, while they did not receive this instruction during the following three intervention sessions. In fear learning, it has, however, been found that <italic>too much</italic> new learning due to multiple prediction errors actually no longer triggers memory reconsolidation (Sevenster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>). Moreover, it could be argued that in our current design, participants in sessions 3 and 4 were already aware of the fact that they would not receive an instruction to drink alcohol, which would have diminished the prediction error. Hence, reconsolidation may have taken place only in the second session, while in the remaining intervention sessions, a process of extinction was induced. As we observed a significant reduction in (retrieval-induced) craving in the WM-MR condition only, this could imply that a high WM load prior to memory retrieval enhances extinction learning.</p><p id="Par51">Indeed, recent findings suggest that enhanced extinction learning may be more resistant to various forms of drug reinstatement compared to normal extinction (Janak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>; Kearns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Millan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>). In these studies, enhanced extinction learning was achieved by either noradrenergic modulation (Janak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>) or through the presentation of already extinguished cues during extinction learning (Rescorla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>; Kearns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). Therefore, a high WM load <italic>prior</italic> to memory retrieval may have indeed induced enhanced extinction, resulting in reduced (retrieval-induced) craving for alcohol that lasts up to 4&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention. The retrieval-induced changes in SCL during the three intervention sessions provide further evidence for this as retrieval-induced SCL in the WM-MR condition was significantly smaller compared to the MR-WM condition. Furthermore, while SCL in the WM-MR condition returned to baseline levels near the end of the retrieval sessions, they remained high in the MR-WM condition. Although enhanced extinction was not observed in self-reported desire for alcohol, the SLC data could be indicative of enhanced extinction of the conditioned responses in the WM-MR condition but not in the MR-WM condition.</p><p id="Par52">Alternatively, the current findings could be explained by the WM theory proposed by Andrade et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>) stating that WM capacity is required to recall memories. As a consequence, if other resources of WM are utilized during memory reactivation, the vividness and emotionality of these memories are reduced, which will result in these memories to be updated into a less emotional form (Nader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>; Schwabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>; Littel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>). Indeed, it has been observed that a high (visual spatial) WM load during the retrieval of substance-related memories reduces craving for cigarettes (May et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>) and food (McClelland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>; Steel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>; Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemps and Tiggemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). In a clinical equivalent of these studies, an Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) procedure has been used, showing immediate reductions in cigarette cravings (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>). Similar effects of EMDR have been found on food cravings (Littel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>). While a reduction in craving in these studies is often interpreted to be a results of impaired memory reconsolidation (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>), it has been suggested that a high WM load only effectively reduces craving when it <italic>prevents</italic> the activation of the (craving-inducing) memories (Van Dillen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). In other words, a high WM load should be induced prior to memory retrieval, as was the case in the WM-MR condition, instead of after memory reactivation, as was the case in the MR-WM condition, in order to reduce the emotionality of the memories.</p><p id="Par53">It should be noted though that in the current study, the WM task took place <italic>prior</italic> to memory retrieval and not <italic>during</italic> memory retrieval. Therefore, the WM task could only have competed with memory retrieval, and thus emotionality of the retrieved memories, if the high WM load lasted throughout the memory retrieval session. However, there is currently no empirical evidence for such a lasting effect of a WM task on brain activity in regions involved in memory retrieval, including the prefrontal cortex. Hence, the conclusion that a high WM load prior to memory retrieval reduces the emotionality of the retrieved memories should be taken with caution. Nonetheless, we did observe smaller SCL responses during memory retrieval in participants who performed a WM task <italic>prior</italic> to alcohol-related memory retrieval, compared to participants who performed a WM task immediately <italic>after</italic> memory retrieval. An increase in SCL has previously been reported in response to addiction-related cues in smokers (Field and Duka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>; Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Cortese and Uhde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>), patients with an eating disorder (Gorini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>), cannabis users (Norberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>), and opiate addicts (de Quiros Aragon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>) and is generally seen as an index of objective measure of emotional arousal (Connelly and Denney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>; Lang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1993</xref>). These findings therefore support the hypothesis that a high WM load <italic>prior</italic> alcohol-related memory retrieval reduces the emotionality of the memories. Importantly, it has been suggested that a high WM during memory retrieval results in a blurred version of the original memory to be reconsolidated (van den Hout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>), which explains the (long-lasting) reduction in self-reported craving of participants in the WM-MR condition.</p><p id="Par54">Changes in self-reported craving, SCL, and heart rate during the assessment sessions were somewhat counterintuitive. That is, retrieval-induced SCL during sessions 1 and 5 was only significantly changed in the MR-WM condition, while significant reductions in craving are only observed in the WM-MR condition. However, conditions already differed in retrieval-induced SCL at baseline, making the interpretation of this interaction effect difficult. Moreover, there was no intervention effect on retrieval-induced changes in heart rate, and heart rate was increased as decreased during different phases of retrieval. Previous studies also failed to report effects of memory retrieval (cue-exposure) on heart rate in smokers (Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Cortese and Uhde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>). Therefore, heart rate may not be the most sensitive measure of cue-reactivity.</p><p id="Par55">This study has several limitations. First of all, to rule out all possible alternative explanations for our results, additional control groups are needed. For example, whereas we expected that a high WM load during memory reconsolidation would impair the reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories, a high WM load could also have strengthened the reconsolidation of alcohol memories, preventing a spontaneous reduction in craving as it could have occurred over time. Indeed, such unexpected timing effects have previously been demonstrated using pharmacological reconsolidation blockers (Torregrossa and Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>). Furthermore, if reconsolidation actually took place, the internal state (arousal induced by the WM-task) could have been incorporated into the labialized memory trace (context-dependent memory) such that it is only accessible in such a state. These effects have previously been demonstrated with pharmacological manipulations (Gisquet-Verrier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). Moreover, based on the current study design, we cannot exclude the possibility that simply doing a task prior to memory retrieval, instead of specifically taxing the WM, affects cue-induced craving. Hence, future studies should be conducted to exclude these alternative explanations, such as include an MR-only condition, a WM-only condition, a non-WM related task + MR condition, and/or a WM task prior to testing, to exclude these possibilities. Secondly, as non-treatment seeking problem drinkers were included, it should be investigated how the current findings translate to a clinical population. In addition, the WM-MR condition reported slightly higher use of cannabis and MDMA. However, there were no baseline differences on other, more relevant, measures, such as alcohol intake, alcohol use severity, retrieval-induced craving, or WM capacity. Moreover, there is no reason to assume that a WM-MR intervention aimed at reducing alcohol craving and consumption is more effective in cannabis/NDMA users. Therefore, these baseline differences are unlikely to have biased our findings.</p><p id="Par56">To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the potential of a behavioral intervention at disrupting the reconsolidation of addiction-related memories. Whereas WM interference on drug exposure has been investigated before, these studies used dual WM-exposure tasks, making the interpretation of the findings difficult (Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemps and Tiggemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; May et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>; McClelland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>; Steel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>). That is, in these studies, reductions in craving could have been the result of impaired memory activation or the disruption of the memory reconsolidation process (Nader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>; Schwabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>; Littel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>). In the current study, however, participants performed a WM task prior or immediately following the memory retrieval session, demonstrating that reductions in craving due to WM-MR interference are likely to be due to impaired memory activation rather than the disruption of memory reconsolidation, although reconsolidation could also have been affected in this latter condition (van den Hout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to most previous studies, we included three (instead of one) intervention sessions, as well as follow-up measures of craving and alcohol intake which provide a more complete view on the long-term effects of WM-MR interventions. Another strength is that both males and females were included in the study and that these results are therefore easily translatable to both genders.</p><p id="Par57">In summary, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a WM load to interfere with the reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories. In contrast to our expectations, a WM task following memory retrieval did not interfere with the reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories. We did find that a high WM load <italic>prior</italic> to memory retrieval significantly reduces (retrieval-induced) craving for alcohol that lasted up to 4&#x000a0;weeks during follow-up. These reductions are likely to be due to WM competition during memory activation, reducing the vividness and emotionality of the memories by which they are updated to a less emotional form (Nader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>; Schwabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>; Littel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether WM-induced changes in the prefrontal cortex last indeed long enough to interfere with the retrieval of alcohol-related memories 15&#x000a0;min later and which exact mechanism (extinction, reconsolidation, other?) underlies the change in the original maladaptive memories. Therefore, future studies are needed to better understand the neural mechanisms behind the effectiveness of the WM-MR intervention, as it may have potential to become an effective (adjunctive) intervention in the treatment of SUD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
