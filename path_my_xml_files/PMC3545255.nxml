In order to compare the effects of upstream versus downstream administration of Tirofiban in Chinese patients with mid to high risk, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) referred for PCI, a multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study will be conducted. A total of 500 mid to high risk, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) ACS patients will be recruited for this study. Patients will be randomized to Tirofiban upstream administration group (initiated 12 h before PCI) and Tirofiban downstream administration group (initiated at cath-lab after angiography). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grades, TIMI myocardial perfusion grades (TMPG), and Corrected TIMI frame counting (CTFC) before and after PCI, as well as clinical outcomes during the hospital stay, and within 30 days after PCI will be compared between the two groups. This study will provide evidence on the optimal timing for initiating administration of Tirofiban in mid to high NSTEMI ACS subjects undergoing PCI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute coronary syndrome</kwd><kwd>Percutaneous coronary intervention</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor</kwd><kwd>Tirofiban</kwd><kwd>Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The efficacy of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) inhibitors in high risk, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients has been well established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">[1]</xref> According to the updated American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guideline, it is recommended in high risk patients undergoing invasive strategy that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be chosen as the second antiplatelet therapy (Ia).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">[2]</xref> However, whether up stream use of GP IIb/IIIa could be better than provisional use in the cath lab remained to be answered.

However, these modest benefits were associated with an increased risk of bleeding. As the meta-analysis data were from studies on different brands of GPI, including Tirofiban, Etifibatide, Lamifiban, and Abciximab, it is still of interest to know whether a specific GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor would have a specific effect, especially in a Chinese population.</p><p>Consequently, we decide to perform a randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare early (prior to Transfer to the catheterization laboratory) <italic>vs</italic>. late (at the time of PCI) initiation of intravenous Tirofiban (which is the only GPI available in China) in NSTEMI ACS patients undergoing PCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Rationale and strategy of ETN-STEP (Early administration of Tirofiban in mid to high risk patients with non-ST elevation, acute coronary syndrome referred for percutaneous coronary intervention)</title><p>Our primary aim will be to compare, in NSTE ACS patients, the efficacy of initiating Tirofiban 12 h before PCI (10 &#x000b5;g/kg bolus, followed by continuous infusion at 0.15 &#x000b5;g/kg per min for 12&#x02013;24 h after PCI) <italic>vs</italic>. initiating Tirofiban at the time of PCI (10 &#x000b5;g/kg bolus, followed by continuous infusion at 0.15 &#x000b5;g/kg per min for 12&#x02013;24 h after PCI).

There are several unique features of this study. Firstly, we believe that it is more meaningful to address the time issue of GP IIb/IIIa administration in high ACS patients. Therefore, when screen the study subjects, we will use the TIMI risk score system to define the mid to high risk ACS patients. Although such a risk evaluating system may not be an optimal model in predicting the outcomes of ACS patients, it is easy to calculate, and furthermore, the results of the study may be more valuable in clinical practice by using such criteria. Secondly, the dose of Tirofiban used in this study may be different from that normally recommended, however, it is currently the dose we are routinely administering in the clinic.</p><p>In all, the findings of the ETN-STEP study will provide insight into the optimal timing for Tirofiban initiation in mid to high risk ACS Chinese patients undergoing PCI.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
