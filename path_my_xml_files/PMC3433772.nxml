However, one of the main factors hindering the achievement of this therapeutic goal is the variability of individual responses to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which has been attributed to patient-related factors, such as iron deficiency, malnutrition and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C4">4</xref>], hyperparathyroidism and the accumulation of uraemic toxins inhibiting erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C6">6</xref>], as well as to factors relating to HD technique, such as dialysis adequacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C7">7</xref>] and the microbiological purity of dialysis fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C11">11</xref>].</p><p>In terms of dialysis technique, convective treatments (CTs) are purportedly more effective in correcting anaemia than standard HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C12">12</xref>] because they may allow better removal of substances with molecular weights of 5&#x02013;50 kDa: i.e. within the range that typically includes erythropoiesis inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C13">13</xref>]. However, studies of the effects of CTs on ESA resistance have produced conflicting results: the findings of observational and non-randomized studies suggest that CTs have a more beneficial effect on erythropoiesis than other treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C16">16</xref>], whereas two small randomized trials involving a total of 88 patients failed to confirm this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C18">18</xref>]. Moreover, no data are available concerning the effect of online pre-dilution haemofiltration (HF), a technique that may theoretically have a better impact than other types of extracorporeal treatment. Discrepancies between observational and experimental studies may be due to known and unknown confounding factors, such as water and dialysate quality and the related cytokine production, inflammation, infection, iron deficiency, the biocompatibility of dialysis membranes, dialyser flux and the adequacy of dialysis in terms of small and medium molecular weight toxins, all of which are notoriously difficult to control in observational settings.</p><p>Within the framework of the CONVESTUDY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C19">19</xref>], a randomized trial comparing standard low-flux HD with two convective techniques [online pre-dilution HF and online pre-dilution haemodiafiltration (HDF)] in terms of haemodynamic stability and various clinical end points, we specifically investigated whether these techniques have a differential effect on haemoglobin (Hb) levels and sensitivity to ESAs. This paper describes the effects of these techniques on the study's haematological outcomes and the results of a secondary analysis aimed at identifying predictors of Hb levels and ESA resistance in the setting of the trial (i.e. a well-standardized context with accurate data collection and systematic external quality control).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="gfs117s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="gfs117s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a primary analysis of a pre-specified secondary outcome of a multicentre, open-label, randomized trial involving 27 Italian dialysis centres and comparing low-flux HD with online pre-dilution HF and/or online pre-dilution HDF (CONVESTUDY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C19">19</xref>].

The Hb model reached a higher adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> than the ESA model (0.35 versus 0.28) and was based on a larger number of covariates. The most relevant predictors of Hb levels were the participating centres (partial eta<sup>2</sup>: 0.313), ESA dose (partial eta<sup>2</sup>: 0.094) and a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease (partial eta<sup>2</sup>: 0.051) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="GFS117TB2">2</xref>).

Consequently, despite the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C23">23</xref>], it seems that there is still a large degree of heterogeneity among centres in treating the anaemia of HD patients and therefore considerable room for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C28">28</xref>].</p><p>As expected, one of the predictors of Hb levels was polycystic kidney disease, which was associated with higher Hb levels ( + 0.82 g/dL) than other underlying kidney diseases. However, strangely enough, this expected predictor has not been included in most previous analyses.</p><p>In our study, the relationship between Hb levels and ESA doses had a negative beta coefficient, thus confirming the finding of previous randomized trials that higher ESA doses are associated with lower Hb levels. This is an apparent paradox because higher ESA doses should increase Hb levels and the true relationship of ESA with Hb levels should be direct; however, the effect of ESA is confounded by physicians who increase the ESA dose when Hb levels are low, as well as by other confounders such as inflammation. As expected, the inflammation indices of serum CRP and ferritin levels were inversely associated with Hb levels, but the fact that per cent TS was only weakly predictive suggests that there is still a need for a simple and reliable index of iron stores. The inverse relationship between total cholesterol and Hb levels was an unexpected finding that requires confirmation by other studies.</p><p>The participating centre was also a major predictor of ESA resistance, with the highest partial eta<sup>2</sup> (0.367). We interpret this finding in the light of poor implementation of the guidelines concerning anaemia treatment in HD patients because it is difficult to believe that ESA resistance was primarily different among centres, whereas it is very likely that there were between-centre differences in the intensity of ESA and iron treatments. Strangely enough, CRP levels lost their predictive power, whereas that of beta2 microglobulin emerged, albeit at borderline significance (P = 0.065). The absence of a correlation between CRP levels and ESA resistance may be explained by the fact that the model only used the median CRP levels of the tested periods (run-in and experimental), whereas the effect of inflammation (CRP) on ESA resistance may be more complex, including peak CRP values. We therefore also tested the &#x02018;peak CRP&#x02019; hypothesis, but the results did not change. The relationship between ESA and beta2 microglobulin levels is intriguing and merits further investigation.</p><p>This study has both weaknesses and strengths. Its main weakness is that the ESA therapy was not randomly controlled, as was also the case in previous randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C18">18</xref>]. One of its strengths is that it made a primary analysis of pre-specified secondary outcome variables and so the related information was prospectively recorded, something that is not true of previous observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS117C16">16</xref>]. Another strength is the prospective 2-month run-in period before the experimental phase, as this allowed the use of a within-patient comparison of Hb levels and ESA resistance between the two periods and gave more power to the findings. We would like to underline that despite the relative small number of the groups, the power of this study, mainly dependent on the size of the population as a whole, is highly valuable as can be appreciated from the two final models showed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="GFS117TB2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="GFS117TB3">3</xref>. Moreover, the fact that our concurrent control group consisted of well-dialysed patients with a low level of inflammation who were treated with a relatively pure dialysate should be taken into account when interpreting the study finding because of the well-known difficulty of demonstrating the positive effect of any kind of experimental treatment under optimal conditions of the control group.</p><p>In conclusion, in comparison with low-flux HD, it seems that convective therapies do not significantly improve Hb levels and ESA resistance. The major sources of variability in Hb levels were the participating centres, the ESA dose and the underlying kidney disease. A centre effect was also a relevant source of the variance in ESA resistance.</p></sec><sec id="gfs117s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all of the physicians, nurses and patients of the participating centres for their support.
