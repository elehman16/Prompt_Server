The burden of multiple daily blood glucose self-testing can be lessened by novel diabetes technology like flash glucose monitoring systems which provide more information compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose. Despite this delivered additional information studies are showing no significant effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction, but a reduced time spent in a hypoglycaemic glucose range. We assume that users of these devices need additional education and training to integrate the delivered information into treatment decisions. Therefore, FLASH, an education and treatment programme, was developed. The programme evaluation follows herein.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Patients are recruited through 40 diabetes outpatient study centres located across Germany. They will be randomly assigned to participate in the education and treatment programme (intervention group) or to obtain treatment as usual (control group). All patients have to give blood samples and to answer a bench of questionnaires during baseline assessment, at the end of the intervention, and 6&#x000a0;months after the end of the intervention. Physicians will be asked to declare some additional clinical data (such as details of the diabetes therapy) for every patient at every one of the three assessment points.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study is conducted as a randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that the newly developed education and treatment programme combined with the use of a flash glucose monitoring device (intervention group) is superior to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared to the use of flash glucose monitoring alone (control group). The first results will be expected in 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03175315?term=flash&#x00026;cond=diabetes&#x00026;cntry1=EU%3ADE&#x00026;rank=1">NCT03175315</ext-link>.

Measurement of blood glucose is especially important before main meals because the prandial insulin dose will vary with blood glucose level, planned carbohydrate consumption, and other factors (e.g. exercise, alcohol consumption). The multiple daily skin pricks and the need to carry a blood glucose meter, test strips, lancets, and blood glucose log books can be very trying, and patients often get frustrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, novel technologies, such as flash glucose monitoring, can provide relief.</p><p id="Par29">Flash glucose monitoring provides continuous measurement of interstitial glucose levels via a glucose sensor placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This sensor can be left at the insertion site for 14&#x000a0;days, and the interstitial glucose level obtained whenever necessary by scanning with a reader or smartphone using near-field technology. In addition to the current glucose level, the reader or smartphone will also display arrows indicating the long-term trend in interstitial glucose level (slightly/strongly increasing, slightly/strongly decreasing, or stable) and the course of the glucose level over the last 8&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="Par30">Flash glucose monitoring has several benefits over SMBG. Multiple daily skin pricks can be avoided. Glucose levels can be painlessly measured any number of times by scanning with a reader and, moreover, the results are automatically stored for 90&#x000a0;days. Software can display glucose patterns and provide information on additional parameters, such as time spent in predefined glycaemic ranges (e.g. hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic range), median and mean glucose values, or an estimation of the current glycated haemoglobin level (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), based on the previous collected and stored interstitial glucose values.</p><p id="Par31">This new technology also has some downsides. Users need to be educated on how to integrate all the additional information (e.g. trend arrows, previous course of glucose) into treatment decisions. Problematic glucose patterns requiring treatment adjustments can be easily identified, but only if the user has the necessary knowledge and skills.</p><p id="Par32">Two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have shown that flash glucose monitoring has no significant effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub>, although it does reduce time spent in the hypoglycaemic glucose range. We hypothesise that education on how to make optimal use of flash glucose monitoring devices would improve outcomes. We therefore developed a programme, FLASH, to support these patients. We are planning a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effect of FLASH on HbA<sub>1c</sub> as well as on secondary outcomes (i.e. time spent in different glucose ranges, patient-reported outcomes, and device satisfaction). The purpose of this paper is to present the research protocol of the planned study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par33">The study is designed as a multicentre study. A total of 40 diabetes outpatient treatment centres located across Germany have been invited to recruit eligible patients for the study. A study centre is defined as a medical practice run by a diabetologist and where diabetes nurses or certificated diabetes educators (CDE) are also available. The course instructors for FLASH will be CDE. Prior to the study, the course instructors will undergo an intensive 8-h training in the study protocol and the education and treatment programme. This programme will be conducted by the research team. Course instructors will be provided with a written curriculum and audiovisual teaching material, along with detailed descriptions of each slide. Additionally, trainers from the coordination research institute (Research Institute of Diabetes Mergentheim: FIDAM) will visit each participating medical centre, and course instructors can then resolve any doubts about the conduct of the programme. In these visits FIDAM employees will confirm that the slides of the FLASH will operate and could be displayed in each medical praxis and that the course instructor knows how to conduct the programme, fully understands the content of the programme, can clarify any likely questions, and knows how to upload the therapy data from the flash glucose monitoring reader to Diasend&#x000ae;. During the course of study, all study centres will have a hotline to FIDAM for support. FIDAM will communicate with all participating study centres via newsletters where every new development can be presented promptly and reliably. Conversely, the coordinating centre will be available for the responsible personnel in the study centres for the entire duration of the study. In addition to conducting the education and treatment programme, the physicians at the study centres will be responsible for the therapy of their patients during and after the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par34">This multicentre RCT will enroll diabetic patients on intensive insulin therapy who are using flash glucose monitoring. The patients will be randomised into one of two groups: an intervention group and a control group. Both groups will receive the flash monitoring device and technical instructions on its use; the intervention group will receive, in addition, FLASH training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par35">A total of 86 patients per group will be necessary to detect a mean difference of 0.3% and a standard deviation of 0.7% in HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction between the two treatment groups (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43), with an alpha error&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2 (power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8). Given an expected non-evaluable rate of 20%, a total of 216 participants will be needed, with 108 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p id="Par36">All participating study centres will identify eligible patients interested in participating in the study. The eligible patients will be offered an appointment to get to know the facts of the study, to clarify doubts, and to give signed informed consent. Because no education programme for patients using flash glucose monitoring devices is available, medical centres and patients are showing great interest in participating in this study. However, despite the great interest it is possible that the required sample size will not be achieved. In this case there are more medical centres available which can be contacted for patient recruitment. Patient recruitment will be stopped after 216 patients are enrolled.</p><p id="Par37">Baseline assessment will take place over two visits. At the first visit, blood will be collected, baseline questionnaires will be completed, patients will be provided with the flash glucose monitoring device and receive technical instructions, and the sensor will be implanted. Blinded FIDAM staff will review all baseline assessments to confirm that the enrolled patients meet all the eligibility criteria. Then, randomisation of patients will be done centrally at FIDAM using SYSTAT version 12, with random assignment at the level of the study centre. The results will be sent to the respective study centres in sealed envelopes that will be opened only at the second baseline visit. At this second visit, 2&#x000a0;weeks after the first visit, patients will be informed of the group assignment. Glucose-level data from the reader will be uploaded via Diasend&#x000ae; (see below: &#x02018;Assessments&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par38">Patients of either sex will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they fulfil the following conditions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39">Age 16&#x02013;75 years</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">On intensified insulin therapy/insulin pump therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Previous participation in at least one structured diabetes education programme</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the range of 7.5&#x02013;14%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Reduction of HbA<sub>1c</sub> as the therapeutic goal</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Able to understand, speak, and write German</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Willing to provide informed consent (if necessary, informed consent of the parents)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Have an indication for using a flash glucose monitoring system</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par47">Indication for a flash glucose monitoring system will be decided by the treating physician.

Once included in the study, patients may still be excluded from the analysis if they decide to leave the study at any point for any reason, or if they miss any one treatment appointment or one of the three assessment points.</p><p id="Par57">The REPLACE and IMPACT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] were not able to show significant improvement in glycaemic control with flash glucose monitoring vs. SMBG. Assuming that education might be able to improve the efficacy of flash glucose monitoring, exclusion of patients with previous flash glucose monitoring system use is not necessary (since the device alone does not seem to be efficacious in improving the HbA<sub>1c</sub>). The main objective of this study is not to prove the efficacy of flash glucose monitoring systems, but rather to evaluate the efficacy of the FLASH education and treatment programme. However, if there are substantial differences between the control and intervention groups in previous flash glucose monitoring system use, adjustment will be made during the analysis for experience of using previous flash glucose monitoring systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Content, structure and intervention of FLASH</title><p id="Par58">FLASH is a structured education and treatment programme that will be delivered in a group setting, with each group comprising three to eight patients in the age range 16&#x02013;75 years. This wide age range was selected so that study centres could include as many eligible patients as possible. Previous experience has shown that it is difficult to recruit homogeneous age groups. Having patients of widely differing ages is not necessarily a disadvantage, since younger people with diabetes can learn from the experiences of older ones and vice versa. If important differences are observed between the different age groups, adjustment for these factors will be made during analysis of data.</p><p id="Par59">FLASH aims to empower patients by providing information and teaching strategies for better self-management of diabetes. FLASH participants are encouraged to be actively involved in their treatment: they formulate their own therapy-related goals, learn to recognise patterns in their glucose levels and to identify trends, and also to use this information for optimising daily therapy decisions. During FLASH, participants are also invited to share their experiences with flash glucose monitoring with other group members. The ultimate objective is to teach patients to live active and normal lives through efficient use of flash glucose monitoring.</p><p id="Par60">FLASH uses different modern educational techniques. The guiding principle is self-management, especially self-monitoring, self-assessment, and enhancing self-treatment. Participants are provided with written material and worksheets and are encouraged to test the contents of each lesson on their own and to then discuss their experiences in the group setting. They are introduced to computer-based data analysis software and learn how to use it for optimising their own therapy. Additionally, patients define what they personally hope to achieve by attending the FLASH programme. Course instructors are provided with core content about the interpretation of flash glucose monitoring results and also optional content in slides on a secondary level if more detailed information is needed on a certain topic (e.g. exercising or hypoglycaemia).</p><p id="Par61">The FLASH programme takes place over 6&#x000a0;weeks. It consists of four sessions, lasting 90&#x000a0;min each. There is a 1-week interval between sessions 1 and 2, and 2-week intervals between sessions 2 and 3 and sessions 3 and 4. These intervals give patients time to practise the newly learned techniques in their daily lives.
