However, postoperative pain control is a major problem because spinal anesthesia using only local anesthetics is associated with relatively short duration of action, and thus early analgesic intervention is needed in the postoperative period. A number of adjuvants, such as clonidine and midazolam, and others have been studied to prolong the effect of spinal anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>A common problem during lower abdominal surgeries under spinal anesthesia is visceral pain, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The addition of fentanyl to hyperbaric bupivacaine improves the quality of intraoperative and early postoperative subarachnoid block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The addition of opioids to local anesthetic solution have disadvantages, such as pruritus and respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine, a new highly selective &#x003b1;2-agonist, is under evaluation as a neuraxial adjuvant as it provides stable hemodynamic conditions, good quality of intraoperative and prolonged postoperative analgesia with minimal side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a short-term sedative for mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Based on earlier human studies, it is hypothesized that intrathecal 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine would produce more postoperative analgesic effect with hyperbaric bupivacaine in spinal anaesthesia with minimal side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Till date, there has been no study comparing the addition of dexmedetomidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine with hyperbaric fentanyl to bupivacaine, although various studies have compared dexmedetomidine and fentanyl with isobaric bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted after approval of ethical committee of the institution. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, either sex, age 18&#x02013;50 years, presenting for lower abdominal surgeries. Exclusion criteria were patient allergic to drug, heart block/dysrrhythmia, or on therapy with adrenergic receptor antagonist, calcium channel blocker, and/or ACE inhibitor.</p><p>All patients received diazepam 0.2 mg/kg orally, the night before surgery. The patients were preloaded with Lactated Ringer's solution 15 mL/kg. They were monitored with automated noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiogram. 25G Pencil point spinal needles were introduced through L3&#x02013;L4 interspaces in sitting position using aseptic precautions. Patients were randomly divided into the following groups: Group D&#x02014;to receive 2.5 mL volume of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine in 0.5 mL of normal saline intrathecal (dexmedetomidine (100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) was diluted in preservative-free normal saline) and Group F&#x02014;to receive 2.5 mL volume of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl intrathecal. Intrathecal injection was given over approximately 10&#x02013;15 s. Immediately after completion of the injection patients were made to lie supine.</p><p>Oxygen (2 L/min) was administered via a mask if the pulse oximeter reading decreased below 90%. Hypotension, defined as a decrease of systolic blood pressure by more than 30% from baseline or a fall below 90 mmHg, was treated with incremental IV doses of ephedrine 5 mg and IV fluid as required. Bradycardia, defined as heart rate &#x0003c; 50 bpm, was treated with IV atropine 0.3&#x02013;0.6 mg. The incidence of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, shivering, pruritus, respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension were recorded. Sensory testing was assessed by loss of pinprick sensation to 23G hypodermic needle and dermatomes levels were tested every 2 min until the highest level had stabilized by consecutive tests. On achieving T7 sensory blockade level, surgery was allowed. Testing was then conducted every 10 min until the point of two segment regression of the block was observed. Further testing was performed at 20-min intervals until the recovery of S2 dermatome. The surgeon, patient, and the observing anesthesiologist were blinded to the patient group. Data regarding the highest dermatome level of sensory blockade, the time to reach this level from the time of injection, time to S1 level sensory regression, time to urination, and incidence of side effects were recorded. Sedation was assessed by a modified Ramsay sedation scale.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Modified Ramsay sedation scale</title><p>

Diclofenac was given intramuscularly as rescue analgesia when VAS was &#x0003e;4. A follow-up was carried out 1 week postoperatively by the blinded anesthesiologist, who asked about postoperative headache as well as postoperative pain and dysesthesia in the buttock, thighs, or lower limbs.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS15.0 Evaluation version). To calculate the sample size, a power analysis of &#x003b1;=0.05 and &#x003b1;=0.90, showed that 30 patients per study group were needed.

They act by binding to presynaptic C-fibers and postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. Their analgesic action is a result of depression of the release of C-fiber transmitters and hyperpolarisation of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Local anesthetic agents act by blocking sodium channels. The prolongation of effect may result from synergism between local anesthetic and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, while the prolongation of the motor block of spinal anesthetics may result from the binding of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists to motor neurons in the dorsal horn.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonists have been found to have antinociceptive action for both somatic and visceral pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Fentanyl is a lipophilic <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-receptor agonist opioid. Intrathecally, fentanyl exerts its effect by combining with opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of spinal cord and may have a supraspinal spread and action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The use of intrathecal clonidine has been studied with local anesthetics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Studies using a combination of intrathecal dexmedetomidine and local anesthetics are lacking. In our study, the intrathecal dose of dexmedetomidine selected was based on previous animal studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] A number of animal studies conducted using intrathecal dexmedetomidine at a dose range of 2.5&#x02013;100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g did not report any neurologic deficits with its use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Fukushima <italic>et al</italic> administered 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg epidural dexmedetomidine for postoperative analgesia in humans but did not report neurologic deficits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Our study has shown that the addition of 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine with hyperbaric bupivacaine significantly prolongs both sensory and motor block. Both fentanyl and dexmedetomidine provided good quality intraoperative analgesia and hemodynamic stability. The analgesia was clinically better in group D as compared to group F but it was not statistically significant. Small doses of intrathecal dexmedetomidine (3<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) used in combination with bupivacaine in humans have been shown to shorten the onset of motor block and prolong the duration of motor and sensory block with hemodynamic stability and lack of sedation.-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Al-Ghanem <italic>et al</italic> had studied the effect of addition of 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine or 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl intrathecal to 10 mg isobaric bupivacaine in vaginal hysterectomy and concluded that 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine produces more prolonged motor and sensory block as compared with 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In our study, in the dexmedetomidine group we found longer duration of both sensory and motor blockade, stable hemodynamic condition, and good patient satisfaction. Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic> studied effect of dexmedetomidine 5 and 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g with bupivacaine in urological procedures and found that dexmedetomidine prolongs the duration of spinal anesthesia in a dose-dependent manner.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Visceral pain usually occurs during abdominal surgery under spinal anesthesia. Intrathecal fentanyl when added to local anesthetics reduces visceral and somatic pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In our study as no patient perceived visceral pain in both D and F groups.</p><p>In our study hypotension was more in the dexmedetomidine group than in the fentanyl group, but it was not statistically significant. A 4-week follow-up showed that intrathecal dexmedetomidine, at a dose of 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g, was not associated with any new onset of back, buttock, or leg pain, weakness or neurologic deficit. Pruritus after intrathecal fentanyl is known but it was not significant in the present study. The &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agents also have antishivering property as observed by Talke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] We too did not find any incidence of shivering in the two groups.</p><p>In conclusion, 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g dexmedetomidine seems to be an attractive alternative to 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl as an adjuvant to spinal bupivacaine in surgical procedures. It provides good quality of intraoperative analgesia, hemodynamically stable conditions, minimal side effects, and excellent quality of postoperative analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
