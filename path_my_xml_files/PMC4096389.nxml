Although the oxygen-ozone treatment improves the diabetic outcome, there are few clinical trials to verify the efficacy and illuminate the underlying mechanisms of oxygen-ozone treatment on DFUs. In the present study, a total of 50 type 2 diabetic patients complicated with DFUs, Wagner stage 2~4, were randomized into control group treated by standard therapy only and ozone group treated by standard therapy plus oxygen-ozone treatment. The therapeutic effects were graded into 4 levels from grade 0 (no change) to grade 3 (wound healing). The wound sizes were measured at baseline and day 20, respectively. Tissue biopsies were performed at baseline and day 11. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) proteins in the pathologic specimens were determined by immunohistochemical examinations. The effective rate of ozone group was significantly higher than that of control group (92% versus 64%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The wound size reduction was significantly more in ozone group than in control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). After treatment, the expressions of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF proteins at day 11 were significantly higher in ozone group than in control group. Ozone therapy promotes the wound healing of DFUs via potential induction of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF at early stage of the treatment.

Introduction</title><p>Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) has been increasingly recognized as one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with a very high mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The management of DFUs has been an open problem for a long time in the world. Most recently a retrospective cohort study, with 312,744 wounds of all types in 154,664 patients enrolled, shows that most wounds were DFUs (19.0%), venous leg ulcers (26.1%), and pressure ulcers (16.2%) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Considering the high costs associated with treating DFUs, the development of better treatment strategies is warranted.</p><p>The medical use of ozone (also known as triatomic oxygen and trioxygen) was initiated in the 19th century. Ozone has multiple therapeutic effects in wound healing due to the property of releasing nascent oxygen, which has been shown to have bactericidal capabilities and to stimulate antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the ozone treatment improves the diabetic outcome [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], there are few prospective randomized clinical trials to verify the efficacy of the noninvasive oxygen-ozone treatment on the wound healing at the early stage of treatment in DFUs. According to the results of the largest DFUs clinical trial, the DFUs median time to heal for weekly or higher-frequency debridement was 21 days [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At the early stage of treatments (including debridement), wound healing is managed by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and transforming growth factors-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>). And then tissue macrophages supply the key multiple growth factors for healing [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, limited research has been conducted on the early efficacy of treatments as early as day 20 after treatment in DFUs. Also it is difficult to obtain the tissue specimens in clinical trials to verify the correlation of the treatments and the expressions of growth factors in the local wounds.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled clinical study in diabetic patients complicated with DFUs to assess the effects of ozone therapy on the healing and the expressions of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF of the wounds at the early stage after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. All patients gave signed informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Participants</title><p>Hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, during March 2012 to January 2013. A total of 50 patients, aged 18&#x02009;yrs or older, with DFU of Wagner classification stages 2, 3, or 4 were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they had one or more of the following conditions [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: (1) gangrenous ulcers in whole foot, (2) active osteomyelitis, (3) a history of collagen diseases, (4) hyperthyroidism, (5) pregnancy or nursing, (6) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels &#x0003e;10.5%, (7) ankle brachial index (ABI) &#x0003c;0.70, (8) hemoglobin less than 90&#x02009;g/L, (9) liver function tests (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or c-glutamyl transpeptidase) elevated to more than three times the upper normal limit, (10) serum creatinine &#x0003e;133&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L or dialysis, and (11) a known allergy to ozone. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records including age, gender, duration of DM, duration of DFU, systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HbA1c, hemoglobin (Hb), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), and ABI.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Study Design</title><p>Included patients were randomized into two groups. After debridement, the ozone group received noninvasive oxygen-ozone treatments with 52&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL ozone (total volume: 20&#x02013;50&#x02009;mL) in a special bag for 30&#x02009;min per day for 20 days using the ozone generator device (Humazon Promedic, German) in addition to standard treatment. The control group received only standard treatment which included debridement once every two days and wound dressings appropriate for the degree of exudate and moisture maintenance of the wound. A special technician was trained to operate the ozone generator device and performed the actual treatments. Study visits were performed at baseline and at days 11 and 20. At each visit, photography of the ulcers was taken at a distance of 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;cm and in the same light; then the wound condition, length, width, depth, healing progression, presence of infection, and the need for debridement were assessed. Ulcer areas were calculated from film transparency tracings using grid paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Criterion of Therapeutical Effect</title><p>At each visit the wound condition was evaluated into one of the four grades by the criteria as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Grade 0: no change or worse than before; Grade 1: wound size reducing less than 1/2; Grade 2: wound size reducing more than 1/2, the secretion obviously less than before, there is little necrosis, fresh granulation generated; Grade 3: wound healing, completely epithelialized with dimensions at 0 &#x000d7; 0 &#x000d7; 0&#x02009;cm.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Half of the tissue was weighed and homogenized in 3&#x02009;mL PBS (pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were collected and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer for the determination of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF by ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Systems). Each specimen was applied in duplicate. The levels of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF were expressed in pg/mg. Values were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD, whereas the other half was fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. The paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into 4&#x02009;mm sections and placed on silane-coated glass slides. Hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Masson's staining were, respectively, performed in all patients' specimens to detect the collagen deposition.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6.

Discussions</title><p>DFU is a major cause of amputation, which is caused by both vascular and neurologic complications of diabetes, in combination with persistent opportunistic infections and deficient wound healing. The management of DFUs is a great challenge for clinicians. The ozone treatment (1.1&#x02009;mg/kg with an ozone concentration of 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL via rectal insufflation) can improve glycemic control and prevent oxidative stress in STZ-induced diabetic rats [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most recently, ozone administered was reported to prevent atherosclerosis development and increase antioxidant systems in New Zealand white rabbits [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The antioxidative effects of ozone also ameliorate the age-related biochemical changes in male rat cerebral cortex [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), ozone treatment by rectal insufflation significantly improved prothrombin time, reduced biomarkers of protein and lipid oxidation, and increased total antioxidant [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A randomized controlled clinical trial in diabetic patients with peripheral arterial diseases (PAD) and diabetic foot showed improved glycemic control, reduced the area of lesions, inhibited oxidative stress and fewer amputations in patients treated with ozone for 20 days via rectal insufflation than in the control group [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Wainstein et al. reported that the ozone treatment in addition to the conventional treatment for 24 weeks was superior to conventional treatment alone in promoting the complete healing of DFUs [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>DFU is characterized by impaired wound healing, delayed closure time, and decreased collagen deposition associated with reduced expressions of endogenous growth factors in the wound [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Multiple growth factors, such as VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF, play an important role in wound healing. Lack of upregulation of some angiogenic and leukocyte chemotactic factors may account for a poor formation of granulation tissue and chronicity of ulcer epithelialization [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Treatments increasing the expressions or levels of growth factors have been proven to be effective in the wound healing of DFUs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The scaffold containing recombinant human VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) significantly accelerated wound closure at day 15 compared to scaffolds without growth factors in db/db mice [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the local application of growth factors has shown poor efficiency due to the rapid leakage and short half-life of growth factors at the wound bed. Thus, it may be more important for the wound healing to stimulate the expressions of endogenous growth factors at local wound site.</p><p>In our study, the oxygen-ozone treatment significantly promoted the early effective rate of the wound healing at day 20 in DFU patients. We also observed that there were significantly higher expressions of VEGF, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and PDGF in the ozone group than in the control group. The results show that the efficacy of the ozone treatment for the healing of DFUs may be partially due to the increasing of endogenous growth factors in the local wounds, which has not been reported before.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Professor Fang Gao, associated-chief physician at Department of Endocrinology &#x00026; Metabolism, and Ling Wang and Feiying He, technicians at the diabetes center of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.
