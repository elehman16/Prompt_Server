Patients from these randomized trials could receive tocilizumab treatment in open-label extension trials. Here, the long-term safety profile of tocilizumab, using pooled data from all of these trials, is reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cumulative safety data (as of February 6, 2009) from five core phase 3 trials, two ongoing extension trials, and one clinical pharmacology study were analyzed. Two patient populations were evaluated: an all-control population (<italic>n </italic>= 4,199), which included all patients randomly assigned in the placebo-controlled portions of the five core studies, and an all-exposed population (<italic>n </italic>= 4,009), which included patients from any of the eight studies who received at least one dose of tocilizumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Total exposure to tocilizumab was 8,580 patient years (PY), and total duration of observation was 9,414 PY. Overall adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) rates were 278.2/100 PY and 14.4/100 PY, respectively. These events included serious infections (4.7/100 PY), opportunistic infections (0.23/100 PY), gastrointestinal perforations (0.28/100 PY), malignancy (1.1/100 PY), myocardial infarction (0.25/100 PY), and stroke (0.19/100 PY). The rates of SAEs and serious infections were stable over time; no increase with prolonged exposure was noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The longer-term safety profile of tocilizumab (mean treatment duration, 2.4 years) is consistent with that observed in the phase 3 studies (duration up to 1 year).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF), B cells, T cells, or, most recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6) have emerged as effective treatments for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As with any new approach, evaluation of the safety profile associated with a particular treatment is critical.</p><p>Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to both soluble and membrane-expressed IL-6 receptors, thereby blocking IL-6-mediated proinflammatory signaling, has one of the most comprehensive phase 3 clinical trial programs for biologicals in RA. In combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), tocilizumab improved signs and symptoms of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and inhibited radiographic progression of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in patients with inadequate responses to DMARDs or TNF inhibitors. Compared with methotrexate monotherapy, tocilizumab monotherapy also was significantly more effective in patients who had not been exposed to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate had not previously failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overall, the onset of tocilizumab clinical benefit is rapid, and efficacy is sustained over time; reduced levels of inflammatory markers are observed as early as 14 days after the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although the safety profile of tocilizumab was evaluated in each clinical trial, integrated data across all phase 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] provide a more comprehensive picture of tocilizumab safety. Here we report pooled tocilizumab safety data and compare them with those of a control group from the RA phase 3 studies. Patients who participated in the randomized, placebo-controlled trials could continue to receive tocilizumab treatment in open-label extensions; therefore, this report includes long-term tocilizumab safety data not previously reported. We describe the longer-term safety profile of tocilizumab from these phase 3 studies and open-label extensions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Data sources and patient populations</title><p>Included in this analysis are cumulative safety data from five core phase 3 clinical trials:</p><p>t<underline>O</underline>cilizumab <underline>P</underline>ivotal <underline>T</underline>rial in methotrexate <underline>I</underline>nadequate resp<underline>ON</underline>ders (OPTION) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], <underline>A</underline>ctemra (Roche; Nutley, NJ, USA) versus <underline>M</underline>ethotrexate double-<underline>B</underline>lind <underline>I</underline>nvestigative <underline>T</underline>rial <underline>I</underline>n m<underline>ON</underline>otherapy (AMBITION) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (including the double-blind transition phase), <underline>R</underline>esearch on <underline>A</underline>ctemra <underline>D</underline>etermining efficacy after <underline>A</underline>nti-<underline>T</underline>NF failur<underline>E</underline>s (RADIATE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], <underline>T</underline>ocilizumab in c<underline>O</underline>mbination <underline>W</underline>ith traditional DM<underline>ARD </underline>therapy (TOWARD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and toci<underline>LI</underline>zumab safety and <underline>THE </underline>prevention of structural joint damage (LITHE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (including the ongoing open-label extension phase).

Mean treatment duration was 2.4 years, and median treatment duration was 2.6 years (range, 0.0 to 4.1 years). Patients entered GROWTH 95 through August 2005 until February 2007 and GROWTH 96 through September 2005 until February 2008; both studies are ongoing. Patients continued background DMARD therapy unless adjustments or interruptions were required for safety reasons. Patients who received placebo during the controlled studies and who subsequently chose to enter the long-term extension studies were given tocilizumab 8 mg/kg once every 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Dose modifications</title><p>Tocilizumab doses could be withheld or reduced on the occurrence of certain adverse events (AEs), specifically severe or frequent infections; significant elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin; or decreases in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or platelet count. In the placebo-controlled studies, dose modification was limited to skipping or interrupting an infusion of tocilizumab/placebo. In the long-term extension studies, a patient's tocilizumab dose could be decreased from 8 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg or skipped.</p><p>Dose and route of administration of methotrexate or other nonbiologic DMARDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and oral corticosteroids were maintained in accordance with study entry through the placebo-controlled period of the trials. However, reductions in these treatments were allowed as clinically required for safety reasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and laboratory assessments</title><p>General safety measures, including AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and deaths were recorded. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who had been administered study treatment; a causal relation with the treatment was not necessary. An SAE was defined as any event that fulfilled regulatory seriousness criteria, including events leading to hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, medically significant events, or death. Multiple occurrences of the same AE in individual patients were counted once. Events of special interest (that is, serious infections; opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis (TB); gastrointestinal (GI) perforations; malignancies; myocardial infarction, and stroke; and anaphylactic reactions) are described later. Infections, opportunistic infections, malignancies, myocardial infarction, and stroke summaries were each based on a standardized group of preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA); in these summaries, multiple occurrences of the same AE in individual patients were counted to assess overall event rates. Neutrophil and platelet counts, hepatic transaminase (ALT and AST) levels, and lipid levels were monitored by routine laboratory collections at scheduled visits (see Laboratory assessments later).</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure to tocilizumab</title><p>The extent of tocilizumab exposure was calculated by assigning 28 days to each infusion received. Total duration of observation was defined as the time from the first tocilizumab dose to the time of the last safety observation, regardless of whether this observation was reported within 28 days of the last tocilizumab dose. Total duration of observation was used as the denominator for patient-adjusted AE rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory assessments</title><p>Fasting lipid levels, including total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, were measured at baseline; at weeks 6, 14, and 24; and every 12 weeks thereafter. ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels were measured at baseline; at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 24; and every 12 weeks thereafter. Complete blood counts (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, white blood cells, and differential (absolute and percentage) and platelets) were performed at baseline; at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16; and every 4 weeks thereafter in the core studies. Complete blood counts were performed at baseline; at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12; and every 4 weeks thereafter in the extension studies. Laboratory measurements occurred before tocilizumab infusions, and investigators were unaware of test results at the time of infusion. Depending on the trial, it was either recommended or mandated that tocilizumab be permanently discontinued in any patient with the following laboratory values: a single ALT or AST measurement &#x02265; 5&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal (ULN) or two measurements &#x02265; 3&#x000d7; ULN at two consecutive study visits, a single total bilirubin level &#x02265; 2&#x000d7; ULN, or a neutrophil count &#x0003c; 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Tocilizumab treatment was withheld in any patient with an ALT or AST level &#x02265; 3&#x000d7; ULN until the level reached &#x0003c; 3&#x000d7; ULN. For liver enzyme assessments, the controlled, double-blind population was used because the monotherapy groups were specifically separated with regard to these measures for this population. Data were included up to only 6 months; patients randomly assigned to placebo for 8 weeks followed by tocilizumab for 16 weeks in a substudy of AMBITION were not included.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient populations</title><p>The all-control population consisted of all patients randomly assigned in the five core studies; data from the double-blind periods were collected from randomization until the first change in treatment regimen or until 2 years of treatment.

One serious bleeding event (hemorrhagic stomatitis) occurred in a patient with CTC grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The 8-mg/kg dose was maintained, and the event resolved without sequelae.</p></sec><sec><title>Hemoglobin</title><p>In the all-control population, the mean hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dl at baseline in all three groups. At weeks 2 and 6, levels were 13.3 g/dl in controls; 14.1 g/dl and 14.2 g/dl, respectively, in the tocilizumab 4-mg/kg group; and 14.1 g/dl and 14.4 g/dl, respectively, in the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg group. Mean baseline hemoglobin level in the all-exposed population was 13.4 g/dl. Subsequently, the level increased to 14.0 g/dl (week 2), 14.3 g/dl (week 6), and 14.8 g/dl (week 104). Approximately 34% of patients who previously had inadequate responses to DMARDs had hemoglobin values below the lower limit of normal at baseline. After treatment with tocilizumab, the greatest improvement in hemoglobin levels was observed in these patients, whose baseline hemoglobin values were below the lower limit of normal. In this subset, mean hemoglobin concentrations increased in the tocilizumab-treated group to within the lower limit of normal, whereas mean levels in the control group remained below the lower limit of normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of lipids</title><p>Fasting lipid levels were assessed during the tocilizumab development program. In the all-control population, mean LDL levels in the control, tocilizumab 4-mg/kg, and tocilizumab 8-mg/kg groups were 114 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 1,404), 113 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 690), and 113 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 1,686), respectively, at baseline, and 117 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 939), 127 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 536), and 136 mg/dl (<italic>n </italic>= 1,419), respectively, at week 24. LDL cholesterol changes from &#x0003c; 130 mg/dl at baseline to &#x02265; 130 mg/dl at last observation were assessed in patients not receiving lipid-lowering agents; 14.2% (123/867) in the control group, 25.1% (106/423) in the tocilizumab 4-mg/kg group, and 33.2% (349/1,052) in the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg group experienced these elevations in LDL cholesterol levels.</p><p>In the all-exposed population, mean total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels increased from baseline to the first assessment after tocilizumab infusion at week 6 and remained at week 6 levels with continued tocilizumab treatment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). At baseline, 70.8% of patients had LDL levels &#x0003c; 130 mg/dl. This proportion decreased to 49.9% at week 24 and remained relatively constant throughout the trial (for example, 48.2% at week 104 and 45.9% at week 200). Overall, 456 patients in the all-exposed population started treatment with lipid-lowering medications at some point during the study. Assessment of the exact effect and the time course of the effect of lipid-lowering medications is difficult because of the wide range of times at which patients started taking these medications in the trials. Furthermore, initiation and dosing of lipid-lowering therapy were not standardized but were based on the discretion of the treating physician. However, after an initial increase in mean LDL level, a decrease to a level similar to that at baseline was observed in this subgroup: baseline (135 mg/dl), week 6 (167 mg/dl), week 52 (152 mg/dl), and week 104 (139 mg/dl) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Lipid parameters<sup>a </sup>in the all-exposed population (<italic>n </italic>= 4,009)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Parameter (mg/dl)</th><th align="center">Baseline</th><th align="center">Week 6</th><th align="center">Week 52<sup>b</sup></th><th align="center">Week 104</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mean total cholesterol</td><td align="center">196.2<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,714)</td><td align="center">227.6<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,279)</td><td align="center">222.9<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,312)</td><td align="center">224.1<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 828)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean LDL cholesterol</td><td align="center">114.2<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,633)</td><td align="center">135.5<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,149)</td><td align="center">133.5<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,274)</td><td align="center">134.3<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 805)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean HDL cholesterol</td><td align="center">56.9<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,656)</td><td align="center">60.8<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,249)</td><td align="center">60.0<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,301)</td><td align="center">60.0<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 826)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean triglycerides</td><td align="center">127.6<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,715)</td><td align="center">160.4<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 3,280)</td><td align="center">148.8<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,312)</td><td align="center">148.8<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 828)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5">Patients starting lipid-lowering medication<break/>at any time up to week 104 during the trial (<italic>n </italic>= 456)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean total cholesterol</td><td align="center">223.3<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 415)</td><td align="center">267.4<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 375)</td><td align="center">247.7<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 154)</td><td align="center">236.1<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 109)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean LDL cholesterol</td><td align="center">135.1<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 402)</td><td align="center">167.6<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 338)</td><td align="center">152.9<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 142)</td><td align="center">138.9<break/>(<italic>n </italic>= 97)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>HDL, high-density lipoprotein;

Patients treated with monotherapy had less-pronounced liver enzyme elevations than did patients treated with combination therapy; 32% and 3.7% of patients treated with methotrexate monotherapy; 19.1% and 1.1% of patients treated with non-methotrexate DMARD monotherapy; and 33.8% and 1.9% of patients treated with tocilizumab 8-mg/kg monotherapy each had at least a single increase in ALT level from normal at baseline to &#x0003e; 1 to 3&#x000d7; ULN or &#x0003e; 3&#x000d7; ULN, respectively, as the highest value during the double-blind period. Further, 42.8% and 5.0% of patients treated with tocilizumab 4 mg/kg + DMARD, and 45.9% and 5.7% of patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + DMARD, each had at least a single elevation in ALT level from normal at baseline to &#x0003e; 1 to 3&#x000d7; ULN or &#x0003e; 3&#x000d7; ULN, respectively, as their highest value during the double-blind period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Changes in AST values were similar (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>).</p><p>In the all-exposed population, 9.5% and 3.1% of patients treated with tocilizumab had increases in ALT or AST levels from normal at baseline to &#x0003e; 3&#x000d7; ULN at any time up to the time of database lock. Overall, 1.6% of patients had tocilizumab dose reductions from 8 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg; 0.4% of patients had DMARD dose reductions; 9.3% of patients temporarily interrupted tocilizumab dosing; and 1% of patients had interrupted DMARD and tocilizumab dosing because of liver enzyme elevations &#x0003e; 3&#x000d7; ULN. Most patients continued therapy after dose reduction; 2.3% of patients withdrew from treatment because of elevated liver function tests (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). In the all-control population, mean total bilirubin levels at baseline were 5 to 6 &#x003bc;mol/L (0.30 to 0.35 mg/dl) in all groups. Mean increases to week 4 in total and indirect bilirubin levels were &#x02264; 2 &#x003bc;mol/L (0.12 mg/dl) in all groups. These values remained stable during the long-term extension studies, and no clinically relevant effect was noted on direct bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, or any other liver function parameter. Further, no evidence was seen of clinically significant hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury associated with transaminase elevations in patients treated with tocilizumab.</p><p>Liver biopsies were recommended but not required for patients whose liver-enzyme elevations did not normalize within 6 months of discontinuation from the study and were obtained at the investigators' discretion. Of the 11 liver biopsy samples evaluated by an independent hepatic pathology expert, steatohepatitis was present in nine patients. Seven of the nine patients had &#x02265; 1 clinical risk factor (excluding methotrexate use) for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, including obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The two patients with normal liver biopsy samples had no risk factors for liver disease and had no history of previous liver disease.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The safety profile of tocilizumab was extensively evaluated in five trials in patients with RA, and the pooled safety data from these phase 3 trials and their long-term extensions are described herein. The longer-term safety profile of tocilizumab (mean treatment duration, 2.4 years) is consistent with that observed in the phase 3 studies (treatment duration, up to 1 year). Notably, no increases in serious or treatment-related AEs were observed with prolonged exposure to tocilizumab. Rates of SAEs, including deaths, were similar to those observed in RA clinical trials for other biologic therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although direct comparison of rates may be inappropriate because of differences in study designs and populations. Further, data from this pooled safety report are consistent overall with the postmarketing trials and experience with tocilizumab.</p><p>Patients with RA are approximately twice as likely as the general population to acquire infections or serious infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This increased risk for infection is attributed to intrinsic disease-related factors (for example, immunologic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), age, extra-articular manifestations, leukopenia, comorbidities, and treatment-related factors (for example, use of corticosteroids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the current analysis, rates of serious infection in the control and tocilizumab-treated groups were higher in patients with preexisting pulmonary disease, diabetes, older age, or higher body mass index and in those concomitantly treated with steroids or previously treated with a TNF inhibitor.</p><p>Overall, infections were the most common AEs and SAEs reported during the studies included in this analysis. Compared with the control group, rates of infections were higher in the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg group than in the tocilizumab 4-mg/kg group. Eight cases of infections with TB were reported in seven patients, all of whom received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. The most common serious infections involved the skin (cellulitis) and lung (pneumonia). Importantly, rates of serious infection did not increase with prolonged use of tocilizumab, and serious infections occurred at rates similar to those reported for RA patients treated with TNF inhibitors or other biologic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Patients with RA treated with any biologic treatment, including tocilizumab, should be closely monitored for the development of infections, and--according to American College of Rheumatology Recommendations for Use of Nonbiologic and Biologic DMARDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]--treatment should not be started in a patient with an active infection. Recommendations also include routine TB screening for patients being considered for biologic therapy and clinical vigilance during long-term treatment.</p><p>In the current analysis, 26 cases (0.28/100 PY) of GI perforation, including three fatal perforations, were observed during treatment with tocilizumab. According to the results of a retrospective, claims-based study that evaluated 40,841 RA patients treated with biologic agents, methotrexate, oral glucocorticoids, and NSAIDs, GI perforation is an uncommon (0.11 hospitalizations with GI perforation per 100 PY) SAE among RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Oral glucocorticosteroid use and preexisting diverticulitis were independently associated risk factors for GI perforation. Overall, 70% of RA patients with GI perforation in the analysis had one or both of these risk factors. Therefore, RA patients who are treated with glucocorticoids or who have previously experienced diverticulitis should be considered at higher risk for GI perforation. Tocilizumab-treated patients with new-onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated promptly for the early identification of GI perforation.</p><p>In this integrated summary of safety, eight clinically significant anaphylactic reactions to tocilizumab infusions were reported. Most of these events occurred with the 4-mg/kg tocilizumab dose and early during treatment. During tocilizumab infusion, treatment should be stopped immediately and appropriate medical management should be started if an anaphylactic or other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Tocilizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience these reactions.</p><p>Increases in hepatic transaminase (ALT and AST) levels were observed in some patients in the phase 3 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These increases were generally mild and reversible. Increases in ALT or AST to either &#x0003e; 1 to 3&#x000d7; ULN or &#x0003e; 3&#x000d7; ULN in patients treated with tocilizumab were less common with tocilizumab monotherapy. Importantly, liver enzyme elevations were not associated with clinically apparent drug-induced liver injury. Because of the potential for increases in hepatic transaminase levels, these laboratory values should be monitored before and during tocilizumab therapy, and dose adjustments--including interruption or permanent discontinuation of tocilizumab or concomitant DMARD (particularly methotrexate)--should be considered if appropriate.</p><p>Finally, RA has been associated with an increased risk for CV disease and CV-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], despite the paradoxically low lipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL) seen with active disease and inflammation. Although the pathogenic mechanisms involved in accelerated CV disease in RA patients are complex and multifactorial, the underlying systemic inflammation has been postulated to promote accelerated atherosclerosis. This concept is supported by the fact that inflammatory markers such as CRP have been shown to be independent predictors of CV events in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the reduction of hsCRP by rosuvastatin in the JUPITER study reduced the incidence of major CV events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Reducing the inflammatory burden of RA by lowering CRP and IL-6 levels may, therefore, reduce CV risk in RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this pooled data set, rates of myocardial infarction and stroke were similar to those reported in epidemiologic studies of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Aggressive prevention and treatment of traditional and nontraditional CV risk factors, including control of inflammation, immunologic disturbances, and metabolic changes, are of paramount importance in RA patients. Like patients without RA, patients with RA--particularly those actively treated--should be monitored and managed according to clinical guidelines (for example, the National Cholesterol Education Program). Lipid parameters should be assessed 4 to 8 weeks after the start of RA treatment and at 6-month intervals thereafter; the addition of lipid-lowering agents in patients with persistently elevated lipid levels should be considered.</p><p>In summary, this report provides an account of the safety profile of tocilizumab from phase 3 clinical trials and their respective open-label extensions. Results demonstrate that the longer-term safety profile of tocilizumab is consistent with that observed in phase 3 studies, with no increases in serious or treatment-related AEs on prolonged exposure to tocilizumab. Similar trial designs and data collection allowed the pooling of individual patient data and resulted in a very large RA randomized controlled trial data set with extensive long-term exposure. However, as with any randomized controlled trial, patients were assessed for strict entry criteria, and the observations were made in a clinical trial setting with rigorous patient monitoring and laboratory testing protocols. Several of the laboratory abnormalities described in this report, such as cytopenias and liver function abnormalities, did not lead to clinically significant sequelae, possibly because of the close supervision of the clinical trial setting. It would, therefore, be prudent for clinicians to use similarly careful patient monitoring strategies for tocilizumab-treated patients in the clinical practice setting. Of note, however, the results of this integrated safety analysis are consistent overall with data from postmarketing surveillance to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results from the current analysis confirm that the longer-term safety profile of tocilizumab in RA patients is consistent with that previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].
