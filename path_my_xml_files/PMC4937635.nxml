Two studies were undertaken to further elucidate the absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor and its regional absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Design and methods</title><p>In two open-label, randomized, cross-over studies, 12 volunteers received a single dose of ticagrelor: oral 90&#x02009;mg and 15&#x02009;mg IV (Study 1); or 100&#x02009;mg oral suspension vs 100&#x02009;mg immediate release (IR) tablet (Study 2). After the initial cross-over period in Study 2, patients received 100&#x02009;mg suspension delivered to specific sites in the GI tract using an Enterion capsule.

Ticagrelor is approved for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The phase III PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) study<sup><xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> showed that ticagrelor (180&#x02009;mg loading dose followed by 90&#x02009;mg twice daily) significantly reduced the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from vascular causes, compared with clopidogrel (both given with aspirin) without increasing the rate of overall major bleeding in patients with ACS<sup><xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>In early clinical pharmacology studies, ticagrelor demonstrated predictable, linear pharmacokinetics with single oral doses up to 400&#x02009;mg<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and multiple oral doses up to 300&#x02009;mg twice daily<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Ticagrelor was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations achieved 1.3&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;h after single doses and 1.5&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;h after multiple doses<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Metabolism of ticagrelor is not required for inhibition of platelet aggregation<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. However, ticagrelor is extensively metabolized<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and the active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) formed via cytochrome P450 3A4/5<sup><xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> is present in blood at approximately one third the concentration of the parent compound<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. AR-C124910XX has similar potency to the parent compound with respect to inhibition of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor (AstraZeneca data on file). In six volunteers receiving a single oral dose of [<sup>14</sup>C]ticagrelor 200&#x02009;mg as a suspension, 26.5% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine, with &#x0003c;0.05% of the dose excreted as unchanged ticagrelor or AR-C124910XX, indicating that renal clearance is of minor importance<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The majority of radioactivity was recovered in the feces (57.8%), suggesting that ticagrelor has low absorption, or that ticagrelor and its metabolites may have passed directly into the bile from the liver or are excreted into the intestine from the systemic circulation via intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gP)<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Ticagrelor is a substrate and inhibitor of intestinal P-gP (AstraZeneca, data on file)<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Ticagrelor requires twice-daily administration. In order to advance the development of a modified release formulation for a potentially once-daily administration regimen, two studies were undertaken to provide further details regarding the pharmacokinetic profile of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers. Study 1 aimed to determine the absolute bioavailability of oral ticagrelor. Study 2 aimed to determine the regional absorption characteristics of ticagrelor from the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel and ascending colon, and to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticagrelor following oral administration of immediate release (IR) tablet and suspension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0006-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study populations</title><p>In Study 1 (D5130C00038) key inclusion criteria were: healthy volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45 years, body mass index (BMI) 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The Enterion capsule is a remote-controlled drug delivery device containing a gamma-emitting radionuclide tracer port<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Each Enterion capsule was administered with 200&#x02009;mL <sup>99m</sup>Technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to provide an outline of the GI tract.

The first study found that the mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was 36% (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x02013;42). This result is consistent with findings from a study using a single oral dose of [<sup>14</sup>C]ticagrelor 200&#x02009;mg in six volunteers in whom the majority of radioactivity was recovered in the feces (57.8%), suggesting that ticagrelor has low bioavailability<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, passed directly into the bile from the liver or was excreted into the intestine via intestinal P-gP. However, neither our current study nor previous studies have determined the proportion of an administered ticagrelor dose that enters the GI tract via intestinal P-gP transport or via biliary excretion.</p><p>The second study was undertaken to compare the absorption profile of ticagrelor following oral administration as an IR tablet vs suspension and to examine the regional absorption of ticagrelor in the GI tract. Compared with administration of the IR tablet, administration of 100&#x02009;mg ticagrelor as a suspension resulted in a greater exposure to both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX. Enterion capsules containing 100&#x02009;mg ticagrelor (suspension) were used to assess regional absorption and generally demonstrated typical GI transit times, given the large inter-subject and intra-subject variability in GI transit with single-unit dosage forms<sup><xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup>. Exposure to ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX decreased the further down the GI tract that ticagrelor was released from the capsule. The largest proportion of ticagrelor was absorbed when it was released in the proximal small bowel, with a pharmacokinetic profile similar to oral administration of the suspension. In addition, the <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> was 1.5&#x02009;h after oral administration of ticagrelor suspension, as well as after release of the suspension within the proximal or distal small bowel (via Enterion capsule), suggesting that the rate of absorption of ticagrelor after oral administration is similar throughout the small bowel. Given the low pH-independent solubility and low permeability of ticagrelor<sup><xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, these results are not unexpected. Both permeability and solubility are important factors in colonic drug absorption in humans, and drugs with low permeability generally exhibit reduced absorption after colonic vs oral and proximal small bowel administration<sup><xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. For example, reduced absorption of low permeability and low solubility drugs from the colon may be due to the reduced surface area (i.e., lack of villi) and a greater tight junctional area in the colon compared with the small bowel<sup><xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Equally, we cannot rule out that ticagrelor was well absorbed from the colon but then metabolized before it reached the systemic circulation; although cytochrome P450 levels tend to be lower in the colon than intestine and PgP-mediated efflux appears to have little impact on colonic absorption in humans<sup><xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of oral ticagrelor in Study 1 were consistent with previous reports<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, where rapid absorption of ticagrelor (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;h) was consistent with the rapid onset of platelet inhibition<sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This was the first study to determine the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor following IV administration. The difference in AUC between a single oral and IV dose of ticagrelor reflects the difference in the dose administered and the impact of first-pass metabolism on the bioavailability of oral ticagrelor. The AR-C124910XX:ticagrelor ratios for exposure were much higher after oral than IV administration, suggesting that the majority of AR-C124910XX formation after oral administration of ticagrelor occurs during absorption and during first pass metabolism.</p><p>Ticagrelor was well tolerated, irrespective of the formulation given (oral suspension, IR tablet, IV, suspension within an Enterion capsule). All AEs were mild and all but one resolved by the end of the study (eye pruritus) across both studies.</p><p>Our studies were not without limitations. The study populations differed in their racial mix, with Black volunteers comprising 75% of the population in Study 1 and Caucasians comprising 91% of those in Study 2. However, ticagrelor pharmacokinetics are not markedly affected by race<sup><xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and, in both studies, the volunteers acted as their own controls, which would minimize the impact of racial differences on variation. Our studies included a relatively small number of volunteers, which, when combined with the low absorption of ticagrelor, may have contributed to observed variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticagrelor. Overall, our findings have limited clinical applicability for physicians and pharmacists. However, they provide important insights into the absorption profile of ticagrelor, which will inform the development of a modified release formulation.</p><p>In conclusion, the mean absolute oral bioavailability of ticagrelor was 36% (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x02013;42%). Ticagrelor was absorbed from the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel, and ascending colon, and the proportion of ticagrelor absorbed decreased the further down the GI tract it was released: the mean AUC for ticagrelor was 89% (proximal small bowel), 73% (distal small bowel), and 32% (ascending colon) that of the mean AUC for the orally administered suspension. Ticagrelor was well tolerated when administered by IV infusion, and orally as a tablet, suspension, and a suspension released at different regions of the GI tract.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Clare Ryles and David Evans (Gardiner-Caldwell Communications) who provided medical writing support, funded by AstraZeneca.</p></ack><sec id="S9"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="S0009-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca (Alderley Park, Cheshire, UK).</p><p><bold>Declaration of financial/other interests</bold></p><p>Renli Teng and Juan Maya are employees of AstraZeneca.
