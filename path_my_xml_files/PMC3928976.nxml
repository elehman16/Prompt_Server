In adult mental health care, assertive community treatment (ACT) is an organizational model of care for treating patients with SMI who are difficult to engage. So far all outcome studies of assertive community treatment have been conducted in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized controlled trial design we compared the effectiveness of ACT for elderly patients with that of treatment as usual (TAU). Sixty-two outpatients (60&#x000a0;years and older) with SMI who were difficult to engage in psychiatric treatment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group (32 to ACT for elderly patients and 30 to TAU). Primary outcomes included number of patients who had a first treatment contact within 3&#x000a0;months, the number of dropouts (i.e. those discharged from care due to refusing care or those who unintentionally lost contact with the service over a period of at least 3&#x000a0;months); and patients&#x02019; psychosocial functioning (HoNOS65+ scores) during 18&#x000a0;months follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the number of unmet needs and mental health care use. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 62 patients who were randomized, 26 were lost to follow-up (10 patients in ACT for elderly patients and 16 in TAU). Relative to patients with TAU, more patients allocated to ACT had a first contact within three months (96.9 versus 66.7%; X<sup>2</sup> (df&#x02009;=&#x02009;1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.68, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002). ACT for elderly patients also had fewer dropouts from treatment (18.8% of assertive community treatment for elderly patients versus 50% of TAU patients; X<sup>2</sup> (df&#x02009;=&#x02009;1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.75, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009). There were no differences in the other primary and secondary outcome variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings suggest that ACT for elderly patients with SMI engaged patients in treatment more successfully.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1620">NTR1620</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Assertive community treatment</kwd><kwd>Severe mental illness</kwd><kwd>Dropout</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>HoNOS65+</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Due to fragmented mental, somatic, and social healthcare services, it can be hard to engage into care older patients with severe mental illness (SMI) who have problems in multiple life domains and problems in treatment motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Assertive community treatment (ACT) was developed as an integrated model to meet the needs of difficult-to-engage patients with complex problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Critical components of ACT associated with reducing hospital admissions were shared caseload, community based services, 7x 24 hour services, a team leader who participated in patient care, full responsibility for treatment services, daily team meetings and time unlimited services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although there is no agreement on which critical components of ACT are associated with psychosocial outcomes, better outcomes have both been shown to be associated with having a better team structure and with having a consumer provider in the team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Better engagement was associated with a smaller caseload in ACT than in TAU, and with a shared caseload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, ACT reduced hospital admissions more than treatment as usual (TAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. European studies however showed mixed effects of ACT when compared with TAU, due possibly to better quality of care in the TAU control-conditions and/or inadequate implementation of key ACT-components. Reduced effectiveness of ACT in Europe could also be explained by a loss of focus on preventing admissions when ACT-teams are confronted with very strict admission criteria, or conversely, when in-patient beds are readily available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>One group of patients who might benefit from ACT are elderly patients with SMI who are difficult to engage, have heterogeneous care needs, such as psychiatric as well as somatic problems, and have problems with activities of daily living, housing and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Only one study has focused on ACT for the elderly (ACTE). Although results suggested that the ACT model supplemented with specific care for the elderly was suitable for this subgroup, the study presented no data on the effectiveness of this service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>To meet the different needs of older patients with SMI who are difficult to engage, a specialized ACTE team was started. We tested its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We hypothesised that ACTE, as compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU), more often succeeds in establishing contact with patients within 3&#x000a0;months of their signing up for care, has fewer drop outs, and has better effects on patients&#x02019; psychosocial functioning (primary outcome variables). We also hypothesized that ACTE would meet patients&#x02019; unmet needs more effectively, and would reduce mental healthcare use (secondary outcome variables) as compared to treatment as usual.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>ACT is a community-based treatment approach for outpatients whose SMI results in difficulties in daily living activities and social functioning often including problems with relationships, physical health, addiction, work, daytime activities, and living conditions. ACT was developed for patients who are high users of inpatient hospital services and who are unwilling to use mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Unlike other community-based programs, ACT provides individualized services directly to the patients. To meet patients&#x02019; various needs, a multidisciplinary team provides psychiatric, somatic and rehabilitation treatment. Team members are trained in the areas of psychiatry, social work, nursing, substance abuse, and rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Key features of ACT are: assertive engagement, a small caseload (maximum of 10 patients per clinician); shared caseload (i.e. all clinicians collaborated closely on each patient using one treatment plan); and community-based and assertive services on a time-unlimited basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. ACTE was implemented using the ACT manual developed for adults. The descriptions in this manual include the team approach and the duties of each discipline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The ACTE team was staffed by: a substance-abuse specialist, a rehabilitation worker, a social worker, a psychiatric nurse, a nurse specialized in somatic care, a community mental health nurse and a psychiatrist (the last two were both specialized in treating elderly people).</p><p>Treatment as usual was provided by three community mental health teams for elderly patients. Two of these teams were for patients with primary psychiatric disorders, and one was for patients with cognitive disorders. The teams provided regular mental health services, including psychiatric care on an outreach basis. Various disciplines (including community mental health nurses, a psychiatrist, and a psychologist) were individually responsible for the patients and their treatment plans (no shared caseload); their caseload was relatively high (more than 25 patients per practitioner). All clinicians were specialized in treating elderly people.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design and recruitment</title><p>The study was carried out by Parnassia Psychiatric Institute, department BavoEuropoort, a mental healthcare centre in the greater Rotterdam area in the Netherlands. BavoEuropoort provides inpatient and outpatient care in an urban population of some 1.3 million people.</p><p>The ACTE study was designed as a parallel group randomized controlled trial, with one intervention group and one control group. The study was approved by the Dutch Union of Medical-Ethical Trial Committees for mental health organizations. See Stobbe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for a more detailed description of the study.</p><p>All elderly patients referred to the BavoEuropoort mental healthcare centre in Rotterdam (the Netherlands) between July 2008 and July 2010 were screened with regard to meeting the inclusion criteria.</p><p>General practitioners or municipal health services referred patients according to usual procedures (the person who referred the patient filled out a form describing the patient&#x02019;s characteristics and current problems). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were filled in and checked by the clinicians of the ACTE and the community mental health teams. The initial inclusion criteria included: 1.) age 65&#x000a0;years or older, 2.) presumption of a severe mental illness (for example schizophrenia spectrum disorders or major affective disorders); 3.) problems in four or more of the following areas: daily functioning, (e.g. personal hygiene, social relationships), daytime activities, addiction, financial problems, housing, somatic problems, or police contacts; and 4.) difficulties in engaging in treatment (for example patients who were unwilling to use mental health services, or those who had a history of involuntary admissions or of drop-out from mental healthcare). There was one exclusion criterion: the presumption of moderate to severe cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Because the inclusion rate was low during the first year of inclusion (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35), we extended the inclusion period to a total of 24&#x000a0;months. Extending the inclusion period was not sufficient for recruitment, and therefore the inclusion criteria were broadened: after 1&#x000a0;year we broadened the inclusion criteria by lowering the minimum age to 60&#x000a0;years. We also dropped problems in various domains as an inclusion criterion, since patients often received no medical or psychiatric treatment so that only limited information was available when patients were referred.</p><p>We compared patients who were recruited during the first year of the study to patients who were recruited later. Patients&#x02019; level of unmet needs and psychosocial functioning at baseline did not differ between patients included during the first year of the study and patients included after we broadened the inclusion criteria. Because we lowered the minimum age after 1&#x000a0;year, patients included after this year were younger than patients included the first year of the study (72.1&#x000a0;years, standard deviation (SD) 8.7 versus 76.7&#x000a0;years (SD 7.2). T-test 2.24, degrees of freedom (df)&#x02009;=&#x02009;60, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>To allocate the patients to ACTE or TAU we used a randomization list generated by a computer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria received a number chronologically from the ACTE service administrator. On the basis of this number, an opaque sealed envelope with the corresponding number was opened and the patient was allocated randomly.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The study focused on three primary outcome measures. First we computed the number of patients who had a first treatment contact with the mental healthcare worker within 3&#x000a0;months of being signed up for care. Second, the number of dropouts during the follow-up period was assessed where there were two categories: being discharged for refusing care and (temporary) unintentional loss of contact with the service for at least 3&#x000a0;months; and thirdly psychosocial problems over time.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures comprised the number of unmet needs over time, the number of in-patient psychiatric hospital admissions, duration of admission and the number of crisis contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Outcomes were assessed at three time points: at baseline (T1), at 9&#x000a0;months after baseline (T2), and 18&#x000a0;months after baseline (T3).</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>Demographic characteristics and dropout data were collected from patients&#x02019; electronic files. The number of psychiatric hospital admissions, duration of admission and the number of crisis contacts were collected from the central system of registration.</p><p>The Dutch version of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for elderly people (HoNOS65+) was used to assess the severity of psychosocial problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The HoNOS65+ is divided into 12 items: overactive and aggressive behaviour, non-accidental self-injury, problem drinking or drug-taking, cognitive problems, physical illness or disability problems, hallucinations and delusions, depressed mood, other mental and behaviour problems, problems with relationships, problems with activities of daily living, problems with living conditions, and problems with occupation and activities. We used the sum score of the HoNOS65+. All items were scored on a 5-point scale, from 0 (no problem) through 1 (minor problem), to 2 (mild problem), 3 (moderate problem), and 4 (severe problem). The Dutch version of the HoNOS65+ has been shown sensitive enough to measure change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The short Dutch version of the Camberwell Assessment of Needs for the Elderly (CANE, staff member version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was used to measure care needs in twenty-four areas. Each item was scored as 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no need, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;met need (due to an intervention) or 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;unmet need (intervention is needed, or intervention had no effect). We used the sum score of the unmet needs. The validity and reliability of the original scale were good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and acceptable for the Dutch version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Measuring model fidelity of ACT is a method to evaluate how close ACT was implemented to the academic ideal. The model fidelity of ACTE and TAU was measured two years after the start of the ACTE team, using the Dutch version of the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The scale items were divided into three sections: human resources, organizational boundaries and nature of services.</p></sec><sec><title>Data-collection procedure</title><p>Outcome data were collected by psychology students on the basis of a face-to-face contact with each patient, which was combined with information provided by the clinician and with data in the patients&#x02019; electronic files. If patients refused contact, data were collected only on the basis of information provided by the clinician and of data in the patients&#x02019; electronic files. Data were analysed anonymously. For practical issues, raters could not be blinded for the treatment condition. Because we were dealing with unmotivated patients, the instruments were assessed from the raters&#x02019; point of view.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>First, all variables were checked for outliers and missing values. Next, we compared socio-demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Chi-square tests were used to analyze differences between the intervention and control group in the number of patients who had a first treatment contact within three months and the number of dropouts. To test differences regarding psychosocial functioning (total score HoNOS65+), the intervention and control group were compared using regression analysis, with centred psychosocial functioning at baseline as covariate and treatment condition as factor. Finally, the Wilcoxon test was used to investigate secondary outcomes, including within-group changes in unmet needs, the number of hospital days and crisis contacts during follow-up. The statistical significance level was set at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. The Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 17 for Windows, was used for all analyses.</p><p>The research question was to demonstrate differences between ACTE and TAU. In order to avoid overestimation, data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. This meant that patients who did not fully adhere to the protocol or patients who received the treatment from the group they were not allocated to, were kept in their original group for the analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Model fidelity</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that the ACTE team had a mean DACTS score of 3.6, meaning that the ACT model was implemented to a moderate degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The TAU teams had lower model fidelity scores (all 3 teams had a score of 2.4). ACTE scored high on the following components of ACT: the small and shared caseload, and time-unlimited services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. While ACTE had the maximum scores for the other components of ACT (community based services and assertive outreach), almost all TAU teams also scored high on these components. The ACTE and the TAU teams also had high scores on components such as explicit admission criteria, a team leader who participated in patient care, and responsibility for hospital admission. ACTE had low model fidelity on the following components: a vocational specialist and consumer provider in the team, the frequency of contact, the intensity of service, the intake rate, dual-disorders treatment groups, work with support system, and responsibility for crisis services.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Difference in DACTS score between ACTE and

As very few patients had been admitted or had had crisis contacts, these variables were not analyzed statistically.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major findings of this study were that ACTE succeeded better than TAU in engaging patients into care within 3&#x000a0;months, and was also able to prevent dropout from treatment (18.8% dropout in ACTE patients versus 50% in the TAU condition). Our results also demonstrated that ACTE did not produce better outcomes with respect to psychosocial functioning, unmet needs or mental health care use.</p><p>By showing better engagement but no effects on psychosocial functioning, these results are in line with studies on the effects of ACT in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Some studies explained the lack of added value of ACT due to the high quality of TAU teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or due to a lack of implementation of evidence based modules in ACT teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In their study, Killaspy et al. explained that better engagement in ACT was associated with a smaller caseload in ACT than in TAU, and with the team approach (shared caseload) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These characteristics were also present in our own ACTE condition. TAU was characterized by larger caseloads and individual case management. It may be that having a large caseload as well as individual case management both limit the possibilities for trying to make contact with difficult-to-engage patients and for preventing dropout.</p><p>Although there is no agreement on which critical components of ACT are associated with psychosocial outcomes in elderly patients, better outcomes in adults have been shown to be associated both with having a better team structure (shared caseload, daily team meetings, and a team leader who participated in patient care) and with having a consumer provider in the team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Both ACTE and TAU did not have a consumer in the team whereas also in both conditions the team leader participated in care, thereby limiting the differences between ACTE and TAU.</p><p>Various reasons are possible for the lack of differences with regard to outcome in psychosocial functioning. First, given the differences in the numbers of patients who dropped out of care, it is possible that patients who dropped out of TAU had worse psychosocial outcomes, which led to a selection bias in TAU. Second, ACTE may have caused selection bias by preventing the dropout of patients who had worse prognoses than the others. Third, TAU used components of ACT, so in some critical components of ACT differences between the intervention and control group were small. Also contact frequency in ACTE was low. Lack of integrated care and degree of contacts was associated with lack of differences found in effect studies in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Various studies have shown that ACT has the best results when it is implemented in full accordance with the original ACT model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, other studies showed no association with model fidelity and outcome in ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the present study, ACTE had moderate model fidelity: for example ACTE did not fully implement a consumer in their team and the contact frequency was low. Also ACTE did not include a psychologist in the team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This may have limited its effectiveness. Nevertheless it could be that, as in line with earlier mentioned studies, ACTE does not have added value in improving psychosocial outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strength of this study is that we managed to include difficult-to-engage patients with SMI in an RCT. To our knowledge this study is the first RCT that investigated the effectiveness of a special ACT team for elderly patients. One limitation is the low number of patients enrolled in this study and the high number of patients lost to follow-up, which meant that the power to detect changes was low (lack of power resulting in a type 2 error). Another limitation is the selection bias; the findings do not apply to all elderly patients with SMI since data were collected in one institution in an urban setting and most patients were, at baseline, difficult to engage. Furthermore it is possible that differences in psychosocial functioning between the intervention and control group were not detected because of measurement limitations. The sum score of the HoNOS65+ has been criticized for not properly measuring change in psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].
