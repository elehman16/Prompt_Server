</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Hydroxypropyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin-diclofenac (HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac) is an injectable formulation of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic effects that was first introduced in Europe more than 30&#x000a0;years ago and subsequently in the US in 1988 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Solubilization of diclofenac with HP&#x003b2;CD allows administration as a low-volume intravenous bolus that leads to rapid analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These properties are beneficial when treating patients with acute postoperative pain and several blinded, placebo-controlled phase III trials have demonstrated that intravenous HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac is well tolerated and efficacious when used in this setting, either alone or in combination with opioid analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Safety considerations relating to the use of NSAIDs include the potential for adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, bleeding, and renal events, which can limit the suitability of this class in at-risk groups such as older patients and those with pre-existing renal and/or hepatic insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Three previous pooled analyses of safety data from two phase III, parallel-group trials comparing HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac with placebo and ketorolac, another injectable NSAID, in patients with acute moderate-to-severe postoperative pain did not show a higher relative risk for bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], renal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] among patients receiving HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac or ketorolac compared with placebo. However, surgical procedures in older patients at increased risk of the AEs typically associated with the use of NSAIDs are becoming increasingly common and this has led to a commensurate increase in the use of postoperative analgesia in this population. This trend is unlikely to change and therefore it is important to more fully characterize the safety profile of specific analgesics in older postoperative patients in order to inform best practice, especially when considering the greater likelihood of comorbidities, co-medications, physical and/or cognitive impairments, and additional risk factors.</p><p id="Par9">Given the increasing importance of characterizing the safety of postoperative analgesia in older patients, the aim of the current analysis was to pool data from three pivotal phase III trials and investigate the safety of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac when treating acute moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in patients aged &#x02265;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par10">Data from three phase III trials of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac were pooled (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00448110, NCT00507026, and NCT00726388). The protocols for all three trials adhered to the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the Helsinki Declaration. Each of the three trials was approved by the appropriate institutional review board and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><p id="Par11">NCT00448110 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled trial that included a total of 331 patients aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years who experienced moderate-to-severe postoperative pain within 6&#x000a0;h after abdominal or pelvic surgery, and who were randomized 1:1:1:1 to HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac 18.75&#x000a0;mg, HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac 37.5&#x000a0;mg, ketorolac tromethamine 30&#x000a0;mg, or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first dose of study drug was administered within the first 6&#x000a0;h after surgery and then every 6&#x000a0;h until patient discharge or discontinuation/withdrawal from the trial. The median number of doses received across the treatment groups was 8 (range 1&#x02013;13). Overall, 14.8% of patients received study drug for 1&#x000a0;day, 80.6% for 2&#x000a0;days, and 4.5% for 3&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par12">NCT00507026 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled trial that included a total of 277 patients aged 18&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years who experienced moderate-to-severe postoperative pain within 6&#x000a0;h after elective orthopedic surgery, and who were randomized 2:1:1 to HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac, ketorolac tromethamine, or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Randomized patients were stratified according to anticipated length of stay (&#x02264;&#x000a0;24 versus &#x0003e;&#x000a0;24&#x000a0;h), as well as by risk, with dosages of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac in patients categorized as either &#x02018;non-high risk&#x02019;, &#x02018;high risk&#x02019;, or &#x02018;high weight&#x02019; (&#x02265;&#x000a0;95&#x000a0;kg and without other risk factors) being 37.5, 18.75, and 50&#x000a0;mg, respectively, and respective ketorolac dosages in the same three groups being 30, 15, and 30&#x000a0;mg, respectively.

Patients received multiple doses of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac 37.5&#x000a0;mg (for patients weighing &#x0003c;&#x000a0;95&#x000a0;kg, or weighing &#x02265;&#x000a0;95&#x000a0;kg and with more than one NSAID-related risk factor) or 50&#x000a0;mg (patients weighing &#x02265;&#x000a0;95&#x000a0;kg and with one or no NSAID-related risk factor) and administration was initiated in the immediate postoperative period as soon as the patient was stable following surgery and according to the study site&#x02019;s usual practice, and then every 6&#x000a0;h (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15 minutes) until the patient was completely transitioned to oral analgesics, discharged, discontinued, or had received treatment for 5&#x000a0;days. The median number of doses received across treatment groups was 2 (range 1&#x02013;5). Overall, 4.2% of patients received study drug for 1&#x000a0;day, 62.5% for 2&#x000a0;days, 22.7% for 3&#x000a0;days, and 10.6% for 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient Groups and Safety Outcomes</title><p id="Par14">Patients were stratified into three age groups: &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65, 65&#x02013;74, and &#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years due to the availability of data from a meaningful number of patients&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years of age and as an acknowledgment that many patients aged 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years have a standard of health that is appreciably different from that of the majority of patients &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years. General safety was assessed by physical examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs tests, and 12-lead ECG. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as those AEs that first occurred or worsened in severity during the course of the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug, and were recorded from baseline or screening through the follow-up periods of 30&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or 30&#x02013;37&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with TEAEs occurring at or after the first dose of study drug included in the analysis.

Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated for each of the three age groups by comparing incidences of TEAEs in patients receiving HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac with those in patients receiving placebo, adjusted by study.

There is greater concern regarding drug safety in this population due to the well established decline in many physiological functions associated with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This is especially true with regard to the use of anti-inflammatory drugs that can negatively affect renal and/or gastrointestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Understanding the risks associated with the use of specific analgesics in older patients, especially in the acute postoperative setting, is therefore critical for optimizing clinical outcomes and minimizing TEAEs.</p><p id="Par22">Previous statistical analyses have stratified data according to age &#x02265;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years in order to represent &#x02018;older patients&#x02019;. Given the increasing life expectancy and the availability of data from a meaningful number of patients &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years of age, this analysis stratified patients into groups of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65, 65&#x02013;74, and &#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years as an acknowledgment that many patients aged 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years have a standard of health that is appreciably different from that of the majority of patients &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years. Our analysis of pooled data from three pivotal trials of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac provides original data for patients aged 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years or &#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years and confirms the safety of postoperative HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac by demonstrating that the overall incidences of TEAEs in these two groups are similar to the incidence observed in patients &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years of age. Furthermore, the relative risks of patients treated with HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac experiencing TEAEs were similar among the three age groups for every relevant SOC category or preferred term for which they could be calculated, and were also similar to the relative risks associated with placebo.</p><p id="Par23">Previous analyses of safety data from two double-blind, parallel-group, phase III trials comparing the use of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac with placebo and ketorolac in adult patients with acute moderate-to-severe postoperative pain showed that the most frequent AEs reported in the active treatment arms were nausea, vomiting, flatulence, injection site pain/irritation, and constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A subsequent open-label, single-arm, phase III trial, which also included patients considered &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; due to being older, anticoagulated, and/or with renal insufficiency, reported that the most common TEAEs in the overall population were nausea, postoperative anemia, constipation, and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and anticoagulant drugs has previously been identified as a risk factor for clinically relevant bleeding-related AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but each of the three trials described above reported similar incidences in patients receiving or not receiving anticoagulant drugs. It should be noted, however, that these three trials involved relatively brief HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac treatment periods and caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of NSAIDs and anticoagulant drugs in the long term.</p><p id="Par24">None of the three pivotal trials mentioned above considered the age of the patients. The current analysis, which pooled patient data from all three trials and stratified them according to age, showed that the most frequent TEAEs in each of the age groups receiving HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac were gastrointestinal disorders (mainly nausea and constipation), postoperative anemia, and events relating to intravenous administration (injection site pain and pyrexia). Nausea was the most frequent TEAE reported in all three age groups and showed no age-related difference in incidence (range 32.2&#x02013;33.0%). It should be noted that postoperative nausea and vomiting are frequently reported following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the incidences of both were previously shown to be lower in patients treated with HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac or ketorolac compared with placebo (nausea 38.2% for placebo; 30.2 and 25.3% for HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac 18.75 and 37.5&#x000a0;mg, respectively; 26.8% for ketorolac 30&#x000a0;mg; and vomiting: 14.5% for placebo; 8.1 and 5.7% for HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac 18.75 and 37.5&#x000a0;mg, respectively; 8.5% for ketorolac 30&#x000a0;mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many of the differences in the incidences of specific TEAEs observed in the three age groups are likely to be heavily influenced by underlying physiologic differences between the groups at baseline, as well as by the different types of surgery that are most common in the different age groups. For example, the increasing incidence of constipation across the three age groups may be anticipated due to the greater prevalence of the condition in older individuals in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while the increasing incidence of anemia and postoperative anemia across the groups is likely due to significant, age-related differences in baseline hematology parameters (e.g., hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, and platelets all decreased with age in the cohort analyzed). Likewise, the increasing incidence of renal TEAEs across the age groups may be expected due to the higher prevalence of mild renal impairment in the two older age groups at baseline and because of the greater risk of acute kidney injury in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The age-stratified data from the current analysis support and expand upon the observations reported in the three previous pooled analyses of bleeding, renal, and cardiovascular AEs in the two double-blind trials of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac by also including a large number of patients from the open-label trial, which included large numbers of at-risk patients in an attempt to more accurately reflect real-world practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The current analysis found that the relative risks of bleeding AEs, compared with placebo, in patients receiving HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac and aged 65&#x02013;74 or &#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years were similar to the risk in those aged &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years, and the risks in all three age groups were not significantly different from placebo. The incidence of postoperative anemia increased with increasing age but, as stated above, this is likely due to baseline differences between the age groups. There were no cases of anemia considered related to HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac treatment reported in the open-label, single-arm trial that included at-risk patients, and which contributed the majority of patients included in the current analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Comparison of the relative risks of renal and urinary AEs in the current analysis was confounded by a lack of incidence of these events in the placebo group for the two older age groups, but the overall incidence in this SOC category was low and the &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65-years group showed a relative risk similar to placebo.</p><p id="Par26">A limitation of this post hoc analysis is the pooling of data from clinical trials with different designs, which was necessary in order to achieve sample sizes for the two older age groups that would support meaningful analysis and interpretation. Due to their lower frequency in the general and surgical populations, the &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75-years group contained fewer patients than the two younger age groups (129 patients compared with 878 in the &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65-years group and 282 in the 65&#x02013;74-years group) and therefore the findings presented should be interpreted with an understanding of this limitation. We did not analyze patient data stratified according to the type of procedure that each patient underwent due to the small numbers of patients present in some of the groups following stratification: for example, there were only 38 and 10 patients in the 65&#x02013;74 and &#x02265;&#x000a0;75-years groups, respectively, who underwent abdominal/pelvic procedures. We cannot rule out that the type of procedure a patient has undergone could influence the risk and frequency of some TEAEs occurring after the administration of postoperative HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac. The three age groups also displayed some significant baseline differences with regard to clinical laboratory parameters and these represent a potential source of bias in the analysis because we chose not to control for these parameters. Likewise, the analysis was not adjusted with regard to the patients&#x02019; prior medication history and this may represent another source of bias. We chose not to adjust the analysis for baseline differences in clinical laboratory results and prior medication history because these variables reflect the nature of the different age groups investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">The findings from the current analysis demonstrate that the use of HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac for the treatment of acute postoperative pain is as well tolerated by older patients as it is by younger patients, with the overall incidence of TEAEs in patients aged 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years or &#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years being similar to the incidence in those aged &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years. Furthermore, all three age groups treated with HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac displayed similar relative risks for the most common TEAEs, which were also similar for patients treated with placebo. The nature of the TEAEs experienced by the three age groups showed differences, such as higher incidences of constipation, postoperative anemia, and hypotension in the older age groups, all of which may be anticipated due to age-related differences in susceptibility and the types of surgery most commonly performed in the different age groups.</p><p id="Par28">Similar to all intravenous NSAIDs, HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac should be used with caution in older postoperative patients due to advanced age being an independent risk factor for postoperative acute renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Data from the current study reinforces the need for this caution because we found a significantly greater incidence of acute renal failure in those aged &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75 years (3.9%) than was observed in those aged &#x0003c;&#x000a0;65 years (0.1%) or 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years (0.4%). It should also be noted that the large open-label trial that contributed the majority of the patient data included in this pooled analysis reported that patients with mild renal impairment prior to surgery (as determined by serum creatinine levels) displayed a significantly greater incidence of key renal-related TEAEs compared with those without renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A higher incidence of acute renal failure was also observed in patients undergoing procedures &#x02265;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;h in duration compared with those undergoing procedures lasting &#x0003c;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These data suggest that caution regarding potential renal-related TEAEs is warranted when considering the use of postoperative HP&#x003b2;CD-diclofenac to treat acute moderate-to-severe pain in patients &#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years of age, or those with pre-existing renal impairment, or those who had a procedure lasting &#x02265;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;h in duration.
