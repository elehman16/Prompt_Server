A more recent study reports the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in 6.3% (95% confidence interval 3.4&#x02013;10.5) of unselected patients managed with cast immobilisation after an Achilles tendon injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This is considerably higher than the estimates for &#x02018;off-prophylaxis&#x02019; hip and knee arthroplasty for symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (1.8%), and pulmonary embolism (1%) estimated by the American College of Chest Physicians.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The main risk of prolonged medication-related prophylaxis, with low-molecular weight heparin, aspirin, an oral thrombin inhibitor, or Factor Xa inhibitor; in relation to venous thromboembolism during lower limb immobilisation, is bleeding.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Intermittent pneumatic compression is an alternative form of prophylaxis that is not associated with increased bleeding risk. It is currently recommended for orthopaedic inpatients either in conjunction with medication-related prophylaxis, or where this is contra-indicated or refused.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The use of intermittent pneumatic compression as a method for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis when cast immobilisation is used for lower leg injuries requires further investigation. It is not known if the performance of an intermittent pneumatic compression device is adversely affected by being placed within a lower limb cast.</p><p>This study examines whether the performance of the VenaJet Jet Impulse Technology using the VenaJet pump and VenaJet undercast pads (specifically designed for use in lower limb immobilisation) is impaired by placement within a lower leg fibreglass cast in healthy volunteers. The Jet Impulse Technology system comprises an in-cast pad that can be placed under a fibreglass or plaster cast and is attached to a pump. The pump mechanism mimics the natural full weight-bearing walking process, rapidly inflating a distal air-cell in the foot cuff to 130&#x02009;mmHg, which then settles to 52&#x02009;mmHg, followed by a proximal air-cell 0.3&#x02009;s later, settling to 48&#x02009;mmHg. After 6&#x02009;s of compression at 48&#x02013;52&#x02009;mmHg, both air-cells deflate. This cycle is repeated every minute.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-2054270416681746"><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, 24 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 65&#x02009;y were recruited after attending a screening visit at the research office for review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and provision of informed consent. Potential participants were excluded if they had a history of previous or current deep vein thrombosis, were pregnant, or had clinical features of peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, scleroderma, lymphoedema, or joint deformity from inflammatory arthritis. Participants who met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were given appointments to attend a second visit for the study procedures.</p><p>At the second visit, each participant was initially seated quietly for 10&#x02009;min on the edge of an examination couch with both legs hanging dependent, as they would normally be seated to have their lower limb placed in an equinus lower limb cast. Baseline popliteal venous flow was measured at this time. Participants then had the Jet Impulse Technology systems (Vena Jet, Germany) placed on BOTH feet and were randomised to have either their left or right leg placed in a fibreglass below-knee equinus cast which also encased the Jet Impulse Technology system on that limb. Initially, we intended that participants would remain in the initial position for the remainder of the study, but baseline popliteal venous flow measures were found to be very slow, and static in one participant, so participants were moved onto seats where they could rest at least part of their feet on the ground with the angle between the thigh and the lower leg at 120&#x000b0;. Participants were asked to sit forward enough on the chair that measurements with duplex ultrasonography could be performed without participants needing to move for the remainder of the study. Popliteal venous flow in this sitting position was re-measured 40&#x02009;min after the randomised lower limb was placed in a cast. Then, 50&#x02009;min after the limb was placed in a cast the Jet Impulse Technology systems on both legs were activated to inflate to 130&#x02009;mmHg every minute using the Vena Jet pump (VADOplex, Germany). After 60&#x02009;min, 10&#x02009;min after Jet Impulse Technology activation, popliteal venous flow was measured again and then the cast and Jet Impulse Technology devices were removed.</p><p>Imaging used a broadband linear ultrasound transducer (Philips IU22, Royal Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) capable of both colour and pulsed Doppler. With a bandwidth of 3&#x02013;9&#x02009;MHz, pulsed Doppler imaging was acquired with a frequency of 3.5&#x02009;MHz. The incident pulsed Doppler was beam steered to ensure a Doppler angle of less than 60&#x000b0; to reduce errors in velocity calculation. The pulsed Doppler wall filter was reduced to capture low-velocity flow. The sample volume was adjusted to encompass the entire diameter of the vein under investigation. Using triplex mode (live B-mode, colour, and pulsed Doppler), the popliteal vein was sampled for flow. Auto-calculation measurements were made over a 2-s interval with phase being predominantly towards the heart. Cine-loop review allowed for vein diameter measurement (used to calculate volume flow) with good temporal resolution. Two sonographers were involved in the study, each measuring 12 participants in total. All measures of popliteal vein flow at each time point were undertaken twice in each limb, with the left limb measured first, and the mean of both measurements used in statistical analysis.</p><p>The primary outcome variable was the difference in peak systolic velocity (cm/s), in the popliteal vein between the casted limb and the non-casted limb after 60&#x02009;min, at which time the Jet Impulse Technology system had been running for 10&#x02009;min. Secondary outcome variables were the difference in peak systolic velocity between the casted limb and the non-casted limb at baseline and 40&#x02009;min after casting, and the difference in mean flow velocity (cm/s), vein diameter (mm), and total volume flow (L/min) between the casted limb and the non-casted limb at baseline, 40&#x02009;min after casting and at 60&#x02009;min.</p><p>The sample size was designed to rule out a paired difference in peak systolic flow of less than 4.8&#x02009;cm/s. This non-inferiority bound is based on a past haemodynamic study where the mean maximum peak systolic velocity achieved with an intermittent pneumatic compression outside of a fibreglass cast was 20.1&#x02009;cm/s with a paired standard deviation for peak systolic velocity of 6.8&#x02009;cm/s.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The chosen non-inferiority bound of 4.8&#x02009;cm/s is 25% of the mean maximum peak systolic velocity found in the past study. A sample size of 24 has 90% power with an alpha of 5% to rule out the nominated non-inferiority bound.</p><p>Participants were randomised to have a cast on one or other leg using a computer random-number based schedule developed by a biostatistician. The randomisation schedule was provided directly to a non-investigator, who prepared opaque envelopes for each study participant. The envelopes were opened by each participant immediately prior to the placement of the Jet Impulse Technology systems and equinus cast.</p><p>The analysis used a mixed linear model to estimate the overall difference between the Jet Impulse Technology system within a cast and on the other leg, as the control intervention. The baseline measurement is used as a continuous covariate, and the order of treatment, randomised leg, and sonographer as the other fixed effects, and the individual participants as random effects, to account for the paired design.</p><sec id="sec3-2054270416681746"><title>SAS version 9.3 was used for statistical analysis</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee, ref 14/STH/82 20394, dated 3 July 2014 and the trial was prospectively registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ANZCTR 12614000730606.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec4-2054270416681746"><title>Results</title><p>The flow of participants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2054270416681746">Figure 1</xref>.

There was no statistically significant difference between the primary outcome of the peak systolic velocity measured in the Jet Impulse Technology system in legs with and without the cast after it was operating for 10&#x02009;min, although the confidence interval for the Jet Impulse Technology system peak systolic velocity difference (&#x02212;6.5 to 4.9&#x02009;cm/s) just included the non-inferiority bound of 4.8. The lack of statistical power to exclude non-inferiority of the system within the cast was because the standard deviation of the measurements was double that anticipated based on our past research; 12.1&#x02009;cm/s compared to the anticipated standard deviation of 6.8&#x02009;cm/s. The peak systolic velocity of 28.8&#x02009;cm/s measured in the leg with the cast and the Jet Impulse Technology system represents a large (sixfold) change from baseline.</p><p>A number of methodological issues are relevant to the interpretation of the study findings. Venous haemodynamics were measured by Doppler ultrasound which is a non-invasive method of measuring lower limb blood flow that is sensitive, specific, and reproducible.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Peak systolic velocity was chosen as the primary outcome variable because it is the most consistent non-artefactual wave form detected by ultrasound.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Although it is known that the right and left legs have similar venous haemodynamics with research participants,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> we randomised participants to have the Jet Impulse Technology system placed on either the right or left leg to avoid any possibility of bias related to selection of the leg for casting, such as perceived discomfort which could be indirectly related to venous blood flow. Although it was not possible to blind the sonographers to the intervention allocation we feel this is unlikely to have resulted in biased assessment of blood flow.</p><p>The original research protocol was that all participants remained in the baseline position, with feet hanging dependent off the edge of the examination couch, for the duration of the study. This would have allowed the ultrasonographer access to the popliteal vein, and placement of the equinus cast without having to move participants during the study. Unexpectedly, there was very poor blood flow in this position, which in fact resulted in withdrawal of one participant. We therefore modified the protocol so that all participants were moved onto chairs so their feet could rest on the floor in order to relieve some of the compression of the femoral vein at the adductor hiatus. While every effort was made to ensure that the participants remained as still as possible after being moved from their baseline position, it cannot be guaranteed that this was achieved at all times. This may have resulted in the unexpectedly large standard deviation seen in the study. This improves the generalisability of the study however as patients with injuries who are immobilised with a lower limb cast are unlikely to remain in a seated position without moving for prolonged periods of time.</p><p>We chose to investigate the Jet Impulse Technology system in this trial as it is designed to be used within an already existing lower limb immobilisation system, and it delivers an inflation pressure (130&#x02009;mmHg) consistent with those delivered by foot intermittent pneumatic compression devices.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> While this pressure is at the lower end of the spectrum of previously studied foot intermittent pneumatic compression devices, this is likely to make the Jet Impulse Technology system more tolerable when confined within a lower limb cast for between six and eight weeks. Past research also shows limited increases in peak systolic velocity with increasing pressures delivered by foot intermittent pneumatic compression devices outside of a lower limb cast, so a higher pressure system may have produced little further clinical benefit.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2054270416681746" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Use of a calf or calf and foot intermittent pneumatic compression within a cast is likely to be technically difficult and result in cast integrity issues over time.</p><p>The study was of 60&#x02009;min duration, insufficient to measure any effect of the Jet Impulse Technology system on the integrity of the cast over a protracted period of time. Now that we have shown the Jet Impulse Technology system works at initial casting, further studies are indicated to assess the longer term effects and tolerability of constant Jet Impulse Technology activation within a lower limb cast over periods of time reflective of those between orthopaedic outpatient visits.</p><p>While we have shown that peak systolic velocity is significantly increased by using the Jet Impulse Technology system within a cast, consideration needs to be given to those issues that might limit its use in the clinical setting. These include skin and cast integrity, patient adherence to treatment, other aspects of tolerability, and cost. These concerns may provide the focus of a future feasibility study assessing the longer term use of the Jet Impulse Technology system within lower limb casts.</p><p>This study shows that in a sample of healthy volunteers with their leg placed in a below-knee fibreglass cast, the Jet Impulse Technology system substantially increases peak systolic velocity in the popliteal vein, and this is similar to the peak systolic velocity of the same system outside of a lower limb cast. Further studies are indicated to address other issues such as skin and cast integrity with prolonged use, patient tolerability and adherence to treatment in a clinical sample of patients with injuries requiring prolonged lower limb immobilisation.
