Vital signs should be checked before and after each dose. A complete blood count is recommended before each dose, with blood chemistries (including electrolyte and creatinine levels) monitored at a minimum on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. The dose of bortezomib should be reduced or held immediately upon development of painful neuropathy, as described in the product monograph; dose modification may also be required for peripheral sensory neuropathy without pain or for other toxicities. Most toxicities are reversible if dose modification guidelines are followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Response to Treatment</title><p>Responses are usually apparent by 6 weeks (2 cycles). For patients achieving complete remission (determined by negative electrophoresis and immunofixation), bortezomib should be given for 2 additional cycles beyond the date of confirmed complete remission. In patients with progressive disease after 2 cycles or stable disease after 4 cycles, dexamethasone added to the bortezomib regimen (20 mg by mouth the day of and the day after each bortezomib dose) may produce an objective response. Bortezomib (with or without dexamethasone) should be continued in patients showing benefit from therapy (excluding those in complete remission) unless disease progression or significant toxicity is observed. Therapy should be discontinued in patients who do not respond to bortezomib alone if disease progression is seen within 2 cycles of the addition of dexamethasone.</p><p>The Hematology <sc>dsg</sc> recognizes that thalidomide is an active agent in multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation or who are refractory to alkylating agent&#x02013;based chemotherapy.

CHOICE OF TOPIC AND RATIONALE</title><p>Multiple myeloma is characterized by a malignant proliferation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow; these cells typically produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin molecule that can be detected in serum or urine. Common manifestations include fatigue, anemia, and bone damage related to osteopenia or lytic bone lesions, or both. The bone pain, pathologic fractures, or in some cases, spinal cord compression that result from the bone damage lead to substantial morbidity. Renal failure, frequent infections, and hypercalcemia also occur in a significant proportion of patients.</p><p>Treatment of myeloma can reduce the levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins and can lead to symptomatic benefit and to delay or improvement in end-organ complications. Practice Guideline Report No. 6&#x02013;6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co13_5p160">1</xref> from the Program in Evidence-based Care (<sc>pebc</sc>) of Cancer Care Ontario summarizes the role of chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation in myeloma.</p><p>Patients 65&#x02013;70 years of age and younger are generally treated with several cycles of high-dose dexamethasone-based induction therapy such as <sc>vad</sc> (vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) followed by stem-cell collection and autologous stem-cell transplantation (<sc>asct</sc>). In this patient group, <sc>asct</sc> represents the current standard of care. It has demonstrated higher remission rates (including about 20%&#x02013;30% complete remissions) and better progression-free survival (<sc>pfs</sc>) and overall survival rates than has conventional chemotherapy alone.</p><p>Older patients generally receive less-aggressive therapy with oral regimens such as melphalan and prednisone. Partial remissions are seen in approximately 50% of cases, but complete remissions are rare.</p><p>Whatever the treatment approach, virtually all myeloma patients eventually relapse and require further therapy. Options for the management of recurrent myeloma include reinstitution of the initial treatment (if the original response duration was prolonged), alternative alkylating agent therapy with oral cyclophosphamide plus prednisone, high-dose dexamethasone, or thalidomide alone or in combination with corticosteroids. Therapeutic options become progressively limited as the disease progresses. At the present time, the disease is not considered curable, and overall survival rates average 3&#x02013;5 years.</p><p>Over the last few years, a better understanding of the biology of myeloma cells and of the relationship between the tumour cells and the bone marrow microenvironment has stimulated efforts to develop other novel agents in this disease. Bortezomib [Velcade (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.), PS-341], a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, is the best studied of the next generation of anti-myeloma drugs.</p><p>Bortezomib blocks the action of the 29S proteasome, a multicatalytic enzyme that has been nicknamed the &#x0201c;housekeeper&#x0201d; of the cell because of its role in degrading abnormal or misfolded proteins targeted for destruction, particularly those involved in cell cycling and gene transcription. Clinical evidence suggesting that bortezomib is active in myeloma and lymphoma has begun to emerge. For this reason, the Hematology Disease Site Group (<sc>dsg</sc>) determined that, to guide appropriate use of this agent, a systematic review assessing the currently available evidence was a high priority.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>3. METHODS</title><sec><title>3.1 Guideline Development</title><p>The present systematic review is a convenient and up-to-date source of the best available evidence on bortezomib in multiple myeloma and lymphoma.

DISCUSSION</title><p>The standard first-line therapy for myeloma was established through a series of large randomized trials. That topic is addressed in the <sc>pebc</sc> Practice Guideline No. 6&#x02013;6, &#x0201c;Optimal Therapy for Patients Diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma and the Role of High-Dose Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Support&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co13_5p160">1</xref>. For patients with advanced-stage myeloma and good performance status, <sc>asct</sc> is recommended as first-line therapy. For patients not eligible for <sc>asct</sc>, oral alkylating agent&#x02013;based chemotherapy with regimens such as melphalan, or prednisone and cyclophosphamide, represent the standard of care. Neither approach is curative, but both are associated with moderate-to-high rates of remission, effective palliation of symptoms, and acceptable toxicity profiles.</p><p>Bortezomib has not been compared with standard treatment options in <sc>rct</sc>s of first-line treatments. Until evidence of its superiority to currently available treatment options becomes available, the Hematology <sc>dsg</sc> does not recommend that bortezomib be used as first-line therapy outside the setting of a clinical trial.</p><p>The optimal therapy for patients beyond first-line therapy is not well established. Available options include additional alkylating agent&#x02013;based chemotherapy or regimens of high-dose dexamethasone, thalidomide, or (more recently) bortezomib. Of these options, only bortezomib has been tested in <sc>rct</sc>s involving relapsed patients.</p><p>Alkylating agents (for example, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, prednisone) as second-line therapy may produce successful re-induction in cases of relapsed myeloma. Where relapse occurs following the use of alkylating agents as first-line therapy, additional therapy with alkylating agents may effectively palliate symptoms and induce remissions, while offering the advantage of convenient oral administration and a relatively favourable toxicity profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-co13_5p160">23</xref>. Fewer data are available on the use of alkylating agents for relapse following <sc>asct</sc> or high-dose therapy. A reasonable expectation is that toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, would be greater in this setting, given the limited marrow reserve following transplantation.</p><p>High-dose oral dexamethasone alone has modest activity in relapsed and refractory myeloma, and it is an appropriate comparator for tests of new agents or regimens either as a single agent or in combination with vincristine and adriamycin in the <sc>vad</sc> regimen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-co13_5p160">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co13_5p160">25</xref>. Because of a lack of myelosuppression, this regimen is commonly used in patients with compromised bone marrow reserves. Although <sc>vad</sc> has not been compared to high-dose dexamethasone alone in randomized trials, it is generally believed to be modestly more effective&#x02014;but at the cost of increased toxicity and inconvenience. The <sc>vad</sc> regimen must be administered intravenously through a central venous catheter and is associated with myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>Thalidomide is also an active agent in relapsed and refractory myeloma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-co13_5p160">26</xref>. Data from uncontrolled trials show a response rate of 30%&#x02013;40%, with a proportion of patients remaining disease-free for a prolonged period. The addition of corticosteroids appears to improve the response rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-co13_5p160">27</xref>.</p><p>Thalidomide is administered orally and is not associated with myelosuppression, but it does have significant toxicities, particularly neurotoxicity, that may cause discontinuation of therapy in some patients. Thalidomide is also highly teratogenic. Thalidomide has not been compared with other agents in randomized trials in relapsed or refractory patients. It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under a special program to safeguard against birth defects. However, it has not been approved by the Canadian Health Protection Branch and is therefore not widely available in Canada.</p><p>In patients with relapsed myeloma, the <sc>dsg</sc> emphasized the importance of sensitivity to alkylating agents in defining the optimal therapeutic regimen. Patients who remain sensitive to alkylating agents may be effectively re-treated with alkylators. No consensus definition for alkylator sensitivity exists, but the <sc>dsg</sc> thought that the commonly used relapse threshold of 1 year or more after alkylating agent&#x02013;based chemotherapy was a reasonable definition. No other regimen has been compared to re-treatment with alkylating agents in this group of patients.</p><p>In view of the favourable toxicity profile and greater ease of administration of alkylating agent&#x02013;based regimens, the <sc>dsg</sc> recommends treatment or re-treatment with alkylating agent chemotherapy for patients with relapsed myeloma whose disease is sensitive to alkylating agents, including patients whose first-line treatment was <sc>asct</sc> or high-dose therapy and who are candidates for further chemotherapy. The oral regimen of weekly cyclophosphamide (250&#x02013;300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, usually 500 mg) and every-second-day prednisone (50&#x02013;100 mg) is commonly used and produces less cumulative myelosuppression than does the combination of melphalan and prednisone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-co13_5p160">28</xref>. Thalidomide-based therapy is also an option under these circumstances.</p><p>For patients with myeloma refractory to first-line treatment (that is, with relapse occurring within 1 year of treatment) who are candidates for chemotherapy, the use or reuse of alkylating agents is not a reasonable option. Treatment options under these circumstances include high-dose dexamethasone, thalidomide, and bortezomib. When compared with high-dose dexamethasone in the <sc>apex</sc> trial, bortezomib was associated with a 14% improvement in 1-year survival without increased severe toxicity. The <sc>dsg</sc> considers this difference to be important. Although thalidomide has demonstrated activity in this population of patients in uncontrolled studies, it has not been compared to either bortezomib or dexamethasone. For this reason, the <sc>dsg</sc> considers that bortezomib is the preferred treatment option for this group of patients.</p><p>The place of bortezomib in the management of lymphoma and Waldenstr&#x000f6;m macroglobulinemia was also considered. Only preliminary results from small studies are available for these cancers. Until such time as more mature data are available, the <sc>dsg</sc> does not recommend that bortezomib be used in patients with these diagnoses outside of clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>6.
