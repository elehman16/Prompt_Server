Peak HIV specific humoral and cellular responses were measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>184 participants were enrolled: 52% were female, all were Black/African, median age was 23 years (range, 18&#x02013;42 years) and 79% completed all vaccinations. 159 participants reported at least one adverse event, 92.5% were mild or moderate. Five, unrelated, serious adverse events were reported. The M/M/P/P and D/D/MP/MP regimens induced the strongest peak neutralizing and binding antibody responses and the greatest CD4+ T-cell responses to Env. All peak neutralizing and binding antibody responses decayed with time. The MVA, but not DNA, prime contributed to the humoral and cellular immune responses. The D/D/M/M regimen was poorly immunogenic overall but did induce modest CD4+ T-cell responses to Gag and Pol. CD8+ T-cell responses to any antigen were low for all regimens.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The SAAVI DNA-C2, SAAVI MVA-C and Novartis gp140 with MF59 adjuvant in various combinations were safe and induced neutralizing and binding antibodies and cellular immune responses. Sequential immunization with gp140 boosted immune responses primed by MVA or DNA. The best overall immune responses were seen with the M/M/P/P regimen.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01418235">NCT01418235</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI068614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corey</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI068635</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Peter B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI068618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomaras</surname><given-names>Georgia D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barnett</surname><given-names>Susan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation (NRF)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williamson</surname><given-names>Anna-Lise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI)/ South African Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchyard</surname><given-names>Gavin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI069469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchyard</surname><given-names>Gavin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI069453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Glenda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award009"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI069519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bekker</surname><given-names>Linda-Gail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>) (U.S. Public Health Service Grants UM1 AI068614 [LOC: HIV Vaccine Trials Network], UM1 AI068635 [HVTN SDMC FHCRC], UM1 AI068618 [HVTN Laboratory Center FHCRC, Duke], UM1 AI069469 [Klerksdorp Clinical Research Site], UM1 AI069453 [Soweto-Bara Clinical Research Site] and UM1 AI069519 [Cape Town Clinical Research Site].

Dunnett&#x02019;s procedure using two-sample t-statistics with common variance across the study arms was applied with overall 2-sided alpha = 0.05 to determine which of the 4 vaccine groups had a significantly higher mean AUC-MB than the pooled placebo group, using Liu&#x02019;s (1997) formula.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] This procedure was applied to construct 95% simultaneous confidence intervals (CIs) about the 4 differences in mean AUC-MBs for each vaccine group versus placebo (vaccine&#x02013;placebo), which determines which vaccine arms have familywise-error rate adjusted 2-sided p-value &#x0003c; 0.05. In addition, an F-test was used for assessing any differences in mean AUC-MBs among the 4 vaccine groups, which assumes normally distributed outcomes and a common variance across the study arms. Then, the 6 pairwise vaccine group differences in mean AUC-MBs were estimated with pointwise and simultaneous 95% CIs (computed using t-statistics and Tukey&#x02019;s procedure), and Holm-Bonferroni adjusted p-values from unequal-variance t-tests were used for testing different mean AUC-MBs between vaccine arms accounting for the six pairs of vaccine arm comparisons. Comparisons were first done for each vaccine arm versus placebo to answer whether there are any vaccine-induced responses to HIV, and secondly done among vaccine arms to answer whether responses differ among the vaccine regimens.</p><p>The neutralization positive response rate was compared between each vaccine group with unadjusted and Holm-Bonferroni adjusted Fisher&#x02019;s exact test together with unadjusted and simultaneous 95% Wilson confidence intervals. Then, a Chi-squared test was used to test for any differences in response rate among the 4 vaccine groups, and the Fisher&#x02019;s and Wilson procedures were applied to compare response rates among the 6 pairs of vaccine groups. To assess magnitudes among positive responders, the above procedures were repeated with t-test based 95% confidence intervals (difference in sample means plus or minus the t-distribution critical value multiplied by s, where s is the square-root of s1<sup>2</sup>/n1 + s2<sup>2</sup>/n2, with s1 and s2 the sample standard deviations for the two groups being compared. In addition, the Kruskal-Wallis procedure was used for testing any differences among the 4 vaccine groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>HIV-specific binding antibody</title><p>The same statistical procedures as described for neutralizing antibodies were used to compare IgG antibodies among groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Intracellular cytokine staining</title><p>Positivity for a peptide pool was based on a one-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact test comparing the percentage of T cells with positive staining for IFN-&#x003b3; and/or IL-2 between the experimental and negative control wells, with a discrete Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment for the 9 peptide pools. If the adjusted p-value for a peptide pool is &#x02264;0.00001, the response to the peptide pool for the T-cell subset is considered positive. If any peptide pool for a T-cell subset was positive then the overall response was considered positive. The protein-specific magnitude of response was the maximum for the protein-specific pools, with the overall magnitude being the sum of the protein magnitudes.</p><p>The polyfunctionality of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was assessed by measuring the proportion of T-cells expressing the following functional markers alone or in various combinations: IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1;, CD40L, granzyme B. Cells expressing granzyme B alone without another function were excluded, since granzyme B is constitutively expressed, even in T cells that are not induced to express functional markers in the assay.

Strong binding antibody responses to Env were produced by all vaccine regimens containing a protein boost (M/M/P/P, MP/MP, D/D/MP/MP). The CD4+ T-cell responses were greatest to Env with the sequential protein boost regimens (M/M/P/P, D/D/MP/MP).

CD8+ T-cell responses to any antigen were low for all regimens. These results confirm the importance of sequential protein boosting to achieve maximum antibody titers and demonstrate that the MVA vector was superior to the DNA vector for priming Env-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses. We note that the neutralizing activity was limited to viruses that exhibit a highly sensitive Tier 1 neutralization phenotype and was not seen with viruses that exhibit a less sensitive Tier 2 phenotype that is more typical of circulating strains. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody responses waned even with high prevalence and magnitude of CD4+ T-cell responses to HIV Env.</p></sec><sec id="sec046"><title>Sequential versus concomitant administration of protein</title><p>The RV144 regimen used a strategy of ALVAC prime, and combination ALVAC: protein boost, which induced binding antibody responses to gp120 in &#x0003e;98% of participants at 6.5 months after the last vaccination.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, the RV144 follow on study (RV305) showed that a protein boost administered 6&#x02013;8 years later, with or without ALVAC, induced strong IgG binding antibody responses.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In a phase 1 trial (HVTN 073/SAAVI 102) using the same DNA and MVA used in this trial, the DNA prime (3 doses)/MVA boost (2 doses) did not induce any neutralizing antibodies and induced low levels of binding antibodies. In a follow on study (HVTN 073E/SAAVI 102E), the same protein used in our study was administered approximately two years after the last MVA vaccine, which induced large binding and neutralizing antibody responses.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] In our study, protein given sequentially with an MVA prime induced stronger peak neutralizing and binding antibody responses than if given concomitantly with MVA, and decayed more slowly. Including protein in a DNA or poxvirus vector based vaccine regimen is important for inducing strong neutralizing and binding antibody and CD4 T-cell responses. Administering protein sequentially as a boost to induce greater frequency and magnitude of neutralizing antibody immune responses may be preferable to administering protein concurrently with the MVA prime in order to induce earlier, but lower frequency and magnitude of peak neutralizing antibody responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec047"><title>DNA prime</title><p>DNA prime, protein boost regimens have been shown to induce better and more durable humoral and cellular immune responses, in pre-clinical studies and in human trials, than either DNA or protein alone.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

A limitation of this study was that the hypervariable region (V2 loop) of the TV-1 HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 120 (TV1gp140&#x00394;V2) was deleted in order to expose conserved regions of the Env involved in viral entry and increase susceptibility to virus neutralization.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This rationale was supported by the induction of neutralising antibody responses when used in DNA primed rabbits and macaques.[<xref rid="pone.0161753.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] As V2 was deleted from the gp140 protein boost, we did not expect to detect strong V1V2 binding antibody responses. The low level V1V2 binding antibody responses observed (data not shown) were probably induced by the V1V2 contained within the DNA-C2 and MVA-C vaccines. In our trial minimal to moderate IgA responses that were not durable were observed. Further studies using the MVA prime vaccine utilized in this study in combination with a subsequent sequential boost of a recombinant protein containing the V1/V2 region of gp120 would be warranted, especially if V1V2 and IgA responses to gp120 continue to emerge as important correlates of vaccine efficacy in future vaccine trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec050"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Sequential protein boosting induced strong peak neutralizing and binding antibody responses that decayed with time. The MVA/protein prime/boost regimen induced the strongest neutralising antibody and T cell responses. The DNA prime did not contribute substantially to the immune responses. A SAAVI MVA-C based regimen with a protein (likely including the V2 loop) boost should be evaluated in further clinical trials leading to potential efficacy studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec051"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161753.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>HVTN 086/SAAVI 103 CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161753.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161753.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>HVTN 086/SAAVI 103 Protocol, Version 2.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161753.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161753.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>HVTN 086/SAAVI 103 Protocol, Version 3.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161753.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the study participants and the clinical research site staff for their contribution to the successful conduct of this study.
