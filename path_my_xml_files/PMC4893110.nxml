All patients were required to have had prior treatment with conventional DMARDs and/or biologics; tumour necrosis factor inhibitor efficacy failures were limited to &#x02264;10% of randomised patients. Patients were also required to have active skin disease with &#x02265;one plaque psoriasis skin lesion &#x02265;2&#x02005;cm in size.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had prior therapeutic failure of &#x0003e;three DMARDs or &#x0003e;one tumour necrosis factor blocker; history of or current rheumatic disease or autoimmune joint disease other than PsA or functional class IV status as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification of Functional Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis; erythrodermic, guttate or generalised pustular psoriasis; malignancy (except treated basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma or early forms of cervical carcinoma with no recurrence in 5&#x02005;years); prior treatment with apremilast; or phototherapy (ultraviolet B, psoralen+ultraviolet A) or immunosuppressive systemic therapy (except as noted) within 4&#x02005;weeks, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, or tocilizumab within 12&#x02005;weeks, or alefacept or ustekinumab within 24&#x02005;weeks of randomisation. Patients with active tuberculosis, history of incompletely treated tuberculosis or significant infection within 4&#x02005;weeks of screening were excluded. No purified protein derivative or QuantiFERON screening for latent tuberculosis was required. There was no protocol requirement to interrupt study medication for patients who developed infection during the study, and no protocol prohibition on vaccinations.</p><p>Patients taking concurrent DMARDs could continue stable doses (&#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks before baseline) of methotrexate (&#x02264;25&#x02005;mg/week), leflunomide (&#x02264;20&#x02005;mg/day), sulfasalazine (&#x02264;2&#x02005;g/day), or combination. One DMARD dose reduction was allowed after week 24. Stable doses of oral corticosteroids (prednisone &#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day or equivalent for &#x02265;4 weeks before baseline) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for &#x02265;2&#x02005;weeks before baseline) were permitted.

Patients were stratified by baseline DMARD use (yes/no) and psoriasis involvement of the body surface area (BSA; &#x0003c;3%/&#x02265;3%). Apremilast was dose-titrated over the 1st week of treatment (10&#x02005;mg on day 1, with increases of 10&#x02005;mg/day until the target dose was reached). Patients whose swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) had not improved by &#x02265;20% at week 16 were considered non-responders and were then randomised (1:1) to apremilast 20&#x02005;mg twice daily or 30&#x02005;mg twice daily if initially randomised to placebo, or continued on their initial apremilast dose. At week 24, all remaining placebo patients were then randomised to apremilast 20&#x02005;mg twice daily or 30&#x02005;mg twice daily.

Because the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to psoriasis and PsA are closely tied, and most patients with PsA have coexistent psoriasis, it is important that agents used to treat PsA also demonstrate efficacy in improving psoriasis skin lesions. Patients enrolled in PALACE 3 had active PsA as well as active skin disease. This study demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect of apremilast 20&#x02005;mg twice daily and 30&#x02005;mg twice daily on disease activity, including improvement in signs and symptoms of PsA as well as psoriasis in a population with broad prior treatment experience.</p><p>Apremilast demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in PsA disease severity at week 16, marked by significantly greater achievement of ACR20 response in both apremilast dose groups (vs placebo) as well as improvements in physical function based on the HAQ-DI (apremilast 30&#x02005;mg), mean and mean per cent change in TJC, mean change in SJC (apremilast 30&#x02005;mg), mean change in DAS-28 (CRP), patients achieving DAS-28 (CRP) &#x0003c;2.6, and physician's and patient's global assessments of disease activity (apremilast 30&#x02005;mg); mean change in dactylitis count was significantly greater with apremilast 30&#x02005;mg than with placebo at week 24. Despite numerical trends in some, ACR50/ACR70 responses, achievement of HAQ-DI minimal clinically important difference &#x02265;0.30, change in CRP and mean per cent change in SJC were not significant at week 16. Similarly, week 24 changes in MASES were numerically greater with apremilast 30&#x02005;mg, but not significant. A trend of higher ACR20 response rates with either apremilast dose (vs placebo), regardless of prior biologic exposure (biologic-na&#x000ef;ve, biologic-experienced and biologic therapeutic failures) was seen, but responses were numerically lower for the biologic-experienced patients.</p><p>Psoriasis severity was significantly decreased at week 16 among patients with psoriasis BSA involvement of &#x02265;3% at baseline. Although the study inclusion criteria mandated active skin disease in all patients, those evaluable by PASI constituted about 55% of the population enrolled, with PASI scores slightly lower than in PALACE 1.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Efficacy data in patients with more severe psoriasis are available from the Efficacy and Safety Trial Evaluating the Effects of Apremilast in Psoriasis (ESTEEM) studies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> PASI responses in PsA are often not as robust as responses shown in psoriasis studies.

In patients remaining on apremilast therapy for &#x02264;52&#x02005;weeks, observed improvements from baseline across many of these measures suggest sustained response.</p><p>The observed safety profile was similar to that in previous apremilast investigations and consistent over the 24-week and 52-week phases. The most common AEs, diarrhoea and nausea, occurred most often during the first 2&#x02005;weeks of apremilast treatment, with a reduced incidence after the 1st month of dosing, and were generally mild or moderate in severity. Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent and did not indicate a need for laboratory monitoring.</p><p>Efficacy and safety assessments during the active treatment phase describe the effects of apremilast observed among patients who continued its use over 52&#x02005;weeks. The 52-week continuation rate in PALACE 3 was 73%, which is within the same range as the continuation rates observed in studies of biologics in patients with PsA.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Long-term assessments may be biased based on the likelihood that patients not responding to or tolerating treatment may be more likely to discontinue. It is notable, however, that, over 52&#x02005;weeks, &#x0003c;10% of patients discontinued apremilast because of AEs, and &#x0003c;10% discontinued because of lack of efficacy. A limitation of the PALACE study design includes the lack of radiographic assessment; further studies are needed to fully evaluate the effect of apremilast on joint damage progression. The short length of the placebo-controlled part of the study is also a limitation, as a meaningful analysis of safety is not possible in the context of a brief placebo-controlled phase (data through week 16 for patients who initially received placebo and escaped early; data through week 24 for all other patients). Whereas a lengthier placebo-controlled phase would provide more rigorous comparative data, it also presents ethical limitations; the week 24&#x02013;52 active treatment period provided an alternative means to describe tolerability and safety of apremilast among those patients with longer-term exposure. Results from open-label extensions of the PALACE programme up to an additional 4&#x02005;years will provide more information on the long-term use of apremilast.</p><p>These findings are important, as a need remains for long-term treatment options for patients with PsA, including those with active psoriasis skin lesions. Based on the significant efficacy seen with apremilast 30&#x02005;mg in PALACE 3 in several domains of PsA, including ACR20 response, changes in HAQ-DI, mean and mean per cent change in TJC, mean change in SJC, dactylitis count, and DAS-28 (CRP), achievement of DAS-28 (CRP) &#x0003c;2.6, physician's and patient's global assessments of disease activity, and skin involvement, as well as a favourable risk:benefit profile and apparent lack of need for ongoing laboratory monitoring, apremilast represents a new oral treatment option, with a unique mode of action, for patients with PsA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2015-207963-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1666" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
