Increasing PA is a key therapeutic target, but thus far few strategies have been found effective in this patient group.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention on PA in patients with COPD in a multicentre European randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>343 patients from six centres, encompassing a wide spectrum of disease severity, were randomly allocated to either a usual care group (UCG) or a telecoaching intervention group (IG) between June and December 2014. This 12-week intervention included an exercise booklet and a step counter providing feedback both directly and via a dedicated smartphone application. The latter provided an individualised daily activity goal (steps) revised weekly and text messages as well as allowing occasional telephone contacts with investigators. PA was measured using accelerometry during 1&#x02005;week preceding randomisation and during week 12. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity and health status. Analyses were based on modified intention to treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Main results</title><p>Both groups were comparable at baseline in terms of factors influencing PA. At 12&#x02005;weeks, the intervention yielded a between-group difference of mean, 95% CI (lower limit &#x02013; upper limit; ll-ul) +1469, 95% CI (971 to 1965) steps/day and +10.4, 95% CI (6.1 to 14.7) min/day moderate PA; favouring the IG (all p&#x02264;0.001). The change in 6-min walk distance was significantly different (13.4, 95% CI (3.40 to 23.5) m, p&#x0003c;0.01), favouring the IG. In IG patients, an improvement could be observed in the functional state domain of the clinical COPD questionnaire (p=0.03) compared with UCG. Other health status outcomes did not differ.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The amount and intensity of PA can be significantly increased in patients with COPD using a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention including a step counter and an application installed on a smartphone.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number:</title><p>NCT02158065.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is the key question?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What is the effectiveness of a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention on objectively measured physical activity in patients with COPD included in a multicentre European randomised controlled trial?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What is the bottom line?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A 12-week semiautomated telecoaching intervention including a step counter and an application installed on a smartphone is effective in increasing the amount and intensity of physical activity in patients with COPD.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Why read on?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This article reports on an effective, innovative and promising coaching programme for people with COPD with a low burden on health professionals administering it.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Based on overwhelming evidence, regular physical activity (PA) is at present seen as one of the most powerful health-promoting acts.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death, attributing to &#x0003e;5 million premature deaths worldwide.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Also, 6&#x02013;10% of major non-communicable disease burden is caused by inactivity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite this evidence, a large proportion of healthy elderly people do not meet PA recommendations.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients with chronic disease show an even more pronounced inactive lifestyle.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This is particularly true when exercise induces symptoms.</p><p>COPD is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, resulting in a substantial economic and social burden.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients with COPD are less active than age-matched controls.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In this patient population, low levels of PA are an independent risk factor for mortality and hospitalisation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Generally, activity level decreases with increasing disease severity but inactivity is not simply a reflection of lung function impairment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Activity promotion is included as a key element in the recommendations for the management of patients&#x000a0;with COPD, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> although there are, thus far, few interventions of proven efficacy. In particular, both pulmonary rehabilitation programmes<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and pharmacotherapy,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> while of proven benefit in other respects, have led to small and inconsistent increases in PA.</p><p>PA is a complex health behaviour; consequently, effective behaviour change interventions need to reflect this. In chronically ill patients, larger improvements on PA have been observed in intervention studies where behaviour strategies (goal setting, contracting, feedback, consequences and/or cues) were included.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Activity monitors can provide direct feedback, which has shown promise in COPD, in combination with goal setting.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Implementing behaviour strategies can be done by face-to-face contacts between patients and clinicians. However, such interventions are relatively time-consuming and may depend on the skills and training of the clinicians involved, making it more difficult for them to be widely adopted. Electronic information and communication technologies offer the possibility of decreasing the burden on clinicians and patients, standardising interventions and making them available to people who live in remote areas or in areas where access to healthcare providers is limited (&#x02018;telecoaching&#x02019;).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>One study in the USA has shown the effectiveness of a solely internet-based telecoaching programme on PA in patients with COPD, observing improvements in both health-related quality of life and in PA.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Various health-related applications (&#x02018;m-health&#x02019;), focusing on PA, are available on the market,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> but applications tailored for patients with COPD have not yet been developed nor tested. We hypothesised that a smartphone application, specifically designed for the intended population and allowing human contact if needed, across the whole spectrum of COPD, would offer insight into the potential effectiveness of such an intervention on the PA level.</p><p>We therefore assessed the effectiveness of a 12-week PA promotion telecoaching programme in addition to usual care in a multicentre trial including patients with COPD. This study forms part of the European IMI-JU PROactive project.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients with a physician-based diagnosis of COPD,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> age &#x0003e;40 with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, who were not actively participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme at the moment of inclusion (or did not plan to start), were enrolled at six centres across Europe (Leuven (Belgium), Athens (Greece), London and Edinburgh (the UK), Zurich (Switzerland) and Groningen (The Netherlands)); these centres were chosen in order to recruit patients with a range of severity of COPD. Patients were excluded if they had any comorbidity limiting a normal activity pattern, had another respiratory disease as primary diagnosis or were unable to understand or operate a smartphone device. Stable patients as well as patients having an acute exacerbation in the last month were included in this trial. Patients using walking aids or those on long-term oxygen treatment were as well included in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>The trial consisted of three visits&#x02014;a screening visit (V1), a randomisation visit (V2) 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks later and a final visit (V3), 12&#x02005;weeks post randomisation. In this 1:1 randomised controlled trial, patients were allocated in either a control group (UCG) receiving usual care or in an intervention group (IG). The random sequence was generated with varying block sizes of 4, 6 or 8 and stratified by centre using a statistical software (STATA V.12.0, StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). After obtaining informed consent and when all inclusion criteria were met at V2, investigators obtained group allocation using an online system that ensured concealment of random allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Usual care</title><p>Patients in both groups received a standard leaflet explaining the importance of PA in COPD as well as information about PA recommendations. This leaflet was discussed with all patients in a 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;min one-to-one discussion with the investigator during V2. The usual medical treatment was not altered throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients in the IG received the usual care plus the telecoaching intervention. This intervention included several components: (1) a one-to-one interview with the investigator during V2 discussing motivation, barriers, favourite activities and strategies to become more active; (2) a step counter (Fitbug Air) providing direct feedback on the step count, on a 2 &#x000d7; 3&#x02005;cm display; (3) smartphone with Fitbug application and a project-tailored coaching application. This application was specifically designed for use by patients with COPD in the present project. It provided automated coaching by displaying an activity goal (number of steps) and feedback on a daily basis. The feedback included a graphical representation of that day's performance and an educational tip. Patients' targets were automatically revised every Sunday, based on performance in the preceding week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016209026F1">figure 1</xref>). Investigators could alter or &#x02018;lock&#x02019; the goals if needed, based on interaction with the patient; (4) a booklet containing home exercises; (5) weekly group text message with activity proposals sent by the investigator, taking into account the local weather forecast; and (6) telephone contacts triggered in the case of non-compliance with wearing the step counter, failure to transmit data or failure to progress.

End-of-study variables were used as the dependent variable, the baseline variable as a covariate and the group factor as the explanatory variable whose effect is to be tested. Because randomisation was performed by centre, the adjustment by centre was tested. Goodness of fit was assessed by means of normality of residuals. ORs for achieving a 1000 steps/day increase in PA, defined as the minimal important difference,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> were calculated.</p><p>As an exploratory analysis, we investigated the intervention effect in different subgroups.

Patients with a better exercise capacity and those with less symptoms had a more favourable response.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weakness of the study</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicentre trial showing the effectiveness of a telecoaching intervention in patients with COPD using triaxial accelerometry as an outcome measure. The paper reports on the effect of the intervention on patients included in six centres across Europe, including primary, tertiary care and rehabilitation centres, which increases the generalisability of the results. This study included people with a wide spectrum of disease severity and a wide range of PA levels without excluding patients who were &#x02018;active&#x02019; at the start of the programme nor those not able to leave the house, as can be observed by the representation of all mMRC scores. Because of these liberal inclusion criteria, the present trial is likely to be relevant to patients seen in routine clinical practice. By providing a smartphone, the inclusion did not depend on any previous experience, even in this elderly population. Only four patients dropped out of the study because they were not able to work with the smartphone application. It could be argued that the intervention would have attracted the more educated COPD population, leading to a possible problem of external validity. This would nevertheless not have changed the interpretation of the present results. The feasibility of using smartphones for wireless transmission (via 4G) of data in this population is in line with previous studies.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The algorithm used to revise the targets every week was based on having at least four days of step counter data. Compliance was not an issue as patients wore the step counter &#x0003e;6&#x02005;days out of 7. Whether the intervention translates to long-term maintenance of higher PA levels has not yet been investigated.</p><p>Some remarks should be made concerning the interpretation of our results. Based on the present study, we cannot state whether all component parts of this intervention were essential. Providing a step counter in combination with goal setting could potentially be equally effective.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The present application however, using a more complex technology interface, allowed clinicians to have insight into the compliance of patients and intervene if patients were unable to cope with the preset goals. Another advantage of such interventions is the standardisation of the intervention, avoiding bias related to the investigator providing the coaching. This makes the intervention, on the one hand, feasible to investigate in a multicentre trial and, on the other hand, it is potentially applicable to routine clinical practice without specific expertise requirements. One could argue that the different parts of the intervention, or the combination of these, rather than the medium used to provide these (smartphone) were essential. In this case, the present intervention could be provided by any kind of modern communication (eg, internet-mediated via any interface). The present authors are convinced that the intervention can be adapted to the preference of communication given by the patient or patient population. It could as well be debated that the contact with the investigator rather the telecoaching could have resulted in the present results. However, this is unlikely as adding a behavioural intervention based on face-to-face contacts in patients following a rehabilitation programme did not result in an enhanced PA level.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>It is of interest that in both the IG and the UCG group the non-completers had a more severe disease judged by quadriceps strength, BMI and CAT score; moreover, those unable to undertake valid PA monitoring had a lower FEV<sub>1</sub>. This mirrors previous findings that these patients are less likely to complete an intervention.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We acknowledge therefore that some patients with the most severe disease may need a more personal approach such as participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme before they engage in PA coaching programmes. The IG patients reported more musculoskeletal problems compared with the UCG. This information should be interpreted with some caution as the frequency of contact with patients in the IG was higher; patients in the UCG only reported adverse events at the end of the trial. Knowing that almost none of these events required any treatment, it may be that mild adverse events were therefore under-reported in the UCG. This bias could have been minimised by providing a diary to patients in the control group. On the other hand, minor transient musculoskeletal problems are not unexpected when sedentary people start an activity programme. PA is highly dependent on the season of measurement.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, a limitation of the present trial is the narrow inclusion between June and December 2014. This can be seen as by the mean decrease in daylight over time, a proxy for season. This likely explains the decrease in PA seen in the control group. Although this influences the within-group results, it does not change the between-group comparisons as the groups were randomly assigned and therefore comparable (including change in daylight). Our results show that patients can be motivated to be active, even during periods of worse weather conditions. Lastly, neither patients nor investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. However, by using the objective PA measurement, the lack of blinding of investigator will not have influenced the primary end point. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge the lack of blinding could have minimally influenced the 6MWD results.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Several studies have used step counters to provide real-time feedback on PA in combination with goal setting in comparable patient groups.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The weighted mean effect of these studies was 1259 steps/day improvement over controls. One study, which used a pedometer intervention and monthly face-to-face meetings, showed a significantly larger effect.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In that study, exercise capacity was relatively well preserved (463&#x02005;m 6MWD), perhaps providing more window for improvement as there was a larger functional reserve.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> It is clear that coaching programmes with the specific aim of increasing PA lead to larger improvements in amount of PA compared with rehabilitation,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and pharmacology.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the present study, patients in the IG were four times more likely to increase their PA by &#x0003e;1000 steps. This increment was defined a priori because it has been defined as the minimal important difference<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and because of its relation with the decreased risk for COPD-related hospitalisation or mortality.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The present intervention was effective irrespective of patients' baseline PA being above or below 5000 steps. Shifting to more active PA provides additional health benefits in healthy elderly and special populations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This supports the concept that aiming for an increase in PA level to lift patients above the &#x02018;sedentary lifestyle index&#x02019; of 5000 steps,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> or the &#x02018;active&#x02019; threshold of 7500 steps,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> is important. The objective of this intervention was to enhance PA by empowering patients and motivating them to engage in more daily activity. It comes as no surprise that the intervention, while successful in enhancing PA, had only a minimal impact on exercise capacity and muscle strength. This observation is in line with others<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and is likely due to the relatively low intensity of PA, insufficient to enhance skeletal muscle function. Indeed, the time in MPA only increased by 10&#x02005;min/day. This may yield health benefits but is not an adequate exercise training stimulus to incur in training effects in the peripheral muscle. Our findings are likely important from a healthcare perspective since the present intervention could easily be combined with a formal exercise training intervention or other interventions with a more direct impact on exercise capacity potentiating the effects of both interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Future perspectives</title><p>The present intervention should be seen as a promising tool as an increased number of patients own a smartphone (mobile broadband is the most dynamic Information and communications technology (ICT) market segment with a 12-fold increase in users worldwide between 2007 and 2015<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the present study, patients were equipped with a smartphone. The intervention will become more clinically available and cost-effective if patients own their own smartphone device. It can be envisaged that this intervention can be embedded in a broader healthcare intervention using a smartphone (m-health). In any case, the coaching tools available on the market should be adapted for users with chronic diseases. Given the limited effect of this intervention on exercise capacity, the impact of delivering this telecoaching intervention in the context of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme or further optimised pharmacotherapy could be a future investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study shows the effectiveness of a 12-week semiautomated telecoaching programme (application installed on a smartphone device) and a step counter providing direct feedback on total daily number of steps, walking time, time in at least moderate PA and movement intensity during walking in patients with COPD across the whole disease spectrum.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Novartis for their kind contribution and input in the protocol development, Anne Elie Carsin (CREAL, Barcelona) for the data verification and all patients involved in the design of the intervention and the participants of the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Nicholas Hopkinson <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/COPDdoc">@COPDdoc</ext-link>, The PROactive consortium <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/PROactiveCOPD">@PROactiveCOPD</ext-link>, Thierry Troosters <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/PROactiveCOPD">@Troosters</ext-link>, Heleen Demeyer <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/Demeyer_H">@Demeyer_H</ext-link>, Judith Garcia-Aymerich <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/judithgarciaaym">@judithgarciaaym</ext-link> and Elena Gimeno-Santos <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/EleGim">@EleGim</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold>
