Several observations suggest that platelets in type 2 diabetes are resistant to inhibition by aspirin. Our aim was to assess comparatively the effect of aspirin, a nitric oxide&#x02013;donating agent (NCX 4016), their combination, or placebo on platelet activation induced by acute hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 40 type 2 diabetic patients were allocated to 100 mg aspirin once daily, 800 mg NCX 4016 b.i.d., both of them, or placebo for 15 days. On day 15, 1 h after the morning dose, a 4-h hyperglycemic clamp (plasma glucose 13.9 mmol/l) was performed, and blood samples were collected before and immediately after it for platelet activation and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition studies.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Acute hyperglycemia enhanced shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation in placebo-treated patients (basal closure time 63 &#x000b1; 7.1 s, after hyperglycemia 49.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 s, &#x02212;13.5 &#x000b1; 6.3 s, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.048). Pretreatment with aspirin, despite full inhibition of platelet COX-1, did not prevent it (&#x02212;12.7 &#x000b1; 6.9 s, NS vs. placebo). On the contrary, pretreatment with the NO donor NCX 4016, alone or in combination with aspirin, suppressed platelet activation induced by acute hyperglycemia (NCX 4016 +10.5 &#x000b1; 8.3 s; NCX 4016 plus aspirin: +12.0 &#x000b1; 10.7 s, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. placebo for both). Other parameters of shear stress&#x02013;dependent platelet activation were also more inhibited by NCX 4016 than by aspirin, despite lesser inhibition of COX-1.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Acute hyperglycemia-induced enhancement of platelet activation is resistant to aspirin; a NO-donating agent suppresses it. Therapeutic approaches aiming at a wider platelet inhibitory action than that exerted by aspirin may prove useful in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Type 2 diabetes is associated with a two- to fourfold increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events and markedly enhances the risk of stroke, amputation, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Not only long-term, continuous hyperglycemia but also transient, acute hyperglycemic spikes may contribute to the poor cardiovascular prognosis of patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Platelet hyperreactivity has been identified as one of the mechanisms of enhanced arterial thrombosis in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We have previously shown that in type 2 diabetes an acute, short-term hyperglycemia enhances platelet activation, and, in particular, high-shear stress&#x02013;induced activation, which is considered an important mechanism triggering arterial thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This phenomenon is partly due to acute enhancement of the circulating levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and indeed platelet-plasma interactions involving vWF have been previously suggested to cause increased platelet aggregability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and recent epidemiological data show that plasma vWF predicts cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). High shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation is hardly sensitive to inhibition by aspirin, and this has been advocated as one of the reasons for the high residual incidence of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The effectiveness of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent in patients with type 2 diabetes is being increasingly questioned and aspirin nonresponsiveness, i.e., the incomplete inhibition of platelet aggregation upon chronic aspirin intake, has been documented in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In the antithrombotic trialists' collaboration overview in patients at risk of ischemic cardiovascular events, antiplatelet therapy did not reduce the odds of a vascular event in diabetes (&#x02212;7%), different from the highly significant reduction produced in the overall population at risk (&#x02212;25%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO), a naturally occurring antiatherothrombotic mediator, inhibits the aggregation of platelets induced by all agonists, also suppressing aspirin-resistant pathways. The production of NO is defective in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It seems thus logical to test NO-donating agents for their effect on platelet activation in type 2 diabetes.</p><p>NCX 4016 (2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid-3-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester), a NO-donating moiety linked to an acetylsalicylic acid backbone, is a prototype of a series of NO-donating hybrid drugs of potential use for cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). NCX 4016 was shown to display a wide range of antiplatelet activities in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and to release biologically relevant amounts of NO after oral administration to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above considerations, we have compared aspirin with the NO-donating agent NCX 4016 for their effects on the platelet hyperreactivity induced by acute, short-term hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Forty patients with type 2 diabetes, as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel groups, placebo-controlled study. Enrollment criteria were the following: male and female patients (age range 18&#x02013;75 years) affected by type 2 diabetes (duration of disease &#x02264;10 years) and having stable metabolic control (A1C in the range of 7&#x02013;8%) with diet and oral antidiabetic treatment, and stable blood pressure control (&#x0003c;130&#x02013;80 mmHg) if hypertensive.</p><p>Concomitant treatments with antiplatelet drugs or nitrates were not allowed in the 10 days before randomization. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, and statins were allowed only if they had been taken regularly for &#x0003e;3 months before enrollment and were continued throughout the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: 100 mg aspirin once daily plus placebo, 800 mg NCX 4016 b.i.d. plus placebo, aspirin plus NCX 4016, or placebo for 15 days. A treatment using the combination of aspirin and NCX 4016 seemed appropriate because most of the new antiplatelet agents that more recently entered clinical use have been tested along with aspirin and because previous studies have shown that thromboxane (Tx) A<sub>2</sub> synthesis inhibition after oral NCX 4016 is less than optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Patients were instructed to take one sachet (NCX 4016 or placebo) and one tablet (aspirin or placebo) in the morning after breakfast, and one sachet (NCX 4016 or placebo) in the evening after dinner. The last study drug medication was taken in the morning of day 15, 1 h before the start of the clamp procedure. A 4-h hyperglycemic clamp was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In brief, glucose was infused at a variable rate, based on plasma glucose measured every 5 min, to maintain steady-state plasma glucose levels (250 mg/dl, 139 mmol/l). Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose analyzer (Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), plasma insulin and C-peptide were measured by assays described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and A1C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, using an H1-AutoA<sub>1c</sub> HA 8121 apparatus (DIC, Kyoto Daiichi, Kogaku Co., Japan). Blood for platelet function studies was collected before and at the end of the clamp procedure. A bleeding time test was performed before blood sampling preclamp and again after blood sampling postclamp. Urine samples were collected for the following periods: the 24 h ending at the start of the clamp (preclamp), the 4 h of the clamp procedure (clamp), and the 24 h starting from the beginning of the clamp (postclamp). The study was approved by our institutional review board (Comitato Etico delle Aziende Sanitarie dell'Umbria), and all patients gave informed, witnessed, written consent before enrollment.</p><sec><title>Laboratory methods</title><sec><title>Bleeding time.</title><p>A standardized bleeding time test was performed using an automatic template device (Simplate II) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The blood emerging from the skin wound was collected on a chilled antiplatelet-anticoagulant mixture (citrate, theophylline, adenosine, and dipyridamole) for the quantification of platelet activation, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Shear-induced platelet activation.</title><p>Shear-induced platelet activation was assessed with the O'Brien filtration test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

In brief, citrated blood (5 ml) was passed through a rectangular parallel plate perfusion chamber over a plastic coverslip sprayed with collagen from equine tendon (&#x0223c;30 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>; Mascia Brunelli, Milano, Italy), at a wall shear rate of 3,000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The coverslip was then harvested, gently washed with 10 mmol/l HEPES, placed in 400 &#x003bc;l of a lytic buffer for 1 h, and then frozen and thawed three times. The supernatants were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assayed for &#x003b2;-thromboglobulin by an ELISA assay (Asserachrom &#x003b2;-TG; Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The total number of platelets deposited on the coverslip was calculated by dividing the amount of &#x003b2;-thromboglobulin present in the lysate by that present in a known number of nonactivated platelets of the same patient.

No significant differences in any of the demographic parameters were evident between the treatment groups. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before the clamp were not different in the four study groups. After the beginning of glucose infusion, plasma glucose reached the target of 250 mg/dl by 31.6 &#x000b1; 2.2 min, with no differences between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Plasma insulin increased in response to hyperglycemia (baseline = 12.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;U/ml and steady-state = 28.0 &#x000b1; 4.2 &#x003bc;U/ml) with no significant differences between the groups, although with a trend to higher insulin levels upon hyperglycemia in the NCX 4016&#x02013;treated groups. Platelet count was similar before the clamp in the four study groups and decreased slightly, but not significantly, after the clamp. Hematocrit values were similar at baseline in all study groups and remained unchanged after the clamp.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data of the

Arachidonic acid&#x02013;induced platelet aggregation at baseline (preclamp) was significantly inhibited in the three active treatment groups compared with placebo, although significantly less in the NCX 4016 group when the highest concentration of arachidonic acid (1 mmol/l) was used (supplementary Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>).</p><p>The inhibition of platelet aggregation in the three active treatment groups was unaffected by the hyperglycemic clamp, except for the NCX 4016 group in which the inhibition of aggregation induced by the highest concentration of arachidonic acid (1 mmol/l) after the clamp was no longer less than that in the other two active treatment groups (supplementary Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>). The lack of effect of NCX 4016 on platelet aggregation induced by high concentrations of arachidonic acid in the sample taken before the clamp, but no longer evident in the sample taken after the clamp, can be explained by the fact that NCX 4016 has a slower absorption rate than aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and this may translate in incomplete inhibition of TxB<sub>2</sub> production before the clamp, but not after. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited in the aspirin and NCX 4016 plus aspirin groups but not in the NCX 4016 group (supplementary Fig. 1<italic>B</italic>). Acute hyperglycemia did not affect collagen-induced platelet aggregation in any of the treatment groups, confirming previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The observation that collagen-induced light transmission aggregometry was not significantly inhibited by NCX 4016 whereas it was by aspirin and, on the contrary, that platelet deposition on collagen at a high shear rate was inhibited more extensively by NCX 4016 than by aspirin can be explained by the fact that low-dose collagen-induced aggregation is largely dependent on TxA<sub>2</sub> production, which is incompletely inhibited by NCX 4016 (see below), whereas platelet adhesion at a high shear rate is very sensitive to NO inhibition and hardly to aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><sec><title>Platelet activation markers in venous blood.</title><p>P-selectin expression on platelets in venous blood was similar in the four groups at baseline (preclamp) (average 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.2% of positive platelets) and was not modified by the hyperglycemic clamp in any of the four groups, confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

This result is documented by the enhanced shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation, enhanced platelet deposition to collagen at high shear rate, increased expression of an activation antigen on platelets in the bleeding time blood, and increased urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TxB<sub>2</sub>, a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Parameters of platelet function, which are not shear-dependent like light transmission aggregometry or the expression of activation antigens on platelets circulating in venous blood, did not change after short-term hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>High shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation is considered to be a parameter relevant for arterial thrombosis more than light transmission aggregometry, and it has been reported to be insensitive to inhibition by aspirin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). No studies, however, have addressed the effect of aspirin intake on high shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation, especially in diabetic individuals. Because NO is able to inhibit high shear stress&#x02013;induced platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), we set up a study to compare aspirin and an NO donor, NCX 4016, for their capability to prevent the acute hyperglycemia-induced platelet activation in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>We found that the enhancement of shear stress-induced platelet activation caused by hyperglycemia is not prevented by aspirin, despite adequate suppression of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), whereas it is completely suppressed by a NO-donating agent. In fact, although in patients treated with aspirin filter closure time was shortened and the percentage of retained platelets was increased by acute hyperglycemia to an extent similar to that observed in placebo-treated subjects, in diabetic individuals treated with NCX 4016 these parameters of platelet activation were unchanged or even reduced after acute hyperglycemia. Acute hyperglycemia also enhanced other parameters of platelet activation, such as platelet deposition on collagen at a high shear rate or the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in circulating blood, and these were also consistently reduced by NCX 4016 but not by aspirin.</p><p>The baseline urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TxB<sub>2</sub>, a marker of in vivo TxA<sub>2</sub> generation in the placebo-treated diabetic subjects, was strikingly increased compared with that in our reference healthy control group. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies showing that diabetic patients excrete large amounts of urinary TxA<sub>2</sub> metabolites especially in the presence of poor glycemic control, most of which derive from platelets as an expression of increased in vivo platelet activation, being markedly reduced by low doses of aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Short-term hyperglycemia further increased urinary 11-dehydro-TxB<sub>2</sub> excretion, confirming increased activation of platelets exposed in vivo to high shear stress in diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although all active treatments inhibited serum TxB<sub>2</sub> and urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TxB<sub>2</sub> significantly compared with placebo, NCX 4016 did so significantly less than aspirin and not quite to the extent (&#x02265;95% inhibition of serum TxB<sub>2</sub>) considered to be required for the effective suppression of in vivo platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The observation that despite incomplete suppression of platelet COX-1, NCX 4016 inhibited several parameters of ex vivo and in vivo platelet activation in diabetic individuals suggests that the antiplatelet activity exerted was largely due to the released NO. Indeed, NCX 4016, but not aspirin, enhanced plasma levels of NOx, demonstrating the delivery of NO in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Considering that NCX 4016 in vitro inhibits platelet COX-1 irreversibly and with a potency similar to that of aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), the lower inhibition we found in vivo suggests that only a minor fraction of NCX 4016 is absorbed as such after oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Hyperglycemia may contribute to atherosclerotic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes not only when it is sustained but also when it occurs in spikes, as in the postprandial state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>): our findings suggest that the enhancement of in vivo platelet activation during acute hyperglycemia may be one of the effectors of cardiovascular complications. Indeed, intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes results in reduced mortality and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our study, using a model resembling the postprandial hyperglycemia of type 2 diabetes in terms of glucose and insulin plasma levels, suggests that platelet hyperreactivity is involved in the detrimental cardiovascular effects of hyperglycemic spikes and shows that aspirin is not able to prevent it, supporting the concept that aspirin offers a less than optimal cardiovascular protection in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). NO has been known for more than two decades as a very effective platelet function inhibitor, but the search for drugs able to release it in vivo in biologically relevant amounts without incurring in untoward effects has been so far unsuccessful elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The present results with NCX 4016 show that it is possible to release NO in vivo in amounts sufficient to inhibit the platelet hyperactivity induced by acute hyperglycemia in diabetic patients without provoking hypotension. Recent data showing that NCX 4016 stimulates glucose transport in adipocytes without negatively affecting insulin sensitivity and that it could therefore help in better controlling glycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) further suggest that NCX 4016 may be suitable for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, NCX 4016 is poorly absorbed and has limitations of pharmaceutical formulation that prevent its further clinical development. Novel hybrid molecules able to exert a full aspirin effect and/or to produce larger or more sustained NO release may exert stronger antiplatelet action and thus represent ideal candidates for development in patients with type 2 diabetes. Agents potentially offering these characteristics are under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec>
