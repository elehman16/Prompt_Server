Although the detailed molecular events that link obesity with its associated pathologies are not well understood, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic inflammation might be an important mediat <sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Studies have demonstrated close associations between obesity and increased circulating concentrations of proinflammatory molecules, including acute-phase proteins, cytokines, adipokines, and chemokines <sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In obese states, these proinflammatory factors are produced predominantly from enlarged adipocytes and activated macrophages in adipose tissue and liver. Many of these inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) can directly induce glucose intolerance and insulin resistance by antagonizing insulin's metabolic actions at peripheral tissues, especially in liver and skeletal muscle <sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P6">Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), also known as 24p3 <sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, is a member of the lipocalin protein family that was originally identified in mouse kidney cells and human neutrophil granules. This protein has been implicated in diversified functions such as apoptosis and innate immunity <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Lcn2 has been recognized as an adipocyte-derived acute phase protein that is positively correlated with potential effects in obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance in mice and humans <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. It also has been showing that circulating levels of this adipokine have a strong, direct correlation with hs-CRP as an acute phase protein <sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. One of the best strategies for preventing obesity and its associated inflammation is participation in regular physical activity <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Although the changes in adipokine levels might be an important clue for understanding the beneficial effects of exercise, data on exercise-induced changes of Lcn2 is still unclear. Recently, Damirchi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported that Lcn2 increased after a single bout of graded exercise in obese and normal-weight men. Choi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, in an only available study, did not report that any changes in Lcn2 level in obese women after 12 weeks moderate exercise training. The magnitude of the changes in plasma adipokine levels depends on the type, duration and intensity of exercise <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The physiological and biochemical responses to resistance exercise are different from those exhibited in response to endurance exercise <sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. No previous study has investigated the effects of resistance exercise on Lcn2 concentration, and no previous studies have attempted to compare the responses of Lcn2 to both resistance and endurance exercise in young men. We hypothesized that resistance training (RT) and endurance training (ET) would reduce the adipose tissue, insulin resistance, inflammatory markers and Lcn2 concentrations. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine and compare the effects of RT and ET on body composition, insulin resistance, CRP and Lcn2 concentration in healthy and sedentary young men.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>METHODS AND SUBJECTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P7">Thirty healthy and sedentary young men (25.3&#x000b1;2.3 years; mean &#x000b1; SD) participated in this study. All the subjects were asked to complete a personal health and medical history questionnaire, which served as a screening tool. The subjects were given both verbal and written instructions outlining the experimental procedure, and written informed consent was obtained. Our participants were not engaged in any systematic exercise programs at least 6 months before the study, they were nonsmokers and none of them had any disease. All the subjects completed the 3-day diet recall forms and were instructed to maintain their normal physical activity and dietary habits throughout the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the RT group (n=10), ET group (n=10) or control group (n=10). The study was approved by the Islamic Azad University, Gachsaran branch Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Study design</title><p id="P8">Following familiarization, subjects were asked to report to the laboratory for an additional test session designed to determine one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for 8 exercises involving the upper and lower body. Maximal strength was determined using a concentric, 1-RM <sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, as previously described <sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The warm-up consisted of riding a stationary bicycle for 5 min, two sets of progressive resistance exercises similar to the actual exercises utilized in the main experiment, and 2-3 min of rest accompanied by some light stretching exercises. After the warm-up, subjects performed the 1-RM test, and the heaviest weight that could be lifted once using the correct technique was considered as 1-RM for all the exercises and used to calculate the percentage of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Resistance training</title><p id="P9">Two familiarization sessions were designed to habituate subjects with the testing procedures and laboratory environment. The main aim of these sessions was to familiarize subjects with different resistance exercises using weight-training machines and also to familiarize them with performing the 1-RM test. During the familiarization sessions, it was ensured that all the subjects used the correct techniques for all exercises prior to taking part in the main test sessions. Subjects executed eight resistance exercises selected to stress the major muscle groups in the following order: chest press, leg extension, shoulder press, leg curls, latissimus pull down, leg press, arm curls, and triceps extension. RT consisted of 50-60 min of circuit weight training per day, 3 days a week, for 8 weeks. This training was circularly performed in 8 stations and included 2-4 sets with 8-12 maximal repetitions at 65-80% of 1-RM in each station. Each circuit and set was separated by 2-3 min and 60-90 s rest respectively. General and specific warm-up were performed prior to each training session, as explained for the 1-RM determination, and each training session was followed by cool-down. One subject did not participate in the final examinations and was excluded.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Endurance training</title><p id="P10">The ET program consisted of running at 65&#x02013;80% of maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) for 20&#x02013;34 min per day, 3 days per week, for 8 weeks.

Each training session was started with a warm-up and finished with a cool down. The exercise intensity was controlled by the investigators, using a heart rate monitor, who ensured that it was between 65 and 80% of HR<sub>max</sub> throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="S8"><title>Anthropometric and body composition measurements</title><p id="P11">Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m<sup>2</sup>).

The effects of resistance versus endurance training on plasma Lcn2 are still unclear, thus this study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of RT and ET on Lcn2 in young men. The present study demonstrated that plasma Lcn2 decreased after 8 weeks RT (10.3%) and ET (22.02%) compared with the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), while no significant differences were found between two training groups. Although no previous study has investigated the effects of resistance exercise on Lcn2 concentration, Choi et al. <sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> indicated that there was no significant change in the Lcn2 in obese women after 12 weeks moderate exercise training. This discrepant result may be attributed to variation in the exercise protocols and differences in subject populations. The results are in agreement with previous reports showing that there was a significant positive relationship between plasma Lcn2 levels with body mass, body fat percentage and WHR, suggesting that the increased fat mass might account for the elevated blood levels of this adipokine in obese individuals. Wang et al <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> showed a higher concentration of Lcn2 in obesity and this adipokine is positively related to the BMI, waist circumference and body fat percentage. Choi et al <sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> demonstrated a positive relationship between Lcn2 and body mass and Damirchi et al <sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> showed a positive relationship between Lcn2 level with waist circumference, fat mass and BMI. Although the results showed that plasma Lcn2 level had tendency to increase with the body mass, body fat percentage and WHR increased at baseline, no significant relationship between the change of plasma Lcn2 with body composition variables were found in the RT and ET group after 8 weeks intervention. Since there was no significant relationship between body composition parameters and plasma Lcn2, thus it seems that there should be the other parameters attributed in Lcn2 improvement.</p><p id="P21">Lcn2 can be recognized as an inflammatory marker that increases after a progressive physiological stress in sedentary individuals. Furthermore, increasing Lcn2 secretion from fat cells may be stimulated by lipopolysaccharides that suggest Lcn2 as an acute phase protein <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. It is reported a direct relation between the Lcn2 and hs-CRP levels and Lcn2 can be use by researchers and clinicians as an inflammatory index <sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Results showing no significant relationship between Lcn2 and hs-CRP after 8 weeks RT and ET, suggest that decrease of the other inflammatory markers might decrease Lcn2 concentration. Serum Lcn2 levels correlated with serum IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels in patients with psoriasis <sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, while we did not measure IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations in this study. Additional research is needed to examine whether exercise-induced change in IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations decreases Lcn2.</p><p id="P22">On the other hand, Sommer et al <sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> showed an upregulation of Lcn2 by IL-1 beta implicating a potential role of this adipocyte-secreted acute phase reactant in the development of insulin resistance, obesity and associated disorders, including cardiovascular disease. Sommer et al <sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> and Yan et al <sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> indicated a positive relationship between Lcn2 concentration and insulin resistance, however, we did not find a significant relationship between Lcn2 and insulin resistance determined by HOMA-IR. Choi et al <sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> reported that HOMA-IR is not a very sophisticated measure of insulin resistance although it has been used widely in clinical and epidemiological studies.</p><p id="P23">Our results showed that 8 weeks RT and ET decreased Lcn2 concentration in young men and the effects of these exercises were similar. Therefore it seems that that exercise itself is effective in decreasing Lcn2 independent of exercise mode. Lcn2 can be recognized as an inflammatory marker and previous studies indicated that exercise has an anti-inflammatory nature <sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In view of the anti-inflammatory nature of exercise, its beneficial action is seen not only in obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease <sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, insulin resistance <sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, diabetes mellitus <sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and hyperlipidemias <sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> but also in Alzheimer's disease and other conditions where inflammation plays a significant role <sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. We had some limitations in this study. We did not measure IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in the present study. If we could measure these inflammatory markers, we could carefully explain the decrease of plasma Lcn2 in response to 8 weeks RT and ET in young men.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p id="P24">In summary, 8 weeks RT and ET decreased Lcn2 concentration in young men, while these exercises had no effect on body composition, hs-CRP and insulin resistance determined by HOMA-IR. In addition, there were no significant relationships between plasma Lcn2 with body composition, insulin resistance and hs-CRP after the intervention. Therefore, it is concluded that other mechanism such as exercise <italic>per se</italic> or decrease of the other inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; might decrease Lcn2 concentration in young men. Additional research is needed to examine these mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><p>The work was supported by grants from the Gachsaran branch, Islamic Azad University.
