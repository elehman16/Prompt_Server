Along with its chronic disease burden it creates high societal costs. Therapy consists of long-term use of medication and, if insufficient, endoscopic sinus surgery. No consensus exists on the right timing and extent of disease that warrants surgery. Furthermore, there is lack of clinical knowledge about the benefit of surgery over medication only. The current trial evaluates the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery in addition to drug treatment versus medication exclusively in the adult patient group with nasal polyps.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled (PolypESS) trial in 238 patients aged 18 years or older selected for primary or revision endoscopic sinus surgery by the otorhinolaryngologist was designed. Patients will be randomised to either endoscopic sinus surgery in addition to medication or medical therapy only. Relevant data will be collected prior to randomisation, at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months after start of treatment. Complete follow-up will be 24&#x000a0;months. Primary outcome is disease-specific Health-related Quality of Life quantified by the SNOT-22 after 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are generic Health-related Quality of Life, cost-effectiveness, objective signs of disease and adverse effects of treatment. Subgroup analyses will be performed to verify whether treatment effects differ among patient phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PolypESS trial will investigate tailored care in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and will result in improved clinical pathways to help to determine in which circumstances to perform surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Dutch Trial Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=4978">NTR4978</ext-link>.

The prevalence of both forms of CRS in Europe is around 11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CRSwNP is the more serious form of CRS and is associated with a prevalence of 1&#x02013;4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Patients with CRS experience a significant impact on most aspects of Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and investigation has shown this to exceed the impact on HRQOL of patients with chronic heart failure, diabetes and chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The high prevalence and significant negative impact on most aspects of HRQOL burdens the diagnostic process and treatment with high medical resource usage and high societal costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>(Inter-)national clinical CRS guidelines advise starting drug treatment for at least 1&#x000a0;month before considering surgery; however, there is no guideline that advises or specifies conditions that warrant surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, patients failing drug treatment are offered a more intensive drug regimen or endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) in addition to drug treatment. In The Netherlands most otorhinolaryngologists prefer surgery, though practice variance is high with regard to the timing and rationale of ESS. These differences lead to inefficient health care practice. Also, if ESS is not proven to be (cost-)effective, risks are generated in exposing patients to ineffective treatment.</p><p>A national audit in the UK demonstrated that 69% of ESS is performed for CRSwNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Corresponding data in The Netherlands are lacking, but may be expected to be similar. A recent Chronic Rhinosinusitis Epidemiology Study (CRES) performed in the UK demonstrated that from all respondents with CRSwNP (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;651) 57% underwent previous sinonasal surgery and 20% underwent multiple surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This high burden of primary and revision surgery remains unclear in aetiology, but highlights the need for more research concerning endotyping and phenotyping patients with CRSwNP as well as more research concerning aspects of surgery itself.</p><p>A recent analysis of the National Comparative Audit of Surgery for Nasal Polyposis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis depicted that almost 40% of patients undergoing ESS suffered more than 5&#x000a0;years from their symptoms related to CRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hopkins et al. specifically looked at the timing of ESS and its influence on symptoms. In the National Comparative Audit of Surgery for Nasal Polyposis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] the effect of patient time to surgery on symptomatic outcomes was evaluated and it was found that patients treated at an early stage in the course of disease (i.e. within 12&#x000a0;months after first diagnosis of CRS) experience more improvement in symptoms after surgical intervention compared to patients treated after a longer burden of CRS (i.e. after 5&#x000a0;years from first diagnosis of CRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On top of this finding, the cohort of patients treated after a longer period of CRS had greater CRS-related health care needs postoperatively, consisting of medical visits and prescriptions per patient per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This available data raises more questions about the right timing of ESS.</p><p>The systematic review of the Cochrane Review Group on ESS for CRS (2006) concluded, with the limited evidence available, that ESS has not demonstrated an additional benefit in comparison to drug treatment. The need for more randomised trials was highlighted in the review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>A recent non-randomised, multicentre cohort study by Smith et al. looked at the differences in HRQOL in a CRS patient group that self-selected ESS versus a patient group that self-selected drug treatment. They demonstrated a significantly better improvement in HRQOL in addition to less use of systemic medication usage after ESS in comparison to on-going medication until 6-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They also found a better HRQOL in patients that self-selected ESS at 1-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Scientific evidence for the effectiveness and the severity of disease that warrants ESS, ideally retrieved from a well-designed randomised controlled trial, is missing. The aim of the present trial is to investigate in a randomised fashion whether two regularly applied treatment strategies used in adult patients with CRSwNP, ESS in addition to drug treatment or drug treatment only, differ in generic and disease-specific HRQOL and to establish the presumed superiority of ESS. A comparison with respect to cost-effectiveness will also be made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary aim of the PolypESS trial is to assess the effectiveness of ESS in addition to drug treatment as compared to drug treatment alone in adults with CRSwNP in terms of improving patients&#x02019; HRQOL, measured by the Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) at 12-month follow-up. Key secondary aims of the trial are evaluation of the effectiveness of ESS in addition to drug treatment as compared to drug treatment alone in the short (3&#x02013;6 months) and long (12&#x02013;24 months) term, in terms of generic HRQOL, objective signs of disease and adverse effects of treatment. This trial will also evaluate which patient phenotypes within CRSwNP benefit from ESS in addition to drug treatment as compared to drug treatment alone. Furthermore, the relation between health care resource use and patient costs and effects of ESS will be determined from a societal point of view. It is hypothesised that a more tailored approach for patients with CRSwNP will be associated with lower medical and indirect costs (health care utilisation and productivity loss).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The PolypESS is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open, national, multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating the (cost-)effectiveness of ESS in patients suffering from CRSwNP. Suitable patients will be randomised into two treatment groups. In the first group patients will undergo ESS in addition to medication, in the second group patients will receive an intensified drug treatment only. Total follow-up is 24&#x000a0;months for all included consecutive patients. Otorhinolaryngologists in the participating centres are asked to recruit patients. Any patient who meets the inclusion criteria (described in detail below in &#x02018;Study population&#x02019; section) will be informed about the trial and asked to participate. The coordinating trial centre (Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) will contact patients who have expressed interest in the trial. The study team member will provide detailed written and oral information about the trial and answer any questions. If patients agree to participate, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and a baseline visit will be scheduled. Potential participants have sufficient time before they give their final consent to participate in the trial. If patients decline participation, known clinical data on disease-specific HRQOL and objective signs of disease are used to evaluate whether the findings of the consecutive sampling are generalisable to the target population. The trial reporting is according to the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and the CONSORT extension for nonpharmacological interventions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>The trial is performed in 15 hospitals, three university-affiliated hospitals (The Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam; Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam; VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam) and teaching hospitals (Amstelland Hospital, Amstelveen; Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp and Alphen aan den Rijn; BovenIJ Hospital, Amsterdam; Deventer Hospital, Deventer; Flevo Hospital, Almere; Haga Hospital, Den Haag; Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis location East, Amsterdam; Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis location West, Amsterdam; Spaarne Hospital, Hoofddorp; Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem; Tergooi Hospital, Hilversum and Blaricum; and Westfries Gasthuis, Hoorn) in The Netherlands. The same medical researcher and research nurses perform all trial assessments in the participating centres, apart from nasal endoscopy. Nasal endoscopy is performed by the local ENT surgeon as part of standard care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study population</title><p>Adult patients (18&#x000a0;years of age or older) with bilateral CRSwNP who have been selected by their ENT surgeon as candidates for primary or revision ESS are eligible for participation. If patients are excluded from participation, reason(s) for exclusion are registered. Exclusion criteria include the presence of systemic diseases affecting the nose (e.g. Wegener&#x02019;s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis), antrochoanal polyps, malignant polyps, inverted papilloma, sinonasal tumours, absolute need for surgical therapy, contraindications for surgical therapy, need for radical surgery (Draf III, Denker surgery, medial maxillectomy), polypectomy without ethmoidectomy, continuous use of systemic corticosteroids for diseases other than CRSwNP, continuous medication for other diseases influencing CRSwNP (e.g. other immunosuppressive drugs), pregnancy at enrolment, mental or systemic illnesses preventing adequate participation in the trial and any other scheduled surgical intervention preventing adequate participation in the trial. Furthermore, potential participants are not allowed to have used any systemic corticosteroids in the previous 4&#x000a0;weeks before enrolment and they should not have suffered from an acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrolment or during the previous 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient enrolment</title><p>Selection of patients follows a two-stage procedure. Consecutive patients are screened for eligibility by a recruiting local otorhinolaryngologist in the outpatient department. Additionally a telephone interview is scheduled by the medical researcher in the Academic Medical Centre during which eligibility will be reassessed. Patients will be enrolled by the medical researcher during a clinic visit in the concerning hospital. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria can be included and will be randomly assigned, after informed consent is given.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Baseline measurements</title><p>On the day of enrolment, patients will undergo the same HRQOL and objective evaluation, including the SNOT-22, the EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L, the EuroQol Group) and nasal endoscopy, that will be used after treatment (see &#x0201c;Outcomes&#x0201d; section). Clinical data is collected by the enrolling medical researcher and focuses on the (severity of) patient-reported symptoms, previous clinical examinations, previous sinonasal surgery, previous conservative treatment and complete medical history. Demographic variables include age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, family situation and highest level of education. Additional study information includes the presence or absence of asthma, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intolerance, allergy, occupational exposure, smoking habits and alcohol consumption. Objective measurements recorded are baseline height, weight, blood pressure, resting heart rate, total IgE, serum eosinophil level and computed tomography (CT) scores using the Lund-Mackay scoring system. This system uses a 0&#x02013;1&#x02013;2 score dependent upon absent, partial or complete opacification, respectively, of each individual sinus and the ostiomeatal complex, contributing to a maximum score of 12 per side. The total score of the two sides can reach a maximal 24 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in female patients with childbearing potential if in doubt of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Skin Prick Test</title><p>To assess allergic sensitisation, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network&#x02019;s (GA<sup>2</sup>LEN) standardised method of the Skin Prick Test (SPT) is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients are instructed to stop taking antihistamine medication 5&#x000a0;days before the SPT. A positive reaction to the SPT is defined as a skin reaction larger than 3&#x000a0;mm for one or more of the tested allergens (at least tree, grass, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cat, dog, moulds) and no reaction to the negative control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients will be assigned to a surgical strategy (ESS in addition to drug treatment) or a drug treatment strategy exclusively. Clinicians and patients will not be blinded to the treatment arm of the study. Those assigned to surgery will be offered ESS within 6&#x000a0;weeks of randomisation. Those assigned to drug treatment will be seen by the otorhinolaryngologist within 6&#x000a0;weeks of randomisation to define the need for additional medication. As this is a pragmatic trial, ESS refers to the surgery performed regularly by otorhinolaryngologists in The Netherlands. The extent of surgery is tailored to the extent of the disease. Drug treatment comprises any usual care medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary study outcome</title><p>The effectiveness of both interventions is evaluated by the SNOT-22 after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up. The SNOT-22 is a patient-reported measure of outcome (PROM) consisting of 22 individual custom-designed questions for use in CRS with or without nasal polyposis. The SNOT-22 covers a broad range of disease-specific HRQOL topics including physical complaints, functional limitations and emotional consequences. This questionnaire has shown to be reliable and valid in clinical practice to assess the impact of CRS on a patient&#x02019;s disease-specific HRQOL and to measure treatment-related changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary study outcomes</title><p>Clinical outcome data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months after start of treatment. All measurements are performed by an adequately trained medical researcher and research nurses. All measurements are carried out according to protocol procedures and defined standard operating procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>HRQOL measurements</title><p>To assess generic HRQOL the EQ-5D-5L is administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The questionnaire comprises five domains/questions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression. An EQ-5D-5L index can be calculated and quantifies a participant&#x02019;s health status on a scale ranging from 0 (very bad health) to 1 (perfect health). Patients are also instructed to rate their overall generic HRQOL using a Visual Analogue Scale (EuroQol-5D VAS) ranging from 0 (very bad health) to 100 (perfect health). In this study the validated Dutch translation is used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Symptoms</title><p>Total clinical symptoms, symptoms of rhinorrhoea, facial pain/headache, loss of smell and nasal blockage are measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no problem) to 10 (worst imaginable problem).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Olfactory function</title><p>The &#x02018;Sniffin&#x02019; Sticks Identification Test is used to assess olfactory performance. These twelve&#x000a0;sticks are odour-dispensing devices that resemble felt-tipped pens and are held under the participant&#x02019;s nose for 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;s. The participant must make a forced choice from a list of four options as to the nature of the odour. The score corresponds to the amount of correct answers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Nasal obstruction</title><p>The peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) method is used to quantify nasal obstruction.

Members of the independent Clinical Research Unit of the Academic Medical Centre will perform monitoring and it will be conducted according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)-GCP guidelines. A detailed study-specific monitor plan (version 3, 1 August 2016) has been formulated. The monitor plan is designed to verify that the rights and wellbeing of the participants is protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete and verifiable from the source documents and that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. Every participating site will be physically visited at least once during the study period. All other monitoring activities will be centralised to detect sources of data irregularities, by exploring the clinical trial database. The monitoring plan will be updated and revised as needed.</p><p>The risk of the current trial is estimated to be low. Patients will only be asked to participate if there is an indication for surgery as decided by their otorhinolaryngologist.

The patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time. Collected clinical data will be anonymised with unique patient identification codes.</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) to be reported are complications after SPT, ESS and adverse effects from any drug treatment started for CRSwNP.

National and international clinical guidelines advise to start with drug treatment for at least 1&#x000a0;month before considering surgical treatment. Based on clinical findings patients start a drug treatment consisting of nasal corticosteroids, eventually supplemented with a short course of systemic corticosteroids or a longer course of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Patients failing drug treatment are offered a choice between more intensive drug treatment and surgery in addition to drug treatment. Shared decision-making between the otorhinolaryngologist and the patient decides the moment that surgery is needed for relief of symptoms. Because of the chronic nature of the (mucosal) disease, the optimal treatment would be local treatment with medication combined with surgery.</p><p>Rudmik et al. have already shown in a Markov decision-tree economic evaluation that ESS would be the most cost-effective intervention compared to continued medical therapy from a long-term perspective, at least with 74% certainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Limitation of this study, however, is that this economic evaluation was not performed alongside a RCT. The current study will be the first high-quality multicentre RCT (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;238) to evaluate the role of ESS and to assess the cost-effectiveness of ESS in addition to drug treatment compared to drug treatment alone in adults with CRSwNP.</p><p>Currently, this trial is being conducted in 15 hospitals in The Netherlands. To the best knowledge of the investigators no other randomised studies to evaluate the same question are currently being performed. The objective is to demonstrate a higher HRQOL after ESS compared to drug treatment only in the treatment of CRSwNP. The outcome measurements are chosen according to experience in the field. Patient symptoms are thought to be an important parameter because patients seek medical advice in case of symptoms, regardless of the extent of disease visible on nasal imaging or with nasendoscopy. The usage of PROMs in clinical trials is growing and HRQOL is a frequently used clinical endpoint in clinical trials for CRS.</p><p>After the two-arm randomisation process, the medical intervention consists of any drug treatment that can be given to patients with CRSwNP in routine medical practice. The drug treatment purposefully is not standardised so as to stay closest to standard care. Also, patients&#x02019; need for drug treatment varies with time and extent of disease. Naturally, this design enhances diversity; however, it also enhances generalisation of the results in the real-world situation. Surgical intervention consists of ESS, which is described as any surgery performed regularly by the otorhinolaryngologists in The Netherlands. The extent of the surgery is tailored to the extent of disease. This introduces a performance bias; however, this will also be closest to normal care.</p><p>The results of this RCT are intended to create a tailored strategy and selective use of ESS in CRSwNP patients. The results will be generalised to the Dutch situation and implemented in clinical guidelines.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is currently in the first phase of patient recruitment and inclusion in 15 Dutch hospitals.
