Development of effective intervention approaches to prevent childhood obesity continues to be a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The international evidence base of the benefits of prevention is strengthening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interventions to promote health among young people have commonly been delivered via schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], in large part due to their potential to reach large numbers of children simultaneously. Much of the school-based obesity prevention interventions have centred around the provision of education, aimed at enhancing factors such as young people&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes and self efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, given the complex aetiology of childhood obesity, interventions solely targeting these individual and intrapersonal factors are likely to have limited effects. Schools represent key micro-environments in which children spend a substantial part of their time. They also have a key role in influencing their immediate and wider communities, and are a source of support for parents and families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, schools provide opportunities to go beyond providing young people with education, to provide and influence contexts which are supportive of positive health and wellbeing, consistent with Ottawa Charter principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Whilst schools are limited in the extent to which they can influence the wider impact of industry and commerce, they do provide a setting within which multi-level interventionist approaches can be developed and tested to reduce unhealthy weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A Cochrane review of multi-level school interventions based on the WHO Health Promoting Schools Framework (HPSF) provided evidence that interventions which combine curriculum change with environmental change and engagement with parents and community can have small but significant effects on outcomes such as BMI, as well as physical activity and dietary behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]</p><p id="Par13">There are significant gaps in the evidence base for child obesity prevention interventions which: target changes in the environmental context and policies; operate in geographic areas or populations where the burden is greatest; as well as interventions or programs which are implemented beyond one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The evidence of changes in BMI is limited due to unexplained heterogeneity in study findings and likelihood of small study bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Engaging parents and communities has proved more difficult to achieve than incremental school changes such as increased focus on health topics within the curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is a need to document the many contextual variations and small effects of multi-level interventions that may contribute to fundamental shifts in schools&#x02019; practices and interactions with other stakeholders. Furthermore, studies which imbed harm prevention within the context of obesity prevention are needed to ensure that school-based obesity prevention strategies have positive outcomes and do not increase body dissatisfaction or weight related impacts on mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">It has been argued that a standardised intervention is inappropriate to deliver in a school setting because schools are complex adaptive systems and their needs and interactions with interventions vary between schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The overall behaviour of the system is constantly adapting as a result of the number of decisions made every moment by many individual agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Keshavarz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] demonstrate the relevance of complex systems in the development and evaluation of health promoting school interventions. The outcomes of whole of school interventions, such as the Gatehouse Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Inclusive Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] are likely to be caused by a combination of all parts of the intervention and the way in which they interact with the characteristics of the complex system in which it is implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The community-based child obesity prevention study, <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!,</italic> emerged from a shared interest between a university research group and a local community health service with the aim of making a difference to the adverse health outcomes experienced through child disadvantage in an inner city area of Melbourne, Australia. In this particular community context, the population was characterised by a socioeconomically and culturally diverse population, and relative socioeconomic disadvantage associated with a significantly higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (31%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> developed with a focus on the need for a complex intervention and a rigorous mixed method study design, to meet the needs of local and state-wide public health decision-makers, and to ensure that the approach and methods were suitable and inclusive within such a diverse and disadvantaged population.</p><p id="Par16">
<italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> was an evidence-based, multi-level, child health promotion and obesity prevention program evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial study design. The 5&#x000a0;year study received funding to support a 3.5&#x000a0;year intervention program with 24 primary (elementary) schools and a mixed method approach to evaluation. The project addressed the issue of child overweight and obesity by working closely with school communities to develop integrated, multi-level interventions guided by the limited evidence available in 2005. In contrast to many previous school-based obesity prevention projects, an extensive research component was incorporated to evaluate the physical, environmental, social, behavioural and financial impacts and outcomes of the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study context</title><p id="Par17">The City of Moreland, a local government municipality (population of 135,205 in 2006) is located 8.5&#x000a0;km north west of the central business district of Melbourne, in South Eastern Australia.

This municipality also has one of the highest levels of residents who belong to the Catholic and Islamic faiths (36% and 10%, respectively, compared to 30% and 4% across Melbourne). However, there is marked variation in demographic and economic background across the municipality, and it has shifted over time towards a higher socio-economic profile as housing demand and inner-urban location has resulted in families with higher median incomes moving into the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Governance</title><p id="Par19">
<italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> was funded by three departments of the state government (Sport and Recreation, Health, and Education). Intervention staff (Community Development Workers) were employed by Merri Community Health Services<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> and research and evaluation staff were employed by Deakin University (2004&#x02013;7) &#x02013; relocating to University of Melbourne (2007&#x02013;9). This model ensured that Merri Community Health Services had influence and leadership on the design and implementation of the intervention, in partnership with the schools, maximising the chance of high impact and sustainability. The implementation of the trial and evaluation study was governed by a project team comprising both researchers and Merri Community Health staff who consulted regularly with school staff, families and community leaders. Key research decisions were referred to the full team of 11 investigators, including representation from each discipline and content area relevant to the conduct of the study. Additional advice was provided by an internal Merri Community Health Services Staff Advisory Committee during the development of the study, and an external committee of government stakeholders which met annually.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Theoretical frameworks</title><p id="Par21">The design and implementation of the intervention was underpinned by the WHO Health Promoting Schools Framework, an evidence informed decision making process, and the International Obesity Task Force &#x02018;10 guiding principles for obesity prevention&#x02019;, which state that health promotion initiatives be empowering, participatory, holistic, inter-sectoral, equitable, sustainable and multi-strategy. The Health Promoting Schools Framework (HPSF) is based on health promotion theory and is consistent with a socio-environmental theoretical framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. HPSF has been widely used and developed to assist schools to address health issues over the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The advantage of the HPSF is that it is designed to guide multilevel interventions to account for environmental, sociocultural and individual influences on health behaviours. It allows for a community participatory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] which was extended in this study to include models of cultural competence to guide the engagement of the culturally diverse community in the Moreland area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. &#x0201c;Cultural and linguistic competence is a set of congruent behaviours, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross-cultural situations&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par22">Schools were supported to develop <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy</italic> programs according to the fixed requirement of a whole school combined focus on increasing fruit, vegetable and water consumption, increasing physical activity and encouraging positive self-esteem in children. Within the intervention schools, the school community determined the exact content of the program strategies, based on interventions that had demonstrated evidence of implementation or success in previous studies, or innovative programs which had a strong likelihood of success. The <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> study offered schools the support of Community Development Workers (CDWs) for the 3.5&#x000a0;year intervention period from Jan 2006 &#x02013; June 2009 who acted as knowledge brokers, providing information and guiding schools' customised development of intervention program strategies and their efforts to resource them. Three full time CDWs provided support to 4 schools each in the first 2&#x000a0;years. This then reduced to 2 full time CDWs providing targeted support to schools based on need. This support ensured that the strategies followed health promotion principles in creating a supportive and sustainable environment, customised for the school community to achieve changes in relation to the school system, policy, curriculum, environment, and child behavior and health outcomes. The CDWs were in turn supported by the Research Program Manager (LGi) to enable shared problem solving and links with evidence-informed approaches.</p><p id="Par23">The aims of the intervention were to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par24">Reduce overweight and obesity and improve child health and wellbeing</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Improve child and family dietary intake, increase child and family physical activity and reduce child sedentary behaviours</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Improve knowledge and skills of school staff, family and children regarding sustainable strategies for healthy eating, physical activity and environmental changes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Develop sustainable positive changes in school, home and community environments (system integration, policies, physical, social, and community connections)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">Examine contextual and programmatic features of the intervention that impact on results.</p></list-item></list>

Intervention effects are estimated based on the intention-to-treat principle with participants and schools analysed according the trial arm they were randomised to. Descriptive adiposity scores were generated using WHO cut points, with bmi z-scores as the adiposity outcome to model the intervention effect. For continuous outcomes (e.g. bmi z-score), the intervention effect was estimated using random effects linear regression models fitted by maximum likelihood estimation to allow for clustering. For dichotomous outcomes such as prevalence of overweight/obesity, marginal logistic regression models were fitted using generalized estimating equations with information sandwich (&#x0201c;robust&#x0201d;) estimates of standard error, specifying an exchangeable correlation structure. Both crude analyses and analyses adjusted for prognostic factors were run. As the study used a repeated cross-sectional design, analyses of continuous outcomes were adjusted for baseline level of the corresponding outcome by using the mean score for the school at baseline as a predictor variable in the models. Binary outcomes were adjusted for the proportion with the characteristic of interest in the study cluster at baseline. As the baseline physical activity variables differed to those used at follow up, the baseline school means for the original measures of physical and sedentary activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] were used as surrogate school means in the analyses of follow-up data. Models were also adjusted for child age and sex, socio-economic position ((SEP) measured by maternal education, residential SEIFA (Australian Bureau of Statistics Socio-economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage), and ethnicity (only English spoken at home). Statistical analyses were conducted with STATA 10.1 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Tex).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Environmental outcomes</title><p id="Par60">Community Development Workers kept records of intervention strategies implemented in schools. Descriptive statistical analyses of school policies, environments and practices were undertaken using school questionnaire data.

Recruitment/consent rate within schools ranged from 38.6% to 64.3%. Data were collected from 1460 (94.9%) recruited comparison children and 1426 (94.4%) recruited intervention children. There was wide variation in consent rates across schools. This is likely to be due to a range of factors but did show a positive correlation with SEIFA for comparison schools. It is possible that this impacted effect estimates. At baseline there were no observed differences between trial arms in the proportion of children with overseas-born mothers, but the intervention arm had higher levels of maternal education, smaller family size, and fewer possessing a health care card. At follow-up there were no observed differences between trial arms in maternal or paternal education or the proportion of children with Australian born mothers. Smaller differences in family size, healthcare card and family employment status remained (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

As part of the intervention process, many of the schools chose to expand their canteen policy to include a broader school-wide healthy eating policy to include strategies such as healthy fundraising, drink water policies and replacement of confectionary as in-class rewards. A question about a school-wide healthy eating policy was subsequently added to the follow up questionnaire. Intervention schools were more likely to report having a written physical activity policy at follow-up (11/12) compared with comparison schools (6/10), and to show an increase since baseline (see Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

There was no associated increase in parent-reported costs to families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Principal exit interviews</title><p id="Par77">Overall, principals across all intervention schools reported that the intervention model trialled in <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> was feasible and acceptable to schools and the principals themselves. For some schools, the program acted as a catalyst and driver for changes beyond the parameters of the program. The baseline data provided by the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> program were used by many principals to support their efforts to achieve change and to direct them to where the changes were needed. The principals were confident that the changes introduced as part of the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> program were sustainable. There was also a willingness of principals to share ideas with other principals and in many cases to share resources.</p><p id="Par78">Parents were described by principals as both a significant barrier and a significant support to introducing changes into the school, depending on the school community and the proposed strategies. For more dramatic changes some principals found it easier to announce that they would be introduced at the start of the following year. For example, one school started a new year by completely removing all of the canteen items and replacing them with only three healthy lunch options. Principals reported that the parents of children in the younger years were more accepting of change and there was a gradual acceptance of the changes across the whole school community over time so that after 3.5&#x000a0;years of the intervention a generational shift had occurred and for the majority of the school community the changes were actually the norm and resistance was negligible.</p><p id="Par79">From the principals&#x02019; perspective, the impact of the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy</italic> strategies and evaluation processes on student body image were low, and self-esteem was not described as a concern as it was addressed through school-wide programs. There were no targeted strategies described for reducing sedentary behaviours. Children were described in many schools as having an important role in introducing changes such as new canteen menu options and healthy fundraising options to the broader school community. For example, one school worked with their local caf&#x000e9; lunch supplier to replace the traditional canteen lunch options with healthy home cooked options such as zucchini slice. The menu was selected by the students following taste tests which helped to overcome scepticism from parents and teachers about the proposed changes. One principal referred to this as an &#x0201c;unanticipated outcome&#x02026;a lot of kids have a lot of influence over their parents&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par80">Cultural diversity and mixed socioeconomic status was common across the school communities albeit with different characteristics in each school. In many cases there was low parent involvement in school activities. The <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> model allowed for these variations because of the capacity to customize the approach for the school community. For example, one school introduced a vegetable garden for use by the school families to grow and harvest fresh, seasonal food. The increase in self-esteem for those involved was evident in a career aspirations survey carried out by the school. In another school, car-pooling was introduced to support child participation in out-of-school sport activities.</p><p id="Par81">An unanticipated outcome described by some of the program principals was the fact that following the changes there was less need for discipline and there were very positive relationships between staff and students arising from the teacher involvement in the physical activities introduced by the school as part of the program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par82">This study assessed the effectiveness of a low investment, child health promotion and obesity prevention intervention, <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> that aimed to improve school environments, policy development and implementation, parent engagement, health behaviours, child wellbeing and adiposity. It addressed a gap in the evidence by targeting an inner urban, culturally diverse and low socioeconomic area where children were at greatest risk of overweight and obesity.</p><p id="Par83">Significant reductions in overweight and obesity were observed over time at all schools, but there was no statistically significant difference in mean BMI between trial arms at follow-up in 2009. A null effect for BMI has been shown in other large studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], including the very large Texas Fitness Now program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and the HEALTHY study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Investigators on the Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) study advocated for the importance of studying mediation of the intervention effect and subsequent relevance of theory driven interventions following the minimal impacts of their school-based intervention undertaken in the South West of England between 2011 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Given that <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> took the full 3.5&#x000a0;years to implement a comprehensive range of intervention strategies across the schools, it is also likely that although the environmental changes were achieved, the final data collection occurred too early to detect the full extent of the impact of these hypothesised mediators on child level changes. This reflects the time needed for changes to embed within a complex system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Inchley and colleagues in their process evaluation of a European Network of Health Promoting Schools in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], note that &#x02018;there needs to be greater recognition of the time it takes to achieve such change and the support schools need to actively engage the whole school community in pursuing the HPS ideology&#x02019;(p70). Longer follow-up periods may be required to capture emergent outcomes which interact with system characteristics to become greater than the sum of interventions parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Alternatively, it could mean that the HPS approach needs to be reviewed to identify opportunities to achieve greater and more rapid change. At a broader level, the potential of school-based interventions may be limited by the fact that the major drivers of the obesity epidemic are changes in food production, marketing, and distribution that lie well beyond the purview of schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">The <italic>fun n healthy in Moreland!</italic> intervention was intended to provide a catalyst to stimulate schools to address the integrated domains of health, education, learning and wellbeing, while acknowledging the social, cultural and other drivers that operate within a school environment. It didn&#x02019;t approach the issue of obesity prevention with a defined program aiming for a quick fix, but instead acknowledged the variation in school community contexts. In doing so, it enabled schools to identify solutions that were likely to be sustainable and pragmatic, aware of the complexities that operate for school communities with different funding models and the need for a shift from awareness to policy to outcomes. This approach is consistent with the Health Promoting Schools Framework. It also incorporates the criteria for success identified in a process evaluation review of Health Promoting School studies - customising the intervention to the context, and providing ongoing training and support to teachers to develop and implement programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It foreshadowed the focus on environmental changes, equity and costs advocated in the 2011 update of the Cochrane review of interventions for preventing obesity in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par85">The cross-sectional analyses at follow up provided evidence that children at intervention schools consumed more serves of fruit per day and parents provided lunchboxes that were more likely to include a drink of water and less likely to include a sweetened drink than children at comparison schools. In this Australian context, it is customary for children to bring a packed lunch to school and where there is a canteen or tuckshop children do make purchases, however schools do not provide lunches. Given that intervention schools tended to target healthy eating first in the development and implementation of their intervention strategies, it is not surprising that the longer period of exposure to changes in the food environment translated into changes in food behaviours, although there were no intervention effects on other measures of dietary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">An intervention effect in terms of physical and sedentary activity was not apparent, but the measurement of physical activity in children is problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Children have difficulty recalling discrete episodes of physical activity and cannot accurately report frequency, intensity or duration of activity. Much of the physical activity of children is incidental activity and difficult to measure. The general activity measure, time outside after school has been shown to be a useful proxy for physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], but it does not include inside activities after school that may be ignored (eg dance/aerobics/swimming in indoor centre). The cross-sectional findings for individual behaviours and health outcomes were supported by the smaller longitudinal cohort analysis.</p><p id="Par87">It is acknowledged there may have been a seasonal effect on the physical activity and eating behaviour results given that data collection extended across seasons but that this should not have differentiated between intervention and comparison schools. It is possible that as two comparison schools withdrew from the study (one after baseline data collection), there may have been an artificial inflation of the intervention effect. It is also possible that some children within the intervention schools were not exposed to intervention and conversely some children in comparison schools may have benefited from health promotion strategies employed by the school. This is positive in terms of promoting healthy school environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but highlights the challenges of conducting intervention trials in community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Matching schools on religious status or other factors could have increased power but only if the correlation between schools within matched pairs was sufficiently large to compensate for the loss of degrees of freedom incurred if a corresponding matched analysis was used. A matched sample would also have meant that if one school drops out, as did happen in this study, the matched pair would have been lost from the analysis as well.</p><p id="Par88">While the specific health promoting actions of schools varied with the differing strengths, needs and culture of individual schools, we identified real changes in school policies, environments and practices to improve healthy eating and increase physical activity. Overall the proportion of intervention schools with written physical activity and school-wide healthy eating policies was markedly higher than in comparison schools. Intervention schools also instituted a greater number of health promoting practices targeting students, staff and parents. These changes represent the success of this complex intervention in achieving sustainable change in school community environments and systems. Engagement of parents is recognised as a highly challenging component of Health Promoting Schools interventions and an important characteristic of complex school systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">Future evaluation is necessary to seek evidence of sustainability of changes to school policies, environments and practices. A decision was made not to strongly brand the program within the schools to allow them to &#x02018;own&#x02019; the changes and to ensure that they continued beyond the period of the study. Exit interviews with principals of intervention schools supported this approach with demonstrated changes in many schools in the environment, programs and the social norms of the school since the commencement of the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> program. Principals reported varied levels of changes from low to high impact and low to high sustainability. Many changes were less policy based and more informal in their development. There was a clear lack of strategies to reduce sedentary behaviours, perhaps because at the time of the study, the predominant sedentary activities of TV watching and video games, were less under the schools&#x02019; influence or control. Some school communities had a high proportion of families committed to healthy eating and physical activity which supported changes in the schools. Otherwise the changes were dependent on the passion and commitment of the principal and a preparedness to counter opposition from the parents. Even though the HPS approach promotes a participatory approach to decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], dramatic changes occurred when there was a show of leadership by school principals. Where negotiation resulted in compromises it was less successful and had less impact. However, there were many examples of children being involved in decision making which was reported by school principals and Community Development Workers as helpful in overcoming parent and teacher scepticism. This shows the potential for child participatory methods to direct school-based changes, particularly when appropriate support is provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Linking strategies to other key messages such as an environmental policy was also found to be successful in the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy in Moreland!</italic> trial. For example, introducing &#x02018;Nude Food Days&#x02019; when children could only bring package free food to school reduced waste and resulted in a greater reliance on fresh, unprocessed foods. These different pathways to change and differing roles of the practitioners and stakeholders, reflect the variability and challenges inherent in a complex intervention placed within a complex system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">A strength of the <italic>fun &#x02018;n healthy</italic> intervention approach was the relatively low cost of the provision of a Community Development Worker (CDW) (equating to $229 per student across the 3.5 years of the intervention, or $65 per child per year). It was also a very flexible approach allowing schools to identify where they would best be able to instigate changes resulting in fewer demands of school time and resources. The CDW also synchronized with programs that were already funded and ongoing, such as &#x02018;Go for your Life&#x02019;, a state funded award scheme.</p><p id="Par91">The cluster randomized trial design enabled the assembly of intervention and comparison groups that were similar in measureable and unmeasurable attributes. Further protection from confounding was gained as the comparison group was followed contemporaneously with the intervention group, making this study design robust to outcome variations over time. Although larger than many other school-based trials, the comparatively small number of schools in this study may have limited the detection of impacts. The smaller size of the intervention schools compared to comparison schools may have inflated the intervention effect. However, the demographic profile at follow-up was not markedly different and inclusion of socio-demographic characteristics into the multivariable analysis had little impact on the effect estimates.</p><p id="Par92">This intervention study was implemented over a period of time where there was a heightened media attention on childhood obesity, an increasing investment of State Government funding into non-government organisation led initiatives for healthy eating and physical activity. Mid-way through the study period, a statewide school awards program on healthy eating and physical activity policies and behaviour change strategies was introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This is likely to have had a contaminating effect and to have therefore lessened differences between intervention and comparison schools, highlighting how contextual factors can impact on intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par93">Building knowledge and expertise in preventing childhood obesity continues to be a public health priority. Despite the growing evidence from school-based interventions, the majority of studies focus on individual and intrapersonal change, often with interventions of less than one year duration. This 3.5&#x000a0;year intervention demonstrates that it is possible to effect system level change and some improvements in health and wellbeing outcomes from investments that focus on the school environment and aim to be long-term, evidence-based and encompassing of the complexities that are real for schools, families and in particular those who are less economically privileged. However, only limited translation of those environmental changes into improved behaviours and weight status were evident at follow up. A long term commitment to addressing the needs of school communities, and a knowledge-broker/ community development approach, is likely to be most effective in achieving policy, curriculum, behavior and health outcome change.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HPSF</term><def><p id="Par6">Health Promoting Schools Framework</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEP</term><def><p id="Par7">Socioeconomic Position</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEIFA</term><def><p id="Par8">Socio-economic Index for Areas</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDW</term><def><p id="Par9">Community Development Worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AFLY5</term><def><p id="Par10">Active for Life Year 5</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p id="Par11">National Institute for Health Research.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par20">Recently renamed Merri Health</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par66">The original baseline paper for this study used IOTF cut points and so the adiposity results can&#x02019;t be compared to the results reported here.
