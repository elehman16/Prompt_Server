Affected patients are exposed to renal functional deterioration, recurrent infections, and repeated endourologic interventions. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the treatment of choice in these cases [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. First reported in 1976, PCNL was progressively established as a procedure performed in the prone position [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This position was chosen intuitively, based on anatomical considerations related to the posterior retroperitoneal location of the kidneys, the short access to posterior calyces situated on the avascular line of Br&#x000f6;del, the reduced risks of interposition of other viscera along the working tract, and the large surface area for puncture [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Prone PCNL became widely popularized and totally replaced open renal stones surgery, emerging as the standard operation and exclusive position for 2 decades. Aiming to reduce patient-, anesthesia- and surgery-related inconveniences of the prone position, Valdivia et al. [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] described the performance of PCNL with the patient in the supine position in 1987. Supine PCNL enables a single positioning throughout the entire operation, easier patient ventilation, protection of the patient from positional injuries, more convenient access to the patient by the anesthesiologist, an improved ergonomic environment for the surgical urologist (who may be seated while operating), and an easy endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (ECIRS) approach if needed [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advantages, the popularity of supine PCNL among urologists worldwide remains modest and is still considered a &#x02018;new&#x02019; rather than an alternative position [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may be accounted for by a conservative viewpoint on the part of physicians and by the traditional consensus that treatment of a large and complex stone should be by a prone PCNL [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This paradigm was challenged in a recent study that revealed effective endoscopic surveillance of the intrarenal collecting system through a lower calyx supine PCNL [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>This report analyzes the effect that supine PCNL implementation has had in terms of the outcome of the initial series of patients, and it addresses various issues related to the assimilation of this new approach in two medical centers with dedicated endourologic facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>The registries of patients treated by PCNL in 2 academic institutions were analyzed from January 2011, when supine PCNL was first implemented, until October 2016. The data also included an initial prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared supine to prone PCNL between January 2011 and November 2012, after which all patients referred for PCNL were scheduled for the supine position unless there were special considerations for operating in the prone position (e.g. other organ interposition on the planned puncture tract, horseshoe kidney with lower calyx and isthmic adjacent stones, hepato- or splenomegaly with lateral kidney wrapping in patients with severe portal hypertension, etc.). Our percutaneous treatment indications conform to the international guidelines [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and patients presenting with indications for bilateral percutaneous treatment are offered a single-session bilateral PCNL.</p><p>There were 255 PCNLs performed on 248 patients, of which 214 were performed in the supine position and 41 in the prone position. This group includes the RCT of the first 51 PCNLs, 27 of them supine and 24 prone, according to the statistical powered design and randomization. The current study was designed to analyze the 2 RCT study groups as well as all the supine PCNLs that followed it until study closure. The RCT groups had been compared in terms of demographics, preoperative clinical data, operative time, postoperative outcome, hospital stay, rate of tubeless procedures, stone-free rates (SFR) as demonstrated on postoperative non-contrast computerized tomography (NCCT), and complications as classified by the Clinical Research Office of the Endourology Society (CROES) Clavien validated score [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The supine operations were analyzed separately for outcome and rate of supine position implementation. In addition, in order to assess whether there had been any changes in outcome over time, the entire supine series was arbitrarily divided into 2 groups for comparison: one group included patients operated during the first 3 years of this 6-year study and the other group included patients operated during the last 3 years.</p><p>The surgical team was comprised of 2 chief surgeons, 4 assistant surgeons, 8 anesthesiologists and 8 assistant nurses. At the end of each operation, each of them indicated which approach they preferred, supine or prone.</p><p>All procedures were intended to be accomplished in a tubeless fashion whenever possible. That means avoiding postoperative nephrostomy tubes while leaving an internal stent with an external tether. The supine position involves placement of the patient at the edge of the table, with a flank elevation of 15&#x02013;20 degrees and the ipsilateral arm padded on an arm support while the legs are in either an asymmetrical lithotomy position or slightly abducted in a straight position. Using a flexible cystoscope, a guidewire followed by a ureteral catheter is inserted into the renal pelvis and a Foley 14 Fr catheter is left in the bladder. A retrograde pyelography is performed, and the puncture is carried out under combined fluoroscopic-ultrasonic guidance. Once access is gained, a guidewire is passed down to the bladder and the tract is dilated by a balloon, leaving a working sheath of 24&#x02013;30FR inside the kidney. Ultrasonic and pneumatic lithotripsy is carried out through rigid nephroscopy, followed by flexible nephroscopy and real-time fluoroscopy to ensure complete stone clearance. A nephrostomy tube is left only in cases of significant bleeding or an expected need for a second-look procedure. Otherwise, an internal stent is placed and the wound is sutured. Further details on our techniques have been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>For patients left with a nephrostomy tube, NCCT was performed on the first postoperative day in order to decide whether there was a need for a second-look PCNL. Otherwise, the patients were released home and the stents were extracted by the patients themselves during the week after the operation. Follow-up in the outpatient clinic at one month postoperatively included a complete blood count, creatinine test, urinary culture and NCCT. Since the wounds were closed with resorbable sutures, there was no need for their removal.</p><p>Statistical assessment was by comparison of continuous data by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and discrete variables by Fisher's exact and chi-square tests. A P value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Statistical assessment of the participants in the RCT conducted between January 2011 and November 2012 that compared supine to prone PCNL revealed that they had similar demographics, clinical data and outcome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table 1</xref>).

Since then, PCNL has been undergoing a continuous process of implementing new technologies and devices which, together with the experience gained in high-volume centers and shared through educational programs, have resulted in increased safety, efficacy and decreased operating time and hospital stay [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This wide popularization of the procedure resulted in not only understanding its advantages over open nephrolithotomy but also in recognizing the inconveniences related to the patient's prone position on the operating table. For example, the operation begins in the lithotomy position and needs to be changed after the initial preparations to the prone position. Moreover, limitations are imposed upon the anesthesiologist in terms of access to the patient for providing ventilation and monitoring the airways during the operation. Other drawbacks include relatively increased pressure in ventilation, inadequate conditions for combining PCNL with an RIRS procedure and ergonomic inconvenience for the surgeon. These circumstances inevitably led to the search for solutions of problems related to patient position.</p><p>The solution that was ultimately postulated by Valdivia et al. [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in the late 90s consisted of the substantial modification of switching the patient's position from prone to supine. A supine position addresses all the disadvantages related to the prone position listed above. Specifically, it allows a single positioning of the patients throughout the entire operation, it facilitates patient monitoring and ventilation by the anesthesiologist, it enables a combination of PCNL and RIRS, and it provides the surgeon with the option of operating in a seated position [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The initial series of 557 patients successfully treated in the supine position was followed by other studies confirming that there were no limitations in terms of stone size, bilateral same-session performance, tubeless approach and treatment of pediatric patients [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advantages, the popularity of supine PCNL among urologists worldwide remains modest, reaching an overall implementation rate of around only 20% [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to a 2008 CROES study, supine PCNL is practiced solely in Europe and South America and not at all in North America [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may not only be due to a conservative attitude of the endourologic community, but also to a traditional consensus that treatment of a large and complex stone should be done through an upper calyx access with the patient in a prone position [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This consensus, however, appears to rely upon expert opinions derived from a series of prone PCNLs, rather than upon updated evidenced-based data. A recent study that compared supine to prone PCNLs challenged this paradigm, revealing that a lower calyx access in the supine position allows effective endoscopic surveillance of the intrarenal collecting system, similar to that of an upper calyx access in a prone PCNL [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The present study describes the implementation of supine PCNLs that was introduced in 2011, in 2 academic referral centers with a high level of expertise in prone PCNLs. The leading endourologists have completed a two days observational accommodation to the procedure in European centers. Because there were few high evidence-based studies in the literature on the positional issue until 2011, our plan for introducing supine PNL started with conducting a RCT. This trial yielded similar clinical outcomes for both the prone and supine positions. Taken together with the advantages of the supine position in terms of anesthetic and surgical considerations, we subsequently adopted the supine PCNL as our procedure of choice. Our current results reflect a period of progressive accumulation of experience over time, leading to a shortening of operative time and hospital stay, fewer postoperative ancillary procedures to render patients stone-free, and an increase in the rate of procedures performed without leaving a postoperative nephrostomy tube in place. Tubeless procedures are reportedly associated with shorter hospitalization [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is entirely possible that the increase in the rate of tubeless procedures in our institutions contributed to the shortening of hospital stay during the last 3 study years. Finally, the surgeons and anesthesiologists involved in the treatment of these patients overwhelmingly preferred the supine PCNL.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the transition process from prone to supine PNL and by that, it may enrich the general knowledge regarding adoption of this approach in other institutions.</p><p>We are aware that our study has some limitations. One of them is that most of the enrolled patients were assessed retrospectively. However, combining the findings of the RCT with a large series of consecutive patients that succeeded them provided us with what we believe are substantial data to support the conclusions of our study. The lack of standardization in assessing the need for blood transfusion between the participating institutions could pose a limitation, although, the rate of blood transfusions was similar and decreased significantly during the last 3 years of the study in both of them.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the supine PCNL approach has already passed the point of needing to prove safety and feasibility. It is an established procedure and one that is easily implemented in centers with experience in PCNLs. It facilitates the solutions for a variety of anesthesiology and endourology issues, and may be routinely used for all kinds of calculi. Our enhanced surgical outcomes with supine PCNL may contribute to further popularization of this procedure among endourologic surgeons.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Esther Eshkol, MA, is thanked for editorial assistance.</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>CONFLICTS OF
