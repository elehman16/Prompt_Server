It is evident from the current study that patients who received dexmedetomidine infusion have oligemic surgical field and better visibility when compared to GFEN patients. These findings can be attributed to the fact that dexmedetomidine reduces sympathetic activity, resulting in lower blood pressure and reduced HR thereby decreasing blood loss at the surgical site, thus improving the quality of the surgical field with better surgeon satisfaction.</p><p>The main finding of this study was that intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine significantly attenuates the pressor response to intubation, extubation, and recovery as shown by that the MAP and HR which were significantly lower throughout the intraoperative and early recovery period in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the GFEN.</p><p>These results are in accordance with those of Feld <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who studied twenty bariatric patients undergoing surgery for open gastric bypass; they used fentanyl 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h or dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus followed by 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h combined with desflurane; they found that mean blood pressure and HR were lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared with GFEN and also dexmedetomidine group provides better postoperative analgesia and this is also in line with this study.</p><p>Furthermore, Rao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assessed hemodynamic and anesthetic advantages on 81 patients who underwent elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia; they were given a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 1 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h until closure of the surgical incision; they found that there was a significant reduction in HR and systolic blood pressure following the loading dose of dexmedetomidine and also in the intraoperative period; this is strongly in line with this study.</p><p>Furthermore, in accordance with the current study, Aksu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared the effect of IV dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg compared to fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg given 5 min before extubation on airway reflexes and hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation during rhinoplasty in forty patients; they suggest that dexmedetomidine was more effective in attenuating airway reflex response to tracheal intubation and maintaining hemodynamic stability without prolonging recovery compared to fentanyl.</p><p>On the other hand, Turgut <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] compared dexmedetomidine 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus dose and 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion versus fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion in patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy. MA<italic>P</italic> values in the dexmedetomidine group were significantly higher than the GFEN and this in contrast to this study where MAP was statistically lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the GFEN, and this may be explained by the lower dexmedetomidine dose they used compared to the dose in this study which is 1 &#x003bc;g/kg as loading and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h as maintenance.</p><p>The bradycardiac effect of dexmedetomidine is primarily mediated by a decrease in sympathetic tone and partly by baroreceptor reflex and enhanced vagal activity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Regarding postoperative analgesia in this study, there was a statistically significant difference in the VAS between the two study groups with better score and analgesia in the dexmedetomidine group compared to GFEN in the immediate recovery period, after extubation in the recovery room R0, after 30 min (R30), and 1 h (R1 h) but was comparable between the two groups after 2 h (R 2 h); this is in accordance with a study done by Gurbet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who investigated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine infusion for postoperative analgesia after total abdominal hysterectomy and concluded that continuous IV dexmedetomidine during abdominal surgery provides effective postoperative analgesia and reduces postoperative morphine requirements.</p><p>Regarding sedation, patients in the dexmedetomidine group were more sedated than GFEN, and these results were in line with Jung <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] who found that Modified OAA/S scores of sedation were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine infusion group after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, and this could be explained that dexmedetomidine has sedative and analgesia-sparing effects through central actions in the locus coeruleus and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>
