interface (BCI)-based functional electrical stimulation (FES) on balance and gait function
in patients with stroke. [Subjects] Subjects were randomly allocated to a BCI-FES group
(n=5) and a FES group (n=5). [Methods] The BCI-FES group received ankle dorsiflexion
training with FES according to a BCI-based program for 30 minutes per day for 5 days. The
FES group received ankle dorsiflexion training with FES for the same duration. [Results]
Following the intervention, the BCI-FES group showed significant differences in Timed Up
and Go test value, cadence, and step length on the affected side. The FES group showed no
significant differences after the intervention. However, there were no significant
differences between the 2 groups after the intervention. [Conclusion] The results of this
study suggest that BCI-based FES training is a more effective exercise for balance and
gait function than FES training alone in patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Brain-computer interface</kwd><kwd>Functional electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease in which the blood supply to the brain is blocked, or
in which hemorrhages develop in the brain. Common features of the disorder are hemiplegia,
motor impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, speech disorders,
visual-perception disabilities, and dysphasia<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because less than 43% of body weight is supported by the affected
lower extremity while standing and because of asymmetrical muscle strength, patients with
stroke develop balance control problems due to an asymmetric posture. Thus, stroke patients
develop an abnormal gait due to the weakened ability to bear weight on the affected side
while walking and because of impaired balance control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Foot drop is a common feature of the gait of stroke patients and implies a partial or
complete loss of motor function, resulting in dorsiflexion. Patients with foot drop
excessively lift their hip joints or adopt a circumduction gait during the swing phase in
order to prevent dragging the foot on the ground while walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These gaits are not only dangerous but also require maximum energy
consumption and cause patients to walk slower and suffer more falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) uses electrical stimulation to induce muscle
contraction, in order to induce functional actions of non-innervated muscles in patients
with stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal damage. FES is applied on the tibialis anterior
muscle to enhance coordination capability during a gait cycle, and to increase the angle
range of the ankle joint and walking speed, thus improving the quality of gait in patients
with foot drop<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the fields of human-computer interaction that
concerns investigation of the interaction between a human and a computer. The BCI measures
brainwave signals in a specific state to gain singularities or characteristics, and then
classifies them. The classified components are then converted to common control signals to
control computers and equipment. In other words, this technology analyzes brain waves, in
real-time, as the brain attempts to control equipment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, BCI technology has been applied to rehabilitation training using FES, robots, and
other assistance tools in BCI feedback training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of BCI-based
FES on balance ability and gait function, when applied to patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ten subjects from S hospital in Seoul, Korea, all of whom had been diagnosed with chronic
hemiparetic stroke, were enrolled in this study. The subjects were provided with a full
explanation of the experimental procedure, and all subjects provided written consent
signifying voluntary participation. This study was approved by the Sahmyook University Human
Studies Committee (SYUIRB2012-010). The detailed inclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
more than 6 months after clinical diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic hemiparetic stroke,
(2) more than 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and (3) able to walk independently for more than 10 m<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
severe hemineglect, (2) history or current diagnoses of other neurologic diseases or
musculoskeletal conditions, and (3) allergic reaction to FES. The general characteristics of
the subjects in the BCI-FES group were as follows: 4 men, mean age of 43.6&#x02005;years, mean
height of 173.1&#x02005;cm, mean weight of 70.3&#x02005;kg, stroke onset of 16.4 months, right-side
hemiplegia in 2 patients, infarction-type stroke in 2 patients, and hemorrhagic-type stroke
in 3 patients. The characteristics of the subjects in the FES group were as follows: 4 men,
mean age of 50.2&#x02005;years, mean height of 166.2&#x02005;cm, mean weight of 65.6&#x02005;kg, stroke onset of 8.4
months, right-side hemiplegia in 2 patients, infarction-type stroke in 1 patient, and
hemorrhagic-type stroke in 4 patients. There were no significant differences between the
groups.</p><p>The subjects in both the BCI-FES and FES groups participated in the program according to a
designated schedule, and 1 research assistant for training and 2 research assistants for
measuring were recruited for this study. They were educated and trained in the use of
equipment, measurement methods, and training programs prior to the experiment, in order to
minimize possible errors during the experiment. The BCI-FES group received ankle
dorsiflexion training with FES as per the BCI-based program for 30 minutes per day, for 5
days. The FES group received ankle dorsiflexion training with FES for the same duration.</p><p>In the BCI-FES group, FES was applied to train the participants when they were
concentrating on a dorsiflexing ankle on the monitor screen, and the (sensorimotor rhythm
(SMR) + mid-Beta)/theta pattern was generated through brain waves. This equipment consists
of a monitor screen for the subjects, a brain wave measurement tool PolyG-I (Laxtha, Inc.,
Daejeon, Republic of Korea), a laptop to record and process brain wave signals, a USB output
board to link the brain wave signals to the FES when concentration occurred, FES and
electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors to receive brain wave information when the concentration
was high, and cables.</p><p>Since subjects are easily influenced by external environmental factors, such as
temperature, location, intensity of illumination, noise, and smell, participants were
provided with separate spaces without external factors. To measure brain waves, electrodes
were attached to the frontopolar 1 (Fp1) and frontopolar 2 (Fp2) regions. A reference
electrode was attached behind the right earlobe, and a ground electrode was attached behind
the left earlobe. For FES training, an inactive electrode was attached to the proximal
tibialis anterior (5&#x02005;cm from the lower portion of the fibular head), which is an antagonist
of the plantarflexor muscles, while an active electrode was attached to the distal tibialis
anterior (lateral and 5&#x02005;cm from the upper portion of the fibula). The subjects sat
comfortably on a chair with armrests and concentrated on moving their ankles by looking at a
monitor screen displaying a dorsiflexing ankle. According to the neurophysiologic brain wave
index, the degree of concentration was analyzed using the brain wave concentration index.
For measuring brain waves, the concentration index was quantified as in the formula above.
In a state of concentration, the theta rhythm decreases. On the other hand, the SMR
(12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz) and mid-Beta rhythm (16&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz) increase. The SMR denotes the unfocused attention
ability to be cautious about one&#x02019;s surroundings, while mid-Beta rhythm denotes the focused
attention ability to be cautious about one&#x02019;s surroundings. Therefore, the concentration
index was quantified as a ratio between the SMR and mid-Beta rhythm over the theta rhythm as
in the formula above.</p><p>Before beginning the experiment, the investigator passively modulated the stimulated
current intensity frequency 35&#x02005;Hz, and pulsed with 250 &#x003bc;s from 1 mA to 50 mA according to
the response from the subject&#x02019;s ankle joint. To gauge the focused threshold of the subjects,
10 rounds of focused inspections were implemented before the training to obtain and input
the average concentration index threshold into the computer. Subsequently, the subjects were
instructed to focus on the movement of the ankle on the monitor screen. When the
concentration index value exceeded the threshold, this information was transferred to the
USB output board, and the FES equipment was turned on. However, when the concentration index
value did not exceed the threshold, this information was transferred to the USB output
board, and the FES equipment was turned off, which resulted in FES as per the degree of
concentration of the subject. When the concentration index value exceeded the threshold to
turn on the FES equipment, FES based on concentration was set to last 5 seconds in order to
avoid causing muscle fatigue.</p><p>Microstim (Medel GmbH, Inc., Germany) is a BCI-FES-based system that can be used for FES
training. This equipment has an adjustable frequency, contraction time, relaxation time, and
pulse width, and consists of a 1-foot switch, a pair of surface electrodes (50 &#x000d7; 50&#x02005;mm), and
a stimulator. An inactive electrode was attached to the proximal tibialis anterior (5&#x02005;cm
from the lower portion of the fibular head), which is an antagonist of the plantar flexor
muscles, while an active electrode was attached to the distal tibialis anterior (lateral and
5&#x02005;cm from the upper portion of the fibula). The waveform was rectangular biphasic, and the
therapeutic exercise was adjusted in order to avoid exceeding 50 mA so that patients would
endure as much dorsiflexion as possible. The ramp-up for maximum intensity was set to occur
in 2 seconds, and the on-time for the stimulation duration was set to last 7 seconds. In
order to avoid muscle fatigue due to electrical stimulation, the off-time was set to last 7
seconds, the pulse frequency was 35&#x02005;Hz, and the pulse width was 250 &#x003bc;s.</p><p>Balance ability was measured using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and the Berg Balance
Scale (BBS). For the TUG test, subjects were seated in a chair with armrests and then
instructed to stand (using the armrests, if desired) and walk as quickly and safely as
possible for a distance of 3&#x02005;m. The subjects then turned around, returned to the chair, and
sat down. The time from the point at which their spine left the back of the chair until they
returned to that same position was recorded using a stopwatch<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring both
static and dynamic aspects of balance in elderly people with stroke. BBS scores range from 0
to 56 points, with higher scores indicating better balance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gait function was measured using a GAITRite system (CIR Systems Inc., Havertown, PA, USA).
The GAITRite system was used to measure spatiotemporal parameters, including gait velocity,
cadence, step length, and stride length. The subjects were asked to walk at a comfortable
speed, without the use of an assistive device, along a 10-m hallway<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Nonparametric statistical methods
were used because the number of research subjects was 5. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test was used to compare
the pre- and posttest results within each group, while the Mann-Whitney U test was performed
to compare the 2 groups before and after training. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in balance ability and gait function after the intervention are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of balance and gait function within groups and between groups

the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To enhance balance ability via postural control, the alignment of the pelvis, femoral
region, and foot is essential. Since the lower extremity on the paralyzed side in stroke
patients shows an abnormal state of alignment, normal alignment of this lower extremity is
necessary. To achieve physical stability, alignment of the ankle joint is also
important<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bajd et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that correct postural alignment
can be a precondition for alignment of not only the knee joint, but also the ankle joint.
This is reported to be effective when combined with FES. In the present study, the BCI-FES
group showed a significant difference in the TUG test value after the intervention (from
28.7 to 22.7 sec). However, there were no significant differences in TUG test value between
the 2 groups after the intervention. We believe the experiment duration was too short to
assess the full effect of FES on balance ability. As the FES component of BCI-FES is
activated when the patient concentrates, the amount of FES activation varies depending on
the patient given that the concentration index does not reach the threshold in patients who
are not concentrating.</p><p>The cadence of a healthy person is approximately 101&#x02013;122 steps/min when waking at an
optimal speed<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>; Perry<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the cadence of normal people
is 116 steps/min. Lau et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that speed-dependent treadmill training in patients with subacute stroke resulted in an
increase in cadence (from 36.9 to 58.5 steps/min). However, there was no significant
difference in cadence between the 2 groups. In the present study, the BCI-FES group showed a
significant difference in cadence after the intervention (from 83.7 to 94.8 sec). Therefore,
FES training may prevent foot drop in the swing phase by contributing to enhancement of
ankle dorsiflexion and motor control ability and stimulation of proprioception in the ankle
joint<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. FES training also confers
stability to the lower extremities upon initial contact, which influences the change in
cadence. We speculate that cadence increased due to security of stability induced by a
reduction in postural disturbance and enhancement of balance ability. In addition, FES
training greatly influences partial recovery of the peripheral mechanism and plasticity of
the cerebral cortex, which helps patients with stroke to control their posture due to
neuroplasticity<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hebb et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
enhancement of plasticity represents functional recovery via the improvements in afferent,
and efferent neural activities. The effect of afferent neural activity in this recovery
increased when rehabilitation treatment was combined with motor imagination with computer
feedback<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason for the
significant difference in the BCI-FES group was as follows: since FES using the BCI system
was activated when patients concentrated and tried to move on their own, there was a
positive impact on gait ability due to improvements in afferent and efferent neural
activities and voluntary movement.</p><p>There are 2 limitations to this study. First, due to the small sample size, it is difficult
to make any generalizations. Second, this study was a pilot study, and the experiment
duration was short (only 5 days). Further studies are required to investigate the long-term
intervention effects of BCI-FES training. Our findings suggest that BCI-FES training
increases balance and gait function in patients with stroke. We hope that future studies
will further investigate BCI-FES training and its role in improving balance and gait.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mercier</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Audet</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000e9;bert</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Impact of motor, cognitive, and perceptual disorders on
