Full history taking and clinical examinations were done. Full anthropometric assessment was also done, including target and mid-parental heights. Target height was calculated by the method of Tanner <italic>et al</italic>, taking the average of mother's and father's height after addition of 13 cm in boys or subtractions of them in girls, while mid-parental height is calculated as before &#x000b1; 6.5 cm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Height was measured twice and neared to the next millimeter using Harpenden Stadiometer, height velocity in cm/year is the variable that describes the patient's one-year velocity and plotting it in the mid-year interval. Sitting height was also measured using Harpenden sitting height apparatus. Lower segment was calculated by subtraction of sitting height from height, and then from these two measurements, upper to lower segment ratio was derived (US/LS). Weight of the patients was measured using electronic balances and recorded in decimal of kilogram. Puberty was assessed by rating the breast development in girls, genital developments in boys, pubic and axillary hair development in both sexes, according to Tanner's classification.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] All anthropometric procedures were performed at baseline before treatment and at follow-up by the same observer at the same time of the day (9 a.m.-1 p.m.) in the growth clinic of (DEMPU). Age-related normal standards for GHD patients were calculated from tables of Tanner and Whitehouse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] All the auxological data including estimated mature height (EMH) were analyzed by a software program (growth vision.2) provided by Novo-Nordisk, Denmark. Skeletal maturity was determined by the same observer from an X-ray of the left wrist and hand (Tanner Whitehouse no.2 method). Bone age delay, delta bone age and EMH were derived.</p><p>Laboratory investigations included the following:</p><p>

All patients received rhGH with a standard dose of 20 IU /m<sup>2</sup>/week. The calculated dose per week was divided for six days and given subcutaneously at night. Puberty was not induced by giving sex hormones during GH treatment, since the treatment was started relatively late in these patients. All the patients accepted postponing induction of puberty after explanation by the physician.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Follow up</title><p>Patients were followed for a minimum period of one year and for a maximum of four years.

Follow up of thyroid profile, IGF-1and IGFBP-3 were done in every six months and skeletal maturity every year. All anthropometric procedures were performed at base line before treatment and at follow up by the same observer at the same time of the day (9am - 1pm) in the growth clinic of DEMPU.</p><p>Every year, the surface area of each patient was calculated, and the dose of GH was adjusted to keep the therapeutic dose at 20 IU /m<sup>2</sup>/week (equivalent to 0.2 mg/kg /week) for GHD. Response to GH therapy was judged on data obtained from auxological assessment, skeletal maturity, and estimated mature height.</p><p>Compliance to therapy is continuously verified by more than one parameter e.g. height velocity, asking the parents about mode of injection and dosing, counting the empty vials and sometimes by analysis of serum IGF-1.</p><p>The decision to stop GH treatment was when final adult height criteria was fulfilled and includes full pubertal development (Tanner stage 5), complete fusion of the epiphysis and growth velocity &#x0003c; 1 cm /year in the last year.

The higher GV reported may be explained by the higher GH dose used (27 U/m<sup>2</sup>/w) compared to ours (20 U/m<sup>2</sup>/w).</p><p>It is of interest to mention that in our study a significant positive trend is observed in the delta changes of all anthropometric data of patients with ISS, including height and its SDS and difference between target height and patient's height except for the EMH where delta changes showed non- significant variation. This finding sets the discussion for the issue of the possible benefit of GH therapy in ISS patients regarding their final adult height. There has been much disagreement concerning the prognosis of adult height in children with ISS. This may be related to the lack of precise classification where some children seem to have a combination of genetic short stature and constitutional delay, while others seem to have a growth disorder based on their pathologic growth rate and height. Until there is a wide availability of genetic tests for mutation in the genes for GH and GH receptors, treatment decision will depend on a clinical judgment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>In our patients with ISS, the mean age for spontaneous pubertal maturation was 11.9&#x000b1;1.1 years for girls and 12.6&#x000b1;1.9 years for boys.

In children with a bone age delay around two year, the average adult height was close to the predicted height, and in those with no bone age delay, adult height surpassed the initial prediction substantially, although if the bone age was delayed by more than two year, adult height was considerably below predicted height.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In our patients with idiopathic short stature, only one female patient reached final adult height (147.9 cm, -2.2 SDS), whereas six patients (three males, three females) reached near final height of a mean of 157.8&#x000b1;4.7 cm (-2.8&#x000b1;0.6 SDS) for males and a mean of 144.7&#x000b1;10.2 cm (-2.4&#x000b1;1.6 SDS) for females.</p><p>The mean increase in adult height attributable to GH therapy (average duration of 4-7 year) in children with ISS is 3.5-7.5 cm compared with historical controls,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] with patients&#x02019;own pretreatment predicted adult heights,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] or with no treatment control or placebo control groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Responses are highly variable and are dose dependent.

This confirms the complexity of growth response in ISS patients, with multidimensional parameters from different categories.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogol</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Deal</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Saenger</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>EO</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Children with Idiopathic Short Stature: A Summary of the Growth Hormone Research Society, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Workshop</article-title><source>J Clin Endocrinol Metab</source><year>2008</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>4210</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18782877</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ranke</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Towards a consensus on the definition of idiopathic shortstature</article-title><source>Horm Res</source><year>1996</year><volume>45</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>64</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8805048</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Feldkamp</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Utah</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Growth Study: Growth standards and the prevalence of growth hormone deficiency</article-title><source>J Pediatr</source><year>1994</year><volume>125</volume><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8021781</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tanner</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitehouse</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Standard for children's height at ages 2 to 9 years allowing for height of parents</article-title><source>Arch Dis Child</source><year>1970</year><volume>45</volume><fpage>755</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5491878</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tanner</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The development of the reproductive system.
