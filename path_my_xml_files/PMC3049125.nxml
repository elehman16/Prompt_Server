It has been proposed that PD as subclinical infection may contribute to the etiology and to the pathogenesis of several systemic diseases including Atherosclerosis. A number of epidemiological studies link periodontal disease/edentulism as independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, new randomized controlled clinical trials have shown an improvement on cardiovascular surrogate markers (endothelial function, sICAM, hsPCR level, fibrinogen) after periodontal treatment. Nonetheless, such trials are still limited in terms of external validity, periodontal treatment strategies, CONSORT-based design and results consistency/extrapolation. The current study is designed to evaluate if periodontal treatment with scaling and root planning plus local delivered chlorhexidine improves endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This randomized, single-blind clinical trial will be performed at two health centers and will include two periodontal treatment strategies. After medical/periodontal screening, a baseline endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and other systemic surrogate markers will be obtained from all recruited subjects. Patients then will be randomized to receive either supragingival/subgingival plaque cleaning and calculus removal plus chlorhexidine (treatment group) or supragingival plaque removal only (control group). A second and third FMD will be obtained after 24 hours and 12 weeks in both treatment arms. Each group will consist of 49 patients (n = 98) and all patients will be followed-up for secondary outcomes and will be monitored through a coordinating center. The primary outcomes are FMD differences baseline, 24 hours and 3 months after treatment. The secondary outcomes are differences in C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glucose serum levels, blood lipid profile, and HOMA index.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT is expected to provide more evidence on the effects of different periodontal treatment modalities on FMD values, as well as to correlate such findings with different surrogate markers of systemic inflammation with cardiovascular effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00681564">NCT00681564</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cardiovascular disease continues to be the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the existence of novel therapeutic approaches designed for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, the number of deaths associated to cardiovascular events remains constant in most countries[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For instance, in Colombia, one out of five deaths can be attributed to ischemic cardiovascular disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During the last decade it has been widely accepted that inflammation plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis. Multiple epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between high levels of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, Serum Amyloid A and soluble adhesion molecules like ICAM-1, E-Selectin, VCAM-1 with the progression of atherosclerosis and also with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>New scientific evidence from the last two decades including epidemiological, <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>assays supports the notion that the immune system significantly contributes in the development and progression of atherosclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This new theory proposes that any potential noxious challenge to the host immune response could be related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hence, other nontraditional risk factors for cardiovascular events, such as infections and rheumatologic autoimmune diseases have emerged as important risk factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several epidemiological studies have also suggested that periodontal infection is an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. A recent meta-analysis on the subset of five cohort studies (86,092 patients, follow-up &#x0003e; 6 years) found increased incidence of coronary heart disease (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.14-1.36, p &#x0003c; .0001) in patients with less than 10 teeth. In the subset of cross-sectional studies at the same meta-analysis report, prevalence of coronary heart disease was reported to be significantly high (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.329-1.907, p &#x0003c; .001)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease in meta-analysis literature is stronger when systemic inflammatory and serologic markers are used to determine the systemic bacterial exposure secondary to periodontitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Several biological mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association between periodontal infections and atherosclerosis:</p><sec><title>1. Systemic consequences of periodontal infection (indirect pathway)</title><p>Patients with periodontitis have increased levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6 and other acute phase reactants associated to cardiovascular events[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6) reduce the expression of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] increase endothelial synthesis of NADPH oxidase,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and promotes the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (e-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is well-know that the absence of anti-atherogenic properties in the endothelium augments the vascular migration of leukocytes (diapedesis) to atherosclerotic plaques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, increased activation of platelets has been reported in subjects with periodontitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Despite the evidence, the contribution to other classic risk factors of CVD of the systemic inflammation associated with periodontitis remains largely unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Invasion of periodontal pathogens into atherosclerotic plaques (Direct pathway)</title><p>Periodontal pathogens (<italic>i.e., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetencomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola</italic>, and <italic>Eikenella corrodens</italic>) have been found in atherosclerotic plaques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that invasion by <italic>P. gingivalis </italic>induces the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1, and TLR-4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>P. gingivalis </italic>HSP60 (GroEL) induces TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression on the surface of endothelial cells,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggesting that autoimmune mechanisms secondary to periodontal infections could play a role in the progression and development of atherosclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are therefore important to study the impact of periodontal infections on cardiovascular disease. A growing number of clinical trials designed to study the effects of periodontal treatment on cardiovascular disease have been published during the last decade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All RCTs evaluating conventional periodontal therapy effects have used different biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function as surrogate outcomes for cardiovascular events, whereas definitive endpoints such as death, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accident are not frequently used. For instance, clinical trials with definitive cardiovascular endpoints in periodontitis patients are not available due to methodological limitations (<italic>i.e. </italic>larger sample sizes, or long term follow-up) and/or ethical aspects concerning the non-treatment of subjects with periodontitis for long periods of time.</p><p>Hence, the use of surrogate biomarkers in RCT evaluating the effects of periodontal treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease is justified, because the otherwise more definitive outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and hospitalizations for cardiovascular complications requires long follow-up periods. Surrogate biomarkers such as flow-mediated, endothelium dependent vasodilatation of the brachial artery (FMD) is a non-invasive, reproducible and easy technique for measuring endothelial function in humans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. FMD is decreased in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking among others) and atherosclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, positive changes in lifestyle (diet, smoking cessation and physical exercise) as well as cardiovascular drugs (ACE inhibitors, statins, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and calcium antagonists) improve endothelial function in humans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The use of FMD as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease has been recently supported by studies reporting association between endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular events[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To date, there are some published RCTs that have found an improvement on endothelial function after periodontal treatment (REF). However, there are several reasons to justify the development of more clinical trials to study this association:</p><p>1. Extrapolation of results to the general community (external validity): Only subjects with chronic severe generalized periodontitis (less than 1% of the adult population) have been included in clinical trials of periodontal treatment and endothelial function,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] therefore there is no available evidence that periodontal treatment improves endothelial function in subjects affected by slight or moderate periodontitis, both more prevalent forms of periodontal disease. Furthermore, the effects of periodontal treatment on endothelial function in diverse ethnic/social groups with other co-morbidities (<italic>i.e. </italic>obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal failure) are unknown.</p><p>2. Differences in periodontal disease treatment strategies: some treatment protocols of periodontal disease used in some RCTs are not available or affordable in non-industrialized countries (<italic>i.e. </italic>local antibiotic therapy with minocycline microspheres).</p><p>3. Methodological limitations of published trials: most published trials do not include a control group (single arm clinical trials) and only one RCT published to date by Tonnetti et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] fully complied with the CONSORT statement[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, information regarding the periodontal diagnosis and disease parameters of the subjects included in recent clinical trials is frequently incomplete.</p><p>4. Consistency: results are consistent when the association persists despite the use of alternative designs, by different researchers and different geographic locations. More RCTs with design improvements and conducted by different research groups are required to confirm the beneficial effects of periodontal treatment on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In summary, current evidence supports a biologically plausible association between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis. To date, few studies have evaluated the effects of periodontal treatment on endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Moreover, the evidence obtained from observational studies is still controversial, probably due to selection biases that have resulted in weaker association strengths. This RCT will be conducted to help to confirm a possible association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, to unveil some biological mechanisms by which periodontal treatment could reduce cardiovascular risk and to increase the external validity of previous studies.</p><p>The study hypothesis is that periodontal treatment with scaling and root planning supplemented with chlorhexidine (Full-Mouth Disinfection) - without systemic antibiotics, improves endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis. <bold>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00681564</bold>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Study Design</title><sec><title>Elegibility</title><sec><title>- Enrolling of study participants</title><p>The periodontal status of potential study participants will be examined by a single periodontists at recruitment (JQ) who will not be involved in any treatment or follow-up of research subjects.

Flow-mediated, endothelium dependent vasodilatation of the brachial artery (FMD) will be measured by the technique described by Celermajer et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] using the guidelines reported by Coretti et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] The ultrasound image of the right brachial artery will be measured longitudinally 5-10 cm above the antecubital fossa by a 2D high-resolution (Siemens SG-60, USA) ultrasound device, using a 7.5 MHz linear array transducer. Ultrasound procedures will be executed with the subject resting quietly in supine position for at least 10 minutes. All measurements will be taken at end-diastole guided by the electrocardiogram. The baseline diameter of the brachial artery will be measured from the anterior to the posterior intima/lumen interface at three points located at a predetermined distance, the mean diameter of the brachial artery will be calculated as the average of the three measures. After the baseline measurement, a pneumatic tourniquet positioned around the right arm will be inflated to at least 50 mm Hg above the systolic pressure for at least five minutes. A rapid release of the cuff will induce reactive hyperemia and shear stress on the endothelium, leading to endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, mainly due to the increase of free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration with subsequent activation of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) and release of NO to the vascular smooth muscle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. FMD will be calculated as the percentage of change in the diameter of brachial artery measured 45-60 s after cuff release in relation to the baseline measure (FMD%). After 10 minutes of rest, sublingual administration of 25 &#x003bc;g of nitroglycerin will be used to measure the endothelium-independent vasodilatation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle unless stated otherwise.
