It exacerbates a large number of health-related problems, both independently and in association with other diseases. Therefore, this study was carried out at PG Hospital, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar to evaluate effect of <italic>Agnimanthadi</italic> compound in the patients of <italic>Sthaulya</italic>. For this purpose 83 patients of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> were selected out of which 15 patients were dropped out. Remaining 68 patients were treated in two groups. Among these, 38 patients of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> were treated with Agnimanthadi compound administered orally in the dose of four capsules of 500 mg three times a day with lukewarm water before meal. Remaining 30 patients of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> were kept as placebo control and were administered orally two placebo capsules of 500 mg filled with starch, three times a day with lukewarm water before meal. The duration of the treatment in both the groups was 7 weeks with follow-up for 2 months. Analysis of overall effects of both the groups showed that <italic>Agnimanthadi</italic> compound provided markedly better reduction in weight, BMI and other signs and symptoms in the patients of obesity in comparison to the control group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Agnimanthadi</italic> compound</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd><italic>sthaulya</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Sthaulya</italic> is included under eight undesirable conditions (<italic>Ashtau Nindita</italic>),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] <italic>Shleshma Nanatmaja</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] <italic>Samtarpana Nimittaja</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] <italic>Atinindita</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] <italic>Ati Brihmana Nimittaja</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and <italic>Bahu Dosha Janita</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] <italic>Vikara</italic>.

Their appetite is excessive[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and whatever they eat is quickly digested, which indicates hyperfunctioning of the <italic>Jatharaagni</italic>. Besides this, the patient suffers from laziness, may be due to under supply of energy, which may be due to hypofunctioning of <italic>Bhutaagni</italic>.

On the basis of the above-mentioned facts of pathogenesis of <italic>Sthaulya</italic>, it can be said that the drug, which decreases <italic>Jatharaagni</italic> particularly <italic>Abhyavaharana Shakti</italic>, increases <italic>Bhutaagni</italic> and corrects the functions of <italic>Dhatvaagni</italic> and at the same time have <italic>Medo-hara, Kapha-hara</italic> and <italic>Vatahara</italic> actions, may be suitable for its management.</p><p>Taking all the above mentioned facts in consideration, <italic>Agnimanthadi</italic> compound comprising of <italic>Agnimantha, Mustaka, Gomutra</italic> and <italic>Eranda Patra Kshara</italic> was formulated for the present study.
