The engineering requirements to minimise these threats results in an extremely heavy and cumbersome clothing ensemble that increases the internal heat generation of the wearer, while the clothing&#x02019;s thermal properties reduce heat dissipation. This study aimed to evaluate the heat strain encountered wearing EOD protective clothing in simulated environmental extremes across a range of differing work intensities. Eight healthy males [age 25&#x000b1;6 years (mean &#x000b1; sd), height 180&#x000b1;7 cm, body mass 79&#x000b1;9 kg, V&#x002d9;O<sub>2max</sub> 57&#x000b1;6 ml<sup>.</sup>kg<sup>&#x02212;1.</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] undertook nine trials while wearing an EOD9 suit (weighing 33.4 kg). The trials involved walking on a treadmill at 2.5, 4 and 5.5 km&#x022c5;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at each of the following environmental conditions, 21, 30 and 37&#x000b0;C wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) in a randomised controlled crossover design. The trials were ceased if the participants&#x02019; core temperature reached 39&#x000b0;C, if heart rate exceeded 90% of maximum, if walking time reached 60 minutes or due to fatigue/nausea. Tolerance times ranged from 10&#x02013;60 minutes and were significantly reduced in the higher walking speeds and environmental conditions. In a total of 15 trials (21%) participants completed 60 minutes of walking; however, this was predominantly at the slower walking speeds in the 21&#x000b0;C WBGT environment. Of the remaining 57 trials, 50 were ceased, due to attainment of 90% maximal heart rate. These near maximal heart rates resulted in moderate-high levels of physiological strain in all trials, despite core temperature only reaching 39&#x000b0;C in one of the 72 trials.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project is financially supported by the Australian Government, managed by the National Security Science &#x00026; Technology Centre within the Defence Science &#x00026; Technology Organisation, and the US Government through the Technical Support Working Group within the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office.

While the use of IEDs is not unique to modern warfare, they have become the weapon of choice for terrorist and guerrilla attacks on civilian and army personnel. This has led to an increased role for explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians in the search, disarmament and clearance of IEDs.</p><p>Faced with the potential threat of overpressure, fragmentation, impact and heat, EOD technicians wear appropriately engineered protective clothing to minimise these risks associated with an IED blast. Consequently the protective clothing is extremely heavy (&#x0003e;30 kg) and provides a high level of thermal insulation. Combined, these attributes create a situation that is conducive to accelerated internal heat generation. This combined with a microenvironment that minimises the body&#x02019;s natural capability to dissipate heat, subsequently compromises the EOD technician&#x02019;s ability to maintain thermoregulatory balance. Once compromised this predisposes the EOD technician to an increased risk of heat strain and potential heat illness <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In order to minimise this risk and the potential threat of the IED itself, EOD technicians often utilise robots to assist. However, in certain scenarios robots cannot be deployed.</p><p>The scenarios encountered by an EOD technician vary not only in their geographical location, from urban landscapes to arid desert or dense jungles, but also in the intensity with which they are undertaken. The standard practice of EOD involves periods of searching for the target, before undertaking shorter period(s) of activity in close proximity to the explosive device. In an urban setting, for example, the total search time can vary substantially, from a target that is identified prior to the arrival of the EOD technician to that of a non-identified target in a large scale building. It is these combinations of uncertainty that surrounds each unique scenario, which makes the development of appropriate tolerance times a necessity for the health and safety of the EOD technician.</p><p>The role of military and non-military protective clothing in the development of heat strain has been evaluated extensively as highlighted by recent reviews <xref rid="pone.0083740-McLellan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Tolerance times have also been developed by many military organisations for differing levels of battle dress, from standard camouflage uniform through to the highest level of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection <xref rid="pone.0083740-Montain1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-White1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the combination of extreme weight and thermal insulation, as produced by the EOD protective clothing, has to date not been appropriately addressed.</p><p>Field observational studies focusing on small groups of bomb technicians have highlighted the potential for heat strain, with rapid increases in core temperature and near maximal heart rates occurring in relatively short time periods <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, these investigations were performed in variable environmental conditions on a small number of participants <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and a systematic investigation of the influence of environmental conditions and work intensity has yet to be conducted. Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate the physiological tolerance times while wearing EOD protective clothing in simulated environmental extremes across a range of differing work intensities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The procedures carried out in this study were approved by the University Human Research Ethics Committee (#1000001160) and participants were informed of the procedures and had any questions answered to their satisfaction prior to giving their written and oral consent to participate.

The first session involved aerobic capacity testing (V&#x002d9;O<sub>2max</sub>), body composition acquisition and a familiarisation with the EOD protective clothing and testing procedures. The remaining three laboratory visits involved the participant walking on a treadmill, while wearing the EOD protective clothing, in an environmental chamber set to a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) of 21, 30 or 37&#x000b0;C. During each of these laboratory visits the participant completed three treadmill-walking trials of 2.5, 4 and 5.5 km&#x022c5;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a 1% grade.

Prior to arrival the participants were requested to abstain from alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and strenuous exercise, and to consume 45 ml of water per kg of body mass in the 24 hours preceding each session. The participants were also provided an ingestible core temperature sensor (CorTemp, HQ Inc, Palmetto, FL, USA) to swallow the evening prior.

Participants&#x02019; with a USG value less than 1.020 were classified as euhydrated and those with higher values were provided with an additional 500 ml of water to be consumed prior to the commencement of the walking trials. Nude body mass was measured to the nearest 50 g (Tanita BWB-600, Wedderburn, Australia) and a cannula was inserted in the antecubital fossa for the attainment of venous blood samples.

The thermocrons were attached to four sites (back of neck, inferior border of right scapula, dorsal right hand and proximal third of right tibia) as per International Standard Organisation 9886 (ISO 9886) <xref rid="pone.0083740-InternationalOrganisationfor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Participants then donned the EOD protective clothing and entered the environmental chamber to commence the trial. During each trial, standard termination criteria were applied in accordance with the ASTM guidelines <xref rid="pone.0083740-ASTM1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>: (1) core body temperature reaching 39.0&#x000b0;C; (2) 60 minutes of exercise; (3) heart rate &#x0003e;90% of maximum; or (4) fatigue or nausea. Following the attainment of one of the termination criteria, the participant exited the environmental chamber and doffed the EOD protective clothing. Nude body mass was undertaken following towel drying and a venous blood sample drawn for determination of serum osmolality. Participants were then instructed to rest in an air-conditioned laboratory. In the following recovery period participants were provided with food and fluid to a volume equivalent to 125% of the body mass loss in the preceding trial. This was undertaken to ensure recovery of body mass and hydration status prior to commencement of subsequent trials. Core temperature and heart rate were monitored and following their return to baseline levels the participant provided a blood sample, had their nude body mass assessed and commenced donning the EOD protective clothing for the subsequent trial. Three trials were conducted in this manner per testing session. The presentation of the trials (2.5, 4 and 5.5 km&#x022c5;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a 1% grade) was randomised using a random numbers generator across the testing sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Mean skin temperature (T<sub>sk</sub>) was calculated from the four thermocrons using equation one <xref rid="pone.0083740-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.<disp-formula id="pone.0083740.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0083740.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>

The major finding of this study was that participants recorded moderate-high levels of physiological strain but did not experience excessive maximal core, skin or whole body temperature. This level of physiological strain resulted predominantly from participants ceasing trials due to the attainment of the 90% of their maximal heart rate termination criteria.</p><p>Tolerance times achieved were, not surprisingly, significantly reduced in the higher WBGT environments and when the work intensity was increased. With heavy work intensities (&#x0003e;250 W<sup>.</sup>m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), environmental conditions have been shown to have a reduced influence on tolerance time achieved in protective clothing <xref rid="pone.0083740-McLellan2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This results from the delay in sweat evaporation as it moves through the various layers of protective clothing <xref rid="pone.0083740-McLellan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While there was no significant interaction effect between environments and work intensities in the current study, potentially due to the maximum 60 minute duration creating an arbitrary ceiling at the

Regardless of the environmental conditions, all of the trials in the highest metabolic work rate (5.5 km&#x022c5;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were terminated due to excessive heart rate and no individual completed the 60 min of walking at this intensity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083740-t002">Table 2</xref>). Similar findings have also been reported in a recent review of encapsulated protective clothing by McLellan and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0083740-McLellan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The current study involved the undertaking of multiple trials, in the same environmental conditions, within the same day. This experimental design was planned in order to mimic the activities of the EOD technician in the field. These activities often involve extended searching for the target, however, once it is identified, the technician may make multiple trips to the target in order to obtain x-rays of the target, this is then followed by disarmament or disablement of the device, then a final clearance of the site. These multiple trips are interspersed by periods when the EOD technician is at a safe distance from the device and is able to remove components of the protective clothing. Undertaking multiple trials on the same day, a protocol previously employed in EOD investigations <xref rid="pone.0083740-Frim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, may have had the unintended consequence of participants undertaking subsequent trials in a hypohydrated or elevated physiological strain state. Commencing tolerance tests in a hypohydrated state has previously been shown to reduce completion times by up to 20% <xref rid="pone.0083740-Cheung2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083740-Cheung3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, however, neither pre-trial nude body mass nor serum osmolality were significantly different between trials in the current study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083740-t001">Table 1</xref>). Tolerance times would also be reduced if any of the physiological termination criteria were elevated on commencement of subsequent trials, however, there were no statistical differences in pre-trial heart rate or whole body temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083740-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, Kenefick and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0083740-Kenefick1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> have previously shown that if hydration and body temperatures are allowed to recover then subsequent aerobic activity in the heat is not impaired. In the current study, these markers of hydration status and heat strain were not significantly different, indicating that the rapid rehydration protocols and the rest periods (&#x0223c;60 min) employed, enabled subsequent trials on the same day not to be detrimentally influenced by the preceding trials. These findings provide an evidence-base for effective rehydration protocols and work-rest periods that would be required if complete physiological recovery was necessary in the field. This recovery time frame is approximately four times that which is normally implemented by EOD technicians, therefore the challenge of future research should be to evaluate the cumulative effect of the uncompensated heat stress and the capability of cooling strategies to mitigate any heat strain developed.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study has provided a comprehensive evaluation of the physiological tolerance times while wearing EOD protective clothing. This was undertaken in simulated environmental extremes across a range of differing work intensities using a systematic approach. This study found that participants displayed moderate-high levels of physiological strain but did not experience excessive maximal core, skin or whole body temperatures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0083740-Roeder1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
