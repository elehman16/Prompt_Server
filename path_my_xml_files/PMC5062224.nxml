More than a century has passed and even today, it is one of the most popular techniques for both elective and emergency surgical procedures, particularly cesarean section, lower abdominal surgeries, orthopedic, and urological surgeries, just to name a few.</p><p>The prime emphasis of acute pain treatment must be to decrease the pain as much as possible (ideally, to zero). This must be achieved, however, with reasonable cost, safety for the patient, and exclusive of drug- and treatment-related side effects.</p><p>This is true even in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, which is a well-known technique for operations on the lower extremities. Although it is easy to perform and provides fast onset and effective sensory and motor block, it has a limited duration of action.</p><p>The need for using additives in local anesthetics was, in former times, due to a desire to prolong the anesthetic action which could allow surgery for several hours. The duration of tetracaine could be prolonged up to 6 h by the addition of adrenaline. Today, bupivacaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic for spinal anesthesia. The duration of bupivacaine spinal anesthesia after a single-shot injection is adequate for hip and knee arthroplasties. Spinal anesthesia can be extended with the use of continuous catheter techniques. Therefore, the purpose of the development of new additives has been related mainly to the prevention and relief of postoperative pain, together with the aim of reducing the dose of local anesthetics and allowing early ambulation after surgery.</p><p>&#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors are located on primary afferent terminals (both at peripheral and spinal endings), on neurons in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord, and within several brainstem nuclei implicated in analgesia, supporting the possibility of analgesic action at peripheral, spinal, and brainstem sites. &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists also enhance analgesia from intraspinal opioids. This interaction occurs both pre- and post-synaptic to the primary afferent synapse in the spinal cord, and is clearly synergistic when both drugs are administered intrathecally. Elimination from blood is slow, arguing against an action by systemic absorption and redistribution to peripheral or central sites. As expected from these divergent time courses, the correlation between blood clonidine concentration and analgesia within individuals is relatively poor. After spinal administration in volunteers and patients, clonidine is rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations in arterial blood within 10 min and in venous blood within 30&#x02013;45 min. Mechanistic studies support a primary spinal site of action of &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists for analgesia and a multifactorial mechanism of action in enhancing peripheral or intraspinal blockade from local anesthetics. Pharmacokinetic studies support an EC95 of 130 ng/ml clonidine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analgesia after intraspinal administration and help to clarify the dose responses observed in clinical studies. In contrast to blood, there is a strong correlation between clonidine concentration in CSF and analgesia after epidural clonidine administration. Clonidine is rapidly and extensively absorbed into the spinal CSF compartment, with concentrations peaking 30&#x02013;60 min after injection.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This coincides closely with an attainment of near-maximal analgesia.</p><p>The adrenergic agonist clonidine has a variety of different actions, including the ability to potentiate the effects of local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Clonidine &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonist, has central brain stem action and peripheral action.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hypothalamic &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors are inhibitory and causes decrease in outflow from the vasomotor centers and sympathetic centers. This explains resultant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and cardiac output. Action by transdermal application is better, gives consistent blood levels and less side effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Extradural analgesic action is because of postsynaptic activation of descending inhibitory pathway that synapse into dorsal horn of spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, unlike spinal opioids, clonidine does not produce pruritus or respiratory depression. It also prolongs the sensory blockade.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It also reduces the amount or concentration of local anesthetic required to produce postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been used as a sole agent as well as admixed with opioids and local anesthetics in labor analgesia and orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Mechanistic studies support a primary spinal site of action of &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists for analgesia and a multifactorial mechanism of action in enhancing peripheral or intraspinal blockade from local anesthetics. Pharmacokinetic studies support an EC95 of 130 ng/ml clonidine in CSF for analgesia after intraspinal administration and help to clarify the dose responses observed in clinical studies buprenorphine partial antagonist receptor when added to bupivacaine is known to increase the duration of analgesia at least by 12&#x02013;15 h and it is not associated with any significant fall in BP or pulse rate. It is a thebaine derivative (naturally occurring opium alkaloid) with powerful agonist action at &#x000b5; opioids receptors and partial antagonist action and does not cause addiction or physical dependence. Intrathecal doses are smaller and have prolonged and profound analgesia because of its highly lipophilic nature. It remains attached to spinal opioid receptors for long duration and spreads into CSF to higher centers causing late respiratory depression, which is associated with morphine and is much less likely with buprenorphine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Adverse effects associated with buprenorphine such as nausea and vomiting and constipation are less as compared with fully agonist morphine.</p><p>Buprenorphine displays a bell-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve in dose&#x02013;effect relationship curve [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. When buprenorphine is used intrathecally in combination with bupivacaine, it improves the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia compared to bupivacaine alone.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Dose&#x02013;effect relationship of buprenorphine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-455-g001"/></fig><p>This study is a comparative evaluation of spinal block characteristics after intrathecal clonidine&#x02013;bupivacaine, buprenorphine&#x02013;bupivacaine, and bupivacaine alone in lower limb surgeries.

The anesthetic and surgical plan was explained to the patients in a simple language and informed consent was obtained. The patients were divided into two groups of 25 each using chit in a box technique. On the day of surgery, inside the operation theater, basal pulse rate and BP were obtained. A wide bore intravenous (i.v.) line was established and the patients were connected to monitors such as ECG, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and a noninvasive BP recording device. The patients received Ringer's lactate infusion 10 ml/kg, prior to intrathecal anesthesia. All the patients received injection ondansetron 4 mg i.v. The patients were positioned sitting for spinal puncture. Under strict aseptic precautions, lumbar puncture was done at L3&#x02013;L4 interspace using 26-gauge Quincke Spinal Needle by midline approach.

Benhamou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] also demonstrated that clonidine increased the spread of the sensory block, intraoperatively. Nicol and Holdcroft[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] tried to explain this in their study on parturients, postulating that because clonidine becomes slightly hypobaric at body temperature, rostral spread might have occurred with the patient in the sitting position for several minutes after the intrathecal injection.</p><p>In the present study, a total of five patients (1 in Group A, 1 in Group B, and 3 in Group C) out of total 75 patients studied, attained a BS of 3. All other patients in the three groups attained the BS of 4. Although the result was not found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), other investigators observed a complete motor blockade of the lower extremities in all patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This difference could be due to the difference in the amount of drug delivered intrathecally. They used a total drug volume of 4.6 ml with 18 mg of bupivacaine, whereas in our study, a total of 3 ml of drug and 12.5 mg of bupivacaine were used.</p><p>Similar study was conducted to compare the efficacy of intrathecal buprenorphine with intrathecal dexmedetomidine for prolonging the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The hemodynamic parameters were stable in all the groups. Both pulse rate and MAP were lower in the clonidine Group C than that of Groups A and B. BP was responsive to i.v. fluid administration as is evident from the fact that there was significant difference in the i.v. fluid requirement in the clonidine Group C than in the other two groups. Clonidine, after neuraxial or systemic administration, affects arterial BP in a complex manner because of opposing actions at multiple sites. The &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists produce sympatholysis and reduce arterial BP through effects at specific brainstem nuclei and on sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, effects that are counteracted by direct vasoconstriction resulting from the &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists on the peripheral vasculature. As a result, the dose response for neuraxial clonidine on arterial BP in humans is generally considered to be U-shaped.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Furthermore, combining &#x003b1;2-adrenergic receptor agonists with local anesthetics can potentially increase the degree of sympatholysis and resulting hypotension.</p><p>The difference in the meantime of sensory regression to L1 in our study was found to be statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), with regression occurring more slowly in buprenorphine group (209 min) than in the clonidine group (183 min). Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in a similar study in gynecological patients found that the mean time from injection to regression of the level of sensory analgesia by two segments was longer in the clonidine group than in control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The mechanism of clonidine-induced potentiation of sensory block in spinal anesthesia is reported to be mediated by presynaptic (inhibition of transmitter release) and postsynaptic (enhancing hyperpolarization)[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] effects. Although clonidine might have a vasoconstrictive effect in large concentrations, the role of vasoconstriction in prolonging sensory block seems to be minor, even in usual clinical doses (1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;g/kg).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The duration of motor block was prolonged (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with addition of clonidine (228 min) and buprenorphine (262 min) to a local anesthetic solution for intrathecal block. Similar result was demonstrated by Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who studied the effect of different concentrations of clonidine, an &#x003b1;2 agonist, on sensory and motor blockade during spinal anesthesia. Racle <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also demonstrated that intrathecal clonidine combined with local anesthetic significantly potentiates the intensity and duration of motor blockade. The explanation for this could be that the &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonists induce cellular modification in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (motor neuron hyperpolarization) and facilitate the local anesthetic action.</p><p>There was a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) between the mean time of first rescue analgesic request among the buprenorphine Group B (383 &#x000b1; 38.9), clonidine Group C (278.2 &#x000b1; 56.4), and control Group A (175.6 &#x000b1; 26.1). Similar results were also demonstrated by Strebel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while studying the effect of varying doses of intrathecal clonidine (37.5 &#x000b5;g, 75 &#x000b5;g, 150 &#x000b5;g) along with bupivacaine (in 8% glucose). van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have also demonstrated that addition of 75 &#x000b5;g clonidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine prolongs spinal analgesia and the motor block after cesarean section and improves early analgesia. In their study, immediate postoperative analgesia was better with the combination of bupivacaine and clonidine as demonstrated by a significantly later first request for analgesia, less need for morphine top-ups in the recovery period, and lower VAS scores in the bupivacaine&#x02013;clonidine group. The analgesic effect following its intrathecal administration is mediated spinally through the activation of postsynaptic &#x003b1;2 receptors in substantia gelatinosa of spinal cord. The rationale behind intrathecal administration of clonidine is to achieve a high drug concentration in the vicinity of &#x003b1;2-adrenoreceptors in the spinal cord and it works by blocking the conduction of C and A&#x003b4; fibers, increases potassium conductance in isolated neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, and intensifies the conduction block of local anesthetics.</p><p>Some of the adverse effects noted in our study were nausea and vomiting, dryness of mouth, and sedation. However, none of the adverse effects noted were found to be statistically significant in either groups. Buprenorphine (12%) caused sedation in significantly higher number of patients than in clonidine group (8%). The nausea and vomiting was not very marked and was settled after one dose of an antiemetic. Other side effects noticed in clonidine group were hypotension and bradycardia in a single patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intrathecal buprenorphine 50 &#x000b5;g gives adequate analgesia up to 383 &#x000b1; 38.9 min, which is significantly longer than that of intrathecal clonidine 50 &#x000b5;g, i.e., 278.2 &#x000b1; 56.4 min. Quality of analgesia was acceptable to patients in both groups, although VAS assessment was better in buprenorphine group. Administration of buprenorphine and clonidine intrathecally does potentiate the duration of analgesia, sensory and motor block. The study suggests that combination of two or more drugs from different group (e.g., opioid and &#x003b1;2 agonist) can give better analgesia and less chance of side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the great help received from the scholars whose articles were cited and included in the references of this manuscript.
