The miosis that occurs during cataract surgery is in part mediated by PGs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Preoperative treatment using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to be effective in maintaining mydriasis during cataract surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The mechanism of their action is dependent on their ability to cause cyclooxygenase inhibition and thereby inhibit the production of PGs in response to surgical trauma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Steroids block the release of arachidonic acid, which is also a precursor for PGs synthesis. Unlike nonsteroidal agents, steroid eye drops have not been extensively studied for their antimiotic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Cataract surgery complications increase when miosis occurs. It was reported that, when mydriasis is greater than 6mm, the incidence of posterior capsule rupture is reduced by half.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In addition, the increasing number of toric and multifocal intraocular lenses draws attention to the importance of maintaining well dilated pupils (&#x0003e; 6mm) during cataract surgery.</p><p>Topical steroids are the most prescribed medication for postoperative periods. It comprises the steroid group derivative of cholesterol. Prednisolone is one of the most commonly used. Although prolonged use of steroids may result in cataract formation, and secondary ocular infections, there are no previous reports showing that its use for a short period before surgery has side effects superior to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furthermore, steroid-induced IOP elevation almost never occurs in less than five days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not comprise the steroid group derivative of cholesterol. The main options for eye drops are ketorolac tromethamine, diclofenac, flurbiprofen, indomethacin and nepafenac. Less influence on intraocular pressure control is one of the main advantages of these medications when used for a long period. Nepafenac, a new prodrug, which is hydrolyzed by intraocular tissues to amfenac has demonstrated superior intraocular penetration when compared with other anti-inflammatory drugs in both anterior segment and retinal tissue following topical ocular administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The objective of the original study was to compare the effect of preoperative use of topical anti-inflammatory prednisolone acetate, ketorolac tromethamine, nepafenac and placebo, in the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis in cataract surgery.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-center, masked, randomized clinical study comprised 140 patients with cataract [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].

These eye drops were administered 48 hours before surgery by mask fashion, three times daily for two days prior to surgery.</p><p>The randomization was done in a blocking manner. Each of the four intervention groups received 35 different numbers from a random number table. These numbers were transferred to small individual envelopes and also fixed at one of the opaque eye drop bottles. It helped not only to randomize the patients but also to mask the treatment groups until data analysis. Four small envelopes, one of each intervention group, were sealed and placed into a larger envelope, totalizing 35 large envelopes containing four small individual envelopes in each one. This comprises the block length of four to assure that every four patients have received all four interventions. When a patient was included in the study, a pharmacist took for him a small individual envelope and after discovering the random number, she took the respective eye drop bottle. The surgeon and the ophthalmologist who collected the data did not know the randomized groups.</p><p>The eye drop group was revealed to the researchers once recruitment, data collection, and statistical analyses were complete. All study participants were masked to treatment assignment.</p><p>Gatifloxacin was prescribed four times daily for two days prior to surgery, with interval time of at least 15 minutes between two eye drops. Preoperative mydriasis was accomplished with tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine 5% eye drops, one drop instilled into the patient's eyes 60, 45 and 30 minutes before surgery (three doses). Peribulbar anesthesia was performed with lidocaine 2% (3ml) in the inferior-temporal quadrant, associated with an oral dose of diazepam 5 mg, 30 minutes before surgery, without additional sedation. Lidocaine was not used intraocularly. The phacoemulsification (Infiniti<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Alcon Inc., H&#x000fc;nenberg, Switzerland) was performed by a single surgeon.</p><p>The surgeon used the same standardized small-incision phacoemulsification technique in all patients. In short, 1.0mm and 3.0mm clear corneal incisions were made and a capsulorhexis 4.0mm in diameter was created. A stop-chop phacoemulsification technique was used and foldable intraocular lenses were implanted in the capsular bag. The phacoemulsification parameters were established prior to all surgeries and were the same for all patients. Cataract surgery was conducted using the Legacy<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Series 2000 Machine (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.). The parameters used were as follows: balanced saline solution, with the height of the bottle set at 100 cm, 40 ml/minute aspiration flow rate, 450mmHg vacuum and phaco power 50%. Intracameral adrenaline was not used in the irrigation solution. Ultrasound time and surgical times were registered at the end of each surgery [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.

Shaikh <italic>et al</italic>., analyzed the antimiotic effect of topical prednisolone and flurbiprofen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In the analysis of the study, there were no significant differences in maintaining mydriasis at any stage of surgery in the prednisolone and flurbiprofen groups when comparing with the placebo group. Unfortunately, the comparison of the prednisolone and flurbiprofen groups with the placebo group (sodium chloride 0.9%) was not ideal, since the author used epinephrine 1:10<sup>6,</sup> a potent direct-acting mydriatic agent, in all groups. Because of this confounding bias, there was a failure when assessing the anti-inflammatory effect of eye drops.</p><p>Epinephrine is one of the alternatives to improve intraoperative mydriasis that were not analyzed in this study. Although the potential for systemic absorption of epinephrine can lead to sympathomimetic effects (such as excessive sweating, pallor, faintness, occipital headaches, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiac disease), its use has additive benefit for inhibiting intraoperative miosis, regardless of whether antiprostaglandins were used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] However, in undiluted and weakly diluted solutions, the bisulfite preservative included in most epinephrine preparations is shown to cause corneal endothelial damage and subsequent corneal haziness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Our results with ketorolac were similar to those of Stewart <italic>et al</italic>., who demonstrated that ketorolac 0.5% used before surgery provided effective and well-tolerated inhibition of surgically induced miosis during cataract surgery when compared with placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>An interesting finding from this study (with economic impact) was the fact that, since there been no significant differences among ketorolac, prednisolone and nepafenac in the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery, these medicines can be used in surgical practice with similar efficacy. Considering that prednisolone has a lower cost than ketorolac or nepafenac and, moreover, during the post-operative period, steroid use is mandatory, while the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is optional,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] it becomes an option for a single drug as a mydriatic adjuvant at preoperative care and as an anti-inflammatory agent at postoperative period of cataract surgery. In spite of its topical use, preoperative steroids theoretically reduce immunity with increased risk of opportunist infection (herpes and fungi); in this study, it did not increase the risk of surgical complications. In addition the ocular surface precipitation of prednisolone did not interfere with surgical view.</p><p>The disadvantages of this study are excluding diabetics, eyes with hard cataracts or pseudoexfoliation limits the applicability of the results considered for these specific patients.</p><p>We are unaware of previous clinical trial reports about the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery, simultaneously including, a relatively new NSAID eye drop (nepafenac), the most prescribed NSAID eye drop for that purpose (ketorolac), as well as the steroid eye drop already used routinely during the postoperative period, (prednisolone) and we could find no reference to it in a computerized search at PubMed. Additional studies are warranted to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn
