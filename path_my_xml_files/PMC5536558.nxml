Often in clinical practice, the anaesthesiologist or surgeon, test anorectal motor block by palpating the patient&#x02019;s anus but it is difficult to quantify the degree of motor blockade using this subjective method.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Epidural local anaesthesia does not produce anaesthetic effects uniformly across the spinal segments.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> One of the factors that can affect the blockade is the size of the nerve root. For example, the large size of the L5 and S1 nerve roots may cause resistance to the local anaesthetic effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Interestingly, it has been reported that the sensory blockade of S3 is easier than that of S1 and as rapid as that of L2 in a lumbar epidural block.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Moreover, the same study concluded that the efficacy of a lumbar epidural block is comparable with a caudal block.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, the authors evaluated motor blockade using the Bromage scale and did not quantify the anal motor block. To our knowledge, no objective investigation has compared saddle, lumbar epidural and caudal blocks in a prospective, randomized study. The lack of a comparative study and adequate information on the potency of paralysing the anal sphincter with these regional anaesthetic techniques prompted us to examine if significant differences in anal motor block existed using the three different methods. Anorectal manometry, with the use of a continuous water perfusion system, was used to assess the tone of the anal sphincter muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="sec2-0300060516659393"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec3-0300060516659393"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>The prospective, randomized, comparative study took place in the Department of Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Kangwon National University Hospital, Gangwon-Do, Republic of Korea between 05 December 2013 and 27 June 2014.

After confirming the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, 1&#x02009;ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (5&#x02009;mg) in 8% glucose solution (Marcain; AstraZeneca, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden) was administered. The patient remained in the sitting position for 5&#x02009;min after the local anaesthetic injection. Subsequently, the patient was moved to the supine position.</p><p>For the LE and CD groups, the anaesthetic solution was lidocaine-epinephrine-bicarbonate (20&#x02009;ml of lidocaine 2% plus epinephrine [1:200&#x000a0;000] plus 2&#x02009;ml of sodium bicarbonate 8.4%, which was added immediately before administration). In the LE group, the epidural space was identified using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Perifix&#x000ae;; B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) with its bevel facing caudally via the midline approach at the L4&#x02013;5 interspace using the loss-of-resistance-to-air technique. Subsequently, a 22-gauge multi-orifice catheter was placed 3&#x02009;cm into the epidural space in the lateral position. After taping the catheter and filter, 3&#x02009;ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1: 200&#x000a0;000) were administered via the epidural catheter as a test dose. If no evidence of intravascular or subarachnoid injection appeared, an additional 12&#x02009;ml of the anaesthetic solution was injected through the catheter over 1&#x02009;min. In the CD group, the patients were placed in the lateral position and an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted into the caudal space through the sacrococcygeal ligament. If no blood or cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated, a caudal injection of 15&#x02009;ml of the anaesthetic solution was given through the needle. All patients in the LE and CD groups were moved into supine position following the anaesthetic injection and remained in the supine position for 20&#x02009;min. To avoid inter-operator variability, one staff anaesthesiologist (S.S.K.) performed all of the blocks.</p><p>In all patients, the level of sensory analgesia was evaluated on the torso and lower extremity at 5-min intervals for 30&#x02009;min after injecting the local anaesthetic. The anatomical landmarks and correlated dermatome levels were standardized for testing as follows: the umbilicus (T10), inguinal crease (L1), anterior thigh (L2), medial knee (L3), medial malleolus (L4), the dorsum web between first and second toe (L5), the lateral heel (S1), and the medial popliteal fossa (S2).

The anal sphincter pressures were measured using a 3-lumen, water-perfused catheter and pneumohydraulic capillary infusion system (R3B &#x00026; PIP4-4; Mui Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) connected to a computerized software program (MMS Database; Medical Measurement Systems, Enschede, The Netherlands). The catheter had three ports spaced 0.5&#x02009;cm apart for the two proximal holes and each lumen was perfused with sterile degassed water at 0.1&#x02009;ml/min.

After the patient was comfortable and the manometric trace had stabilized, the recording was started. The patient was then instructed to contract the anal sphincter maximally for 15&#x02009;s on three separate occasions 1&#x02009;min apart and the average value of 3 consecutive measurements was taken for the analysis. While relaxing and squeezing, the maximal resting (MRP) and squeezing (MSP) pressures of the anus were observed. The amount of inhibition caused by anaesthesia (i.e., the pressure drop in the anal canal) was expressed as the percentage of the resting and squeezing pressures. The percentage inhibition for MRP or MSP was calculated as follows:

The resting tone of the internal anal sphincter contributes 85% to the MRP and the resting tone of the external anal sphincter 15%.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The MSP in the anal canal is at its highest pressure during squeezing and starts from a baseline represented by the maximal resting tone. The MSP is related to the activity of the striated sphincters (i.e., the external sphincter and the puborectalis muscle).</p><p>The principal finding of this study was that saddle block was the most effective technique for decreasing MSP. In addition, the reductions in MSP following lumbar epidural or caudal block were similar. Also, the decrease in MRP was similar for all types of anaesthetic technique. These current findings support the results of a study that found surgeons who were blinded to the anaesthetic method rated spinal anaesthesia better than epidural anaesthesia for minor non-obstetric surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The complex innervation of the anal zone (i.e., autonomic versus spinal) may explain the differences that this present study found between the regional anaesthetics in the anorectal manometry results. The internal anal sphincter is under autonomic control via sympathetic innervation from the hypogastric plexus, which initiates tonic contraction, and via sacral parasympathetic fibres that mediate anorectal muscle relaxation. The external sphincter, which is supplied by the inferior rectal branch of the internal pudendal nerve and the perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve, is under voluntary control.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The decrease in the MRP after each block is probably due to sympathetic blockade. Therefore, the difference that this current study observed between the reductions in MSP and MRP may have been the result of partial, incomplete sympathetic blockade. In this present study, the level of analgesia ranged from T10 to L2 (SD group), T8 to L1 (LE group) and T12 to L3 (CD group). Considering the innervation of this region and the sensory level that was observed with each block, partial sympathetic blockade of the hypogastric plexus was a probable cause for the differences that were found between the regional anaesthetics in this study.</p><p>With a spinal block, sympathetic blockade is present two or three levels above the level of the sensory blockade, whereas with an epidural block the level of sympathetic blockade is the same as, or lower than the sensory block.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The hypogastric plexus contracts the internal anal sphincter and receives its sympathetic innervation from preganglionic fibres, which have their cell bodies in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Another possible explanation for the differences that were found with the three regional anaesthetics in the anorectal manometry results in the present study is incomplete sympathetic blockade that might happen in the dermatomal segments when analgesia is present. For example, one study showed that despite a blockade sufficient for surgical anaesthesia, it was difficult to achieve a complete sympathetic blockade with a spinal or epidural block using clinical doses of local anaesthetics.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Although caudal block is widely used for anorectal surgery, its success rate has been reported to be only 70&#x02013;80%.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr24-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Despite a highly experienced staff anaesthesiologist performing the procedure in the present study, three of the 18 caudal blocks were unsuccessful. Caudal block failure is often related to anatomic variations of the bony sacrum and the soft tissues over the bone, which include displacement of the hiatus, narrowing of the sacral canal, and ossification of the sacrococcygeal membrane that can occur especially in the elderly.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In addition, following caudal entry to the epidural space, the cephalad spread of the drug may be limited by minor bony obstructions that will result in the blockade of limited segments.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In our institute, saddle block is the most commonly performed regional anaesthetic technique for anal surgery, since it provides rapid-onset, dense block and usually takes a short time to perform.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Caudal block is used as an alternative to saddle block in cases where dural puncture is to be avoided (e.g., patients with a history of post-dural puncture headache, increased intracranial pressure). However, as mentioned previously, caudal block in adults is often difficult because of anatomical variability. Also, we noted that the sacral spread of anaesthetic following the lumbar epidural block was sufficient to block sacral segments for anal surgery. Therefore, lumbar epidural block rather than caudal block may be a better choice in cases where saddle block cannot be used.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, the exact level of sympathetic blockade was not checked and although measuring the level would have provided more detail, it was not the primary objective of the study. Moreover, there is some debate concerning the evaluative methods for sympathetic blockade.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr30-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Secondly, the direction of the epidural catheter was not confirmed radiologically. One study showed that the initial injection of a local anaesthetic solution through a caudally oriented epidural catheter results in a large spread of anaesthesia through the sacral area.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Although the bevel of the epidural needle was placed caudally, it did not ensure caudal advance. However, another study showed that the injection of a local anaesthetic solution through a lumbar epidural catheter oriented caudally resulted in a faster onset and superior quality of anaesthesia in comparison with a cephalad-oriented catheter in ankle surgery (operating site innervated mainly by S1), but not in haemorrhoidectomy (by S3&#x02013;5).<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This interesting difference between the two aforementioned studies implies that although more anaesthetic pooled in the sacral area with the caudally oriented lumbar epidural catheter, sensory analgesia with a lumbar epidural block for the area innervated by the sacral nerve (excluding S1, the blockade of which is often delayed due to the larger size of this root<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>) is not affected by the direction of spread of the local anaesthetic.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In this present study, it remains unclear as to whether the direction of the epidural catheter affected manometric changes within the LE group. Theoretically, we would suggest that more caudal spread of the local anaesthetic with a caudally directed catheter should result in a difference in the degree of motor blockade in the lower sacral area. Finally, different local anaesthetics were used in the three treatment groups; hyperbaric bupivacaine was used for spinal anaesthesia and lidocaine for the LE and CD groups. A significantly higher motor blockade has been reported with lidocaine than with bupivacaine.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, the focus of this present study was to make a clinically oriented comparison of the three anaesthetic techniques in a normal clinical practice setting. In addition, several case reports and animal studies have suggested that spinal lidocaine may result in a greater incidence of neurological complications compared with other local anaesthetics.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-0300060516659393" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, this prospective, randomized, comparative study used anorectal manometry to demonstrate that saddle block was more effective than lumbar epidural or caudal block for depressing anal sphincter tone.
