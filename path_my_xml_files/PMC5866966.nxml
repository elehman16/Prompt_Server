Human ICUs largely prescribe either proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, 66% of SUP protocols) or histamine<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs, 30% of SUP protocols).<xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Acid suppression with omeprazole leads to proliferation of bacteria in the gastric lumen in both species.<xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> PPI administration in people carries a 3.5&#x02010;fold risk for the development of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>&#x02010;associated diarrhea (CDAD), which is independently associated with longer ICU stays and increased mortality.<xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> The prevalence of infection by pathogenic <italic>Clostridia</italic> species in dogs receiving PPI treatment is unknown.

Sucralfate was administered concurrently with acid injury and immediately after the injury with the aim of determining its efficacy both as a protective and reparative drug.

The investigators had no influence on the selection of dogs for euthanasia or the timing of euthanasia. The NC State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee reviewed the study, and waived approval of the study because investigators solely collected tissues from euthanized dogs, and did not take part in the euthanasia of dogs. Shelter staff used an overdose of pentobarbital to euthanize dogs. Dogs that were surrendered for illness or had obvious signs of systemic disease were excluded.</p><p>The precise age of the dogs was unknown in most cases, but ranged from &#x0223c;8 months to 10 years&#x02010;of&#x02010;age. The dogs were typically mixed breed, ranging in size from &#x0223c;10 to 30 kg. All dogs were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Immediately after euthanasia, the entire antral&#x02010;pyloric section of the stomach was excised, then incised along the greater curvature and placed mucosa side down in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Ringer's solution (Ringer's solution additives, in mM: 114.0 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 1.25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.3 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.65 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) at room temperature. After a 20&#x02010; to 25&#x02010;minute transport time to the laboratory, the tissue was transferred to oxygenated Ringer's solution at room temperature and the seromuscular layer was removed via blunt dissection. The remaining antral mucosa tissue was mounted on Ussing chambers (1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> diameter). Tissues were mounted on Ussing chambers from each animal for all control and treatment groups.

When administered immediately after acid injury, sucralfate accelerated recovery from acid injury. These findings suggest potential utility for SUP using sucralfate in dogs.</p><p>The Ussing chamber mimics the alteration in submucosal blood flow that precipitates SRMD, resulting in mucosal injury at a physiologically relevant pH.<xref rid="jvim15076-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Because pH 1.2 is in the range of daily pH variation, gastric ulceration would not necessarily be expected in vivo. However, in the present experiments, tissues in the Ussing chamber model are isolated from a blood supply, removing an important gastroprotective mechanism, likely allowing for tissue to be more easily injured than in vivo, similar to injury that occurs during splanchnic hypoperfusion. The model of pH 1.2 for 45 minutes was selected from a number of time and acid injury combinations because of its reliability of producing marked but recoverable acid injury.</p><p>When sucralfate was applied to the gastric mucosa at the completion of acid injury, treatment accelerated recovery of barrier function and normalized tissue morphology. Flux of <sup>3</sup>H&#x02010;mannitol as a measurement of gastric permeability was not altered by sucralfate treatment in this stage of the investigation, which is not surprising given that mannitol fluxes detect changes in barrier function over larger blocks of time (1 hour versus 15 minutes) and as such, the remaining time post&#x02010;injury might not have been sufficient to detect a difference in barrier function. This model of injury more closely mimics treatment with sucralfate in patients with pre&#x02010;existing damage to the gastric mucosa, implying that sucralfate could be used to treat pre&#x02010;existing SRMD.</p><p>The mechanism by which sucralfate exerted is protective and reparative effects to injured mucosa was not specifically examined in the current study. Histologically, PAS/Alcian blue demonstrated a thick proteoglycan layer in sucralfate treated tissues (data not shown), implying a potential role of sucralfate in increasing mucus production. However, we could not conceive of an accurate method to measure significant differences in the mucus layer. For example, in Figure <xref rid="jvim15076-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, injury causes an apparent increased thickness of the mucus layer, but the irregular nature of this thickening precluded measuring and statistically analyzing these changes. Instead, we relied on our primary goal of measuring gastric barrier function in treated tissues.</p><p>There are several limitations to the use of the Ussing chamber model to study gastric injury and specifically SRMD. It allows only for the study of peracute injury (induced within an hour) because of the viability of canine gastric mucosa ex vivo, so the duration of efficacy of sucralfate could not be examined. Drugs that have a delayed effect on tissues, such as a PPI, would be difficult to investigate without pretreatment of dogs before euthanasia. The Ussing chamber model is not an ideal replication of splanchnic hypoperfusion and does not allow for the interaction of other host factors, such as gastric motility or concurrent medications. However, it has the advantage of allowing for the examination of barrier function in a more comprehensive manner than would be possible with an in vitro or in vivo model.</p><p>This investigation was completed using tissue from dogs that were previously scheduled for euthanasia and included a variety of breeds and ages. The effect of age, sex, and neuter status did not affect baseline barrier function (data not shown). However, there was a large degree of inter&#x02010;dog variability that might be in part explained by the variation in ages and breeds. Nonetheless, no research animals were used and in spite of the individual variation among dogs, a significant protective and reparative effect of sucralfate was demonstrated.</p><p>This ex vivo model of SRMD provided an avenue to investigate the pathophysiology and potential treatment of this disease syndrome in dogs, and demonstrated that sucralfate effectively prevented and accelerated healing of acid&#x02010;induced mucosa. We conclude that sucralfate could be an effective alternative SUP in dogs that can tolerate oral medications. Further work is needed to examine the efficacy of sucralfate as a prophylactic and treatment for SRMD through in vivo studies and with critically ill dogs.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15076-sec-0027"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15076-sec-0028"><title>OFF&#x02010;LABEL ANTIMICROBIAL DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no off&#x02010;label use of antimicrobials.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15076-sec-0029"><title>INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC) OR OTHER APPROVAL DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no IACUC or other approval was needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list content-type="cited-references"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="jvim15076-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="jvim15076-cit-0002">
