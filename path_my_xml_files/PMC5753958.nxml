The National Athletic Trainers&#x02019; Association (NATA) has recommended immobilization with either a traditional spine board or a full-body immobilization device.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The NATA specifically mentions the use of a full-body vacuum splint to improve comfort for the immobilized athlete and reduce the irritation of bony prominences.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This recommendation was based on previous studies that have shown improved comfort and less cervical spine extension and lateral bending in a full-body vacuum splint.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>Cervical spine immobilization of a football player is complicated by the presence of a helmet, facemask, and shoulder pads. Previously, the NATA had recommended the maintenance of equipment until transport to the emergency department.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The rationale for deference of on-field equipment removal was based on preventing unwanted movement of the cervical spine.

</p><p>Because of the current recommendations of both a rigid spine board and vacuum-mattress splint in the management of a suspected cervical spine injury, the current study aimed to compare cervical spine motion between a traditional rigid spine board and a full-body vacuum splint. In light of the recommendation to remove athletic equipment in a prehospital setting, the secondary aim of this study was to investigate the influence of football equipment, and the process of equipment removal, on cervical spine motion using each immobilization type. Last, this study evaluated the influence of weight on cervical spine motion under each of the above conditions. We hypothesized that immobilization with a rigid board or vacuum splint, the presence of equipment, or weight would not influence cervical spine motion. However, we hypothesized that increased cervical spine motion would occur in removing equipment from the immobilized athlete.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967117744757"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967117744757"><title>Design and Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy male participants volunteered for this crossover study to examine the influence of immobilization type and presence of equipment on triplanar angular cervical spine motion.

Two previous studies showed that rigid backboards and vacuum-mattress splints provided similar degrees of immobilization.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In contrast, Luscombe and Williams<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> found the vacuum splint to provide more stability. The above studies used rudimentary measuring techniques: patient alerts, flexible metal arms, rigid metal wire arms, inclinometers, and goniometers. The current study is the first to use 3-dimensional motion analysis to quantify triplanar cervical spine motion in a comparison of immobilization boards. Despite small but significant differences in cervical spine motion between board types, neither board with an immobilized equipped or unequipped athlete had cervical spine motion greater than 5&#x000b0; when moved and turned in the different testing conditions. Furthermore, motion between the board types was limited to 2&#x000b0; or less, irrespective of equipment or testing condition. These small movements in cervical spine motion did not surpass a previous established minimal important difference: 5&#x000b0; of flexion and extension and 3&#x000b0; of lateral bending and rotation.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>

This change in scores from the established literature can be attributed to the improved ergonomics of the modern, contoured, plastic rigid board compared with the antiquated, flat, wooden rigid board. Both the rigid board and vacuum-mattress splint provide adequate, comfortable, and clinically equal immobilization for a suspected cervical spine&#x02013;injured football player.</p><p>While immobilized, cervical spine motion was limited to 5&#x000b0; or less, irrespective of helmet and shoulder pad equipment or rigid board or vacuum-mattress splint. However, when removing equipment, cervical spine motion ranged from 11&#x000b0; to 15&#x000b0;. An increase in transverse-plane motion was detected with the use of the vacuum-mattress splint when taking into account the time to reach peak motion. Interestingly, equipment removal took less time when using the vacuum-mattress splint than the rigid spine board. Because the time taken to complete this process differed between immobilization types, we felt that it was appropriate to normalize by time to peak motion. Despite this normalization, peak motion occurred faster in the transverse plane for the vacuum-mattress splint, which may have contributed to the observed difference between immobilization types. Motion during the removal of equipment exceeded the minimal important difference established by Swartz et al<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and accepted by Boissy et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Previous authors<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> have noted 18&#x000b0; of motion by fluoroscopy while removing football equipment in an injured cadaveric model. Using motion capture, this study confirms the movement of the cervical spine during equipment removal.</p><p>It is not established what amount of movement of an injured cervical spine would lead to neurological injuries. McGuire et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967117744757" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have noted the possibility of neurological injuries with a greater than 2-cm anterior-posterior displacement of the cervical spine.

Despite the idealistic circumstances, the current study showed cervical spine motion while removing football equipment. Real-life clinical scenarios involving unqualified health care professionals attempting to remove equipment could lead to unwanted neurological sequelae. Sports medicine physicians and athletic trainers should continue to lead the process of equipment removal. Their expertise in protecting the cervical spine&#x02013;injured athlete cannot be overstated. Additional research is needed to specify a clinical threshold of cervical spine movement in the immobilized athlete.</p><p>This is the first study to evaluate the effect of weight on cervical spine motion during simulated cervical spine immobilization and transfer. The correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2325967117744757">Figure 5</xref> confirm the importance of considering the weight of the athlete and the presence of equipment when choosing the immobilization type. In general, patients with a greater weight had less movement on the rigid board compared with the vacuum splint. Specifically, heavier, unequipped athletes experienced less cervical spine motion when immobilized to a rigid backboard (sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes). Furthermore, the presence of equipment protected against movement in both the rigid board and vacuum splint. We postulate that the equipment may normalize the body mass by distributing the mass over a fixed surface. When athletes weighing over 250 lb were analyzed, the vacuum splint allowed motion greater than the 5&#x000b0; clinical threshold, whereas the rigid board reduced cervical spine motion to within the 5&#x000b0; threshold.</p><sec id="section16-2325967117744757"><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study is not without limitations. Cervical spine motion was captured in a healthy, noninjured athlete. The conditions of the experiment were in a controlled environment without distractions. Real-life clinical scenarios could show increased cervical spine motion. As the spine-boarded athletes in our study did not suffer a cervical spine injury, the involuntary contracture of the paraspinal musculature in the tested participants could have led to an underestimation of cervical spine motion. Furthermore, testing was only performed on male football players. These data may not be applicable to other helmeted athletes (hockey, lacrosse, etc) or female athletes. Nevertheless, we believe that the current study supports the use of a rigid board or vacuum-mattress splint in the immobilized football player.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section17-2325967117744757"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study confirms the statistically significant but clinically insignificant motion with the vacuum-mattress splint compared with the rigid backboard in varying sized, equipped, or unequipped athletes. Significant cervical spine motion occurs when removing a football helmet and shoulder pads, at an unknown risk to the injured athlete. Qualified health care providers such as certified athletic trainers and team physicians should be intimately involved in equipment removal. In immobilized athletes with a weight greater than 250 lb, immobilization with the rigid board with equipment present helped to reduce cervical spine motion compared with the vacuum-mattress splint.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967117744757"><p>The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest in the authorship and publication of this contribution.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-2325967117744757"><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Virginia&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research (FWA No. 00006183).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967117744757"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
