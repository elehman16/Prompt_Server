One of the potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue is &#x0201c;exercise-induced hyperammonemia&#x0201d;. Previous studies have shown that supplementation with amino acids can increase training tolerance. The &#x003b1;-keto acids are biochemical analogs of amino acids and can be converted to amino acids through transamination, thus reducing the cellular ammonia level. This double blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the effects of &#x003b1;-keto acid supplementation (KAS) on training tolerance, training effect, and stress-recovery state.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-three untrained young male adults underwent four weeks of training (5 sessions/week; 30 minutes running at the individual anaerobic threshold followed by 3 x 3 minute sprints/each session). Throughout the 4&#x02009;weeks of training and one week of recovery, subjects took &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (AKG group, 0.2&#x02009;g/kg/d, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), branched-chain keto acids (BCKA group, 0.2&#x02009;g/kg/d, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) or isocaloric placebo (control group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 4<sup>th</sup> week training volume, maximum power output and muscle torque were higher in the AKG group (175&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;42&#x02009;min, 412&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;49 Watts and 293&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;58 Newton meters, respectively, P&#x0003c;0.05) and the BCKA group (158&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;35, 390&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;29 and 273&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;47, P&#x0003c;0.05) than in the control group (92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;70, 381&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;67 and 233&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;43). The general stress and emotional exhaustion as assessed by the rest-stress-questionnaire-sport after the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of training increased significantly in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), but not in the KAS groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Under KAS, subjects could bear a higher training volume and reach a higher power output and peak muscle torque, accompanied by a better stress-recovery-state. Thus, KAS improves exercise tolerance and training effects along with a better stress-recovery state.

Among the metabolic changes induced by exercise, blood lactate concentration has been extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is well-known that protein breakdown is accelerated with intensive exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Under high-intensity exercise, amino acids produced from muscle protein breakdown are partly used to produce energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has been shown that the blood level of ammonia increased significantly in rats during resistance exercise and in humans during intense dynamic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several studies have reported that an exercise bout causes a dramatic increase in ammonia concentration along with an increase in inosine-5&#x000b4;-monophosphate (IMP) and the ratio of IMP/AMP (adenosine monophosphate), demonstrating a deamination process from AMP to IMP under high energy turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which can remain above the baseline level after one hour of recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previous studies have attributed exercise-induced hyperammonemia to fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, an ammonia accumulation caused by exercise is considered a negative factor for exercise tolerance.</p><p>The effects of nutritional intervention, especially amino acid supplements, on physical performance have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is evident that supplementation with specific amino acids, such as glutamate, reduces ammonia concentrations during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, it is also evident that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leads to a distinct elevation in arterial ammonia level during 60&#x02009;min of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Alternatively, &#x003b1;-keto acids that are analogs to amino acids do not donate ammonia during metabolism, but can catch or re-bind ammonia through the ammonia-shuttle or recycle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (AKG), re-binds ammonia through the action of aminotransferase to form glutamate, and the branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) to form BCAA (the so-called BCKA-BCAA cycle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As a result, &#x003b1;-keto acids, by exerting biological roles in protein metabolism, may prevent or attenuate the hyperammonemia associated with physical training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies of nutritional interventions with supplementation of amino acids during physical training have been published. BCAA supplementation was reported to increase endurance capacity in trained individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but this result was not supported by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, the combination of the keto analog and amino acid supplementation was reported to attenuate the increase in blood ammonia concentration after an exercise bout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, studies of the effects of &#x003b1;-keto acid supplementation (KAS) seem to be principally limited to pathological conditions such as renal or hepatic disorders, and the effects of KAS alone on physical exercise in healthy subjects remain unknown. Because glutamate/glutamine and BCAA play the prominent roles in protein metabolism and have been extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], examining the effects of their keto acid analogs (i.e., AKG and BCKA) on physical training is of scientific interest. We hypothesized that KAS can improve training tolerance under physiological conditions through its biochemical role as an amino acid analog, but without ammonia loading. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of KAS on exercise tolerance, training effect, and stress-recovery state in normal healthy subjects in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-six healthy male volunteers were initially enrolled in the study. The health status of the subjects was verified by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, lung function test with body plethysmogram and routine blood tests (full blood counts, creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as electrolytes, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides) according to the standards of German Society of Sports Medicine. Subjects with obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and maple syrup urine disease were excluded. The untrained status of the subjects was considered when the following criteria were all met: physical exercise had not been regular and was less than 2 hours each week during the last three years, and maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;min<sup>1</sup>&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>.

An accumulation of metabolites such as ammonia produced by deamination from AMP to IMP and by protein metabolism during exercise may play an important role in this regard. Any modification to metabolites may affect exercise tolerance. Previous studies have shown that supplementation with amino acids can lead to changes in energy metabolites and physical performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Biochemically, &#x003b1;-keto acids are endogenous intermediate metabolites, analogs to amino acids and may affect the cellular and blood level of ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that supplementation with &#x003b1;-keto acids has an impact on physical training. We have therefore hypothesized that supplementation with &#x003b1;-keto acids improves exercise tolerance and training effects. In this study, we found that by supplementing the subjects with KAS, their training volume, maximum power output and maximum muscle torque, as well as their performance, were all significantly increased, which was associated with a better recovery-stress state. Therefore, KAS can indeed improve training tolerance.</p><sec><title>KAS effects on physical training</title><p>A number of studies of nutritional intervention during physical training have been published. A recent study reported that acute supplementation of cyclists with keto analogs and amino acids during exercise attenuated exercise-induced hyperammonemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the effects of KAS alone during prolonged physical training have not been reported. In the present study, we have adopted the double blind, randomized and placebo-controlled trial design, so that the subjective component affecting exercise tolerance could be precluded from the effects of KAS. To provoke the metabolic challenge, a cohort of untrained subjects was recruited and a very strenuous training program was undertaken to achieve an &#x0201c;over-reaching&#x0201d; status. The training was highly demanding; the subjects in the control group could not maintain their assigned training volume during the second half of the program (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The training data also showed a typical training effect at the stage of over-reaching; i.e., a significant improvement in maximum power output after recovery but only slightly in aerobic exercise capacity, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The subjects underwent an endurance-training bout first so that the energy reserve was exhausted, and the subsequent sprint running would then draw energy partly from protein metabolism. This training strategy constitutes a valid metabolic challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To exclude the influence of components other than &#x003b1;-keto acids, the intake of energy and minerals was carefully matched in the placebo preparation. There were no side effects or difficulties in compliance, suggesting that the supplementation was safe.</p><p>Despite the hard training, over-training did not occur because there were no clinical complaints and no decrease in the maximum performance and maximum blood lactate concentration (10.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.4&#x02009;mM). The training, however, improved VO<sub>2max</sub> (average 14%, P&#x0003c;0.01) in all three groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This result is in accord with those of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The training effect on VO<sub>2max</sub> was comparable among the three groups, although the training volume was quite different at the second half of the training phase. This finding may be explained by the fact that the oxygen delivery determined principally by the cardiorespiratory system is the primary limiting factor for VO<sub>2max</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The maximum power output did not change in the control group after the training phase and recovery (NS). There was a similar increase in maximum power output in both study groups after the training and more so after recovery, indicating a &#x0201c;super-compensation&#x0201d; effect from training (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These results are in good accord with those of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and suggest a significant training effect in both groups supplemented with KAS. Similarly, the muscle function, both maximum torque on isometric measurement and maximum performance on isokinetic measurement, increased significantly after recovery in both groups supplemented with KAS. The maximum muscle torque was higher in the AKG group than in the BCKA group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), mainly due to the different baseline levels but not changes in training (NS). In the present study, the endurance capacity (P<sub>LAT</sub> in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) was improved in all three groups with no significant difference among the groups, which could be attributed to the concurrent training program executed with combined training components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>It is also interesting to observe the relative changes in VO<sub>2max</sub> and P<sub>max.</sub>. There was a similar increase in VO<sub>2max</sub> in all three groups, but the P<sub>max</sub> was much higher in the two groups with KAS than in the control group, suggesting that there was either a higher work efficiency or a higher quotient of anaerobic energy metabolism associated with KAS. Because the maximum blood lactate concentration was comparable among the groups (data not shown), the higher relation of P<sub>max</sub> to VO<sub>2max</sub> for both groups with KAS can be considered as reflecting improved work efficiency.</p><p>VO<sub>2max</sub> was determined on a cycle-ergometer instead of using a treadmill test since this method was established in our laboratory and a rapid linear increment of the workload was better to achieve. Determination of VO<sub>2max</sub> on a cycle-ergometer is well established and widespread in the routine practice of sports medicine. Yet it remains unclear whether a lack of statistically significant difference in this parameter among the groups could be attributed to the known fact that VO<sub>2max</sub> determined on a cycle-ergometer is generally lower than that determined on a treadmill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the training program performed in this study produced distinct training effects in the control group. However, KAS supplementation was associated with additional improvements in P<sub>max</sub> and maximum muscular torque and performance. Together with the data from training volume, it can be concluded that KAS improves training tolerance and has beneficial effects on physical training.</p></sec><sec><title>KAS effects on stress-recovery state</title><p>The state of stress-recovery during and after a training phase can be assessed using the questionnaire RESTQ-sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In general, the profiles of the RESTQ scores were quite different among the three groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A-D). The term general stress reached its highest level in the control group after the third training week (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Emotional exhaustion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C) and a slight increase in somatic complaints (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B) followed the same pattern but with distinct disturbed breaks as a sign of poor recovery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). A decrease in the general stress parameters at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> training week and after recovery was associated with a reduction in training volume (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This finding is in agreement with those of Kellmann and Gunther, who concluded that the general stress and somatic complaints were correlated with the duration of intense training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In contrast with the results for the control group, the RESTQ scores for the terms general stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) and emotional exhaustion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C) in the BCKA group did not change significantly and remained at a lower level, but the somatic complaints increased during the training period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). These data suggest that BCKA supplements can relieve general stress and emotional exhaustion and better preserve the recovery after high-level exercise. With the AKG supplement, the RESTQ profile was comparable to that of the control group, although the training volume was higher in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> training weeks. Considering the relationship between the amount of training and RESTQ scores in general stress and somatic complaints reported by Kellmann and Gunther [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], our data suggest that supplementation with AKG helps maintain the level of general stress, somatic complaints and emotional exhaustion during high-intensity training.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies investigating the effects of KAS supplementation on physical training. However, two relevant studies have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In a study of adult rats, De Almeida et al. have shown that exercise increased ammonia levels twofold with respect to the control and significantly increased blood urea levels (17%). Those authors also report that acute supplementation with keto acid-associated amino acids (KAAA) clearly reduced exercise-induced hyperammonemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This result was supported by a study of male cyclists, where it was observed that short-term supplementation with KAAA blunted exercise-induced hyperammonemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, in these two acute studies, the effect of KAAA on exercise tolerance was not investigated. Thus, whether the inhibition of exercise-induced hyperammonemia by supplementation with KAAA leads to an improvement in training tolerance remains unclear. Although the underlying mechanism of the effects of the supplementation of &#x003b1;-keto acids on physical exercise remains unclear, we have shown the beneficial impact of the supplementation with KAS on physical training in untrained individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify whether KAS supplementation affects amino acid homeostasis and ammonia metabolism during and after physical exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Physical exercise is of great significance to public health. However, to maintain physical activity is by no means simple, and exercise adherence is affected by a variety of factors. Finding ways to modify inhibitory factors such as exercise-induced hyperammonemia is of great scientific and clinical interest. This study has shown that nutritional supplementation with &#x003b1;-keto acids in healthy, untrained subjects significantly improved exercise tolerance, training effects, and stress-recovery state.
