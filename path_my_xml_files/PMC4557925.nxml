Findings from pragmatic trials may be used in KT to provide patients, healthcare providers and policymakers with information to optimize healthcare decisions based on how a given strategy or intervention performs under the real world conditions. However, pragmatic trials have been criticized for having the following problems: i) high rates of loss to follow-up; ii) nonadherence to study intervention; iii) unblinded treatment and patient self-assessment, which can potentially create bias; iv) being less perfect experiments than efficacy trials; v) sacrificing internal validity to achieve generalizability; and vi) often requiring large sample sizes to detect small treatment effects in heterogeneous populations. In this paper, we discuss whether these criticisms hold merit, or if they are simply driven by confusion about the purpose of pragmatic trials. We use the Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP) trial - a community randomized pragmatic trial designed to assess whether offering a highly organized, community-based CHAP intervention compared to usual care can reduce cardiovascular disease-related outcomes - to address these specific criticisms and illustrate how to reduce this confusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN50550004">ISRCTN50550004</ext-link> (9 May 2007).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pragmatic trials</kwd><kwd>Criticism</kwd><kwd>Knowledge translation</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomized trials</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) defines knowledge translation (KT) as a &#x0201c;<italic>dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically sound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, KT is a quality improvement process whose ultimate goal is to promote the use of evidence to support practice and policy. KT researchers have noted that whereas KT promotes evidence-based practice (EBP), the methods used to promote EBP are not always necessarily evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As such, randomized controlled trials of KT interventions play a significant role in the KT process. These KT trials are designed based on the following considerations: i) the right PICOT (population; intervention; comparator; outcomes; time-frame) research question that is relevant to patients, healthcare providers and policy-makers; ii) the right methodology, such as a randomized controlled trials (RCT), to minimize bias; iii) large sample sizes - to maintain sufficient power to account for heterogeneity of populations studied and variability in the estimated treatment effects; and most importantly iv) a pragmatic strategy in design, conduct and analysis - to optimize the relevance of the results for real world practice and decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>What is a pragmatic strategy?</title><p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines &#x0201c;pragmatic&#x0201d; as an adjective meaning <italic>&#x0201c;Dealing with matters in accordance with practical rather than theoretical considerations or general principles; aiming at what is achievable rather than ideal; matter-of-fact, practical, down-to-earth&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Inspired by Schwartz and Lellouch&#x02019;s work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], a pragmatic approach requires that when comparing treatments in the &#x0201c;real world,&#x0201d; one should take into account:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The realities of life - that patients may change or withdraw treatment, may not adhere to treatment, and may experience barriers to treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The patient, provider and policy-maker have preferences and pressures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Practice variations among healthcare providers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The existence of co-morbid conditions - patients may take multiple medications (which can interact with the treatment of primary interest).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Variations in decision-making processes between administrators or policy-makers, including funders.</p></list-item></list></p><p>A pragmatic trial is designed to answer the practical question of whether offering an intervention compared with some alternative (for example, usual care) within the real world environment does more good than harm. That is, a pragmatic trial addresses a question of whether an intervention does work under usual healthcare conditions in patients to whom it is offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other synonymous terms used for a pragmatic trial include <italic>practical</italic>, <italic>management</italic> or <italic>effectiveness</italic> trial. On the other hand, explanatory trials, also known as efficacy trials are designed to test whether an intervention can work under ideal, tightly controlled conditions in patients who receive it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They are therefore intentionally designed not to be pragmatic.</p><p>A key advantage of a pragmatic trial is that, if its result is positive (that is, the intervention is shown to cause more good than harm), one can be reasonably sure that the therapy being tested really works and can be successfully implemented in real practice. A disadvantage is that if its result is negative (that is, it is unclear whether the intervention does more harm than good), one cannot distinguish a worthless therapy from an efficacious therapy that is not applied or accepted widely enough by the participants. Hence, in pragmatic trials, it is better to test therapies that have already been shown to work in explanatory trials. On the other hand, the main advantage of explanatory trials is that if they are negative, one can abandon the therapy; a disadvantage is that if they are positive, one still does not know whether the therapy will work in usual healthcare conditions. Thus, positive explanatory trials still require therapies to be tested further in pragmatic trials, in order to assess their effects in real-world settings.</p><p>For some key resources on pragmatic and explanatory trials and the differences between them, we refer the reader to the clinician-trialist rounds by Dr. David Sackett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], where he reviews the main features of pragmatic trials, and MacPherson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The first three (i-iii) suggest that pragmatic trials may lead to biased estimates of effect of therapies or interventions, whereas the last three (iv, v and vi) suggest that pragmatic trials may not be a good use of research funds or may be infeasible to conduct.</p><p>The key issue is whether these criticisms are a fundamental problem in real-world health care. Do real-world patients know what treatment they are supposed to take, but often do not take it as prescribed, drop out of care, etcetera? If so, the problem must be permitted to occur, in order to get a clear answer as to whether the underlying therapy works in the real world. The more significant challenge in pragmatic trials is to prevent the problem from leading to a biased conclusion.</p><p>In the next section, we describe our experiences in designing and conducting a KT trial using a pragmatic strategy - the CHAP trial designed to implement evidence-based guidelines to improve cardiovascular health among the elderly in Ontario communities - to illustrate how one can address these criticisms in the design, conduct and analysis of a pragmatic trial.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics</title><p>The CHAP trial was approved by the research ethics boards at Bruy&#x000e8;re Continuing Care in Ottawa, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, and McMaster University in Hamilton.

Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for death in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and a leading cause of hospitalization, disability and death in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In Canada, the burden of CVD is huge - with one CVD or stroke death every 7&#x000a0;min. Cardiovascular disease accounts for 17&#x000a0;% of the total hospitalizations and over CAN $22 billion is spent each year on CVD problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We know from efficacy or explanatory CVD trials that a decrease of 10&#x000a0;mmHg in systolic blood pressure or 5&#x000a0;mm. Hg in diastolic blood pressure (with one medication or a change in lifestyle) significantly improve health outcomes: they can reduce heart failures by 50&#x000a0;%, strokes by 40&#x000a0;% and death or heart attacks by 10-15&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, we also know that major gaps exist in making efficacious therapies or interventions effective in the real world. For example, detection, treatment and control of hypertension remain sub-optimal, with only half of the people with hypertension actually being diagnosed; of those diagnosed, only half are treated, and of those treated, only half control their hypertension - a phenomenon that is seen in many diseases and referred to as the rule of halves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Many people are unaware they have high blood pressure (BP), which is why hypertension is often called &#x0201c;the silent killer&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, recommended techniques for BP measurement are rarely followed, and community-based interventions are often not linked to primary care.</p><p>The CHAP study was a cluster randomization trial, with the community as the unit of randomization, intervention, analysis and inference, designed to address the CVD problems created by hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Introduced in 2009, the PRECIS is a tool that can be used to indicate the level of pragmatism of a trial on 10 elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The wider the web on the PRECIS wheel, the more pragmatic a trial design is, and the closer it is to the center of the wheel, the more explanatory it is. Judging from the PRECIS wheel for the CHAP trial, the CHAP investigators believed that CHAP was a highly pragmatic trial. Scoring was done independently by five investigators and the scores of each investigator are shown as a green dot in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>PRECIS score for the CHAP trial at the end of trial.

Extrapolating to the general population aged 65&#x000a0;years, the 9&#x000a0;% RR means that the CHAP intervention would result in approximately 5,000 fewer hospital admissions for CVD annually in Ontario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>How did we address the key criticisms about pragmatic trials in the CHAP trial?</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Criticism 1: High rate of loss to follow-up</title><p>It is important to note that loss to follow-up is a fundamental feature of pragmatic trials because loss to follow-up is a normal process of clinical care in the real world. We prevented it from causing bias in CHAP by not adding artificial follow-up clinic visits for patients who did not attend. Instead, we used independent administrative databases that recorded the outcomes for all community dwelling residents, regardless of whether they participated in the program or not or whether they moved in, out or between communities during the study period (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We then applied the intention-to-treat (TT) principle to analyze the data, by including all residents aged 65&#x000a0;years or older in the control and intervention communities. In fact, ITT analysis is the most appropriate way to answer the question of whether an intervention works under usual conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Criticism 2: Non-adherence to study intervention</title><p>Non-adherence, a normal process in clinical care in the real world, is fundamental to pragmatic trials because they are designed to study real-world practice.

We prevented it from causing <italic>bias</italic> in CHAP by using ITT analysis to describe the real-world situation.

Efficacy and pragmatic trials should not be compared in this way as they seek to answer entirely different questions. In the CHAP trial, the efficacy of blood pressure measurements, CVD risk assessment, education and referral were never in question but rather the effectiveness of organizing these services in a community setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Criticism 5: Compromising internal validity to achieve generalizability</title><p>For pragmatic trials, &#x0201c;internal validity&#x0201d; would be compromised if the real-world conditions were altered - that is, if no crossovers were allowed, patients or clinicians were blinded, or artificial follow-up visits were created to minimize loss-to-follow up. In fact, the trial <italic>would then no longer</italic> be pragmatic. A problem with this criticism is that the critics inappropriately judge the internal validity of a pragmatic trial by applying criteria that are appropriate for explanatory trials; this is a major source of confusion about pragmatic trials. We ensured the internal validity of the CHAP trial by preserving the natural process of care in the real world and by using other techniques - such as random allocation of the intervention - to minimize the potential for a bias in its conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Criticism 6: Large sample size requirements for small treatment effects</title><p>Finding small treatment effects in heterogeneous populations is vital to improving health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. At a population level, small differences can lead to substantial improvements in health and decreases in resource utilization and costs. The key challenge raised by this criticism is that of <italic>feasibility</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We made CHAP <italic>feasible</italic> by the following: including <italic>everyone</italic> aged 65&#x000a0;years or over who lived in the target communities; using existing community resources such as lead community organizations to coordinate the CHAP program; recruiting community-based family physicians to send out letters to all their eligible patients, inviting them to attend BP clinics set-up at the local pharmacies, which were manned by community peer health volunteers and mentors to assess CVD risk and measure BP; relying on community health nurses to ensure quality control; and using existing administrative databases for outcome assessment. The economic analysis of the CHAP trial showed that the real cost was on average CAN $20 per eligible resident aged at least 65&#x000a0;years old, and cost neutral (that is, there were no statistically significant differences in resource utilization or cost for hospitalizations, emergency department and physician visits, or prescription drugs between the CHAP arm and usual care) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In fact, comparing the per-patient cost of the CHAP trial to that of most CVD explanatory trials (at least CAN $5500 per patient) revealed that that CHAP was extremely inexpensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In addition to the arguments made above, other researchers have demonstrated that outcomes in patients who receive care in the context of an explanatory RCT (ideal circumstances) are neither better nor worse than in patients who receive care in real world (or pragmatic) circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In May 2012, Dr. Sackett organized a special session on &#x0201c;Confusions and controversies around pragmatic trials&#x0201d; at the Society of Clinical Trials annual meeting in Miami, USA.

Knowledge translation efforts that employ pragmatic trial methods are imperative, especially for optimal management of chronic health conditions. Pragmatic trials aim to assess the effectiveness of therapies or interventions under routine care (real-world) conditions. The key is to guard against biased conclusions. However, it is also important to think about &#x0201c;bias&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;validity&#x0201d; in the context of &#x0201c;effect under routine care.&#x0201d; Tampering with routine care conditions may actually lead to biased results on whether therapies work in the real-world settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>1</sup>Dave Sackett attributed this to Tjeerd-Pieter van Staa, head of research and honorary professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London UK.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHAP</term><def><p>Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIHR</term><def><p>Canadian Institutes for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBP</term><def><p>evidence-based practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HF</term><def><p>heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KT</term><def><p>knowledge translation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p>myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PICOT</term><def><p>Participants, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Timeframe</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRECIS</term><def><p>Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>relative reduction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LT developed the idea.
