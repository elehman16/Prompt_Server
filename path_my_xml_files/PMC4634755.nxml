Campos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] demonstrated that high-intensity actions were maintained by ATP-PCr metabolism during taekwondo combat simulation, in which glycolytic metabolism has been considered important to perform numerous high-intensity actions [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, nutritional strategies that could improve glycolytic metabolism, such as caffeine supplementation, could improve performance during simulated taekwondo combat. However, the effect of caffeine ingestion on energy cost during taekwondo combat is currently unexplored in the literature.</p><p>Rapid recovery between rounds is crucial to taekwondo success since official matches are composed of 3 rounds of 2 min with 1 min intervals [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Higher maximal aerobic power (VO<sub>2max</sub>) and, consequently, a faster parasympathetic reactivation during the intervals between rounds could help the athletes to improve taekwondo performance during either isolated (training) or consecutive combats (competition). Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) are non-invasive tools to provide information regarding the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic modulations during and after exercise [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Goldberger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] proposed a simple temporal time-varying parasympathetic index to evaluate parasympathetic reactivation after exercise, which is derived from the time-course of the root mean square of successive differences between R-R intervals (RMSSD) measured during successive 30-s segments (RMSSD<sub>30s</sub>). HRR can be assessed by the number of heart beats recovered within 60s after the cessation of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], fitting post-exercise HR recovery (HRR) to a first-order exponential decay [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and analyzing the time constant of 30s short-time recovery. Buchheit et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] showed that all HRR indexes were significantly correlated with glycolytic metabolism during high-intensity exercise. Caffeine ingestion has previously been shown to impair parasympathetic reactivation [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], though it could be hypothesized that caffeine supplementation would prolong sympathetic activity that occurs during exercise, increasing both adrenergic factors and local metabolites (i.e. epinephrine, lactate) during recovery. Thus, caffeine may actual slow parasympathetic reactivation after combat simulation.</p><p>Caffeine (1,3,7 &#x02013;trimethylxanthine) ingestion (3&#x02013;9 mg&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>) has been shown to significantly improve performance during endurance tasks (activities lasting greater than 30 min) [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although its effect on short-term (&#x0003c; 30 min) high-intensity exercise is less clear [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Caffeine has been shown to increase anaerobic contribution [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and reduce the rating of perceived exertion [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] during exercise. However, little attention has been given to the effect of caffeine ingestion on combat sports, and only one study investigated its effect on taekwondo combat. Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed improved performance with 5 mg&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup> caffeine supplementation on performance during simulated taekwondo combat. The results of this study suggested caffeine supplementation allowed individuals to maintain an increased exercise intensity during the latter rounds as indicated by increased blood lactate concentrations following the second and third rounds. However, no study to date has evaluated the effect of caffeine ingestion on the contribution of different energy systems during, or parasympathetic reactivation after, taekwondo combat simulation.</p><p>Therefore, the aim subsequent rmance feine on performance? You need to put this in order. My suggestion is below:easure following the second and thof this study was to evaluate the effect of caffeine ingestion on estimated energy systems contribution during simulated taekwondo combat and its subsequent effects on performance. Furthermore, we determined whether caffeine supplementation influenced parasympathetic indexes measured following the combat simulation. We hypothesized that caffeine supplementation would increase glycolytic metabolism, and thus lead to performance improvements, during the combat simulation. Furthermore, it was supposed that the higher glycolytic metabolism contribution with caffeine would delay cardiac autonomic recovery.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten male taekwondo athletes (age: 21 &#x000b1; 4 years, body mass: 71.0 &#x000b1; 12.9 kg, height: 1.80 &#x000b1; 0.08 m), who were black belt holders with a minimum of 9 years&#x02019; experience took part in the present study. All of the subjects were active competitors in national and international championships. The athletes were at the competitive phase of their preparation and engaged in 10 sessions of training per week; approximately 1.5 h was dedicated to technical workouts, 12 h to tactical training and the remaining time to strength and flexibility (2h). The sample was representative of high-level male taekwondo athletes from all Olympic weight divisions: &#x0003c;58 kg (n = 3), 58&#x02013;68 kg (n = 3), 68&#x02013;70 kg (n = 2), &#x0003e;80 kg (n = 3). Prior to testing, the athletes were informed of the procedures, including the possible risks involved, and signed an informed consent form. This study was conducted in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines and Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures were approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo.</p><p>

To account for athlete drop out, we aimed to recruit eleven participants. However, one participant was excluded from the study due to technical problems with the gas analyzer during collection and the athlete&#x02019;s lack of time to repeat all procedures. Thus, statistical analysis was performed on ten participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec008" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>Athletes attended two sessions in which they were required to consume one capsule containing either 5 mg&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup> of pure caffeine (CAF; Formula Ativa Pharmacy, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) or cellulose (placebo; PLA) alongside 200 ml water, in a double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures crossover design (<xref rid="pone.0142078.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Immediately following combat simulation, athletes answered a questionnaire to evaluate any side effects (e.g., increased urine output, gastrointestinal problems, tachycardia, muscle soreness, or headache) experienced by participants during the combat simulation [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

To avoid the influence of diet on performance, athletes filled-out a 24-h food diary on the day preceding the first trial and were instructed to repeat the same diet on the day preceding the second test. Furthermore, during combat simulation the athletes did not ingest water or any food during the experiments. The athletes were also instructed not to ingest alcohol during the study and to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing substances (i.e., coffee, chocolate, and soft drinks) for 24-h before the experimental tests. Athletes were also required not to be performing any rapid weight loss in order to make weight during the period in which experiments were conducted. Habitual caffeine intake was assessed via a questionnaire with only two participants reporting a high-consumption level for caffeine (corresponding to more than six cups of coffee per day), while the remaining participants all reported a low-consumption level (less than two cups of coffee per day). The athletes performed the tests hydrated and fed, with the last meal ingested two hours before the start of the supplementation protocol. The temperature and relative humidity in CAF and PLA were 27.7&#x000b0;C, 13.4% and 29.5&#x000b0;C, 13.4%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Simulated Taekwondo Combat</title><p>Simulated combat was performed according to the World Taekwondo Federation&#x02019;s (WTF) official rules and followed the Olympic weight categories. Briefly, each combat consisted of three 2-min rounds with 1-min intervals, and took place within an official area (8 x 8 m). A black belt in taekwondo who was blinded to the capsule content that the athletes had ingested refereed the matches. Although new taekwondo rules establish the use of electronic body protectors to protect the trunk of the athlete and at the same time allow more reliable and accurate score identification [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we did not use this system because it would cause interference with the gas analyzer. The gas analyzer was placed on the athlete&#x02019;s back and no attack to this area was allowed. Each athlete competed in a one-on-one match, and only one athlete was evaluated per match (CAF or PLA vs. non-supplemented athlete); the opponent was the same in both conditions. Furthermore, although coaches and others athletes were present during the experiments, no verbal encouragement was provided to the athletes. These procedures were similar to those used in studies analyzing karate [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and taekwondo [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

The blood sample collections took place immediately before and after the warm-up, immediately after each round, and 1, 3 and 5-min after the last round.</p><p>Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was measured immediately before and after the warm-up, and immediately before and after each round using the 6&#x02013;20 Borg scale [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The subjects were asked to report RPE using cues derived from all sensations experienced during the exercise. Oxygen consumption was measured breath-by-breath during combat and rest using the K4b<sup>2</sup> (Cosmed, Italy), which has previously been validated [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The athlete remained with the equipment during the entire combat and for 6-min after the activity ended. Mean oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2MEAN</sub>) for each round was calculated as the average VO<sub>2</sub> during the entire time of the round. Since the gas analyzer uses telemetry, the start and finish of all combat phases were marked by one researcher who made these markers during all matches procedures. Thus, VO<sub>2</sub> between rounds (VO<sub>2INTERVAL</sub>) also was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Estimated Energy System Contribution</title><p>Estimates of the contributions of the oxidative, glycolytic and ATP-PCr systems during exercise were calculated using the measurements of oxygen consumption during activity, peak blood lactate concentration, and the fast phase of excess oxygen consumption after exercise (EPOC<sub>FAST</sub>).

In the present study, we fitted the kinetics of post-match oxygen consumption to bi- and mono-exponential models and, since the slow component of the bi-exponential model was negligible, post-match breath-by-breath VO<sub>2</sub> data were fitted to a mono-exponential model and W<sub>PCR</sub> was obtained by calculating the integral of the exponential part (Origin 6.0, Microcal, Massachusetts, USA). The contribution of the glycolytic system (W<sub>[La</sub>

HR was measured continuously throughout the match simulation using a HR monitor (Polar S810i, Finland). Mean (HR<sub>mean</sub>) and peak (HR<sub>peak</sub>) HR were determined during each round. Parasympathetic function was assessed during the 6-min period after the third round. At the end of third round, all athletes immediately sat passively on a chair. Time between the end of exercise and sitting was less than 5-s. Particular attention to this detail was made because differences in body posture have been shown to result in different absolute HR recovery values. HRR was calculated by 1) taking the absolute difference between the final HR at the end of third round (mean of 5-s) and the HR recorded 60-s later (HRR<sub>60s</sub>: mean of 5-s), 2) taking the time constant of HR decay obtained by fitting the 6-min post-exercise HRR into a first-order exponential decay curve (HRR<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>), or by 3) analyzing the first 30-s (from the 10<sup>th</sup> to the 40<sup>th</sup> seconds) via logarithmic regression analysis (T30) [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Time-varying vagal-related Heart Rate Variability (HRV) index</title><p>A progressive increase in the R-R interval is generally observed during the initial 5-min of HRR, although on shorter scales (i.e., 15-60-s), the curve is piecewise linear with superimposed oscillations.

[<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Time-motion analyses were conducted in an attempt to calculate work:rest ratios for each match. The events were measured in tenths of a second, using the marking tool in the analysis software. Attack time (AT), stepping time (ST) and pause time (PT) were recorded separately for each round. The AT was the total time during which the athlete attacked or tried to attack his opponent. Specifically, we recorded the time elapsed between the moment that the athlete began to move his foot or hand in the direction of the opponent and the moment when the athlete finished the attack movement. The ST was defined as the total time in which there was no attempt to attack and the PT was characterized by time-outs determined by the referees.</p><p>The following indexes were calculated from these measurements: AT for each round; ST for each round; sum of AT for each round; sum of ST for each round; total attack number (AN) for each round; and average AT:ST ratio for each round [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To verify the reliability of analysis, all matches were analyzed twice by the same researcher and a reliability of analyses was performed using an Intraclass Coefficient Correlation (ICC). The ICC revealed that the time-motion analyses conducted in this study was highly reliable for all 5 variables investigated, with values ranging from 0.95 to 0.99 (P &#x0003c; 0.05): attack time (ICC: 0.98; P &#x0003c; 0.01), total attack number for each round (ICC: 0.95; P &#x0003c;0.01), sum of attack time for each round (ICC: 0.99; P &#x0003c; 0.01), stepping time (ICC: 0.97; P &#x0003c; 0.01), sum of stepping time for each round (ICC: 0.99; P &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to determine if the data met parametric assumptions (normality). The data were tested for homogeneity using Levene&#x02019;s test. After confirmation of normality and homogeneity, the variables were compared using a two-way (condition and time of measurement) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurements in the second factor (condition x time). Where necessary, a Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used in order to identify possible differences between conditions and time. When the assumption of sphericity was violated, as indicated by the Mauchley test, the critical value of F was adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon value. All indexes of HRR were compared using a Student&#x02019;s t-test in both CAF and PLA. Effect sizes were calculated using eta squared (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>). A &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were considered as small, moderate and large effects [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Previous studies have reported benefits after caffeine ingestion on high-intensity exercise [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as during taekwondo combat simulation [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, not all studies have shown a positive effect of caffeine with no performance changes shown during successive maximal cycling bouts [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], wrestling [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and judo [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly to our results, Lopes-Silva et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that caffeine ingestion did not improve performance (number of throws) during the Special Judo Fitness Test after a 5-day weight loss period. More recently, Felippe et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also reported that caffeine ingestion did not improve performance (number of throws) during the Special Judo Fitness Test. Conversely, Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that caffeine supplementation reduced the sum of time-outs enforced by the referee in the first and second rounds of a taekwondo combat simulation. The reasons for these differences are not clear, but may be related to different performance protocols that used different durations, intensities and type of exercise. In the present study, we evaluated simulated taekwondo combat and during this activity performance is determined by technical, tactical, physiological and physical characteristics of the athletes [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite an increased estimated glycolytic contribution with caffeine this did not alter the pattern of technical actions during the simulation. However, in the study conducted by Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] the combats were performed between supplemented athletes (i.e. caffeine <italic>versus</italic> caffeine), which suggests that improvement in performance may have been caused by the fact that both athletes were supplemented. In contrast to the study of Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], athletes in the present study were evaluated individually (supplemented <italic>versus</italic> non-supplemented athletes). Thus, when only one athlete is assessed (i.e., the supplemented athlete) there was no improvement in performance variables following caffeine supplementation during simulated taekwondo combat.</p><p>Our results show that there was no significant difference in HR<sub>mean</sub> and HR<sub>peak</sub> during simulated taekwondo combat after caffeine ingestion. Our data corroborate with Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], who did not report significant differences in HR responses during taekwondo combat simulation after caffeine supplementation in relation to placebo. However, there was an increase in HR values over the course of the combat. This corroborates with other studies, which have shown an increase in cardiovascular demand as the number of rounds continues in taekwondo athletes [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The results of our study showed a predominant estimated energy contribution of oxidative metabolism (65%) during simulated taekwondo combat, followed by ATP-PCr (27%) and glycolytic (8%) contribution. These results are in agreement with Campos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], who reported that energy contribution during a taekwondo combat simulation was predominantly supplied from aerobic sources, with lesser contribution from both the ATP-PCr and glycolytic energy systems. Furthermore, although caffeine supplementation had no effect on the ATP-PCr contribution, in the present study, there was an increase in ATP-PCr contribution in the third round in relation to the first and second rounds. This difference may be due to the method used to calculate ATP-PCr metabolism; a 1-min break between rounds is insufficient to determine VO<sub>2</sub> offset, while the fast component of EPOC is considered for determination of energy contribution during the third round.</p><p>Ratings of perceived exertion increased linearly across rounds, although no differences were shown between caffeine and placebo. These results are in accordance with Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], who showed that caffeine supplementation did not reduce RPE during simulated taekwondo combat. However, Doherty and Smith [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] did show that caffeine ingestion reduced perceived exertion; 29% of the variance explaining the ergogenic effect of caffeine on performance was due to decreased RPE during the exercise. As opposed to endurance exercise, taekwondo combat is acyclic and athletes distribute the technical and tactical actions through the combat. Thus, our results showed that caffeine supplementation does not affect RPE during simulated taekwondo combat.</p><p>Caffeine ingestion resulted in increased peak lactate concentration following simulated taekwondo combat. This result is supported by other studies, which showed an increase in blood lactate concentration after caffeine ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that caffeine ingestion resulted in increased lactate concentrations during simulated taekwondo combat when compared to placebo. Furthermore, Lopes-Silva et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that caffeine ingestion following a 5-day weight loss period resulted in increased lactate concentrations after successive bouts of the Special Judo Fitness Test. Thus, the increase in the lactate concentration after caffeine ingestion corroborates with the results reported in the literature.</p><p>Our results showed that caffeine ingestion increased estimated glycolytic contribution during simulated taekwondo combat when compared to placebo. Although no study in the literature has reported that CAF supplementation increases glycolytic contribution during a combat taekwondo simulation, it is well established that caffeine increases anaerobic contribution during cycling exercise [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that caffeine ingestion increased anaerobic contribution during a 4-km cycling time-trial and two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in blood lactate concentration. Firstly, CAF may increase anaerobic activity through its antagonistic action on peripheral adenosine receptors, which could prevent the inhibitory effects of adenosine on phosphofructokinase activity in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Secondly, caffeine may promote catecholamine release to facilitate the conversion of phosphorylase <italic>b</italic> to its more active <italic>a</italic> form, accelerating muscle glycogenolysis [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although previous studies showed a decrease in glycolytic contribution over subsequent rounds during simulated taekwondo combat [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], our data show that caffeine supplementation actually increased estimated glycolytic contribution during simulated taekwondo combat simulation in relation to placebo. However, this did not translate across into any changes in technical actions performed by the athletes.</p><p>Caffeine supplementation did not affect post-exercise parasympathetic reactivation indexes after the taekwondo combat simulation. In contrast to our results, Bunsawat et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that HR was increased 2-min after incremental treadmill exercise with caffeine in relation to placebo. However, this delay in HR was accompanied by an increase in time to exhaustion after caffeine supplementation. Thus, the delay in autonomic recovery after incremental exercise could have been caused by a combination of caffeine-induced sympathetic activation along with increased performance. Furthermore, although parasympathetic indexes after repeated sprint exercise have been correlated with anaerobic contribution, possibly through a high elevation of adrenergic factors and local metabolites during recovery [<xref rid="pone.0142078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the increase in glycolytic metabolism after caffeine ingestion did not influence the parasympathetic indexes after simulated taekwondo combat.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Practical Applications</title><p>Although time-motion performance variables during simulated taekwondo combat were not changed following supplementation, the results of the present study suggest that caffeine supplementation might be an effective strategy to increase glycolytic energy metabolism in taekwondo athletes, and could be an effective pharmacological strategy during training sessions to improve anaerobic capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, caffeine supplementation increased estimated glycolytic metabolism contribution during simulated taekwondo combat, although this did not translate into improvements in performance.
