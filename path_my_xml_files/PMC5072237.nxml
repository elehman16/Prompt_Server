Apart from oral mucositis, it was reported that the patients suffered from pain, fatigue, xerostomia, dysphagia, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction, thus negatively impacting the quality of life.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>One third of all cancer patients receiving oncological treatment and those with advanced cancers suffer from mental distress to an extent.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Physicians unwittingly fail to recognize the distressed patients invariably adding to their already compromised oral function and general well-being.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In a cancer context, emotional distress can be conceptualized as referring to anxiety, depression, and adjustment disorders related to the cancer experience.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Depression was found to be a persistent component at various stages of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and after.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A study reported the prevalence of depression in cancer patients between 25% and 52% during treatment and 11&#x02013;45% at 6 months follow-up.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Prevalence of distress reported as such in palliative care varies between 7% and 60% depending on the stage and type of disease, study design, and measures used, with most studies suggesting that around one-third of patients experience clinically significant distress.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Adjustment disorders are the most common psychiatric syndrome seen in cancer patients.

Concomitant oral mucositis and anxiety/depression can modulate response of patient toward pain perception.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, need of the hour was to evaluate anxiety/depression levels in patients having oral mucositis so that early recognition can decrease the morbidity associated with cancer treatment.</p><p>Rates of distress in cancer are measured as self-reports, with cutoff scores signifying distress or as combined rate of psychological disorders, mainly anxiety, depression, and adjustment disorders measured by psychiatric diagnostic interviews.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Various scales have been used to evaluate distress in the individuals with cancer, one of which is the popular Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS &#x02013; is a brief self-administered scale, which has been specifically designed for use in patients with co-morbid physical illness. It consists of 14 items, seven each recording depression and anxiety. Each item has four possible choices scoring from &#x02032;0&#x02032; to &#x02032;3&#x02032;. The depression subscale has been constructed in such a way as to largely exclude somatic symptoms. This subscale consists of items that predominantly screen for anhedonia, which is considered a symptom characteristic of the endogenous subtype of depression.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Validation studies have established a high internal consistency and reliable factor structure. The scale has been validated in the Indian population in a study that used HADS to screen for depression and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] They also established sensitivity and specificity for various cut-off scores. The study suggested that the best cut-off values for the Indian population are &#x02032;8&#x02032; and &#x02032;7&#x02032; for depression and anxiety, respectively. A cut-off score of &#x02032;8&#x02032; on a depression subscale has a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 76%, respectively, for the diagnosis of depression.</p><p>It is one of the commonly used questionnaire scales for identifying anxiety/depression in oncological settings.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The fourteen item questionnaire with cut off points indicates oncologists to decide about including a mental health care professional in treatment planning.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] There are very few studies relating anxiety and depression among oral mucositis patients on large scale population in Indian context.

Group II included those patients undergoing CCRT and having oral mucositis. Group III included radiotherapy patients within 14 days of initiation of therapy and having oral mucositis. Group IV included radiotherapy patients after 14 days of initiation of therapy and having oral mucositis.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of cancer, ability to speak and to complete the questionnaire, and willingness to be part of the study.

This allowed us to attain uniformity among the questionnaire participants and reducing the discrepancy of scores obtained during the study. The present study was carried out over 4 months period from June 2015 to September 2015. Participants were selected from outpatient and inpatient hospital facilities in the abovementioned oncological centers. The inpatients mostly fell into chemotherapy group and CCRT groups. The questionnaire was distributed among all the participants, and it was immediately collected once answered. The questionnaire had seven questions pertaining to anxiety and seven questions pertaining to depression. The summed up scores for anxiety and depression separately were obtained with the range between 0 and 7 considered as normal, 8&#x02013;10 considered as borderline, and 11 and above were considered as being abnormal or having frank anxiety/depression. The scores thus obtained were subjected to final assessment under six different variables among all 455 participants.</p><p>In addition, the severity of oral mucositis was also evaluated in all 455 patients grouping them under mild, moderate, and severe. The treatment of pain and burning from oral mucositis was done under the supervision of concerned oncologist who was in charge of the patient at presentation.

It is sensitive to changes both during the course of diseases and in response to psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological intervention. HADS scores predict psychosocial and possibly also physical outcome.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Many questionnaires devised in the West have been standardized to assess the psychological status of cancer patients throughout the world, one of which HADS was used in the study. However, some questions seemed unsuitable for our patients; hence, a questionnaire for the Indian set up is desirable.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In our study, many patients faced the problem of understanding idioms such as &#x0201c;butterflies in the stomach&#x0201d; even when translated into local language and between certain options, requiring us to provide the help of principal translator.</p><p>The validity of HADS after its translation, when not addressed carefully, the influence of language or culture might manifest causing shift in mean scores or diminished validity or it could lead to incomparable cut points because the translated item measures something else than intended in the original version.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>HADS has been used in this study to evaluate the participants taking part in the survey. Four hundred and fifty-five participants agreed to be part of the study, and there were no withdrawals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Gender</title><p>Of the 455 participants, 268 (58.9%) were women and 189 (41.1%) were men. This may represent the gender characteristics of cancers in general in this region of India. Maximum numbers of female participants were in Group III with 72.88%. This was found similar to the study &#x0201c;Psychological factors associated with head and neck cancer treatment and survivorship&#x0201d; by Howren <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Groups</title><p>Ideally, radiotherapy is given for 4&#x02013;5 weeks, 5 days a week between 100 and 200 cgy depending on the type of cancer. Radiotherapy group was divided into two subgroups-one, within 15 days of initiation of therapy and second group, after 15 days of therapy. This was done to compare the advent of oral mucositis during the second week of radiotherapy and healing during last week of treatment. Chemotherapy group was not divided as the participants who were undergoing therapy for more than a year might have affected the scores in the study. In addition, subjects undergoing CCRT were also included as separate group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Age</title><p>The age of participants ranged from 20 years to 80 years, with the maximum in 51&#x02013;60 years and least in the age group 71&#x02013;80. This was found to be similar to a study on Taiwanese oral cancer patients &#x0201c;Exploring Changes in Symptom Severity and Depression during Cancer Treatment.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Intensity of mucositis versus anxiety and depression</title><p>This variable when correlated with presence of anxiety and/or depression demonstrated significant results. It is a well known fact that as the treatment of cancer increased in number of days or cycle, the mucositis intensity increases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, along with the changes in intensity, there was significant increase in the scores of anxiety and depression in all the groups. It was most prominent in Group IV patients. This finding had corroborated with similar other study in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The levels of anxiety when correlated with the levels of mucositis showed that those in Group III had established anxiety closely followed by the Group IV. All the participants had severe mucositis in oral cavity. The appearance of mild mucositis and moderate mucositis was associated with borderline anxiety in Group I and Group II. This is conflicting evidence when compared with depression scores where the Group I and Group II with mild mucositis and moderate mucositis had established depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Diet</title><p>The dietary intake of solid and liquid food might have been compounding factors in the study. The patients on only liquid diet belonged majorly to Group II, followed closely by Group IV. Majority of participants were on solid food intake in Group I. However, conclusion could not be arrived regarding the scores of anxiety or depression with that of diet alone. There might have been more compounding factors along with the diet which would have influenced the scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Not anxious/depression</title><p>It was noteworthy that out of 455 participants, just 56 were classified as not anxious/depressed using HADS. Most of such subjects were from Group I.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the above study, it can be concluded that the Group IV had most number of participants with established anxiety and established depression. This was closely followed by Group II, then by Group III and least by Group I.</p><p>Thus, appropriate intervention in the form of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment appears warranted in all the above groups. Many of the antianxiety and antidepressants themselves cause profound oral changes such as hyposalivation, which may modify the pain, severity, and effecting quality of life. Appropriate psychiatric interventions during the treatment course as a multidisciplinary approach can better help and may improve overall treatment outcome in cancer treatment.</p><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Certain limitations marred the definitive outcome of the study which may be overcome in further other research directed toward such a process. There was no follow-up of the patients after 6 months to check for changes in the scores of anxiety or depression. The study also did not look into other compounding factors such as financial background and personal habits, which could have had an influence on the scores of anxiety or depression. The site and type of cancer might have influenced the scores, which again were ignored. An association between socioeconomic status and education, with anxiety and depression were not considered. Staging of the cancer and pain, which would have definitely affected the scores, was not taken into account due to confidential patient records which were not shared with the study investigators. It is recommended to include such factors and evaluate patients at various time intervals to arrive at proper analysis for effective intervention strategy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>Financial
