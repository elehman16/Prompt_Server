It has also been reported to play a part in improving the survival of neurons by heightening the resistance to nerve damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Exercise-induced increases in BDNF levels in the motor cortex and hippocampus have also been associated with enhanced learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been suggested that this increase in BDNF is associated with enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which supposedly enhances synaptic transmission and increases the expression of molecules associated with learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Since being discovered in human blood in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], exercise-mediated BDNF influx has been associated with improved cognitive ability and positive impacts on health and brain function. Indeed, many studies have examined BDNF and cognitive function, utilizing various exercise types and intensities in human subjects. Most of these studies reported that human serum showed higher concentration levels of BDNF in response to long-term aerobic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Several studies have reported improvement of cognitive function after both acute and chronic aerobic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Recent studies have reported that temporal exercise-induced increases in levels of BDNF can further escalate in response to chronic aerobic exercise bouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chronic elevations in resting serum BDNF levels have also been reported following long-term endurance training in human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast, some studies have reported that the duration of aerobic exercise does not have a significant influence on resting levels of serum BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is related to neurogenesis and regulation of the BDNF gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and is involved in the growth and differentiation of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In response to exercise, IGF-1 levels increase in the brain as well as in the periphery, thereby increasing neurotransmission across the blood vessel walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast, stress is known to have negative impact on the production of nerve cells and demonstrates an inverse association with levels of BDNF mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One typical stress hormone is cortisol.</p><p id="Par24">Cortisol is released in response to stimuli such as psychological oppression, anxiety, and fear. Stress also induces changes in BDNF; an increase in stress levels influences BDNF mRNA, which ultimately decreases BDNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and significantly disturbs the creation of nerve cells in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, Zheng et al. reported that BDNF and cortisol have a negative correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">According to Baddeley, working memory is the place of mental effort that demands conscious attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Gathercole and Alloway have reported that the capacity of working memory has close relationship with learning ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Rice and Stan reported that the general structure of the brain is formed before birth and that brain development continues through adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Although there is clear evidence of aerobic exercise-induced increases in BDNF, the effect of chronic resting serum BDNF levels, which are influenced by the intensity and duration of aerobic exercise, on cognitive functioning remains unclear. Also the subjects of most of these previous experimental studies were adults. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the effects of varying intensities of aerobic exercise on resting serum BDNF, IGF-1 concentrations, cortisol, and memory of adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par27">Forty male middle school students [from D middle school located in Yongin City, Republic of Korea] with no history of physical illness volunteered to participate in the study.

The K-WISC-III not only includes scores that represent comprehensive intelligent ability such as IQ, but also includes subtests that measure a subject&#x02019;s ability in particular areas of intelligence. In this study, the number subtest was applied, because it is one of the core subtests that measure memory. For this, there are two tests: repeating presented numbers in the right order and in reversed order. The first test consists of 8 questions. There are two numbers in the first question that would enable the minimum order. Then, one number is added to each question that follows until the participants reach the 8th question (a string of 9 numbers). For each task in this first test, the examiner clearly articulated all numbers at one-second intervals and the subject was then asked to repeat the numbers in the right order, one second after hearing the last number of the question. After a two-minute interval, one more test with 8 questions of different number combinations was completed. After completing these first tests, the reverse order tests were performed. These had the same number combination sets, except that subjects were asked to repeat the numbers in the reverse order. There were a total of 32 questions in the entire assessment, and one mark was scored for each correct response and zero for each incorrect response, resulting in a maximum score of 32 points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exercise protocol</title><p id="Par35">The exercise sessions were completed at D university in Yongin, and were conducted 4 times a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks.

In the current experiment, we investigated whether this might be dependent on the intensity of exercise.</p><p id="Par45">One of the most interesting findings of the present study was that the exercise-induced changes in BDNF were dependent on the intensity of exercise. This supports findings of Rojas-Vega et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], who reported that when athletes performed 10&#x000a0;min of warm-up exercises, there was no notable change in the serum BDNF concentration level. However, after subjects performed ramp tests, the level of serum BDNF significantly increased. Also, Ferris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] reported that when subjects performed 30&#x000a0;min of cycling at below 20% of threshold concentration level of ventilation (55% VO2max), there was no notable difference in their serum BDNF level; however, when they performed 30&#x000a0;min of cycling at higher than 10% of threshold concentration level of ventilation (75% VO2max), their serum BDNF level significantly increased.</p><p id="Par46">Furthermore, several studies have reported a high BDNF concentration at rest after acute exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The results for the high intensity aerobic exercise group in the present study showed a similar trend as other recently conducted studies that have reported an increase in serum BDNF concentration at rest after the long-term endurance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is believed that high intensity aerobic exercise will increase resting BDNF concentrations. In particular, Griffin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] investigated the effect of acute and long-term cycling exercise in young adults. They found that cognitive function and BDNF were enhanced through acute exercise, and a transient increase in the motor response BDNF expression level was reported in the long-term aerobic exercise group.</p><p id="Par47">Despite the use of different cognitive functional tests, most previous studies have reported an enhancement of cognitive functioning after acute exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and long-term aerobic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the current study, we used number-related core subtests of intelligence of the K-WISC-III to examine the exercise-induced change in working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We found that only the high intensity exercise group showed a significant increase in working memory (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The fact that the moderate intensity exercise group showed no significant difference while its BDNF significantly increased at rest could indicate that the change in the working memory and serum BDNF will be more significant when high intensity aerobic exercise is performed. To conclude, our results support trends found for BDNF and cognitive function to be enhanced by aerobic exercise.</p><p id="Par48">The intensity of the exercise appeared in most of the previous studies, which supports the view that increases in BDNF can be elicited by exercise of at least 50% VO2max. However, the intensity of the LIEG group in the present study, set at 40% V02R, is thought to be too low to have any impact on the serum BDNF at rest.</p><p id="Par49">In this study, IGF-1 showed a significant increase in the HIEG and SG groups only, and no significant difference was observed in terms of the interactive effect between groups and time as well as among the groups. Schiffer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported no significant change in BDNF when the changes in BDNF and IGF-1 were analyzed after 12&#x000a0;weeks of resistance exercise. The authors also reported that there was no significant relevance with IGF-1. Adams and McCue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported that long-term resistance training might stimulate the secretion of IGF-1. In addition, IGF-1 is known to be involved in the growth and development of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study, the subjects were adolescents whose bodies are still growing and developing. Aside from exercise intensity, this factor could have also influenced the result involving IGF-1.</p><p id="Par50">Cortisol is a stress hormone secreted from the adrenal cortex of the kidneys in response to stress, and, in order to allow the body to produce maximum energy, it acts to increase blood pressure and glucose levels. A study on the relationship between exercise and cortisol showed that short-term medium to low strength exercises did not change plasma cortisol levels or may even have slightly reduced those levels, whereas high-intensity exercise can elicit increases in blood plasma cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the present study, the HIEG group showed decreases in the cortisol level in blood plasma, and did show statistically significant differences. This could show that stress affects the expression of cortisol, which would support animal studies by Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] that reported a negative relationship between BDNF and cortisol, and that the change in the level demonstrated a close relationship with stress.</p><p id="Par51">During childhood and adolescence, vigorous generation of brain cells takes place along with physical growth. Brain function also completes its growth during this period, and research on the generation and activation of the brain cells at this age is therefore important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A strong case is developing, with the support of this research, regarding the importance of implementing regular physical activities children and adolescents, as this is a significant period in which physical development, learning, and cognitive ability can likely be enhanced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">We conclude that adolescents whose brains are still developing, long-term aerobic exercise of moderate to high intensity levels may have a positive effect on concentration levels of serum BDNF at rest and on cognitive functioning. Through well-designed studies, the effect of the exercise on neural plasticity and cognitive development could be better understood, and experiments with larger sample sizes could identify the relevance between changes in the brain function and its relationship to exercise and BDNF.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BDNF</term><def><p id="Par6">Brain derived neurotrophic factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p id="Par7">Electrocardiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GTX</term><def><p id="Par8">Graded exercise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIEG</term><def><p id="Par9">High intensity exercise group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGF-1</term><def><p id="Par10">Insulin-like growth factor 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQ</term><def><p id="Par11">Intelligence quotient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LIEG</term><def><p id="Par12">Low intensity exercise group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIEG</term><def><p id="Par13">Moderate intensity exercise group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRNA</term><def><p id="Par14">Messenger ribonucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RER</term><def><p id="Par15">Respiratory exchange ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p id="Par16">Rated perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPM</term><def><p id="Par17">Revolutions per minute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SG</term><def><p id="Par18">Stretching group and control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO2max</term><def><p id="Par19">Maximum oxygen intake</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank subjects (middle school students) and their parents for volunteer.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par53">None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par54">For availability of data and material please contact the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par55">YJ and CH analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
