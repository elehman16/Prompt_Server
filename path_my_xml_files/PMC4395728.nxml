reality-based ankle exercise on the dynamic balance, muscle tone, and gait ability of
stroke subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty persons who were in the chronic stroke
subjects of this study and they were included and assigned to two groups: experimental
(VRAE; Virtual Reality-based Ankle Exercise group) (n=10) and control groups (n=10). The
VRAE group performed virtual environment system ankle exercise, and the control group
watched a video. Both groups performed their respective interventions for 30 minutes per
day, 5 times per week over a 6-week period. To confirm the effects of the intervention,
dynamic balance, muscle tone, and spatiotemporal gait were evaluated. [Results] The
results showed that the dynamic balance and muscle tone was significantly more improved
after the intervention compared to before in the VRAE group (dynamic balance: 5.50&#x000b1;2.57;
muscle tone: 0.90&#x000b1;0.39), and the improvements were more significant than those in the
control (dynamic balance: 1.22&#x000b1;2.05; muscle tone: 0.10&#x000b1;0.21). Spatiotemporal gait measures
were significantly more increased in the paretic limb after the intervention compared to
before in the VRAE group and the improvements were more significant than those in the
control group. [Conclusion] This study demonstrated that virtual reality-based ankle
exercise effectively improves the dynamic balance, muscle tone, and gait ability of stroke
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality-based ankle exercise</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional weakness of the lower extremity due to stroke is caused by muscular weakness and
by decreases in muscular endurance, stability of the joint, and loss of proprioceptive
sense<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients have difficulty
in movement control because of the muscular weakness, abnormal tonus of the muscle, and
abnormal movement patterns. These changes are related to an increase in their postural sway
during static standing posture<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among
these, balance problems delay the improvement of independent activities of daily living
(ADLs) and alter the standing or walking posture<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because of the decline in balance ability, compensation movements occur in each part of the
body. This makes the patients consume more energy compared than healthy subjects, and an
inefficient walking pattern develops<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
decreased gait and balance abilities of stroke patients may be an important factor that
limiting ADLs, reducing independence, and as a result, brings restricting participation in
the local community<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the patients have difficulty in standing up without
help, and negotiating obstacles start to emerge when walking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these reasons, walking or balance training is important for
stroke patients. The motor function of the ankle joint greatly affects balance and walking
abilities.</p><p>When stroke occurs, flaccidity appears during the early stage; however, as time passes,
flaccidity is accompanied by spasticity. Spasticity occurs in 90% of stroke patients. It
limits voluntary movement because of the stiffness in the muscles. In particular, spasticity
of the ankle plantarflexor disturbs static and dynamic balance problems as well as a normal
gait pattern<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dorsiflexor weakness
accompanied with spasticity is reported to be the factor that is most dangerous for
falling<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Virtual reality has been used to increase muscle strength, balance, gait function, and
motor recovery during stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality provides interest, fun, and motivation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it encourages active participation in
active treatment to increase the needs for exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, in a virtual reality environment, the patient
receives sound and sight feedbacks to enhancing the effects of exercise training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, focusing on a virtual reality
environment is effective at increasing concentration<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality-based ankle exercise is effective for ankle
movement, improving the plantar-flexor muscles coordination, and increasing gait speed<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is unclear whether virtual
reality-based ankle exercise improves gait and balance abilities as well as muscle tone in
patients with a neurological disorder. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate
the effects of virtual reality-based ankle exercise on the dynamic balance, muscle tone, and
gait ability of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were chosen from among 26 stroke patients who were undergoing
physical therapy at a rehabilitation hospital. Participant selection criteria were: those
who were hemiparesis due to stroke with onset of &#x0003e;6 months, the ability to follow verbal
instructions, the ability to communicate at a certain level, and a score of &#x0003e;24 points on
the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean (MMSE-K). Patients were excluded if they had
diplegia or visual or vestibular impairments. All patients who participated in this trial
provided their signed written consent after receiving a full explanation of the expected
result and side effects of the intervention fully explained. This study was approved by the
Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board. The general characteristics of the subjects
in the experimental group were as follows: a sex of 6 male and 4 female; a mean age of
64.60&#x02005;years; a mean height of 166.20&#x02005;cm; a mean weight of 61.20&#x02005;kg; and a mean time since
stroke onset of 11.14 months; and had right-side hemiplegia in 6 cases and a left-side
hemiplegia in 4 cases. Those of the subjects in the control group had as follows: a sex of 5
males and 5 females; a mean age of 78.10&#x02005;years; a mean height of 157.40&#x02005;cm; a mean weight of
52.50&#x02005;kg; a stroke onset of 11.63 months; and had right-side hemiplegia in 8 cases and a
left-side hemiplegia in 2 cases. There were no significant differences between the two
groups.</p><p>The general information including sex, age, weight, height, academic background, and
medical information related to the stroke lesion were obtained from the medical records of
the 26 hospitalized stroke patients. Four patients withdrew from the study. Twenty-two
participants were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=11) and control groups (n=11).
Participants in the experimental group performed a virtual environment system ankle exercise
for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. Subjects in the control group watched a
documentary in the same condition as the experimental group. Before the intervention, all
the participants received conventional physical therapy for 30 minutes per day, 10 times per
week over a 6-week period. One subject in each group withdrew for personal reasons during
the experiment. Dynamic balance, muscle tone, and gait ability were blindly assessed before
and after the intervention.</p><p>The virtual reality-based ankle exercise (VRAE) was composed of 4 exercise programs:
exercising on the floor, exercising on a balance board, exercising on a cushion ball, and
standing on one foot. All the subjects maintained a standing position for the exercises. To
create the virtual reality environment, we used a virtual reality-based ankle exercise
program, notebook computer (X-note 280; LG, Korea), beam projector (PLC-XW55; Sanyo, Japan),
and screens.</p><p>Virtual reality was projected onto a screen that is 2,200&#x02005;mm and 1,900&#x02005;mm screen positioned
3&#x02005;m in front of the subjects via a 1,024 &#x000d7; 768 XGA type high quality beam projector. To
maintain the movement speed of the subject, the keyboard function was used to change the
speed of the virtual reality environment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This helped maintain the subject&#x02019;s speed and the actual speed for
parallelism. The screen was installed, and the beam projector was used for people and
computers to interface through the camera, which installed equipped on the computer. One
screen showed the virtual reality-based ankle exercise program while the other screen showed
the target. Each exercise program was composed of a full shot, side shot, and the ankles.
The screen changes with time in order to raise the participants&#x02019; concentration. The
participants could visualize all sides, which allowed the participants to modify their own
posture. This allowed them to participate in the exercises using the correct posture. The
target participated in the exercises progressed in the order from easy to hard. The four
virtual reality-based ankle exercises trained the subjects in a back and forth movement of
the ankles without any movement from the body or hip joints. The subjects used a gait belt
for safety. To minimize instability, a therapist was stood at the beside to help the
subject. All the exercise emphasized ankle stabilization for maintaining posture during the
movement or performance. The subjects performed each virtual reality-based ankle exercise
for 5 minutes. After each exercise, the subjects took 2-minute breaks to minimize tiredness.
The control group watched an environmental documentary irrelevant to ankle exercise.</p><p>The timed-up and go (TUG) test was used to assess the subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance function.
The TUG test is frequently used which assesses fall risk, mobility, and dynamic balance in
clinics<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intra- and
inter-reliability have been reported as <italic>r</italic> = 0.99 and 0.99,
respectively<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To assess the muscle tonus, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Tardieu scale were used.
The MAS is the most frequently used method for assessing muscle tonus (spasticity) in
clinics, and it measures abnormality in tone or the resistance to passive movement or
stretch of a particular muscle<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Tardieu scale can measure muscle spasticity by testing the response of the muscle to stretch
at 3 types of velocity (i.e., slow as possible, speed of the limb segment when falling, and
as fast as possible)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The GAITRite (CIR System Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) was used to measure spatial and temporal
parameters of gait ability. The collected information on the time and spatial variables was
analyzed by the GAITRITE GOLD, version 3.2b software (CIR System Inc.). The measurement was
performed 3 times, and to eliminate the fatigue of walking, the subjects took a 30 second
rest after walking once. The temporal parameters (velocity and cadence) and the spatial
parameters (step length, stride length, stance time percentage, swing time percentage, and
double limb support percentage) were measured.</p><p>SPSS, version 18.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all the statistical analyses.
The data showed normal distribution using as assessed by following the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. The paired t-test and Wilcox-signed rank test were performed to compare the dependent
variables within the groups before and after training. The independent t-test and
Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the differences in the dependent variables between
the groups. A Results &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The virtual reality-based ankle exercise was significantly improved in the MAS, Tardieu

balance deficit and abnormal muscle tone are the chief factors, and these elicit asymmetric
posture, reduction in appropriate weight distribution, and reduce in sensory input during
the standing position in stroke survivors. Thus, the management of balance and muscle tone
is regarded as important in stroke rehabilitation.</p><p>In our study, a virtual reality-based ankle exercise effectively improved dynamic balance.
This finding is similar to that of a previous study of the tibialis anterior and soleus,
muscles essential for dynamical balance, which these muscles showed an increase in
alternative vitality after performance of the virtual reality-based ankle exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is because the postural sway in the
anterior to posterior direction decreased. In addition, during the primary postural
disturbance, the ankle moves advances before the movement of the hip joint, which is well
used by stroke patients. Because the movement of the hip joint decreases, demands on the
body&#x02019;s balance control most likely increases during single-leg support. Lastly, this
exercise intervention increased proprioception activation and movement of the ankles which
we assume improved the dynamic balance was improved.</p><p>Muscle tonus is the resistance of muscles in the passive stretch during resting condition,
and it is also means the continuous and passive partial contraction, which helps to maintain
the body&#x02019;s posture<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous
research into virtual reality&#x02019;s influence on muscle tonus, the virtual reality-based ankle
and leg exercises effectively increased the stroke patient&#x02019;s gait velocity, ankle movement,
and muscle strength of the soleus<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, in our study, spasticity decreased by 55% based on the MAS, and by 50% based on
the Tardieu scale. For patients with an upper motor neuron disease, a decrease in muscle
tonus increases the speed of adaptation for the changes in the environment. Moreover,
because of a decrease in stretch reflex, the threshold for the phasic reflex is raised to
reduce for future reflexes. In this study, because of the increase before and after the
ankle movement increased after the intervention, the virtual reality-based ankle exercise
increased the muscle strengths of the tibialis anterior and triceps surae and also decreased
spasticity. This study proved that the virtual reality-based ankle exercise is effective at
reducing spasticity. Therefore, this exercise is effective at decreasing spasticity
following stroke.</p><p>Gait is the movement of transferring from one place to another, and it is an essential
element for the performance of ADLs and functional activities<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gait of stroke patients is different from that of normal
people, because stroke patients&#x02019; temporal and spatial walking abilies movements are
decreased<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have
reported that virtual reality gait training or augmented reality-based treadmill training
improved stroke patients&#x02019; walking speed and community walking time, as well as cortical
reorganization associated with locomotion in patients with stroke<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
the virtual reality-based ankle exercise effectively improved gait velocity. Through visual
feedback from the visual sense and proprioception, this exercise accelerated the
reorganization of the cerebral cortex&#x02019;s neural circuits for accelerating nerve
reorganization<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, through
vitalization of the cerebral cortex and central nerve territories, exercises were
re-learned, and the movement of the ankles increased. And The gait velocity probably
increased because of the improvement in dynamic balance due to the improvement of ankle
movement and the reduction of spasticity in the soleus during the swing phase term, which is
a factor that affects walking speed. In previous studies, the 6-minute walking test was used
as an evaluation tool. However, this study used the GAITRite for a more objective
evaluation.</p><p>In Dunsky&#x02019;s study, they provided a home-based motor imagery gait training program for
chronic stroke patients, and reported that there were significant increases in stride
length, cadence, and single limb support time of the affected lower limb and a decrease in
the double limb support time<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, our findings demonstrated that the virtual reality-based ankle exercise
effectively improved the cadence, step length, stride length, and swing time percentage of
stroke patients. Virtual reality-based exercise allows patients to recognize movements by
participating in a virtual reality that is similar to their actual environment. Moreover, we
consider that ankle movement control increased (in the paralyzed leg) in order to maintain
the body&#x02019;s balance for executing the task in the virtual reality program.</p><p>The virtual reality-based ankle exercise reduced walking time because of the increase in
the gait velocity of the affected side, and it also increased security and stride length
which reduced the time of the double limb support time. Thus, the virtual reality-based
ankle exercise had a great influence on the subjects&#x02019; gait ability.</p><p>This study did not investigate the correlations of temporal and spatial gait ability; thus,
it is not clear whether the virtual reality-based ankle exercise can influence their 2
relations. In addition, the amount of increase in walking ability and decrease in muscle
tonus that was elicited should be discussed, and the correlations should be measured. The
virtual reality-based ankle exercise is effective at improving walking ability.</p><p>This study had some limitations to this study. First, the sample size was relatively small.
Second, the long-term effects of our intervention and the follow-up were not clear. Thus,
further studies need to confirm our findings using a large sample or a long-term application
of the intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>An ankle proprioceptive control program improves balance,
