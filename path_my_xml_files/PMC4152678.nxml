A detailed physical examination was carried out a day before the proposed surgery. Patients of American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II, aged 30-50 years, weighing 45-65 kg and scheduled for elective gynecological surgeries under spinal anesthesia were included in the study, after obtaining informed consent. Patients with contraindications to spinal anesthesia or major neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, renal disease or coagulation abnormalities were excluded.

Spinal anesthesia was instituted at L3-L4 interspace and a volume of 3.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy injected over 30 s through a 25 Gauge spinal needle.

Regional and opioid analgesia has been studied extensively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A meta-analysis conducted by Cliff K.-S. Ong, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrates the ability of preemptive analgesic interventions to attenuate postoperative pain scores, decrease supplemental postoperative analgesic requirements, and prolong time to first rescue analgesic request. Using these outcome measures, preemptive analgesia showed an overall beneficial effect after epidural analgesia, local wound infiltration, and systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration. Pre-incisional analgesia has been shown to be more effective in control of post-operative pain by protecting the central nervous system from deleterious effects of noxious stimuli and resulting allodynia and increased pain. Gabapentin and pregabalin have antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic properties useful for treating neuropathic pain and may also be beneficial in acute post-operative pain managemant.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist. It acts by decreasing the release of neurotransmitter glutamate.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Oral gabapentin as an adjunct to epidural analgesia have been found to decrease pain and analgesic consumption.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hurley <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in a meta-analysis on 896 patients concluded that perioperative use of oral gabapentin is a useful adjunct for the management of post-operative pain by providing analgesia through a different mechanism than opioids and therefore would make a reasonable addition to a multimodal analgesic treatment plan.</p><p>M,Christophe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have shown that premedication with 1200 mg gabapentin improved preoperative anxiolysis, postoperative analgesia, and early knee mobilization after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament repair under general anaesthesia.</p><p>Pregabalin is claimed to be more effective in preventing neuropathic component of acute nociceptive pain of surgery, to produce more opioid sparing effect and for amelioration of perioperative anxiety.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Saraswat and Arora[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied preemptive gabapentin and pregabalin for acute post-operative pain after surgery under spinal anesthesia.

The total post-operative analgesic time was 8.9 hours in group G whereas 14.17 hours in group P (highly significant, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Similarly in our study, a significantly longer duration of effective analgesia in group C (nine hours) was observed in comparison with other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). We have used 600 mg of gabapentin in this study, as bioavailability of gabapentin is not dose proportional, i.e., as dose increases bioavailability decreases. In one metaregression analysis it was suggested that the gabapentin-induced reduction in the 24-h opioid consumption was not significantly dependent on the gabapentin dose The most common adverse effects of the gabapentinoids were sedation and dizziness.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Pregabalin has been used in a dose range of 75 mg to 300 mg, and higher doses of pregabalin were associated with an increased incidence of dizziness thus in our study, we used 150 mg of pregabalin.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study incidence of side effects was not significant.
