</p><p>All included patients received appropriate pharmacotherapy by the consultant. The patients with menstrual irregularities were randomized to divide into two groups: One on <italic>Yoga Nidra</italic> therapy and pharmacotherapy (intervention group), and another on only pharmacotherapy (control group). Assessments of all subjects were carried out by administering Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) at baseline and after six months. We used computer-generated numbers for permuted randomization. Small paper chits written either case or control were placed in opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes prepared by a biostatistician who had no contact with participants.</p><p>Initially all the patients with menstrual irregularities were recruited irrespective of severity of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following randomization, psychological assessment of all patients was done to assess the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms by applying the following tools (HAM-A and HAM-D). All the patients with clinical significant or non-significant anxiety or depressive symptoms were re-evaluated after six months; however, those patients with clinically non-significant anxiety and depressive symptoms were excluded for the purpose of statistical evaluation to see the effect of intervention (<italic>Yoga Nidra</italic>) in comparison to control group.</p><p>There were two outcome measures:</p><p>

It suggests that the <italic>Yoga Nidra</italic> may be helpful for the patients with mild to moderate anxiety symptoms but not in patients with severe symptoms. The analysis also reflects that &#x02018;<italic>Yoga Nidra</italic>&#x02019; intervention has significantly positive impact in majority of the participants (78.57%) in terms of reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms. Prior studies have also shown significant improvement in the anxiety following meditation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and breathing exercises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Studies have also reported reduction in state anxiety following muscle relaxation techniques and listening to music.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The study results revealed similar trends for depressive symptoms as well. Previous study reported similar significant improvements on measures of stress and psychological outcomes (state and trait anxiety, well-being, vigor, fatigue, and depression) in women suffering from mental distress after participating in a three-months &#x02018;Iyengar&#x02019; yoga class.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Other studies have also reported similar findings and supported the finding of the current study regarding the effect of Yoga on anxiety and depressive symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, probably no study has compared the subjects on the basis of severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as done in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The patients with mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms improve significantly with &#x02018;<italic>Yoga Nidra</italic>&#x02019; intervention. There is no improvement in the patients with severe anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, small sample size and selection of subjects from hospital outpatient clinic are the limitations of this study. Overall this study shows that the <italic>Yoga Nidra</italic> is an effective tool for improvement of psychological problems emerged out of long standing menstrual
