swallowing rehabilitation in the oral phase by elucidating the speed and regularity of
movement of muscles related to the lips, tongue, and chin. This study investigated the
effect of a three-week period of orofacial myofunctional exercise on the improvement of
cheek, tongue, and lip muscle strength and diadochokinetic rate in dysphagia patients.
[Subjects and Methods] This study employed a pretest-posttest control group design. Both
orofacial myofunctional exercise and the temperature-tactile stimulation technique were
applied to the experimental group (n=23), while only the temperature-tactile stimulation
technique was applied to the control group (n=25). [Results] Tongue elevation, tongue
protrusion, cheek compression, lip compression, and alternating motion rate were more
significantly improved in the experimental group than in the control group. [Conclusion]
Orofacial myofunctional exercise is effective in the rehabilitation of swallowing function
in the oral phase in dysphagia patients by improving orofacial muscle strength and
response rate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Orofacial exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Alternating motion rate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a disease caused by central nervous system and peripheral nervous system damage
from cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage, and it is one of the major causes of death
worldwide. In particular, the death rate of stroke is exceptionally high in South Korea
(50.3 out of every 100,000 people as of 2013), showing the highest rate for a single
disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke not only has a high death rate but also has a high possibility of causing
aftereffects, such as dysphagia, motor disorder, language disorder, cognitive disorder, and
sensory disorder, in those who survive<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Among them, dysphagia, which is a problem in the process of passing food boluses from the
oral cavity to the esophagus due to weakening or paralysis of the swallowing-related
muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, occurs very frequently. If
dysphagia is left untreated, it can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia and
malnutrition and even death, which makes early detection and treatment critical<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Swallowing involves four phases: the oral preparatory phase, oral phase, pharyngeal phase,
and esophageal phase. Among these, patients with dysphagia from stroke frequently experience
disruption in the oral preparatory phase, oral phase, and pharyngeal phase<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the facial nerve or hypoglossal nerve
is damaged by stroke, the muscles in the tongue, cheek, and lips, such as the orbicularis
oris muscle, mentalis muscle, buccinator muscle, and palatoglossus muscle, weaken, causing
problems in both the oral preparatory phase and oral phase<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The tongue triggers swallowing by stimulating fauces and
oropharyngeal receptors and plays an important role in the oral phase by moving boluses to
the anterior faucial arch<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although many studies have been conducted on the effect of orofacial myofunctional exercise
in patients with dysphagia from brain damage, most of them have only focused on improving
the strength of individual muscles, such as the tongue and cheek muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and few studies have investigated the holistic improvement of orofacial muscle strength,
speed, and functions. Measurement of the alternating motion rate can provide useful
information on swallowing rehabilitation in the oral phase by elucidating the speed and
regularity of movement of muscles related to the lips, tongue, and chin.</p><p>This study investigated the effect of a three-week period of orofacial myofunctional
exercise on the improvement of dysphagia patients&#x02019; cheek, tongue, and lip muscle strength
and alternating motion rate in dysphagia patients, and it suggests basic material for
swallowing rehabilitation in the oral phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 48 stroke patients who were diagnosed with dysphagia by one
of three medical institutions from January through April 2015 in Seoul and Incheon and who
understood and agreed to participate in this study. This study conformed to the principles
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received clearance from an Institutional Review
Board. All participants provided informed consent. As the minimum number of samples
calculated based on power analysis using the t-distribution was 45 with a significance level
(&#x003b1;) of 0.05, effect size of 0.5, and power of test (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.95, the number of samples in
this study was appropriate. The inclusion criteria for selection of the subjects were
diagnosis within 6 months without aphasia, apraxia, depression, and cognitive disorder with
a score of over 24 points on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(K-MMSE)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to random
assignment by table of random sampling numbers, participants were classified into the
experimental group with the application of both orofacial myofunctional exercise and
temperature-tactile stimulation technique, and the control group (n=25), which received
application of temperature-tactile stimulation technique only.</p><p>For orofacial muscle strength, tongue elevation, tongue protrusion, cheek compression, and
lip compression<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> were measured by using
the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is composed of a tongue bulb and a connecting tube. The
measurement methods were as follows: For tongue elevation, the bulb was placed in the hard
palate of the subject, who was instructed to compress the bulb with tongue as strongly as
possible for 2&#x02013;3 seconds. For tongue protrusion, the subject bit the bulb with his/her
molars and compressed the bulb as strongly as possible. Cheek compression was measured with
the bulb oriented toward the surface of cheek. Referring to the study of Clark et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, lip compression was measured by having
the subject bite and compress a tongue depressor with the lips, as the bulb cannot be fixed
between the lips. All values presented are means of 3 measurements<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For alternating motion rate, the count-by-time was used; it represents the average number
of times one syllable was repeated per second when /Pa/ and /Ta/ were repeated quickly,
alternating between them, for 5 seconds. Praat version 5.1.3<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> was used for the analysis of alternating motion rate, and means of
3-time measurements are presented.</p><p>Orofacial myofunctional exercise was composed of 9 items, which were cheek massage, neck
massage, lip closing, cheek bloating, cheek sucking, lip protrusion, tongue protrusion,
tongue elevation, and tongue lowering, conducted for 30 minutes daily, 5 time a week for 3
weeks. This program was selected based on information from the Team of Seirei Mikatahara
General Hospital<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and Park et al<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the temperature-tactile stimulation technique, 30 minutes of stimulation was applied to
the anterior faucial arch with an ice stick to facilitate pharyngeal swallowing per day, 5
days per week for 3 weeks.</p><p>For analysis, a preliminary homogeneity test was first conducted with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test or independent sample t-test, and then a pre-post efficiency test was conducted with
the paired sample t-test. IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) was
used for analysis, and the significance level was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of the independent t-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for age, gender,

rehabilitation in the oral phase. According to the results of the investigation on the
effect of orofacial myofunctional exercise on the improvement of orofacial muscle strength
and alternating motion rate in dysphagia patients, tongue elevation, tongue protrusion,
cheek compression, lip compression, and alternating motion rate were significantly improved.
This corresponds with the results of preceding studies that indicated that orofacial muscle
exercise improved swallowing functions of stroke patients by reinforcing orofacial muscle
strength and formation of oral pressure<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decline of orofacial muscle in the tongue, chin, and lips caused by stroke causes
problems in the oral preparatory phase and oral phase of the swallowing process, such as
problems with mastication and the formation of boluses, leading to the onset of
dysphagia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In normal swallowing,
muscles in the cheeks and lips play an important role in oral containment by forming oral
pressure<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In particular, the strength of the tongue is crucial in the oral phase. When food boluses
pass through the anterior faucial arch and reach the base of the tongue, pharyngeal
swallowing is induced, and then the tongue is gradually elevated backward (a process called
&#x0201c;rolling&#x0201d;), which requires the overall strength of the tongue<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that orofacial exercise performed on patients with dysphagia from stroke improved
the movement range and strength of the tongue, and in this study, orofacial myofunctional
exercise also had a significant effect on the reinforcement of the tongue&#x02019;s muscle strength.
Furthermore, this study verified that orofacial myofunctional exercises, such as tongue
protrusion, elevation, and lowering, not only increase muscle strength but also improve
response rate and coordination between the tongue and chin. Future multilateral studies
considering stroke severity are required to verify the effect of orofacial myofunctional
exercise.</p><p>Regarding the limitations of the study, as all the subjects were subacute dysphagia
patients, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of self-rehabilitation in the
improvement of orofacial muscle strength. Moreover, it is difficult to determine the
long-term effects, because the treatment period in this study was only three weeks.</p><p>The results of this study imply that orofacial myofunctional exercise is effective in the
rehabilitation of swallowing function in the oral phase in dysphagia patients by improving
orofacial muscle strength and response rate.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Korea National Statistical
