The Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group conducted a phase 3 study of adults who received either filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood or filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow from human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling donors. Because all donors received the identical filgrastim dosing schedule, this study allowed for a controlled evaluation of the impact of stem cell source on development of chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease. One hundred and twenty-one evaluable filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow patient donor products were immunologically characterized by flow cytometry and tested for their association with acute and chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease within 2 years of transplantation. The immune populations evaluated included, regulatory T cells, central memory and effector T cells, interferon &#x003b3; positive producing T cells, invariate natural killer T cells, regulatory natural killer cells, dendritic cell populations, macrophages, and activated B cells and memory B cells. When both filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow were grouped together, a higher chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease frequency was associated with lower proportions of CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer regulatory cells and interferon &#x003b3;-producing T helper cells in the donor product. Lower CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer regulatory cells displayed differential impacts on the development of extensive chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease between filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow. In summary, while controlling for the potential impact of filgrastim on marrow, our studies demonstrated that CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer regulatory cells had a much stronger impact on filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood than on filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow. This supports the conclusion that a lower proportion of CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer regulatory cells results in the high rate of chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease seen in filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood. <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: 00438958</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Filgrastim granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood (G-PB) as a donor source is clinically well established due to rapid engraftment, ease of collection, and similar survival to marrow as a donor source.

Cell populations are associated with acute GvHD (aGvHD) after G-PB which includes dendritic cells<sup><xref rid="b14-1021936" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and Treg cells<sup><xref rid="b15-1021936" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> but do not have any association with cGvHD. Other donor cell populations have found no association for either aGvHD or cGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b16-1021936" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> To date no study has definitely established which immune cell populations are most responsible for the higher rate of cGvHD associated with the G-PB donor source compared to marrow. Until the specific, unique components in G-PB <italic>versus</italic> marrow as a source are identified, it remains difficult to develop graft manipulation strategies to modulate cGvHD.</p><p>The Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group (CBMTG) undertook a definitive phase 3 trial comparing G-bone marrow (BM) with G-PB in sibling allografts for adults with hematologic malignancies. In that study, the CBMTG showed that cGvHD was lower with G-BM (HR=0.66; 95% CI 0.46 &#x02013; 0.95; <italic>P</italic>=0.007).<sup><xref rid="b17-1021936" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This study presented an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of graft source on the development of cGvHD with both donor sources receiving G-CSF treatment using an identical regimen. The population was relatively homogenous as only human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor (8/8 or 7/8 HLA-match) was used for predominantly myeloid malignancies with the only variable being the method of collection (i.e., marrow harvest <italic>versus</italic> apheresis). We hypothesized that one of the immune cell populations previously identified by correlative cGvHD biology and biomarkers studies would correlate with the induction of cGvHD by G-PB donor product. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated both G-BM and G-PB donor grafts combined for donor product immune cells for any specific cell types correlation with the development of cGvHD. Once identified, we evaluated the relative impact of each immune cell population on cGvHD for the relative impact of the two donor sources, G-PB <italic>versus</italic> G-BM, on the development of cGvHD. The immune populations evaluated included: regulatory T cells, central memory and effector T cells, interferon (IFN)&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> producing T cells, regulatory natural killer (NK) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages, activated B cells, and memory B cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Clinical Study Design</title><p>Samples for the current study were obtained as part of a larger clinical study (CBMTG 0601), a randomized phase 3, parallel group trial conducted by the CBMTG at 13 centers in Canada, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. The institutional research ethics board at each center approved the trial and recipients and donors both gave informed consent before randomization. Recipients were between 16 and 65 years of age and with a hematologic malignancy. Donors were 7/8 or 8/8 HLA-matched siblings medically fit to receive G-CSF and undergo a marrow harvest or apheresis.

The primary analysis was performed on patients who had survived up to 2 years after BM transplantation (BMT) (&#x0003e; 95% of patients developed overall cGvHD by 2 years), with the omission of patients due to death and leukemia relapses that occurred before the onset of cGvHD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-1021936">Table 1</xref>; n = 89).

Furthermore, logistic regression was applied to examine the effect of aGvHD, sex, TBI, recipient age, donor age, AML, death, relapse as well as donor source on the identified cell populations. Moreover, with patients split by cGvHD status, optimal cut points for the identified cell populations were determined by plotting their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and by finding the point on the ROC curve that is closest to the point of perfect sensitivity and specificity. Lastly, we examined the interaction effect between donor source and the identified significant markers on cGvHD status using logistic regression and the Cox model.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the study herein following peer review, but had no direct influence on the study design, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, in the writing of the report or in the decision to submit the paper for publication.

We initially evaluated both G-BM and G-PB together and found two significant associations in two donor cell populations for both overall and extensive cGvHD. Both had inverse relationships with the development of overall cGvHD (IFN&#x003b3; <sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK<sub>reg</sub> cells) suggesting regulatory functions. We then looked at the populations in a broader context to ensure that the observations were consistent, and found: a) no correlation with other factors except aGvHD in NKreg cell and TRM in the T cell population, and b) the association was consistent when a secondary analysis included patients that died or relapsed before 2 years after BMT. We also found that the inclusion of both populations together increased the association with cGvHD. Having looked at the two populations in the overall population, we subsequently looked at the impact on cGvHD in the two donor sources of graft (G-BM and G-PB) separately. We found that the NK<sub>reg</sub> population had a proportionately greater impact on extensive cGvHD in G-PB compared to G-BM.

Murine models have shown that the role of IFN&#x003b3; in GvHD appears to be variable depending on specific times post BMT, as early administration of recombinant IFN&#x003b3; prevents CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated GVHD.<sup><xref rid="b43-1021936" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that donors who have microsatellite polymorphisms with decreased IFN&#x003b3; production have higher rates of cGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b44-1021936" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In mouse models, high IFN&#x003b3; production by NK T cells results in lower rates of cGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b45-1021936" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Interestingly, IFN&#x003b3; is not necessary for the development of GvHD in many murine GvHD models,<sup><xref rid="b46-1021936" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1021936" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and disease can progress despite a lack of IFN&#x003b3;. The role of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the induction of immune tolerance is not well understood.

Lastly, IFN&#x003b3;&#x02013;licensed mesenchymal stem cells inhibit proliferation of activated T cells through both an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and, possibly, PD-1 dependent manner.<sup><xref rid="b50-1021936" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Whatever their role, this population requires further study in its potential to predict a later onset of cGvHD.</p><p>One question is whether we could define a threshold of either CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK<sub>reg</sub> cells or INF&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which are required to be infused per Kg of the recipient.
