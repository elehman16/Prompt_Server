Standard and systematic treatments will effectively mitigate its symptoms of 80% of the patients, but about 20% of the patients with epilepsy have no sensitivity to antiepileptic drugs, referred to as refractory epilepsy clinically (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Patients suffer from repetitive harms from refractory epilepsy, and their mentality and family and social safety are threatened. The occurrence of refractory epilepsy mostly depends on the genetic factors, disease factors and social psychological factors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The formation of abnormal synapses between neurons provides the basis for the occurrence of epilepsy. That abnormal neural networks occur in refractory epilepsy, leading to abnormalities in nerve excitability conduction, which forms excitatory loops, thus resulting in significantly higher sensitivity of patients with refractory epilepsy than that of patients with epilepsy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) contributes to the encoding of the expression of drug transporter-multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as the regulation of the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). The over-expression of MDR1 may have a relationship to the drug resistance of epilepsy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Exclusively using oxcarbazepine can not only effectively control epilepsy, but also remarkably alleviate epilepsy that other drug cannot deal with (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>At present, oxcarbazepine&#x02019;s efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy is ranked as level A by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The correlation of the expressions of MDR1, P-gp and MRP1 in peripheral blood with the refractory epilepsy, and the regulatory effect of oxcarbazepine on the above proteins have not been studied.</p><p>This study aimed to illustrate the mechanism of refractory epilepsy at the molecular level and the curative effect of oxcarbazepine on refractory epilepsy through analyzing the relationship of the expressions of MDR1, P-gp and MRP1 in peripheral blood with refractory epileps, and whether oxcarbazepine could regulate it, thus providing new methods for clinically treating refractory epilepsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Instruments and materials</title><p>Oxcarbazepine tablets (Novartis Farma S.p.A, Switzerland); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma); TRIzol kit (Invitrogen); reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen, USA); ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D system, USA); electrochemiluminescence (ECL) solution (Invitrogen, USA); rabbit anti-Ppg, rabbit anti-MRP1 and rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Cell Signaling Technology); horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology); polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument (Applied Biosystems, USA); ultraviolet imaging system (Biometra, Germany); electronic balance (BP121S, Sartorious, Germany); other relevant equipment and reagents were illustrated in relevant parts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects</title><p>All the study samples were from the epilepsy patients enrolled in Binzhou City Center Hospital, Huimin County, Binzhou, Shandong Province, P.R. China from from May 2013 to May 2015 who were the confirmed cases diagnosed by specialists. Patients with epilepsy (n=24) and those with refractory epilepsy (n=24) were selected, and the normal subjects were enrolled as control (n=30). Patients with epilepsy consisted of 11 males and 13 females at the age of 31&#x02013;43 yr old; patients with refractory epilepsy included 12 males and 12 females aged 29&#x02013;43 yr old; in control group, subjects consisted of 15 males and 15 females at the age of 30&#x02013;45 yr old. Age and gender of the selected patients were not statistically different from those of subjects in the control group.</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for refractory epilepsy referred to the diagnostic criteria formulated by China. Inclusion criteria: 1) patients diagnosed with epilepsy; 2) patients treated with top-ranking antiepileptic drugs for over 1 year; 3) patients whose seizure frequency of epilepsy remained above 30%. Patients with other consumptive diseases were excluded.</p><p>All patients signed the informed consent. The experimental regimen was inspected and approved by the Ethics Committee in out hospital. Clinical and pathological data and treatment regimens of all the patients were complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Grouping</title><p>According to the type of epilepsy, the selected patients were divided into epilepsy group (n=24) and refractory epilepsy group (n=24). And normal subjects formed control group (n=30). After the serum was separated, the peripheral blood was drawn and then stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for standby application. Patients with refractory epilepsy were randomly divided into oxcarbazepine group (OB group) and placebo group (OZ group) with 12 patients each. Patients took fundamental antiepileptic drugs when being included in this experiment (No oxcarbazepine and/or similar other drugs), and were treated with the experimental regimen stipulated in the treatment: additionally, patients orally took 150 mg oxcarbazepine in two divided doses with one in the morning and the other one in the evening in OB group; patients underwent oral administration of 100 mg oryzanol tablets in two divided doses with one in the morning and the other one in the evening for 8 successive weeks in OZ group.

Multidrug transporters are expressed on the cell membrane of brain tissues in patients with refractory epilepsy, which can pump the drugs out of the cells, so the intracellular drug concentration cannot reach the ideal concentration, thus leading to the failure of the epilepsy treatment (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). P-gp and MRP1 are multidrug transporters that are often studied. These two transporters participate in the transport of refractory epilepsy drugs and affect the therapeutic effect of refractory epilepsy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The curative effect of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of rats with refractory epilepsy can be improved by regulating P-gp and MRP1 in brain tissues of them suggesting that the regulation of multidrug transporters can effectively eliminate the difficulty in treating refractory epilepsy (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Through establishing a refractory epilepsy rat model, Emich-Widera et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) found that the P-gp expression level on the temporal lobe in the model is 2.7 times higher than that in the normal group, so it is speculated that MDR1 may take part in the formation of refractory epilepsy. A variety of multidrug transporters of tumor drugs are featured with wide distribution, and P-gp and MRP1 are highly expressed in brain tissues of epilepsy patients, suggesting that it may be closely related to the refractory epilepsy (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, it is difficult to access to the brain tissue samples, and if the correlation between multidrug resistance of patients with refractory epilepsy and multidrug transporters can be studied by detecting expression levels of these transporters in peripheral blood, the difficulties in developing refractory epilepsy drugs can be alleviated.</p><p>In this study, the expression levels of P-gp and MRP1 in peripheral blood of patients with refractory epilepsy, general epilepsy and normal subjects showed that the levels in patients with refractory epilepsy were significantly higher than those in patients with general epilepsy and normal subjects, which are consistent with the findings of previous study (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) about the expression levels of P-gp and MRP1 in brain tissues. The above-mentioned results manifested that there was a consistency between the expression of P-gp and that of MRP1 in peripheral blood and brain tissues, and the correlation between refractory epilepsy and multidrug transporters could be studied through the peripheral blood samples. The expression levels of P-gp and MRP1 are mainly regulated by MDR1, and MDR1 is a gene having a relatively definite association with epilepsy refractory, which shows high expression in brain tissues of patients with refractory epilepsy (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the expression level of MDR1 in peripheral blood of patients with refractory epilepsy was significantly higher than that of normal subjects and patients with general epilepsy. The above results showed that the relationship between the expressions of MDR1, P-gp and MRP1 and the refractory epilepsy can be studied through detecting peripheral blood. But this method still has some limitations: SqRT-PCR evaluates changes of gene expression only at the gene level, he accuracy of which is less than that of pre qPCR and immunohistochemistry methods.</p><p>In this study, we further investigated the expression of MDR1 related proteins by Western-blot, and the results were consistent with semi quantitative RT-PCR, which revealed the relationship between MDR1 and intractable epilepsy at gene and protein levels. The recurrence rate of epilepsy could be effectively reduced and the effective rate of treatment of refractory epilepsy could be increased using oxcarbazepine; furthermore, no serious adverse reactions were found during the 8 weeks of mediation. Oxcarbazepine is a new antiepileptic drug on sale, and its single or combined application can be used for the clinical treatment of the generalized seizure of epilepsy. It is the first-line drug for treating epilepsy at present, and it can also treat the epilepsy through blocking the ion channels of nerve cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). At 8 weeks after treatment with oxcarbazepine, the mRNA expression level of MDR1 in peripheral blood of patients with refractory epilepsy was significantly decreased, and the expression levels of P-gp and MRP1 were also significantly lower than those in OZ group. Oxcarbazepine increases the effective rate of treatment of refractory epilepsy, which may be associated with the decreased expression of MDR1 mRNA and the regulation of refractory epilepsy-related transport proteins P-gp and MRP1, suggesting that reducing expression levels of multidrug transporters in patients with refractory epilepsy is of great value for increasing the cure rate of refractory epilepsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>MDR1, P-gp and MRP1 were highly expressed in patients with refractory epilepsy, and oxcarbazepine can effectively cure the disease, whose possible mechanism is related to the reduced expression of multidrug transporters. The above study results provide new breakthroughs for the clinical therapeutic drugs of refractory epilepsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism,
