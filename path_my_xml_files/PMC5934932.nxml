Tolerability determinations are based on physical examination, laboratory testing and patient self-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In cancer treatment, patients are unsystematically asked about toxicity symptoms, and the severity and presence of these symptoms are interpreted and registered by clinicians. Further, observational studies comparing the reporting of symptoms via clinicians versus direct patient self-reporting have found that clinicians&#x02019; ratings of symptom severity are lower than those gathered using patient-reported outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, capturing symptomatic toxicities directly from patients using patient-reported outcome measures may improve the accuracy of identifying and characterizing the symptomatic adverse effects of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Now, version 4 of the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is the standard for reporting adverse events in cancer clinical trials and is widely used in cancer treatment and research settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a companion to the CTCAE, NCI has developed a Patient-Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Studies examining the feasibility of electronic patient-reporting of symptomatic side effects of cancer treatment have shown high acceptability of self-reporting presented as high satisfaction with using the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the patient&#x02019;s experience of aided recall of symptoms helped them feel more in control of their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In this study, we aimed to use a questionnaire covering all the relevant symptomatic toxicities for a specific cancer treatment, which is important in order to use the patient&#x02019;s reporting in the discussion of treatment tolerance and supportive care with the oncologist. Additionally, patients&#x02019; electronic reporting of side effects prior to chemotherapy could be displayed in real-time to both clinicians and patients using an established patient-reported outcome (PRO) dashboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This makes it possible to incorporate patients&#x02019; experiences into the treatment-related communication and decision-making, including side-effects management and supportive care.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>System availability</title><p id="Par32">The AmbuFlex software was continuously available, apart from a three-minute offline period during the three months&#x02019; study period. This offline period did not influence the project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par33">This study demonstrates that the collection of self-reported data using PRO-CTCAE, with real-time feedback to treating oncologists employing the AmbuFlex system, is feasible and acceptable in routine clinical practice with male patients undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Patients stated that the PRO-CTCAE items provided a complete overview of their experienced side effects and that it was a good communication tool. Oncologists found the online platform easy to use and reported that patients were better prepared for the dialogue.</p><p id="Par34">The strength of the study was the sizable percentage of patients who agreed to participate in the study and the substantial number of completions of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. The study included male patients only, which could be a limitation. However, we find it plausible that the results, showing good acceptability in the group of elderly men with different social and educational backgrounds, will also be applicable to female adults and other cancer diagnoses, as shown in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further research is needed to examine the acceptability in other groups.</p><p id="Par35">In our study, the researcher was present in the clinic during the study period, handed over the tablet computer and gave instructions to patients on how to complete the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. Therefore, the setup did not reflect the routine clinical workflow. If the tested model is to be implemented in routine practice, it will be necessary to provide additional training to patients, oncologists, nurses and secretaries. Our study results indicate that incorporation into local guidelines, including all the above-mentioned matters, and sufficient information to the clinicians are important for facilitating patients&#x02019; reporting of symptoms before consultation. The sustainability of the tested model will depend on local resources to cover training, however. Further, the electronic symptom surveillance using PRO-CTCAE has the potential to have alerts be developed, such as for severe symptoms, missed surveys, missed review by clinicians. Such functionalities will be included in future studies.</p><p id="Par36">We also found a high acceptance of the technical facilities, in accordance with other feasibility studies of electronic self-reporting systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and patient satisfaction with using the tool when communicating with oncologists about symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, oncologists found the AmbuFlex system useful as a tool to facilitate the clinical dialogue with patients. The AmbuFlex system has been implemented in clinics treating patients diagnosed with afflictions such as prostate cancer, epilepsy, renal failure, sleep disorders and neuromuscular diseases and including more than 13,000 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the system allows for a graphic presentation of symptoms, which may facilitate the dialogue during the clinical encounter.</p><p id="Par37">About half of the patients in our study reported that their oncologist had reviewed the PRO data in AmbuFlex before the consultation. The log from AmbuFlex showed that 83% of the patients had their answers reviewed at least once during the study period. Even though reviewing the PRO-CTCAE questionnaires was not compulsory, 50% of the total number of completions were reviewed during the study period. Obtaining reviews of all PRO-CTCAE reports might be facilitated by implementing this procedure in local guidelines.</p><p id="Par38">Some oncologists reported that their own assessment differed from patients&#x02019; self-reported symptoms. This conforms to previous research showing discrepancies between the clinician&#x02019;s report and the patient&#x02019;s self-reporting of the same symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Research indicates that part of the discrepancy between clinician and patient report of symptoms occurs because patients report about any symptom whereas clinicians&#x02019; reports are directed toward toxicities attributable to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Patient reporting of symptoms is shown to add information to the clinicians reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the US National Cancer Institute to directly incorporate the patients&#x02019; experience into the capture and reporting of symptomatic adverse events in cancer clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Evaluation shows that patient reporting using PRO-CTCAE may also improve the identification of symptoms at baseline prior to trial initiation, thus allowing for a more precise understanding of the symptomatic toxicities attributable to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Future studies may reveal the impact of PRO-CTCAE on side-effect management, for example.</p><p id="Par39">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that international collaboration on PRO measures is necessary to secure a common framework for generating and reporting patient-centered data, including symptomatic toxicities, from cancer clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The need for a disease-specific instrument to capture patients&#x02019; symptomatic toxicities according to the relevant therapies has been emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One of the most frequently-used questionnaires on patient-reported symptoms are the quality of life questionnaires of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). While health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures capture a broad picture of the patients&#x02019; condition, including family and social factors, they pay less attention to specific toxicity symptoms relating to the individual cancer therapy. PRO-CTCAE has been suggested as a new standard instrument to measure symptomatic toxicities in clinical cancer trials, which is flexibly adaptable to different diagnoses and therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">One challenge to introducing patient reporting of side effects is the risk of increasing clinicians&#x02019; workloads, which has been suggested as a potential barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When using PRO-CTCAE feedback as additional information from the patient, oncologists stated that they did not spend extra time on the consultation.</p><p id="Par41">Traditionally, direct patient self-reporting using patient-reported outcome measures has not been systematically incorporated into toxicity reporting. PRO-CTCAE changes this paradigm. As studies have shown high acceptance among patients in the self-reporting of symptoms and that technical barriers can be overcome, the main remaining barrier is to engage clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which might be addressed by means of systematic training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], decision support, and clear accountability metrics. In future studies, special focus must be on clinicians&#x02019; engagement in using PROs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Electronic patient reporting of symptomatic toxicities using PRO-CTCAE was deemed feasible in prostate cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients and oncologists stated that the electronic system was easy to use and that the patient&#x02019;s electronic reporting of PRO-CTCAE symptomatic toxicities served to enhance communication. The fact that electronic symptom surveillance with clinician feedback using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in Danish prostate cancer patients was shown to be feasible in this study makes us hypothesize that the model is applicable to future research. Our future research will examine the impact of providing patients&#x02019; PRO-CTCAE results to clinicians prior to the visit on the quality of side effects management and resultant clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>IT team leader Klaus Hvam Petersen, AmbuFlex, for IT support during the study period.</p><p>Ethics: the study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (case no. 2012-58-0004).
