In Pakistan, 22% of emergency room visits are injury-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and a recent case series revealed that a large number of injuries to Pakistani children occur at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is agreement that effective prevention programs should incorporate the three Es: (1) education, to influence behavior or raise awareness of injury risk, e.g., teach parents about childhood injuries; (2) engineering, to design devices in order to reduce their risk of injury, e.g., installing automobile air bags or reducing the temperature of household water heaters; (3) enforcement through legal regulation or sanctions, e.g., bicycle helmet laws, to prevent behavior likely to increase the risk of injury. Home visitation has been championed as an effective strategy that promotes the reduction of household hazards as it incorporates the tenets of education, engineering, and enforcement, and targets the hazards in the home that are likely to cause children to sustain injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Concerning the risk of falls, the following hazards were identified and studied: no stair gate, presence of a baby walker, and windows opening easily in the living room and the child&#x02019;s bedroom. Similarly, for the ingestion risk, the following hazards were identified and studied: poisonous products in the bathroom and living room, and hazards on floor in the living room and child&#x02019;s bedroom. In developed countries, home visiting programs aimed at addressing injury prevention have led to a 25% reduction in the number of hazards in households that received home visits compared to households that did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The effectiveness of home visitation programs in Pakistan is unknown, and we found a few recently published articles indicating the effectiveness of similar programs in reducing targeted hazards in less developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We therefore undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of home visits on reducing the number of hazards for home injuries in young children who reside in Pakistan. A recent retrospective study from our ED confirmed that falls and ingestion are the two most common childhood injuries presenting to the department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It also revealed that most childhood injuries occurred at home, falls being the most common mechanism of injury. Falling while running and/or playing accounted for 80%, whereas falling from low heights (less than 1 m) accounted for 20%. For ingestion injuries, inedible items were more frequently the cause than edible items. We therefore focused on falls and ingestions, the two most common injuries in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) of Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH).</p><p>We hypothesized that homes with children aged 3 and under in which the families had received injury prevention counseling at home would be safer than those not visited. The two intervention arms of this study allowed us to examine the effectiveness of counseling to reduce falls and counseling to reduce poisoning and choking. The principal objective was to measure the number of homes in which all specified hazards were removed from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months following the initial home visit. The secondary objectives were to examine the effect of the program on parental injury awareness and knowledge, and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of home safety inspection and education by home visitors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p>The study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), a 550-bed acute care urban center with about 12,000 pediatric ED visits annually. Inclusion criteria were: (1) families with at least one child aged 3 years old or younger discharged home from the ED following a visit for any reason other than an injury, (2) English or Urdu-speaking, and (3) residing within 45-min driving distance from the hospital.</p><p>Children who presented with an injury were excluded in case the event had sensitized them to the importance of preventing injuries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study group and randomization</title><p>This was a non-blinded randomized controlled trial design in which one branch of the study group (injury prevention vs. ingestion prevention) served as the control for the other. This ensured that both groups received an intervention of potentially equal benefit. Parents of children up to 3&#x000a0;years who agreed to participate in the trial were randomly allocated to either group 1 (falls) or group 2 (ingestions: poisoning and choking). Parents in group 1 received falls safety and prevention counseling only; parents in group 2 received ingestion safety and prevention counseling only. The attending pediatrician introduced the study to parents of all eligible children at the time of discharge. Eligible families were formally approached within 24&#x000a0;h by the study coordinator and invited to participate in the trial. Simple randomization was done using a random number generator. The research assistant ensured that appropriate interventions were carried out depending on the group to which the participants were allocated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p>For power calculations, we assumed a common baseline rate of 12% of homes having no specified hazards for falls or for ingestions, and aimed to detect an intervention effect of at least doubling of the proportion of safe homes. A sample size of 142 homes per condition would yield 80% power with a type 1 error rate of 0.05. To account for attrition, we recruited 170 participants per condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Three men and three women were trained to undertake the home visits and were audited by the study coordinator at random visits. The research instruments consisted of a questionnaire measuring parental knowledge, attitudes, and behavior (KAB questionnaire), and a child safety checklist, an observational tool measuring the presence of hazards in the home. Research assistants administered the questionnaire after which s/he inspected the home for hazards in the presence of the family. The family was then assigned to either the falls or poisoning/ingestion intervention branches of the study. Families then received a 15-min education session in which the research assistant reviewed relevant fall or ingestion hazards, including revisiting problem areas in the dwelling and offering potential solutions to eliminate said hazards. The research assistant immediately informed the family of any obvious and serious hazards (e.g., easy access to open fire or no barrier to prevent falls). A follow-up telephone call was made 3 months later in which the parents were asked about safety enhancements made since the home visit. The second and final home visit was conducted 6 months after the first one, during which time home safety was reassessed followed by querying the family regarding safety issues for which the family served as a control.</p><p>The KAB questionnaire consists of ten questions that elicited the subject&#x02019;s general knowledge about home-related injuries. For each question, each participant had to choose a number from 1&#x02013;10: 1, not at all serious to 10, very serious. Hazards were classified as risk factors for falls, poisoning, suffocation, and fires/burns, and were measured as being present or absent. All instruments had been used in previous published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The instruments were translated into Urdu and tested in a pilot program. A variable representing the &#x0201c;total number of hazards&#x0201d; was constructed by counting the number of &#x0201c;unsafe&#x0201d; practices in each home with respect to falls and with respect to ingestions. Each variable had a maximum score of 4. For the fall risk, households were assigned 1 point for no stair gate, presence of a baby walker, and window openings exceeding 15&#x000a0;cm in the living room and/or the child&#x02019;s bedroom. For ingestion risk, households were assigned 1 point for poisons (drugs and chemicals) not locked away in the bathroom or the kitchen, and choking hazards (any toy, food, or small object less than 1 3/4&#x000a0;inches in diameter, which can be a choking hazard) on the floor in the living room or in the child&#x02019;s bedroom. The four safety practices were assessed by home observation at baseline and follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measures were the relative risks of houses that changed from &#x0201c;unsafe&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; after the intervention, since this was done for the control and intervention groups, respectively. A house was considered &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; if all items scored to 0, the rationale being that a house was unsafe if even one hazard was present. A change from unsafe to safe was recorded if a home with at least one hazard at baseline had no hazards at follow-up. Homes were evaluated separately for falls and for ingestions/poisonings. Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior (KAB) scores were calculated for both groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We collected descriptive statistics for the two groups and analyzed data on an intention-to-treat basis.

Logistic regression was used to check for effect modification by covariates [mother&#x02019;s age and education, socioeconomic status, mother&#x02019;s age at first pregnancy, presence of male sibling younger than 3 (because of the perceived preference given to male children, their homes may be safer), and number of siblings].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethics</title><p>Permission to conduct the study was given by both the Dalhousie University Research Ethics Board (Halifax, NS, Canada) and Aga Khan University's Ethics Committee (Karachi, Pakistan).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 340 families in January 2004 of whom 170 were randomized to receive fall prevention counseling (group 1) and 170 to ingestion safety counseling (group 2).</p><p>Follow-up was completed in July 2004. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> outlines the flow of participants from randomization to the last follow-up. In total, 304 (90%) completed 6 months of follow-up, with a similar number lost to follow-up in the two study groups. The only reason for dropout was loss to follow-up. Baseline characteristics between the two randomized groups are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age of children was 26&#x000a0;months in both study groups, with males comprising about two-thirds in each group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mothers in both branches of the study had similar mean years of education and mean age at which they had their first child (26&#x000a0;years). The frequency of safety hazards observed during the initial home visit is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The safety hazards were evenly distributed in the two branches of the study. Almost 90% of homes had stairs that were not protected by a stair gate or a door, and 48% of the sampled homes had a baby walker in their home. There was a high prevalence (75%) of proper storage of poisons in homes.

Moreover, we did not find the home visits difficult to implement, and we were successful in gaining access to 88% of the homes. The result of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that the intervention was effective in reducing targeted hazards in a low-income South African setting. The two systematic reviews concluded that home visits can substantially reduce rates of unintentional injuries, particularly in families at increased risk of injuries at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A Canadian study examining the effectiveness of a home visit to improve home safety found that significant safety modifications only occurred in the number of homes having hot water exceeding 54&#x000b0;C or the absence of a smoke detector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We hypothesized that the difference in Pakistan, as compared to the Canadian study, probably relates to a cultural difference, since health advice is often adhered to by Pakistani people. Other possible reasons are differences in education or income between less developed and developed countries. However, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the intervention was just as effective for lower income participants with little education as for higher income participants with more education.</p><p>Previous intervention studies have not shown consistently positive results in the prevention of injuries sustained in the home. In some studies, primary care-based education had a limited effect on improving home safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some authors have suggested that a limiting factor may be the broad scope of many interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interventions might be more effective if they are simpler and more focused, as in this study.</p><p>Pakistan does not have legislation requiring safety caps on prescriptions. Fortunately, about 75% of households in our study stored poisons in locked cabinets. Mandatory safety caps on bottles would likely be beneficial for the 25% of households that did not store medications in locked cabinets.</p><p>In our study, the injury hazards were evenly distributed among both fall and poisoning groups, except for windows opening less than 15&#x000a0;cm. This is probably because they were in newly constructed apartments that are compliant with building codes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Parents' knowledge about fall hazards was generally low. This, along with defining barriers and exploring hazard reduction opportunities to eliminate them, needs to be investigated (e.g., difficulty in obtaining stair gates and perceived benefits of using baby walkers).</p><p>There are a few limitations that can be addressed in future studies. This intervention in an urban, fairly well-educated population may not be generalizable to rural settings or populations with low levels of literacy. Another limitation is that we have measured home injury hazards and not the occurrence of injuries. However, based on studies that relate the presence of hazards with an increased risk of injury, it is reasonable to use a proxy measure, and indeed this is the only feasible approach without requiring the thousands of research participants needed to demonstrate a reduction in injuries.</p><p>Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of an educational intervention program aimed at improving the home safety practices of families with young children. Concerning houses that were deemed &#x0201c;unsafe&#x0201d; in regard to falls at baseline, the number of households deemed &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; at follow-up had about a four-fold increase compared to the control group. Similarly, for houses that were deemed &#x0201c;unsafe&#x0201d; with regard to ingestion at baseline, the number of households deemed &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; at follow-up had increased about eight-fold compared to the control group. Despite these impressive improvements, the majority of households in both groups still had at least one hazard for falls or for ingestions. This implies a need to refine the intervention or combine it with other strategies that will make homes safer. In addtion, our results need to be replicated in a rural setting with lower levels of education and low SES, and possibly a difference in the number and type of home hazards.</p><p>Recognizing that a "one size fits all" approach to interventions does not work, it is also recommended that successful and promising home-visitation programs be tested across different communities and with different groups of home visitors to determine their utility and impact across varying conditions. This intervention is feasible in Pakistan because of the existence of female health workers, 75,000 women whose main focus is delivering primary health care at the village or neighborhood level. Injury prevention education could easily be implemented as part of home visits. This should be tested in a randomized controlled trial since it is possible that the injury prevention messages may be diluted by the other messages delivered in a home visit, and the impact found in this trial may be lessened.</p><p>Home visits were feasible and acceptable to the families, and there was a statistically significant increase in their knowledge, awareness, and behavior. Further work is needed to determine the long-term impact of this intervention and its extension to other settings such as villages and rural areas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Funding</bold> A grant was provided by the University Research Council of Aga Khan University, Pakistan.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold> None.</p><p><bold>What is already known on this topic?</bold> <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In developed countries home visiting programs for injury prevention have led to a 25% reduction in the number of hazards in households that received home visits compared to households that did not.</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>What this study adds</bold> <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This trial has demonstrated that in Pakistan, a less developed country, home visitations focused on reducing injury hazards had a large impact on urban families.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interventions might be more effective if they are simple and more targeted.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Home visits were feasible and acceptable to the families.</p></list-item></list></p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Krug</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lozano</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of injuries</article-title><source>Am J Public Health</source><year>2000</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>523</fpage><lpage>526</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2105/AJPH.90.4.523</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10754963</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Sarin</surname><given-names>YK</given-names></name><name><surname>Manocha</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Patterns of childhood trauma: Indian perspective</article-title><source>Indian Pediatr</source><year>1993</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8406709</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deen</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Vos</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Huttly</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Injuries and non-communicable diseases: emerging health problems of children in developing countries</article-title><source>Bull World Health Organ</source><year>1999</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>518</fpage><lpage>524</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10427938</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Paden M, McGee K, Krug E (Eds) (2002).
