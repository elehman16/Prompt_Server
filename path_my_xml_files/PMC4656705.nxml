Patient compliance improves effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. When patients comply, there is a rise of bone mineral density, reduction of fracture risk, and improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, long-term compliance with treatment has been shown to be poor in osteoporosis and about half of patients stop therapy within 1 to 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Compliance could even be lower with supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, it has been suggested, in a multicentre study conducted in Spain, that only two in ten patients effectively comply with calcium and vitamin D treatment after 1&#x000a0;year or more of its prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>However, calcium and vitamin D are essential for the maintenance of bone homeostasis. Most of the current guidelines recommend a daily intake of calcium in postmenopausal women of at least 1000 to 1200&#x000a0;mg, together with at least 800&#x000a0;IU of vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Besides its effect on falls and fractures, results from ecological, case-control and cohort studies have also shown that high vitamin D levels were associated with reduced risks of autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, vitamin D status of the general population is largely below the recommended level. Indeed, it is estimated that one billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Regarding calcium, the needs for adults are generally recognized as the intake required to maintain calcium balance and therefore skeletal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for European adults is 800&#x000a0;mg/day. After menopause, the calcium requirements increase to at least 1000&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most of the epidemiological studies suggest that calcium intake in this population is below the recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent data suggest that there is an increased risk of incident myocardial infarction in patients taking calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, other studies or critical reviews of the literature by other groups of researchers do not support this finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As a consequence, the safety of calcium supplements has drawn much controversy, especially since its use is becoming more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Obviously, this could also have an impact on compliance with calcium supplementation.</p><p>Another factor impacting compliance with treatment is the frequency of treatment administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the field of bone health, pharmacological interventions, including vitamin D supplementation, have been developed with daily, weekly, monthly or multiannually regimes with the objective to improve compliance. This is particularly sensible with vitamin D because such an approach offers a realistic and pragmatic public health measure to target at-risk populations and addresses the emerging public health issue of widespread vitamin D insufficiency. However, still with vitamin D, dosing intervals of more than 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months and/or intermittent bolus doses (200,000&#x000a0;IU) are not regarded as physiological and could affect clinical outcomes because of a difference in the bioavailability of vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The question of the ideal time between doses is, however, still of debate.</p><p>The aims of the present study are to compare the compliance with a once-monthly administration of vitamin D3 to compliance with a daily administration of a fixed-dose combination of vitamin D3 and calcium during two 6-month periods and to assess their effect on the level of vitamin D.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase IV, two-armed, randomized, open, cross-over study conducted in adult volunteers aged 50&#x000a0;years old or older.

After the screening visit (month 0), volunteers respecting all inclusion/exclusion criteria were divided into two groups of treatment. One hundred volunteers were randomized to receive either one drinkable ampoule containing 25,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D3 once monthly (i.e. group VD) or one chewable tablet containing 1000&#x000a0;mg calcium carbonate&#x02009;+&#x02009;800&#x000a0;IU vitamin D3 once daily (i.e. group VDCa) during 6&#x000a0;months.

Quantitative variables were expressed by mean, standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (P25&#x02013;P75) for asymmetric distributions. Qualitative variables were expressed by number and percentage. For quantitative variables, comparison between the two groups of treatment was assessed by means of a Student <italic>t</italic> test for independent populations or a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test if normality was not satisfied. The relationship between qualitative variables and group of treatment was assessed using a chi<sup>2</sup> test. As the study design was a cross-over study, compliance was analyzed according to the method described in D. G. Altman (&#x0201c;Statistical methods for medical research&#x0201d;, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991). This method consists of testing a period/sequence effect, then an interaction effect between period and treatment, and finally, and only in case of no significant effect of period and interaction, a treatment effect. All effects are assessed by using a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test or a non-parametric test of Mann-Whitney. To test the mean evolution of vitamin D between T0 and T6 within the two treatment groups, a Student <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples was used. The relationship between the main reasons of preference to a treatment and the chosen treatment was assessed by a Fisher exact test. For each criterion of acceptability (taste, ease of use, frequency of use, AEs and overall satisfaction), the categories &#x02018;not at all satisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;slightly satisfied&#x02019; and &#x02018;moderately satisfied&#x02019; were regrouped due to few data. For the same reason, the categories &#x02018;very much satisfied&#x02019; and &#x02018;extremely satisfied&#x02019; were also regrouped. For each acceptability criterion, the degree of satisfaction for the two treatments was compared by means a McNemar test. Results were considered to be statistically significant at the 5&#x000a0;% critical level (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Many interventions, involving different factors, may be considered. Indeed, there is evidence to support that a multifaceted strategy targeting cognitive, behavioural and emotional factors is more effective than one aimed at a single factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Preference of the patients also needs to be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Indeed, besides the potential effect on compliance with treatment, the patient&#x02019;s perspective is becoming increasingly important in clinical and policy decisions. In our study, more patients preferred D-Cure&#x000ae;, but the two treatments (i.e. D-Cure&#x000ae; and Steovit Forte&#x000ae;) were chosen for different reasons. The frequency of use is the main reason given for choosing vitamin D alone, but it should be pointed that the potential reasons for preference were predefined.</p><p>Interestingly, increasing time between two doses has also been suggested to improve compliance. However, and more globally, the dose interval is still a matter of debate. On one side, some studies have suggested that compliance with monthly regimes could be better than with daily regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. On the other side, according to a recent review, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of the endocrine/autocrine system, significant 25OHD should be available on a daily basis to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Consequently, the balance between bioavailability and compliance needs to be taken into account.</p><p>Anyway, it should be pointed out that although the exact consequences of dose interval on bone health outcome are not well known, the effect of the frequency of vitamin D administration on vitamin D status has already been investigated. In our study, even if the monthly intake has improved the vitamin D status more than the daily intake, it does not reach statistical significance. Other studies have compared daily, weekly and monthly vitamin D supplementation. In one 4-month study of equivalent oral doses of vitamin D3 600&#x000a0;IU/day, 4200&#x000a0;IU/week and 18,000&#x000a0;IU/month, daily dosing was the most and monthly dosing the least effective to raise 25(OH)D concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In another 2-month study, intakes of 1500&#x000a0;IU of D3 daily, 10,500&#x000a0;IU weekly and 45,000&#x000a0;IU once every 28&#x000a0;days were equally effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a 1-year study, intakes of 800&#x000a0;IU daily were more efficient than intakes of 97,333&#x000a0;IU every 4&#x000a0;months to increase serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Another study, conducted over a period of 3&#x000a0;months, showed no difference in the improvement of vitamin D status between supplementations of 2000&#x000a0;IU/day or 60,000&#x000a0;IU/month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>It should also be noted that even if most of the epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of adequate calcium intake is low, the supplementation of calcium is not necessary in subjects with sufficient intake of calcium from food. Indeed, the best way to meet the daily dietary calcium requirement is through the intake of foods high in calcium: such as dairy products, green vegetables, and mineral waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dairy products may represent one of the best dietary sources of calcium as they provide more calcium (and protein, magnesium, potassium, zinc and phosphorus) per calorie than any other typical food found in the adult diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The recommended consumption is three portions of dairy products per day (for example, one glass of milk, one portion of cheese and one yogurt). This amount could provide most of the calcium needs of the general population and could limit the use or the dose of calcium supplementation in the elderly. Another possibility to improve calcium intake, keeping a once-monthly intake of vitamin D, would be with food fortification. A variety of calcium-fortified foods, such as orange juice and soy milk, are available in some countries and provide the same amount of calcium as dairy products. Interestingly, it has been calculated, from the FINDIET data, that calcium fortification of only 11&#x000a0;% of all fortifiable foods would lead to a decrease of the proportion of participants with calcium intake below the recommended level from 20.3 to 15.7&#x000a0;% in men and from 27.8 to 23.2&#x000a0;% in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>We should acknowledge that besides the open-label design of this study, a major limitation of this study is that no daily calcium supplementation was given to the subjects from the monthly dose of the vitamin D group. Obviously, the well-known minor adverse events (e.g. gastrointestinal disorders) observed with calcium supplementation could have affected the compliance with the combined calcium/vitamin D product that, in turn, could have influenced the vitamin D status. However, because of the controversies regarding calcium supplementation, some prescribers and some patients could be willing to avoid such supplementation. In these circumstances, strategies to increase calcium intake through calcium-fortified food should be activated.</p><p>On the other side, in Belgium, where this study was conducted, there is no other supplement than D-Cure&#x000ae; containing cholecalciferol alone. All specialities containing cholecalciferol are combined with calcium. Steovit Forte&#x000ae; was chosen, as the dose of cholecalciferol (800&#x000a0;IU/daily) is the closest to that of D-Cure&#x000ae; (25.000&#x000a0;IU/month). It should then be pointed out that the monthly total dose of vitamin D3 delivered in the monthly supplement was 1000&#x000a0;IU greater than in the daily supplement. The cost per month is 1.25&#x020ac; for D-Cure&#x000ae; and 15.87&#x020ac; for Steovit Forte&#x000ae;. In our study, a substantial proportion of the volunteers were previously treated with D-Cure&#x000ae; and/or Steovit Forte&#x000ae;. Therefore, both products were well known by the volunteers before their entry in the study. In addition, both products are available on the Belgium market since many years and without prescription over the counter.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that a monthly dose of vitamin D is preferred to a daily combined administration of calcium and vitamin D and leads to a better compliance but without a significant difference in serum vitamin D concentration between both regimes/treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a grant from Laboratoires SMB, a pharmaceutical company in Belgium who manufactures the D-Cure&#x000ae;.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>RD and ND have no competing interest.
