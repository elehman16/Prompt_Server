One reason would be the mother's desire. Increased maternal self-efficacy can be an important step to reduce percentage of cesarean. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of training-based strategies to increase the self-efficacy for choosing delivery method among pregnant women in Shahrekord city.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 130 pregnant women who attended urban health centers in Shahrekord city in 2013. Intervention was applied in the experimental group in three sessions in about 60-90 min while control group did not receive any intervention. Fear of childbirth and self-efficacy questionnaire was completed before and after training.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>While mean scores of the fear of childbirth, expectations and childbirth self-efficacy before the intervention between the two groups were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In this study, 71.4% of mothers in intervention group and 53.8% of control mothers naturally delivered their children. Most of intervention group mothers desired to deliver through cesarean and had more fear (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but lower childbirth expectation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and self-efficacy (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) than those who chose normal method.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings showed that training-based self-efficacy procedure has been effective in encouraging mothers to choose natural childbirth.

For example, Bandura, a psychologist, expressed self-efficacy in his social learning theory which states that self-efficacy includes self-assessment of one's own ability to cope with stressful situations.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In fact, a relationship between fear of childbirth, self-efficacy and natural childbirth may exist; if a pregnant woman thinks that she cannot control labor situation, her fear and anxiety will lead her to choose cesarean delivery without medical reasons.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moreover, due to the importance of self-efficacy in controlling fear and pain of labor and suitable delivery method, educational intervention strategies designated to increase self-efficacy could reduce the fear and may enhance the ability of mothers to overcome the pain of labor and cesarean cut. Therefore, the aim of present study was to find out the effect of educational intervention based on self-efficacy on the delivery choice among pregnant women in Shahrekord city, Iran in 2013.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2013. The participants were 130 randomly selected pregnant women of 24-32 weeks of gestation referred to the urban health centers. Using stratified random sampling, pregnant women referring to all eight urban health centers of Shahrekord city were randomly classified into two groups (intervention and control) and based on the population distribution of each center were randomly divided into two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 65 for each group). Inclusion criteria was all pregnant women at 24-32 weeks of pregnancy, centers who were willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included medical indications for cesarean section (previous cesarean, dystocia, embryonic distress and breech view) and the cases of premature delivery or emergency caesarean delivery and cases who did not want to cooperate. Two of the mothers in the intervention group were excluded from the study due to premature birth.</p><p>This proposal was approved by the Research Council of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in terms of ethical points and all mothers entered the study filled a consent form. Also the questionnaires were given anonymously in order to assure confidentiality.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Variable assessment and study instruments</title><p>We used a questionnaire which its validity and reliability of self-efficacy questionnaire has been examined and verified by Khorsandi and colleagues.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In another study, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire titled childbirth fear were also examined and verified by Khorsandi and colleagues.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The questionnaires were completed in both intervention and control groups at the first visit. Then the educational intervention was conducted in the intervention group and the control group received routine care during pregnancy. The questionnaire administered consisted of three parts: Demographic information (age, age at marriage, education, occupation and history of cesarean among relatives), questions related to childbirth fear and questions about the self-efficacy of delivery. The questionnaire titled with delivery fear included 14 questions using Likert score. Delivery self-efficacy questionnaire itself consisted of two parts: The first part with 17 questions on outcome expectation and the second part on expected delivery self-efficacy with another 17 questions. Validity and reliability of self-efficacy questionnaire has been examined and verified by Khorsandi and colleagues in Iran.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In another study, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire titled childbirth fear were examined and verified by Khorsandi and colleagues in Iran.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Outcome and self-efficacy expectations could be considered as &#x0201c;a belief on that the expected behavior would result in special outcome&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;a belief that one enables to do necessary behaviors in special situations&#x0201d;, respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The intervention group participated in three 60-90 min sessions during a week (including 8-10 persons in each session) which in sessions, they have received extra education (more than routine prenatal care they usually received). Educational content was developed based on strategies of self-efficacy increase (success in performance, replace experience, verbal persuasion and physiological or emotional states). In first session, mothers were introduced to each other, and each of the mothers were allowed to talk about the causes of childbirth fear as well as their maternity imagination and also the reason of program and panel discussion and the participants were given equal opportunity for free expression of their ideas and their viewpoints. After collection of childbirth fear causes, the educational content was prepared based on it. At second session, by inviting a successful normal (vaginal) birth delivered mother to express her experience, the participants were practically familiar with the normal method. Then, the training were continued with explaining maternal anxiety and its effects on the fetus, stating the benefits of natural childbirth, cesarean side-effects, reasons for emergency caesarean section and Kegel exercise training; pelvic floor exercise, or Kegel exercise, consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, now sometimes colloquially referred to as the &#x0201c;Kegel muscles&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Finally, at third session, the Kegel's exercises were illustrated to ensure that it is perform in a correct way. Full interpretation of natural childbirth, labor characteristics, childbirth stages and effective actions during these stages and natural childbirth education using instructional videos were also applied. At the end of each training session, it has been given enough time to mothers to answer their questions.</p><p>Instruction was performed by Lecture, group discussion and question and answer. In addition, the educational pamphlets about the characteristics of the labor and natural delivery process were placed at mother's disposal. After the above mentioned three sessions, through two further telephone conversations, mothers were given some tips about doing Kegel exercises and mothers were encouraged to do exercises 2-3 times a day and their potential questions were answered. The final evaluation was done by recompleting questionnaire 1-month after training in both groups. Information about the actual method of delivery was collected by calling mothers in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16 Software (Chicago, SPSS Inc.) by using descriptive statistics (mean, frequency and standard deviation) and inferential statistics such as independent <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square and Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as the level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of mothers were 26.72 &#x000b1; 4.61 and 27.72 &#x000b1; 5.81 year in intervention and control groups, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Since each self-efficacy program along with position analysis is more efficient, it is recommended to be considered in future studies. However, due to the low sample size and lack of evaluation of pregnant women living in rural areas, it would be more useful and extensile to study a larger sample size and adding the pregnant women in rural area to the sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>As a conclusion, the results of this study confirms the role of self-efficacy as a key element in the choice of childbirth method and natural childbirth fear control and may illustrate the effectiveness of an educational intervention based on self-efficacy in reducing cesarean section in the intervention group after the end of the study. Therefore, the broad educational interventions based on self-efficacy can be effective in encouraging mothers to natural childbirth.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This article is a dissertation of Master's degree in Health Education, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
