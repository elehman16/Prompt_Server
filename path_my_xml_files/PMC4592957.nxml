We illustrate an approach using observational data. <bold>Methods.</bold> Our example is the Whole Systems Demonstrator (WSD) trial, in which 3230 adults with chronic conditions were assigned to receive telehealth or usual care. First, we used novel placebo tests to assess whether outcomes were similar between the RCT control group and a matched subset of nonparticipants who received usual care. We matched on 65 baseline variables obtained from the electronic medical record. Second, we conducted sensitivity analysis to consider whether the estimates of treatment effectiveness were robust to alternative assumptions about whether &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; is defined by the RCT control group or nonparticipants. Thus, we provided alternative estimates of comparative effectiveness by contrasting the outcomes of the RCT telehealth group and matched nonparticipants. <bold>Results.</bold> For some endpoints, such as the number of outpatient attendances, the placebo tests passed, and the effectiveness estimates were robust to the choice of comparison group. However, for other endpoints, such as emergency admissions, the placebo tests failed and the estimates of treatment effect differed markedly according to whether telehealth patients were compared with RCT controls or matched nonparticipants. <bold>Conclusions.</bold> The proposed placebo tests indicate those cases when estimates from RCTs do not generalize to routine clinical practice and motivate complementary estimates of comparative effectiveness that use observational data. Future RCTs are recommended to incorporate these placebo tests and the accompanying sensitivity analyses to enhance their relevance to policy making.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>causal inference</kwd><kwd>external validity</kwd><kwd>generalizability</kwd><kwd>randomized trials</kwd><kwd>telehealth</kwd><kwd>chronic health conditions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can ensure high levels of internal validity because the treatment groups are balanced.

Another threat to generalizability is that the care provided in the RCT may differ from what would be delivered in routine clinical practice.

Stuart and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> proposed a diagnostic test that assesses whether patients receiving a given treatment in an RCT reported similar outcomes to those receiving the same treatment in the target population, after reweighting for the characteristics of the 2 groups. Hartman and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> formally defined the assumptions required for estimating population treatment effects from RCT data and proposed accompanying placebo tests. None of this previous work examined how the study should proceed when the placebo tests fail to confirm the generalizability of an RCT. This is an important topic for policy makers, because if a placebo test fails, then it may be unclear whether the intervention is effective in the target population. In this paper, we extend placebo tests by proposing a sensitivity analysis that addresses the potential implications of nongeneralizability. We also apply placebo tests to an RCT of a complex, out-of-hospital intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Complex interventions are of particular interest to policy makers and include patient-centered medical homes,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> telehealth,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and health coaching.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Placebo tests have not previously been applied to RCTs of these interventions, but they face particular threats to generalizability.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For example, the effectiveness of complex interventions is thought to depend on how well teams of care professionals work together, but the presence of an RCT can significantly alter the context in which these teams work.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Also, patients and professionals often cannot be blinded to treatment allocations in these trials, since the control treatments (e.g., usual care) are typically already known to the participants, and the new interventions require changes in their behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There are several potential problems with estimating treatment effects from these unblinded trials, including &#x0201c;resentful demoralization&#x0201d; if a strong preference for the new treatment leads to poor compliance among controls.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>A clear example of the additional generalizability concerns that are raised by evaluations of complex interventions is the recent Whole Systems Demonstrator (WSD) trial, which used cluster randomization to assign 3230 patients with chronic conditions to receive either telehealth or usual care.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In this trial, telehealth was associated with around 20% fewer unplanned (emergency) hospital admissions than usual care,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> which led to a national initiative to roll out telehealth and similar approaches to 3 million people in England.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, the estimated improvements in outcomes following telehealth appeared to be driven by the relative increase in rates of emergency admission among the RCT control group shortly after their recruitment,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> thus raising concern that patients in the control arm reacted to their allocations or received different care than would be provided in routine clinical practice.</p><p>Next we describe the WSD trial and discuss the generalizability concerns it illustrates.

Potentially eligible patients were identified from the lists of patients registered at the participating primary care practices; diagnoses were sourced from routine primary and secondary care data sets and from clinician reports. Identified patients were written to at home (<italic>n</italic> = 15,171). Those who responded affirmatively (<italic>n</italic> = 5279) were visited and provided with consent forms for participation. Ultimately, 3230 patients participated. The treatment allocations of patients followed those of the primary care practices at which they were already registered. While patients could not be blinded, they were only told of their treatment allocations after they had consented to participate. The long recruitment period (May 2008 to September 2009) meant that it was not always possible to blind those recruiting patients.</p><p>Telehealth patients received home-based technology to record medical information (e.g., blood oxygen) and to answer symptom questions. Information from patients was transmitted automatically to monitoring centers, which were staffed by employees from local healthcare organizations. Control patients had access to usual care for their area, which did not include telehealth. They were offered telehealth at the end of the 12-month trial period if they were still eligible at that point.</p><p>For the analysis of service utilization, primary care practices were asked to share pseudonymized data from the electronic medical record for all their registered patients, covering dates of registrations, encounters, diagnoses, test results, and prescriptions over at least a 4-year period.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> These data were linked to pseudonymized administrative hospital records.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>In prespecified analyses, telehealth patients experienced fewer emergency hospital admissions than controls over 12 months (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65&#x02013;1.00, <italic>P</italic> = 0.046).

Some candidates are general attitudes toward using emergency care and severity of illness requiring emergency care. These, however, are correlated with variables for which we did control, such as prior emergency admissions,<sup><xref rid="bibr57-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> and it is not obvious how they would lead to the sudden increases in admissions that were observed among the RCT control group.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the failure of the placebo tests for emergency admissions is that the implementation of the trial protocol altered unplanned forms of care for RCT patients assigned to receive usual care. As the placebo tests reported similar rates of elective admission, outpatient attendance, and primary care contact (all of which are planned by an appointments system), it now seems unlikely that the healthcare professionals involved in recruiting patients for the RCT altered the management of patients assigned to the control. However, it is possible that the trial recruitment processes led to changes in behavior amongst these patients. For example, recruitment into the trial could have increased unease or anxiety among those with a preference for telehealth, such that patients were more likely to seek help at emergency rooms.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Unfortunately, information on patient preferences was not collected during the trial,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> so it is not possible to verify this theory directly.</p><p>Compared with emergency admissions, confounding appears more likely for mortality. In-hospital mortality is strongly predicted by clinical information recorded at the point of admission, such as blood pressure and respiratory rate,<sup><xref rid="bibr59-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bibr60-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> but this information was not available within our data sets at that particular point in the care pathway. It is hard to see how the implementation of the trial protocol could have altered usual care to the extent that mortality rates were significantly increased, although it is true that the mortality effect estimated from the RCT data was unusually large.</p><p>Regardless of the explanation for the failure of the placebo tests for emergency admissions and mortality, the conclusion is the same: The generalizability of the WSD trial was limited for these endpoints. This encourages sensitivity analyses to determine whether the trial-based estimates are robust to alternative comparison groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-0272989X15585131"><title>Sensitivity Analysis Regarding Reasons for Nongeneralizability</title><sec id="section9-0272989X15585131"><title>Methods</title><p>Failure of the placebo tests implies that the control treatment in the trial was different than that received in the target population or the sample selection was confounded (conditional on observables), or both. Although analysis of RCT data will give unbiased estimates of sample treatment effects, in applying these findings it is necessary to assume that the treatments are consistent with those in routine practice. We can produce an alternative estimate of the sample treatment effect by comparing the RCT intervention patients with a comparable group of patients receiving the control treatment within the target population. This comparison is observational (and thus susceptible to confounding), but it avoids having to assume that the RCT control group experienced care consistent with usual care in routine practice. We propose that reporting sample treatment effects using both the RCT controls (base case) and a matched sample from the target population (sensitivity analysis) offers a useful check on whether the results from the RCT are robust to these threats to generalizability.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0272989X15585131">**</xref></p><p>To apply the sensitivity analysis to the WSD study, we matched nonparticipants to patients in the RCT telehealth arm, using the same approach as before. After satisfactory balance had been obtained (see Appendix C), we applied generalized linear models to the matched data to estimate the SATT of telehealth versus usual care, by contrasting endpoints for the RCT telehealth arm with those of the matched nonparticipant patients who received usual care. We also obtained the comparable estimate from the RCT, by matching controls and telehealth patients within the trial and fitting generalized linear models.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0272989X15585131"><title>Results</title><p>For those endpoints where the placebo tests passed, estimated treatment effects were similar regardless of whether telehealth patients were compared with RCT controls (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X15585131">Table 3</xref>, column B), or with matched nonparticipants (column C). Thus, for example, both analyses found that telehealth did not significantly change the use of outpatient services, and both analyses reported similar point estimates for primary care contacts (although significance levels varied slightly).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0272989X15585131">&#x02020;&#x02020;</xref></sup> In contrast, the estimated treatment effects for emergency admissions and mortality differed markedly according to the comparison group. Thus, although analysis of RCT data alone suggested reductions in emergency admissions (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.77&#x02013;1.05),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0272989X15585131">&#x02021;&#x02021;</xref></sup> the comparison between telehealth and matched nonparticipants reported a trend toward more emergency admissions among telehealth patients (rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.95&#x02013;1.31). Likewise, analysis of RCT data alone suggested that telehealth reduced mortality (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.13&#x02013;1.23), but the comparison with nonparticipants reported a trend in the opposite direction (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 0.57&#x02013;3.94). These sensitivity analyses have implications for policy making because reductions in emergency admissions continue to be a major motivation to invest in telehealth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section11-0272989X15585131"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current paper adds to a growing body of research addressing the potential of observational data to assess and strengthen the generalizability of RCT-based estimates of comparative effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Hartman and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> proposed placebo tests for assessing the assumptions required for RCTs to provide unbiased estimates of population average treatment effects. We applied placebo tests to an RCT of a complex out-of-hospital intervention, comparing the outcomes of RCT control patients with those of matched nonparticipants receiving usual care. Unlike previous studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> we proposed sensitivity analyses to explore the implications of alternative assumptions about the cause of nongeneralizability. Sensitivity analyses may be particularly useful for decision makers in the settings exemplified by our case study, where placebo tests indicate that the main trial findings do not generalize to the target population of interest. For WSD, they showed that if one assumes that the placebo tests failed because of differences in control treatments between settings, then the data were consistent with an increase in emergency hospital admissions due to telehealth.</p><p>Our approach to placebo tests and associated sensitivity analyses has the following requirements. First, before conducting the placebo tests, the target population must be defined, along with what constitutes a meaningful difference in outcomes. In our example, the target population consisted of local patients with the relevant chronic conditions, and the definition of &#x0201c;clinically different&#x0201d; came from the original sample size calculation.</p><p>Second, RCT investigators should understand reasons for nonparticipation in an RCT. Just as in an observational study, it is vital to understand the mechanism for treatment selection.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> In our example, we drew on a qualitative study about reasons for refusal to participate in the WSD trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Third, observational data sets are required with patients, contexts, and treatments that represent the target population and overlap with those included in the RCT. These data sets must contain sufficient information to reproduce the main RCT eligibility criteria and outcomes. One possibility is to collect baseline, process, and follow-up data for people who refused to participate in the RCT, as in a comprehensive cohort study.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="bibr63-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> Another is to embed RCTs within large routine data sets.<sup><xref rid="bibr64-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup></p><p>Fourth, placebo tests should use analytical techniques that are able to address confounding. We used genetic matching,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> since the large number of baseline variables (<italic>n</italic> = 65) was too challenging for traditional matching methods. We also carefully assessed the sensitivity of the placebo tests to alternative regression model specifications (see Appendix B), including the addition of interaction terms and alternative model structures.</p><p>Fifth, as in our example, the study is required to prespecify sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the findings.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. The placebo tests addressed only some aspects of generalizability, related to the characteristics and treatments of the control group. The generalizability of the intervention regimen could have been addressed with very similar methods, but data were not available on patients receiving telehealth in routine settings. Also, although the placebo tests are useful for providing a quantitative assessment of the generalizability of the RCT-based estimates, they cannot identify precisely why a study was not generalizable. We believe that the most plausible reason for the failure of the placebo tests for emergency admissions in the WSD study was that the control patients received atypical care or otherwise reacted to their treatment allocations, but it is also possible that there were important unmeasured differences in patient characteristics between settings. Finally, as with many comparative effectiveness studies, several endpoints were measured with no attempt to allow for multiplicity. Where the placebo tests indicate that treatment effects were more generalizable for some endpoints than others, judgment is required to decide whether to proceed to estimating population average treatment effects. One explicit approach to weighting the alternative endpoints would be to apply the placebo tests to overall metrics such as those used in cost-effectiveness analyses (e.g., to contrast net monetary benefits between the RCT and routine practice settings).</p><p>Future research could address alternative estimators for the placebo tests. Stuart and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> used 3 methods to reweight control outcomes to the target population, namely inverse probability of treatment weighting, full matching, and subclassification. These gave similar results in their example. We found that generalized linear modeling and time series regression gave similar results (see Appendix B), but further investigation is warranted. Placebo tests could also be extended to consider missing endpoints data and could be considered for situations without such a rich set of baseline variables as WSD.</p><p>This study raises the question about the value of collecting observational data alongside RCTs, given that the amount of funding for a given RCT is constrained and there are competing priorities. Substantial efforts are often made at the design stage to improve the generalizability of RCTs,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> but analytical-stage strategies that assess generalizability empirically are often relatively limited. The CONSORT statement, for example, recommends only a table of baseline characteristics.<sup><xref rid="bibr65-0272989X15585131" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> We conclude that the proposed placebo tests and accompanying sensitivity analyses provide information about the level of generalizability actually achieved in RCTs. These additions to the methodological toolkit can help decision makers judge the extent to which estimates of comparative effectiveness obtained from RCTs can be adjusted to apply to their target populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary
