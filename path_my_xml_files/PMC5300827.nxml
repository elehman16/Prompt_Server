of massage therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on gastrocnemius muscle
fatigue, assessing whether the intervention improved muscle tone, stiffness, and muscle
contraction. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 20 healthy males in their 20s who
were equally divided into a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation group and a
combined therapy group that received a combination of massage therapy and transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation. Muscle fatigue was triggered on the gastrocnemius muscle,
and the effects of intervention method on muscle tone, stiffness, and muscle contraction
were examined over time. [Results] Lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscle tone and
stiffness significantly increased and gastrocnemius muscle contraction significantly
decreased in each group immediately after fatigue was triggered on the gastrocnemius
muscle. There was no difference in the effects of the two intervention methods over time.
[Conclusion] This study verified that a combined therapy of massage therapy and
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was able to be used effectively in improving
muscle tone, stiffness, muscle contraction, thereby reducing gastrocnemius muscle
fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Muscle fatigue</kwd><kwd>Muscle tone</kwd><kwd>Stiffness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscle fatigue triggers a decrease in the skin&#x02019;s sensory faculty<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, an accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibers, and

the improvement of gastrocnemius (GCM) muscle tone, stiffness, and muscle contraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study randomly and equally divided 20 healthy males residing in a local community into
a TENS group that employed only TENS (mean &#x000b1; SD: age, 22.0 &#x000b1; 1.6&#x02005;years; height, 178.0 &#x000b1;
7.9&#x02005;cm; body weight, 74.8 &#x000b1; 12.5&#x02005;kg) and a combined therapy (CT) group that employed both
massage therapy and TENS (mean &#x000b1; SD: age, 22.7 &#x000b1; 1.4&#x02005;years; height, 173.5 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x02005;cm; body
weight, 66.4 &#x000b1; 7.1&#x02005;kg). Those who had a musculoskeletal or neurological disorder, had
regularly exercised within the past three months, or had conducted strengthening or aerobic
exercises within the past five days were excluded from this study. All the subjects
sufficiently listened to and agreed with the purpose and purport of this study. This study
was conducted with the approval of Howon University&#x02019;s Life Ethics Committee and all subjects
signed an informed consent of the study.</p><p>Muscle fatigue was induced by having each participant maximally and continuously conduct a
calf raise with his ankle plantar flexion on a stool (which had a height of 20&#x02005;cm) with his
dominant leg&#x02019;s GCM muscle as the subject until he was no longer able to raise his calf<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After muscle fatigue was triggered in each subject, an intervention was applied to each
group once per day for two days for 15 minutes each day. The calf region of each subject in
the TENS group was stimulated with two channels using an electrostimulator (TENS-7000,
Koalaty Products Inc., USA) with a frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz, a pulse duration of 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;s<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and an adhesive electrode with a diameter
of two inches (Nurostimulation Electrodes, ValuTrode, USA). Massage therapy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> was applied to the lateral and medial GCM
muscles of each subject in the CT group for seven minutes, and massage therapy and TENS were
applied to the lateral and medial GCM muscles of each subject in the TENS group for seven
minutes and eight minutes, respectively. The intensity of the TENS was adjusted according to
each subject&#x02019;s tolerance. All the interventions of this study were applied while each
subject was in a prone position.</p><p>Lateral and medial GCM muscle tone and stiffness were measured in a prone position using
Myoton<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>PRO (MyotonAS, Estonia). A mark was placed symmetrically on the highest
muscle belly, and measurement equipment was placed vertically<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. An average value of two measurements was used as data. For the
measurement of the maximal voluntary muscle contraction of the GCM muscle, a Commander
PowerTrack II Muscle Tester (JTECH Medical, Inc. USA), which is a handheld dynamometer, was
used. Each subject extended his knees while in a prone position on the plinth and maximally
dorsiflexed his plantar, at which point a measurement was taken<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to prevent muscle fatigue recovery during these
repetitive measurements after muscle fatigue was induced, a measurement was taken once after
two practice measurements. Measurements were taken four times: before the inducement of
muscle fatigue, immediately after the inducement of muscle fatigue, after the application of
the intervention on the first day (24h), and after the application of the intervention on
the second day (48h).</p><p>The measured indoor temperature was 23&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. All the interventions and measurements was
applied by a physical therapist who had completed a Maitland Level IIa course. All the data
collected from this study were analyzed using a statistical processing program (SPSS 210/PC,
USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Each subject in each group&#x02019;s muscle tone, stiffness, and muscle contraction before and
after the inducement of muscle fatigue was the same and there was no significant difference.
A repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to assess changes in
muscle tone, stiffness, and muscle contraction before and after the inducement of muscle
fatigue in each group, and as a post hoc test, a simple and repeated contrast test was
carried out. An independent t-test was conducted in order to compare the changes between the
two groups. The significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05. According to the results of the
repeated measure ANOVA analysis, each group&#x02019;s GCM muscle tone and stiffness significantly
increased and their GCM muscle contraction significantly decreased immediately after the
inducement of muscle fatigue (p&#x0003c;0.05). GCM muscle tone and stiffness significantly
decreased and muscle contraction significantly increased in both the TENS and CT groups one
day after the intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05). Two days after the intervention, both groups&#x02019; GCM
muscle tone and stiffness decreased and muscle contraction increased, but lateral GCM muscle
tone and stiffness significantly decreased only in the TENS group (p&#x0003c;0.05). There was no
significant difference in the improvement effects of each group over time (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Change in muscle tone, stiffness and muscle contraction on each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-fatigue</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-fatigue</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 Day</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 Day</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Lateral gastrocnemius muscle</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Muscle tone (Hz)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TENS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.5 &#x000b1; 0.8<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.8 &#x000b1; 0.3<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.9 &#x000b1; 0.8<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.3 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.7 &#x000b1; 0.5<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4 &#x000b1; 0.4<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4 &#x000b1; 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Stiffness (N/m)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TENS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">323.3 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">377.1 &#x000b1; 12.7<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">317.6 &#x000b1; 6.3<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">306.7 &#x000b1; 4.9<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">320.6 &#x000b1; 8.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">371.5 &#x000b1; 15.7<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">296.0 &#x000b1; 7.9<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">294.1 &#x000b1; 9.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Medial gastrocnemius muscle</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Muscle tone (Hz)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TENS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.8 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6 &#x000b1; 0.3<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 &#x000b1; 0.1<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.6 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.8 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.4 &#x000b1; 0.5<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.1 &#x000b1; 0.5<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.1 &#x000b1; 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Stiffness (N/m)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TENS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">297.8 &#x000b1; 6.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">358.8 &#x000b1; 6.7<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">293.6 &#x000b1; 3.8<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">292.6 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">302.1 &#x000b1; 9.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">368.7 &#x000b1; 14.6<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">287.0 &#x000b1; 8.6<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">284.2 &#x000b1; 6.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Gastrocnemius muscle contraction (N)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TENS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">245.5 &#x000b1; 4.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">201.1 &#x000b1; 3.8<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">237.9 &#x000b1; 5.2<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">245.2 &#x000b1; 3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">251.0 &#x000b1; 5.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">211.8 &#x000b1; 7.7<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">243.5 &#x000b1; 4.1<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">247.3 &#x000b1; 5.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SE.

and stiffness significantly increase immediately after the inducement of muscle fatigue and
significantly decrease after the application of the intervention for one day. After one day,
there was no significant difference in the changes in muscle tone and stiffness of the GCM
muscle between the two groups, but on average, the CT group showed a greater decrease.</p><p>Such a result is noteworthy because massage therapy decreases alpha and beta activity,
inducing a relaxation response<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
more greatly influences a decrease in muscle tone and stiffness. In a previous study, Kang
et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that TENS did not have
obvious effect on recovery from erector muscle fatigue. Since the intervention effect of
TENS on muscle fatigue recovery may differ according to different body parts, the
application of massage therapy together with TENS will be effective for the management of
muscle fatigue. Two days after the intervention, only the muscle tone and stiffness of the
lateral GCM muscle of the TENS group significantly decreased, but there was no significant
difference in the amount of change between the two groups.</p><p>In this study, both groups&#x02019; GCM muscle contraction significantly decreased immediately
after the induction of muscle fatigue but significantly increased after intervention was
applied for one day. However, there was no significant difference between the study groups,
and the subjects&#x02019; natural physical recovery ability likely had an effect because the
subjects were young adults in their 20s. Cho et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> saw muscle contraction decrease immediately after the inducement of
GCM muscle fatigue, but their findings support the present study&#x02019;s results by verifying that
the application of TENS had a significant effect on the recovery of muscle contraction
ability.</p><p>At present, as an intervention method for fibromyalgia, a combined therapy using electrical
therapy methods has been presented as a better treatment than a single therapy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In this study, when TENS was applied to GCM muscles in which muscle fatigue had been
triggered, muscle tone and stiffness decreased on average when TENS and massage therapy were
applied in combination. This result suggests that for the management of muscle fatigue and
delayed onset muscle soreness, using different intervention methods should be preferred over
the employment a single intervention method. A limitation of this study, the findings cannot
be generalized to women or neurological disorder, because the subjects were in healthy
male.</p><p>However, this study verified that a combined therapy of TENS and massage therapy may be an
effective intervention for the recovery of GCM muscle tone and stiffness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding of this paper was provided by Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Comparisons of changes in the two-point discrimination
