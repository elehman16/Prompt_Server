It necessitates making the method of training of shoulder dystocia management more efficient, i.e., better management and giving services with higher quality. Thus, this study was carried out to compare the impact of training by simulation and oral technique on the skill of the employed midwives in obstetric clinics at Mashhad city (Iran) in shoulder dystocia management during 2012.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>The current research is a double-group clinical trial that was conducted on 51 members of the employed midwives in the obstetric clinic at Mashhad city in 2012. The questionnaire of personal specification and awareness about shoulder dystocia and practical examination (objective-structured clinical examination) were employed as tools for data collection. The learners were divided into two groups by randomized allocation. Training was done by the presentation of lecture in the oral content group and a short movie was displayed at the end of it. The shoulder dystocia management technique was simulated in another group and through role-playing of instructor application of moulage (station) training was conducted. The period of the training course (4 h) and content of the educational workshop was identical for both groups. The practical examination was held for the learners before and immediately after training course. The given data were analyzed by means of statistical descriptive tests including Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test via SPSS software (version 16). The significance level was considered as (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in all cases.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The total mean score was significantly increased for the variable of shoulder dystocia management skill after intervention in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

The midwife is the obstetric operator in 45% of cases for morbidity of shoulder dystocia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The proper and prompt decision-making and appropriate clinical performance are some part of the necessary skills for the midwife.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Similarly, taking suitable measures for care and therapy depends on knowledge and practice of midwife.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, quality of midwifery training may deeply affect on presentation of above skills and the efficient education may lead to improvement of the quality of midwifery services and increase in efficiency and effectiveness in cares and productivity in healthcare medical system.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, making effort to improve the quality of midwifery training may play a determinant role in the health of the community, quality of care, and reduced the related rates of morbidity and mortality to shoulder dystocia[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] while achieving this objective definitely requires a comprehensive educational system.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Nowadays, education and training course is presented mainly by traditional method and via lecture (oral) technique by the teacher in this country. The educational aids are less used in oral training, and the amount of available information is much higher than potential and capability of the learner. The learners lack the experience of training in an active learning environment, and they acquire their skill on a real patient after passing their theoretical lessons.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Genarally, in training oral method of shoulder dystocia management the real environment and clinical presence of the patient is the first opportunity for the learner to use his/her scientific memorized knowledge to manage shoulder dystocia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] As a result, they lack adequate clinical skills and readiness to encounter the unexpected problems.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Thus, employing the alternate educational techniques and utilization from the methods by which the learner can personally acquire the knowledge and skill is necessary. Adaptation of educational techniques based on personal learning may have the highest and foremost impact in their learning[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] including simulation that is one of the methods based on personal learning. Through providing the conditions similar to real world situation, simulation technique puts the opportunity for exercise and repetition at learner's disposal.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Likewise, training by simulation technique leads to increase self-confidence and facilitates acquisition of the needed capability and reduces time of training.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Nevertheless, so far there is no reliable and adequate information regarding the impacts of training by means of simulation method.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Based on the results of study carried out by Goffman <italic>et al</italic>. to determine skill of gynecology and midwifery residents in shoulder dystocia management using simulation technique, those residents who had been trained by this educational method had significantly higher scores in terms of time of intervention for removal of dystocia, conducting maneuvers, and general practice.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The results of the study that was carried out by Comeau and Craig (2014) showed that simulation training technique might not improve the quality of reporting shoulder dystocia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] With respect to necessity of midwife's skill for prediction and favorable shoulder dystocia management as well as given qualitative studies which have been reported in this field and their findings contradicted to the results of this investigation the present research was carried out to compare two educational methods including by simulated and oral techniques and their effect on skill of midwives that are employed in obstetric center at Mashhad city and in shoulder dystocia management in 2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study of clinical trial was conducted with two groups on 54 members of the employed midwives in obstetric centers at Mashhad city after receiving the permission from Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2012. The sample size was estimated using means formula at 99% level of confidence and test power (99%) in any group as 24 participants so that given exclusion of 10% of that sample this size was considered 27 participant in any group. Two participants in oral group and one member in simulated group were excluded from study during this study because they did not participate in posttest. Primarily for sampling, the educational workshop was held by expressing target group and day for holding this course in which the researchers were the scientific secretaries of that workshop and it was recorded in permanent educational system and midwives enrolled in it via system. Then, based on available method of sampling and inclusion criteria, the qualified samples were divided by means of randomized allocation and using lottery technique into two simulated and oral training groups in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> days, respectively. The inclusion criteria of the study comprised consent to participate in research; having at least BA degree in midwifery and the exclusion criteria from study consisted of nonparticipation in all educational phases or examinations of the given course; experience in exposure to shoulder dystocia during studied period; occurrence of inadvertent accidents during holding educational sessions and course examinations. Personal specifications questionnaire, awareness inventory about shoulder dystocia management, and practical examination (objective-structured clinical examination) were tools for data collection to evaluate skill in shoulder dystocia management, and also consent form of educational course and the related practical exam.</p><p>Personal specifications questionnaire included some questions about age, marital status, educational degree, working experience in clinical field and attendance in shoulder dystocia management workshops and the awareness inventory consisted of 15 questions regarding theoretical contents about shoulder dystocia. The practical test (objective-structured clinical examination) included assessment of shoulder dystocia management maneuvers and the related communicational skills. Evaluation of shoulder dystocia management maneuvers comprised four items and assessment of skill consisted of six items. The lowest acquired score from any item was considered as zero and the highest score was 1 for any item so that the minimum total score was zero and the maximum total score was deemed as 10. The checklist of observation of practical test (objective-structured clinical examination) was designed according to World Health Organization checklist concerning prophylaxis and control of shoulder dystocia and important guidelines of national guidance instructions for presentation of midwifery and obstetrics services in mother-friendly hospital and based on the consensus of the relevant academic teachers. Validity of questionnaires and practical test observation checklist (objective-structured clinical examination) was evaluated using content-validity method and reliability of observation checklist for objective-structured clinical examination and awareness inventory was confirmed through determination of internal consistency via., Cronbach alpha coefficient respectively as &#x003b1; = 0.82 and &#x003b1; = 0.78.</p><p>Similarly, the rate of consent from educational course and practical examination in this study was evaluated according to Likert 5-scale spectrum based on choices ranged from strongly agree[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to strongly disagree.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This is a standardized form and former sources and studies have been used to prepare it. It should be noted that the day before holding workshop, the examiners played the related roles along with midwifery instructor for coordination and proper execution of role in the simulated obstetric room to exercise the needed skills and their competency in role-playing and evaluation was confirmed.</p><p>Then, the researcher initially explained about the goal and method of study and dealt with acquiring informed consent from qualified midwives in this study during both days of holding workshop after attendance in study site. Afterward, the personal specifications questionnaire and awareness inventory about shoulder dystocia management were completed by the studied units and they passed a pretest practical examination (objective-structured clinical examination) regarding shoulder dystocia management. The studied sample was initially entered in the simulated obstetric room at clinical skills center during pretest and the simulated scenario was put at their disposal. This scenario included history of a woman during delivery (age: 35, 90 min during exercise for delivery, an hour abnormal glucose concentration test). A midwifery student play the role that she was playing role of a woman during delivery in half-seat status on gynecological bed while she was upset and sought for help and moulage with fetus was placed in front of her and an obstetrician assistant directed shoulders of fetus by a strip fastened around the neck of fetus. The research unit should continue delivery process (exit of shoulders) and notice shoulder dystocia in exposure to delivery from shoulder and manage it during 5 min. In the case of achievement in practice by the midwife in shoulder dystocia successful management and exiting of shoulders, and or passing through this process more than 5 min to exit shoulders, and or confession of the given midwife to lack of her ability to manage dystocia, the examination was stopped. Midwife's skills for existing shoulder and her communication skills were assessed according to observation checklist by examiner. Likewise, one person as midwife and two other persons as gynecologist and pediatrician attended in the simulated obstetric room where they assisted the midwife if she asked them for help. Training course started for 4 h after assessment (simulated training in 1<sup>st</sup> day and oral training in 2<sup>nd</sup> day). After the end of training session, the training consent form was filled out by the research units and posttest was also administered after the end of training. The educational contents were presented to oral training group by means of lecture along with power-point software and then the training movie was played that was published by college of gynecologists and midwifery (about 10 min) and the last 1/2 h of training session was devoted to question and answer (total training period: 4 h). The training consent form was completed by the studied units at the end of training session and they also passed posttest at the end of training session.</p><p>Initially, a synopsis of educational content was presented by short lecture (1/2 h) in simulated training group at clinical skills center and then management of this technique was executed in a simulated obstetric room by researcher on moulage station and explained simultaneously. Similarly, the needed communication skills for management of dystocia were trained through role-playing of researcher (the responsible individual for delivery) with other persons that played roles of delivery subject, midwife, obstetrician, and pediatrician specialists. Afterward, midwives exercised in a simulated environment and received the needed feedback from the instructor (total training period: 4 h). After the end of training session, the training consent form was completed by the studied units. The training content was the same in both groups and it was prepared according to national guiding instruction for presentation of midwifery and obstetric services in mother-friendly hospitals [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-6-50-g001"/></fig><p>Both groups passed posttest similar to pretest immediately after training.

Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study in order to determine the effect of the simulated training technique on shoulder dystocia management on 63 midwifery students in Portugal. The results indicated that the shoulder dystocia management was significantly higher in the simulated training group than in oral training group.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The results of study done by Crofts <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) showed that training on mannequin might lead to improvement of shoulder dystocia management and also it reduced time interval among exiting of head and shoulder as well as pressure on head for exit[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] so that this finding is consistent with the results of the present study. Training leads to improvement of skill, thinking potential, rising capability for design, and execution of care plans.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] There are undeniable evidences that similar to delivery management and its relevant processes, training of practical skills causes increasing mental readiness and pervasive capability in doing clinical measures properly in exposure to emergency and real situations.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] On the other hand, similar to simulation, presentation of training by means of active training techniques and based on personal experiences of learners may increase performance and skill remarkably.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] One can refer to application of question and answer as the factors for efficiency of oral training in the present study. Question and answer may activate mind and lead to active training in the learners.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The communication skills in shoulder dystocia management after intervention were significantly increased in both training methods (simulation and oral) in the present study but there was no significant difference between mean scores of communication skills in shoulder dystocia management in both simulated and oral training groups.</p><p>The results of study carried out by Deering <italic>et al</italic>. on 33 female residents in USA showed that the simulated training might significantly increased communication skills in shoulder dystocia management compared to control group 2 weeks after training.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The reason for this difference of this finding from the results of present study may be due to difference in time interval among pretraining and posttest. Posttest was done 2 weeks after training in Daring's investigation but in the present study posttest was held immediately after the end of training course. However, change in mental dimension might be created immediately after intervention but these changes may not endure and they may approach to the previous level before training during subsequent follow-up processes.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Based on principles for learning adults, creation of opportunity and allowing students to employ and execute their learned contents and knowledge in a clinical situation and showing that in which fields their knowledge and skill may be defective can create strong drive for learning[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and it is recommended to adapt more active educational methods in training the students and also it is suggested to implement some studies to determine the impact of the simulated training technique on retention of skill for shoulder dystocia management. One of the constraints in this research was implementation of this study on the employed midwives in public sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicated that training increased shoulder dystocia management skill in midwives. This improvement of skill was further in simulated training group than in oral training group. Therefore, it is obvious that application of more efficient training techniques and improving training level in midwives may lead to upgrading process of presentation of healthcare services and enhancement and increase in giving services to mothers and their neonates and this will cause improvement of health level among mothers and newborns and enhancement of health indices.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is part of a research proposal approved by the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences with Code No. 89914 which was performed with financial support of the Research Council of the University.
