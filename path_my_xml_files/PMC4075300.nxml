immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels and hormone profile in sedentary adults with Down
syndrome (DS). A total of 40 male adults with DS were recruited for the trial through
different community support groups for people with intellectual disabilities. All
participants had medical approval for participation in physical activity. Twenty-four
adults were randomly assigned to perform resistance training in a circuit with six
stations, 3 days per week for 12 weeks. Training intensity was based on functioning
in the eight-repetition maximum (8RM) test for each exercise. The control group
included 16 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched adults with DS. Salivary IgA,
testosterone, and cortisol levels were measured by ELISA. Work task performance was
assessed using the repetitive weighted-box-stacking test. Resistance training
significantly increased salivary IgA concentration (P=0.0120; d=0.94) and
testosterone levels (P=0.0088; d=1.57) in the exercising group. Furthermore, it also
improved work task performance. No changes were seen in the controls who had not
exercised. In conclusion, a short-term resistance training protocol improved mucosal
immunity response as well as salivary testosterone levels in sedentary adults with
DS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>Resistance training</kwd><kwd>Saliva</kwd><kwd>Immunoglobulin A</kwd><kwd>Testosterone</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="19"/><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The increasing life expectancy of people with Down syndrome (DS) calls for knowledge of
conditions that frequently occur in adults with the syndrome, and of which health
personnel should be particularly aware (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>This population group is particularly susceptible to infections of the respiratory and
the gastrointestinal tracts, which may be explained, at least in part, by a severe
impairment of immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion in the saliva (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In this respect, Chaushu et al. (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) reported that detection of salivary Ig levels might serve as a predictor
of the susceptibility of DS individuals to recurrent respiratory tract infections.</p><p>Recent studies have found that exercise at moderate intensity may have a positive impact
on both the mucosal immune response and the salivary hormone levels (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In a
more detailed way, Akimoto et al. (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) reported
that a 12-month mixed protocol based on endurance and resistance training improved
salivary IgA levels in elderly subjects. Similarly, resistance training has
significantly increased salivary testosterone levels in middle-aged, strength-trained
men (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, the effect of regular exercise
on the mucosal immune response has received no attention in people with DS. In this
regard, the additional positive effects of resistance training on functional tasks of
daily living and employability in this population group should be taken into
consideration (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we hypothesized that resistance training may improve mucosal immunity response in
sedentary adults with DS. Accordingly, the main objective of this research was to assess
the influence of resistance training on the salivary hormone profile and IgA level in
sedentary adults with DS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Forty male adults with DS (23.7&#x000b1;3.1 years, 26.2&#x000b1;2.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited
through different community support groups for people with intellectual disabilities
(ID). They had an intelligence quotient range of 60-69 determined by the
Stanford-Binet Scale, and were diagnosed as having mild ID. Participants were
excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria:
<italic>1</italic>) atlantoaxial instability, <italic>2</italic>) congenital heart
disease, <italic>3</italic>) thyroid disease, <italic>4</italic>) toxic habits
(smoking or alcohol), <italic>5</italic>) participation in a training program in the
6 months prior to their participation in the trial to ensure that any effects could
be attributed to the current intervention, and <italic>6</italic>) not completing at
least 90% of the training sessions. Twenty-four adults were randomly assigned to the
exercising group to perform a short-term resistance training program. The control
group included 16 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched adults with DS who did not take part
in any training program.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention program</title><p>The intervention consisted of a 12-week resistance circuit-training program performed
3 days per week (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). It should be
pointed out that training sessions were scheduled in the morning, taking into
consideration that evenings and weekends are especially inactive time periods for
participants with ID (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The resistance
training was performed in a six-station circuit including arm curl, leg extension,
seated row, leg curl, triceps extension, and leg press stations. Training intensity
(load) was based on functioning in the eight-repetition maximum (8RM) test for each
exercise, given that it has been recommended for resistance training in patients with
various diagnoses (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Each training session was performed in small groups of six participants and
supervised by experienced physical therapists to ensure that participants used the
correct technique and intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Salivary evaluation</title><p>Whole saliva samples were collected after the mouth had been rinsed thoroughly with
distilled water. Saliva production was stimulated by chewing a sterile cotton swab
(Salivette; Sersted, Germany) at a frequency of 60/60 s. Saliva was separated from
the cotton by centrifugation at 2500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Collected samples
were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C and stored until analysis.</p><p>Salivary IgA levels were determined by ELISA as described previously (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Salivary levels of testosterone and cortisol
were also measured by ELISA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (DiaMetra,
Italy).</p><p>All individual outcomes were assessed first at baseline and again 72 h after the end
of the intervention. Finally, it should be pointed out that biochemical outcomes were
assessed after an overnight fast (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional assessment</title><p>Work task performance was assessed using the repetitive weighted-box-stacking test as
recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Briefly, it requires the participants to repetitively lift
10-kg boxes, from the floor to a table 75 cm above the floor. The number of boxes
stacked in 1 min was measured. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that all
participants (n=40) underwent a preliminary training session to be familiar with the
correct use of the test.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and statistics</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all parents or legal representatives. The
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Malaga (Ref. No.
10-132). Results are reported as means&#x000b1;SD. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess
whether data were normally distributed.</p><p>To compare the mean values, a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used. Finally, Cohen's
d statistics were used for determining mean effect sizes as follows: small, d&#x02265;0.2 and
&#x0003c;0.5; medium, d&#x02265;0.5 and &#x0003c;0.8; large, d&#x02265;0.8.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Resistance training improved the mucosal immunity response by increasing IgA
concentration in the exercising group (P=0.0120; d=0.94). Similarly, the testosterone
level was significantly increased (P=0.0088; d=1.57). Conversely, no significant changes
were observed in cortisol concentration after the completion of the training program
(P=0.572; d=0.12). These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>. The repetitive weighted-box-stacking test was also significantly
increased (19.1&#x000b1;3.0 <italic>vs</italic> 23.3&#x000b1;2.7 boxes/min; P=0.0141) in the exercising
group.</p><p>

</p><p>On the other hand, no significant changes in any assessed outcome were observed in those
who had not exercised. Finally, neither sport-related injuries nor dropouts were
reported during the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first study that demonstrated that resistance training improved mucosal
immunity response, by increasing salivary IgA concentration, in sedentary adults with
DS. The clinical relevance is related to the fact that Ig levels may serve as a
predictor of the susceptibility of individuals with DS to recurrent respiratory tract
infections (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A previous study found that a
12-month mixed protocol based on endurance and resistance training improved salivary IgA
levels in elderly subjects (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Similarly,
Martins et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) concluded that 16 weeks of
aerobic training significantly increased salivary IgA in older men and women. In this
regard, it should be emphasized that our exercise intervention program lasted just 12
weeks and that continued activity by participants would be desirable. The importance of
exercise as a life-long therapy should also be emphasized, given that people with DS are
at risk of a life of inactivity that can result in a multitude of medical problems
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, previous studies have reported that intensive training increased the
incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in elite athletes by decreasing salivary
IgA levels (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the current study showed that resistance training significantly increased
salivary testosterone levels, indicating a strong effect size (d=1.57). Taking into
consideration that salivary testosterone reflects the free bioavailable steroid hormone
fraction found in blood circulation, the increase reported in the current study may have
positive implications for adults with DS. This finding, coupled with no observed changes
in cortisol levels, suggested an enhanced anabolic status in participants after the
completion of the resistance training, as was recently reported by Hayes et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in sedentary aging men. In fact, Cadore et al.
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) reported that under exercise conditions,
the salivary values of cortisol (r=0.52; P=0.005) and dehydroepiandrosterone (r=0.7;
P&#x0003c;0.001) might offer a practical indicator for their serum concentrations. Similar
results were found by Baillot et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) in
obese diabetic men during submaximal exercise.</p><p>A secondary finding was that resistance training improved work task performance. This
finding was of particular interest for young adults with DS given that their workplace
activities typically emphasize physical skills such as packing boxes of confectionery or
assembling automotive parts, rather than cognitive skills (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, an improvement of muscle strength could
potentially increase the amount of activity they undertake, which may ultimately give
them the confidence to continue exercising after the trial concludes, thus reducing
their risk of the secondary health consequences of inactivity in the long term (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of the current study included the excellent adherence rate as well as the
homogeneous and large sample size. Conversely, previous studies that have focused on the
influence of regular exercise in people with ID recruited mixed (male and female) groups
in order to increase sample size with the aim of strengthening the research design. In
addition, some studies have recruited participants with ID matched for intelligence
quotient but with differing diagnoses. The presence of a control group, consisting of
age- and gender-matched controls with DS, as in this study, may reduce the recruitment
bias of healthy controls.</p><p>The present study had some limitations that should also be addressed. A major weakness
was the relatively short duration of the exercise intervention. In fact, there was no
follow-up to determine whether the positive effects induced by resistance training were
maintained. Therefore, there is a clear need for long-term studies to determine whether
the increased levels of salivary testosterone and IgA improve clinical outcomes of
individuals with DS. Also, the use of weight-lifting machines may limit the
reproducibility of this study in case the exercise equipment is not available.
Accordingly, future studies evaluating the effect of circuits that utilize body-weight
or free-weight exercises are also required to guarantee its reproducibility
elsewhere.</p><p>In conclusion, a short-term resistance training protocol improved mucosal immunity
response and salivary hormone profile in sedentary adults with DS. A secondary finding
was that it also improved work task performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>First published online March 31, 2014.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Malt</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Haugsand</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Ulvestad</surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name><name><surname>Emilsen</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Health and disease in adults with Down
