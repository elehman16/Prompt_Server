Although the pathogenesis of PBC remains incompletely understood, the accumulation of endogenous hydrophobic bile acids due to destruction of small bile ducts is thought to promote the progression of liver cell injury and finally lead to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the standard of care for PBC patients <sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> and is recommended by major guidelines.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The primary therapeutic action of hydrophilic UDCA is to replace hydrophobic bile acids, thereby attenuating cholestasis and hepatocellular injury. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a taurine conjugated form of UDCA with higher hydrophility, is the primary metabolite of UDCA.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Setchell et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported that the administration of TUDCA (500&#x02013;1,500&#x0200a;mg daily) to patients with PBC led to an enrichment of UDCA by 34% to 41%, which resulted in a greater shift toward a more hydrophilic bile acid pool. A dose&#x02013;response study indicated that TUDCA was at least as effective as UDCA for PBC, and this result was confirmed by a crossover study.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, no large-scale, randomized, clinical trial has compared the efficacy and safety of TUDCA and UDCA for PBC patients. Therefore, we performed this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these 2 agents in Chinese patients with PBC.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patient selection</title><p>Eligible patients were Chinese males or females with PBC, aged 18 to 70 years.

A centralized telecommunication-based interactive voice response system was used for patient randomization after patient eligibility was determined through clinical and laboratory screening assessments. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the TUDCA or UDCA group at a ratio of 2:1.</p><p>Patients in the TUDCA group were treated with TUDCA plus UDCA placebo at a dose of 250&#x0200a;mg 3 times daily; patients in the UDCA group were treated UDCA plus TUDCA placebo at a dose of 250&#x0200a;mg 3 times daily. The first dose was administered at the baseline visit, and the patients were followed up at weeks 4, 12, and 24. At each visit, blood biochemistry, routine hematological tests, adverse events, and concurrent medications were assessed.</p><p>This trial was conducted with approval from the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration.

One of the limitations of our study was the relatively short duration of treatment (only 24 weeks). However, a recent report by Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that biochemical response at the first sixth months of UDCA treatment had a similar predictability to that at 12 months of UDCA therapy, regarding the risk of poor outcomes such as complications of cirrhosis, liver-related death or liver transplantation. Therefore, we believe the results of our study could reflect the efficacy of longer term.</p><p>TUDCA is available on the market in these countries: Italy, Turkey, and China. As a more hydrophilic bile acid, TUDCA is a promising agent for patients with PBC,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> since endogenous hydrophobic bile acids play a major in progression of cholestatic liver injury.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Previous studies showed that during TUDCA treatment significantly decreases cheno-deoxycholate and cholate in the serum, and lithocholic acid in the duodenal bile.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> This more profound shift toward a more hydrophilic bile acid pool by administrating TUDCA may be more favorable, leading to more efficient extraction of taurine-conjugated bile acids.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Indeed, one study published recently shown that TUDCA (750&#x0200a;mg/d) is safe and more effective than UDCA (750&#x0200a;mg/d) in improving biochemical parameters in a 6-month double-blind randomized control trial for cirrhosis patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>It is also noteworthy that the same amount (750&#x0200a;mg) of TUDCA and UDCA per day is not bioequivalent because of their different molecular weight, and 500&#x0200a;mg TUDCA is approximately 375&#x0200a;mg UDCA in terms of bioequivalence. So it could be anticipated that TUDCA could be more effective than UDCA if given the same bioequivalent amount of drugs for PBC patients. It is also worth noting that 750&#x0200a;mg TUDCA and 750&#x0200a;mg UDCA are not equivalent molar amounts, since 500&#x0200a;mg TUDCA is approximately 375&#x0200a;mg UDCA in terms of bioequivalence.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Thus, patients in the TUDCA group actually received smaller molar amounts of the drug and this may partially explain why TUDCA was not superior to UDCA in this study, since it is known that low-dose (&#x0003c;10&#x0200a;mg/kg/d) UDCA does not work well in patients with PBC.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>In conclusion, our current randomized, double-blind, controlled trial confirmed that TUDCA is as effective and safe as UDCA for patients with PBC.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate the support and assistance provided by all the people who contributed to the study and this article including: Xiaojuan Ou, Yiwen Shi (Beijing Friendship hospital), Yanmin Liu (Beijing You-an Hospital), Hong Zhao (Beijing Ditan Hospital), Ping Han (302 Military Hospital), Rongbin Guo, Yunsheng Yang (301 Military Hospital), Jun Li (Peking University First Hospital), Bo Feng (Peking University People's Hospital), Gui Jia (Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University), Yimin Mao, Xiong Ma, Dekai Qiu (Shanghai Renji Hospital), Chuantao Tu (Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University), Jianming Zheng (Shanghai Huashan Hospital), Qing Guo (Shanghai Ruijin Hospital), Ling Xu (Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University), Xiaojin Wang (85th PLA Hospital), Dongxun Zhou (Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital), Guoguang Xu (Shanghai Public Health Center), Bin Zhao (The Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine), Jinhui Wang (First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University), Bingliang Lin (Sun Yat-Sen University 3rd Affiliated Hospital), Xiaolin Zhu, Yingying Zhang (Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University), Ke Ma (Wuhan Tongji Hospital), Lichun Wang (Sichuan Huaxi Hospital), Xiangqian Dong (The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University), Guoping Sheng (Zhejiang University 1st Affiliated Hospital), Chuntao Liu (Hangzhou Sixth People's Hospital), and Yanxiao Yan (Department of Biostatistics, Peking University First Hospital) who provided statistical consultation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-95-e5391-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e911" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALB = albumin, ALP = alkaline phosphatase, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AMA = antimitochondrial antibodies, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, BMI = body max index, CMH = Cochran-Mantel Haensze, FDA = American Food and Drug Administration, GGT = gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, IgG = immunoglobulin G, PBC = primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis, PTA = prothrombin time activity percentage, SAS = statistical analysis system, SCr = serum creatinine, T-Bil = total bilirubin, TUDCA = tauroursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA = ursodeoxycholic acid, ULN = upper limits of normal.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>JJ, HM, MZ, YH, HY, HT, JS, HH, LC, QX, YZ, GC, ZG, WX, JW, SW, GW, XM, XF, LD, JX, LW, GS, CC, MC, QN, and CY give substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, and were responsible for the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the data.
