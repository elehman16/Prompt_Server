Various methods have evolved for providing postoperative pain relief in pediatric patients aiming to a better quality of sleep and a prolonged duration of sedation.</p><p>The regional anesthetic techniques significantly decrease the postoperative pain and systemic analgesic requirements. Caudal route is one of the simplest and safest techniques in pediatric surgery, with a high success rate.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, the reduced cardiotoxicity and central nervous system toxicity associated with the use of levobupivacaine, the pure (S&#x02212;) enantiomer of bupivacaine, rather than bupivacaine, have been demonstrated in preclinical studies,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and many researchers have determined its potential benefits for clinical use. One of the major disadvantages of caudal analgesia is the limited duration of analgesia following single injection. To decrease postoperative analgesic requirements after single shot caudal epidural blockade, various additives, such as morphine, fentanyl, ketamine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine, with local anesthetics have been investigated.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl, a lipophilic opioid, is added frequently to local anesthetics in children, but its beneficial effects are debated. Side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, or respiratory depression, are not uncommon.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective &#x003b1;2 adrenergic agonist that has been described as a safe and effective additive in many anesthetic applications and analgesic techniques.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In contrast to other agents, it has sympatholytic, analgesic and sedative effects, and is remarkably free from side effects except for manageable hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was designed to compare the analgesic properties of caudal dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl added to levobupivacaine in pediatric patients subjected to lower limb orthopedic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted after obtaining approval of the Ethical Committee of Ain Shams University. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents before surgery. Ninety patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II, aged 1-7 years of both sex scheduled for lower limb surgeries (lower extremity lengthening, correction of lower extremity deformities) were included in this study. Clinical examination and routine investigation were done to all the patients.</p><p>Patients with known allergy to the study drugs, ASA grading 3 or above, suspected coagulopathy, infection at the site of caudal block, history of developmental delay, neurological diseases, and those whose parents did not approve inclusion in the study were excluded from the study.</p><p>On arrival to the operating theater, the standard monitors including noninvasive blood pressure, five lead electrocardiography and pulse oximetry, temperature monitor, and peripheral nerve stimulator (Infinity Kappa, Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany) were attached to the patient, and 22-24-gauge cannula was inserted into an available peripheral vein. Patients were placed in a supine position, then general anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane in oxygen/air (FiO<sub>2</sub> 50%). Cis-atracurium 0.1 mg/kg was given intravenous (IV) and intubation was done with appropriate-sized endotracheal tube and they underwent controlled mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Patients were placed in lateral decubitus position with hips flexed to 90&#x000b0;, and under all aseptic precautions, a single dose caudal block was performed with 23-gauge needle using the standard loss of resistance technique. Proper position of the needle was confirmed by the pop sensed during penetration of the sacro-coccygeal ligament, which was followed by the whoosh test[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] done using 1-3 ml of air, after needle insertion and negative aspiration of blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were randomized into three groups (30 patients each) using the sealed envelope technique (based on computer-generated random numbers) to receive a caudal block. Group L (control) received 0.75 ml/kg levobupivacaine 0.25% diluted in normal saline 0.9%. Group LD received 0.75 ml/kg levobupivacaine 0.25% with dexmedetomidine 1 &#x000b5;g/kg and Group LF received 0.75 ml/kg levobupivacaine 0.25% with fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg. Note that the doctor who did not participate in the study was aware of the children's age and weight while preparing for the drugs for the three groups.</p><p>After performing caudal block, the patient was turned to the supine position, surgical procedure started after 15 min from the caudal block, if there was an increase in heart rate (HR) or mean arterial blood pressure of more than 20% of the baseline value after skin incision, then it was considered as block failure and these patients were excluded from the study. Anesthesia was maintained using 1.5% sevoflurane in an oxygen&#x02013;air mixture (1:1 ratio), muscle relaxation was maintained by 0.02 mg/kg cis-atracurium when the first twitch in the train-of-four (T1) is recovered to 25% of its baseline height, and IV fluid volume was maintained using lactated ringer solution 4 ml/kg/h. No other narcotic, analgesic, sedative, or antiemetic was used intraoperatively. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), as well as end tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, were recorded every 5 min all through the surgery. By the end of the surgery, reversal of muscle relaxation was done by atropine 0.02 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg IV. On return of spontaneous ventilation, sevoflurane was discontinued and the endotracheal tube was removed, and the patient was shifted to the postanesthesia care unit. Duration of surgery and wake up time were recorded. All physicians, anesthetists, and surgeons, as well as patients&#x02019; parents, were blinded to the caudal medication administered. Postoperatively, the HR, MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and respiratory rate were assessed, postoperative pain was assessed by Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], requirement of rescue analgesia (ibuprofen 40 mg/kg/day in four divided doses in 24 h) was noted, and duration of analgesia (time from caudal block to time at which FLACC score was 4 or more) was recorded. FLACC score was recorded at 15 min following extubation and then every 30 min for the first 4 h and hourly thereafter till the score was 4 or more, which was considered the end point of the study, and at this point, systemic analgesics were given for analgesia.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data for the study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-423-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The categories for scoring Such as zero, one, or two points are assigned to each of the five categories shown in the table: FLACC.

Levobupivacaine, the pure S (&#x02212;)-enantiomer of bupivacaine, has strongly emerged as a safer alternative for regional anesthesia than its racemic sibling, bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine has been found to be equally efficacious as bupivacaine, but with a superior pharmacokinetic profile.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Frawley <italic>et al</italic>. compared 1 ml/kg of levobupivacaine 0.25% and bupivacaine 0.25% on 310 patients undergoing subumbilical surgery and the analgesic effects of the drugs were found to be similar during both the intraoperative and postoperative periods.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Levobupivacaine could replace bupivacaine in children for postoperative analgesia because of various studies suggests that it is less cardiotoxic than racemic bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is the most common additive to local anesthetics to caudal block, but it has undesirable side effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;2 adrenergic receptor agonist which prolongs the duration of analgesia when added to caudal levobupivacaine. In a study conducted in adult population by Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>., they have concluded that dexmedetomidine seems to be a better alternative to fentanyl as an epidural adjuvant as it provides comparable stable hemodynamics, early onset, establishment of sensory anesthesia, prolonged postoperative analgesia, lower consumption of postoperative local anesthetic for epidural analgesia, and much better sedation levels.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the absence of sufficient amount of data for caudal dexmedetomidine in children, this study was designed by using a low dose of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x000b5;g/kg). The selected caudal dose of dexmedetomidine was based on previous reports in children.</p><p>However, Anand <italic>et al</italic>. have concluded that caudal dexmedetomidine (2 &#x000b5;g/kg) with 0.25% ropivacaine (1 ml/kg) for pediatric lower abdominal surgeries achieved significant postoperative pain relief that resulted in a better quality of sleep and a prolonged duration of arousable sedation and produced less incidence of emergence agitation following sevoflurane anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the results of demographic data were comparable between the studied groups.</p><p>As regards postoperative FLACC score, duration of analgesia, and number of patients required analgesia in the first 6 h, there was a significant decrease in FLACC score and number of patients required analgesia in first 6 h in dexmedetomidine group in comparison with the other two groups.
