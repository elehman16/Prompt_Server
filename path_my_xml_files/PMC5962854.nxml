A total of 68 patients (76 eyes) with refractory glaucoma treated were randomly divided into Ex-PRESS group and AGV group. Results showed that the intraocular pressure IOP in both Ex-PRESS group and AGV group after operation was significantly decreased compared with that before operation (P&#x0003c;0.001). At 3, 6 and 9 months after operation, IOP in Ex-PRESS group was significantly lower than that in AGV group (P&#x0003c;0.05). At the end of follow-up, BCVA of patients in both groups after operation was slightly decreased compared with that before operation (P&#x0003e;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in BCVA between the two groups of patients (P&#x0003e;0.05). Moreover, the corneal endothelial cell counts of patients in both groups after operation were obviously decreased compared with those before operation (P&#x0003c;0.05). The number of anti-glaucoma drugs applied was decreased from 3.53&#x000b1;0.86 to 0.55&#x000b1;0.60 in Ex-PRESS, and from 3.24&#x000b1;0.88 to 0.89&#x000b1;0.73 in AGV group. At the end of follow-up, the number of anti-glaucoma drugs applied in Ex-PRESS group was smaller than that in AGV group (P&#x0003c;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in success rate of operation between the two groups at the end of follow-up (log-rank test; P&#x0003e;0.05). Finally, the incidence rates of postoperative complications and surgical intervention rates had no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Ex-PRESS implantation is a safe and effective treatment for refractory glaucoma, characterized by simple operation, small trauma and less pain, which has an equivalent curative effect to AGV implantation; but its control effect on IOP after operation is superior to that of AGV, and the number of anti-glaucoma drugs applied after operation is small.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ex-PRESS implant</kwd><kwd>Ahmed glaucoma valve</kwd><kwd>refractory glaucoma</kwd><kwd>curative effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently, glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease, ranking first in the world. As of 2020, more than 10 million people around the world have suffered from binocular blindness due to glaucoma. The success rate of filtering operation of refractory glaucoma is only 11&#x02013;52%, which is much lower than that of conventional glaucoma operation (70&#x02013;90%) (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Since Molteno invented the glaucoma drainage device in 1930, new progress has been made in the treatment of refractory glaucoma (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). On the basis of its drainage principle and structure, some new drainage devices have also emerged; these implantation materials have common characteristics in structure: A flexible silicone tube and an implantation material in the equatorial part of the eyeball, whose common mechanism is that the aqueous humor enters the fiber cavity formed around the implantation material from anterior chamber via silicone tube under the pressure action, and is then absorbed by blood capillaries and lymphatic vessels (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) is one of such devices, which significantly improves the success rate of refractory glaucoma operation, and has now become a recognized effective treatment method of refractory glaucoma. However, it has shortcomings of complex operation, low success rate and many postoperative complications, so AGV is always applied cautiously.</p><p>Ex-PRESS implant (Ex-PRESS) is a small, stainless steel and splitless glaucoma drainage valve, as well as one of the recently-developed minimally-invasive anti-glaucoma filtering techniques (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Ex-PRESS is placed under the scleral flap, similar to the traditional trabeculectomy, and it also avoids the removal of sclera and iris required in the trabeculectomy (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Its theoretical advantages lie in the simplicity and repeatability of operation, and reduction of eye tissue injury. In 2002, upon the approval of Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Ex-PRESS glaucoma drainage device began to be widely used in clinical practice. Ex-PRESS was introduced to China in 2012.</p><p>Since Ex-PRESS was widely used in clinical practice, many clinical studies in China and worldwide have compared the treatment effect of Ex-PRESS implantation and trabeculectomy on open-angle glaucoma (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), but there is a lack of clinical data on curative effects on secondary glaucoma, refractory glaucoma, so further clinical observation is needed. In this study, therefore, the intraocular pressure (IOP) control, success rate of operation, complications, after Ex-PRESS implantation and AGV implantation in the treatment of refractory glaucoma were observed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Ex-PRESS implantation in the treatment of refractory glaucoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>General data</title><p>A total of 68 patients (76 eyes) with refractory glaucoma treated in Zaozhuang Ophthalmologic Hospital (Zaozhuang, China) from January to December 2016 were enrolled, and they were informed of this study according to the Declaration of Helsinki and signed the informed consent. They were randomly divided into Ex-PRESS group [n=33 (38 eyes), implanted with Ex-PRESS implant] and AGV group [n=35 (38 eyes), implanted with AGV].

At 3 months after operation, IOP in Ex-PRESS group was significantly lower than that in AGV group. Moreover, the number of glaucoma drugs applied after operation in both groups was significantly reduced; the number of glaucoma drugs applied at 9 months after operation in Ex-PRESS group was obviously smaller than that in AGV group.</p><p>The reason for the better control of IOP in Ex-PRESS group may be due to the inconsistent structure of the two drainage materials. Firstly, the aqueous drainage mechanisms of the two kinds of implantation materials were different. Ex-PRESS drainage device is a valve-free casing tube, so the communication between intraocular and extraocular aqueous fluid has no obstacle; due to the fixed diameter (50 &#x000b5;m), the postoperative aqueous effluent is fixed, there is less ocular hypotension and the postoperative IOP is stable (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); AGV silicone elastic valve is a one-way pressure-sensitive valve that can provide the resistance to the outflow of aqueous fluid to prevent the excessive drainage of anterior aqueous fluid before the capsule is formed on the surface of the drainage disk, and it can only open when IOP reaches or exceeds the preset value of 8&#x02013;10 mmHg, and close when IOP is &#x0003c;8 mmHg to prevent the outflow of aqueous fluid (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Such a pressure structure results in higher IOP after AGV implantation. Secondly, the drainage capsule and fiber proliferation were different after the two types of implantation. The study of Bae <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) showed that the filtering bleb fibrous layer in AGV group was significantly thickened compared with trabeculectomy. Similar to trabeculectomy, the aqueous fluid outflow pathway in Ex-PRESS group comes from the sclera, and the intraoperative application of MMC can effectively reduce the fiber proliferation between and around the sclera, so that the filtering bleb fiber proliferation is significantly reduced. As posterior filtration in AGV, AGV was placed under the conjunctival flap and Tenon's capsule to drain the anterior aqueous fluid to the rear of Tenon's capsule; the limited capsule around the drainage valve can significantly reduce the outflow of aqueous fluid. Susanna <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) studied and also showed that the application of MMC in AGV implantation does not significantly improve the success rate of operation. Overall, compared with AGV, Ex-PRESS aqueous fluid drainage mechanism and postoperative filtration channel formation mechanism are more conducive to the IOP control.</p><p>Many studies have shown that the success rate of Ex-PRESS implantation is similar to that of trabeculectomy, but the postoperative complications are significantly reduced compared with trabeculectomy (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The 1-year success rate of Ex-PRESS implantation in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma is more than 80%. As far as we know, there are still few clinical reports on Ex-PRESS implantation in the treatment of refractory glaucoma (<xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, after Ex-PRESS and AGV implantation for refractory glaucoma, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the relative and complete success rates of operation at the end of follow-up between Ex-PRESS group and AGV group; the success rate of AGV implantation was consistent with that in previous studies (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b21-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), but that of Ex-PRESS implantation was lower than that in previous studies (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5977" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This is mainly because of the different types of glaucoma. This study mainly aimed at the refractory glaucoma. It still can be seen from the previous and this study that Ex-PRESS implantation and AGV implantation are undoubtedly effective treatment methods for refractory glaucoma, compared with the drug and laser therapy, although the success rate of operation is decreased over time. This study showed no statistically significant differences in incidence rates of postoperative complications and surgical intervention rates between the two groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study suggested that Ex-PRESS implantation is a safe and effective treatment method of refractory glaucoma, characterized by simple operation, small trauma and small volume of implantation materials, so it is easier to be popularized and applied clinically. However, this study had some limitations. First of all, Ex-PRESS has been applied in China for a short time, so only a small number of cases were included in this study; secondly, there was a certain bias. In order to minimize the bias, a detailed comparative analysis was performed for the homogeneity of patients' general conditions before data statistics, and patients were followed up for at least 9 months, so that the short-term effect of Ex-PRESS implantation could be described and analyzed more reliably. The long-term curative effect of Ex-PRESS implantation on refractory glaucoma remains to be further demonstrated via further large-sample multi-center randomized controlled clinical research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WB designed the study, DD collected data, FS analysed the data, WB and FS prepared the manuscript.
