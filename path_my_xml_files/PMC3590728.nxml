Bone grafts, their synthetic substitutes, and GTR techniques have been used in an attempt to gain this therapeutic endpoint. The present study was designed to compare the combined effect of BG+GTR (test group) with OFD (control group) in the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects.</p><p>A clinically and statistically significant improvement in PPD reduction, CAL gain, and radiographic defect fill was observed in both test and control groups at 6 month postoperatively compared to baseline, which favored the test group.</p><p>In the control group, the mean reduction of PPD was 3.22&#x000b1;1.09 mm and CAL gain was 2.77&#x000b1;1.09 mm at 6 months follow-up visit. In a study by Kilic <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] OFD group showed the mean PPD reduction of 3.17 mm, which was in accordance to the results of the present study and CAL gain of 2.1 mm which was slightly lower than the present study. The difference in results of OFD group might be influenced by surgical technique, baseline defect characteristics, and operator skill.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The reduction in PPD was slightly higher and the CAL gain was in agreement with the previous reported study by Kasaj <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] that evaluated the clinical efficacy of NcHA paste in intrabony defects and reported PPD reduction of 3.9&#x000b1;1.2 mm and CAL gain of 3.6&#x000b1;1.6 mm. This slightly higher PPD reduction may be due to the effect of combination technique (BG+GTR) used in the present study. Kilic <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]demonstrated that the combination of HA collagen bone graft with ePTFE membrane resulted in higher PPD reduction (5.85 mm) and greater CAL gain (3.80 mm) compared with the test group results of our study. The higher reduction of PPD might be explained by the higher gingival recession in the above study (2.00 mm) compared to 0.55 mm in the present study.</p><p>It was suggested that intrabony defect configuration influences the results after GTR and larger amounts of CAL gain were reported in deep three-wall defects than two- or one-wall defects following GTR treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] A systematic review[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] concluded that in two-wall intrabony defect models of periodontal regeneration, the additional use of a grafting material gave superior histological results of bone repair to barrier membranes alone. In the present study, configuration of defects treated were 2 and 2&#x000bd;-walled, which may have benefited from the combination technique.</p><p>Pocket depth reduction, even though not necessarily a result attributed to regeneration, is a major player in decision making in routine periodontal patient care scenarios. Initial pocket depth in the defects treated with BG+GTR in the present study were more than 7 mm, and were reduced to value just slightly above 3 mm depth accepted as manageable by current patient care standard.</p><p>Intergroup comparison of the results at 6 month showed that there was an additional 1.11 mm PPD reduction and 1.00 mm CAL gain in the test group. Trombelli[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]concluded that additional effect of the combination treatment (GTR + BG) is similar to GTR alone when compared to OFD alone with respect to attachment gain, but results in slightly more PPD reduction and greater gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery.</p><p>The combined group showed a significantly greater CAL gain, lesser alveolar crest reduction, and greater vertical bone gain compared with the GTR alone group. In fact, collagen membranes are characterized by a lack of stiffness when they are dampened by biological fluids. The presence of a physical support under such a material allows the membrane to maintain its position when the flaps are sutured over the defect, exerting pressure onto the membrane itself. It should, however, be pointed out that in the present study the collagen membrane was not fixed by means of bioresorbable sutures or pins. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the membrane was displaced during flap suturing or the healing process and may have acted only for stabilization of the graft particles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Periodontal therapies are usually associated with gingival recession which is of esthetic concern for both patients and clinicians. Regenerative therapy potentially could help to overcome this unwanted side effect. Hence, it is important to assess the amount of REC. The REC in the present study showed no statistically significant difference between the test and control sites at baseline and at six months. The increase in REC in present study was lower in both test and control groups compared to the previously reported similar study by Sculean <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The ability of a probe to penetrate into a pocket is related to several factors including probing force and gingival tissue condition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] When evaluating results of periodontal regenerative therapy results should be interpreted carefully. Camargo <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] stated that the improvement in clinical parameter can result in gain in attachment; however, it should be remembered that placement of graft material into the defect may modify gingival tissue consistency and therefore interfere with the penetration of periodontal probe without necessarily having induced any gain in CAL.</p><p>Hence, bone fill data derived from surgical re-entry is important to substantiate routine post-operative measurements due to the above mentioned reason. However, it has certain inherent disadvantages like inducing further resorption at the treated site and inability to ascertain the exact histological nature of the hard tissue. The second surgical procedure is also time consuming and may interrupt the regenerative process if healing is still ongoing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Zybutz <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]concluded that standardized radiographs reliably and permanently describe the hard tissue changes and thus can serve as substitute for probing to bone or re-entry measurements of bone changes.</p><p>In the present study, a change of the alveolar bone level was detected radiographically using consecutive pre- and post-operative radiographs. Projection geometry of consecutive radiographs should be standardized to minimize measurement errors. Prefabricated film holders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] may provide projection standardization to a certain degree. In the present study, linear measurement from the crest to the base of the intrabony defect was measured using the &#x0201c;J image&#x0201d; software, which can overcome errors in the linear measurement to a certain degree than manual measurements.</p><p>In the present study, the radiographic defect depth gain was 2.07&#x000b1;0.67 mm, which represents radiographic defect depth fill of 47 % at six months in test group. Kilic <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] reported 1.55 mm gain of radiographic defect depth in test group, which was slightly lower than the present study. Several reports indicate that the bone fill is enhanced by the addition of a graft material to GTR procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Present study demonstrated additional 1.16 mm (22%) radiographic defect depth fill in the test group compared with the control group over six month period, although complete regeneration was not achieved.</p><p>Wenzel <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] reported no increased bone fill between 6 and 12 months may support the six month radiographic analysis of the present study. Question arises whether the radiographically assessed increase in the defect fill in the test group could represent the new bone formation or the presence of residual graft material or both, although NcHA was reported to be resorbable.</p><p>The present study demonstrated statistically significant but slight clinical improvement in CAL gain (1.00 mm) in the test group compared with OFD. Radiographic defect fill was more in favor of the test group. The most reliable outcome variable for assessing periodontal regeneration is histological analysis; however, due to ethical consideration and patient management limitation, no histological evidence was obtained to establish proof of periodontal regeneration in present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Combined use of NcHA bone graft with collagen membrane resulted in clinically and statistically significant PPD reduction, CAL gain and bone fill percentage, compared to OFD alone, in periodontal intrabony defects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The author would like to thank Manipal University, Manipal for partial financial support for this study.
