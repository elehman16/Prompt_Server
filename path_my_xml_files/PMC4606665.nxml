Discoloration of anterior teeth is an esthetic problem that requires effective treatment. Vital bleaching is a viable option to consider when treating intrinsically stained or discolored teeth whose form and integrity are deemed acceptable. Carbamide peroxide introduced by Haywood and Heyman[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] was most widely used for tooth whitening (bleaching) both in professional and in self-administered products.</p><p>Though the decrease in discoloration has been satisfactory with the application of bleaching agents, there were also adverse effects as the consequence of this treatment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Prominent side effects of concern included pulpal sensitivity,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] surface compositional changes,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] mineral loss from the tooth structure[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and decreased hardness of the enamel.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The decrease in the micro-hardness number has a linear relationship with the mineral loss under the conditions of demineralization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>To overcome this loss of minerals and subsequent micro-hardness remineralizing solutions are recommended.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) is a derivative of milk protein casein found in cow's milk. CPP-ACP is produced from a tryptic digest of milk protein casein by aggregation with calcium phosphate and purification by ultra-filtration. The casein phosphopeptide (CPP), by stabilizing calcium phosphate in solutions maintains high concentration gradients of calcium and phosphate ions and ion pairs into the demineralized lesion[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and thus affects high rates of enamel remineralization when compared to other calcium phosphate remineralization solutions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The more the concentration of the bleaching gel the more the adverse effects were reported.

Introduction of night guard vital bleaching has rekindled a resurgence of interest in tooth bleaching. Bleaching is a decolorization or whitening process that can occur in a solution or on the surface. The color producing materials are typically organic compounds that possess extended conjugated chains of alternating single or double bonds and often include hetero atoms, carbonyl, and phenyl rings in the conjugated system and are often referred to as chromophore. Bleaching or decolorization of the chromophore can occur by destroying one or more of the double bonds in the conjugated chain or by oxidation of other chemical moieties in the conjugated chains.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Carbamide peroxide is an adduct of urea and hydrogen peroxide which on contact with water breaks down to urea and hydrogen peroxide. The chemistry of this agent is based primarily on its ability to generate free radicals in most solvents. The hydroxyl radicals lack one electron, are extremely electrophilic and unstable and will attack most other organic molecules to achieve stability generating other radicals.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hydrogen peroxide bleaching can proceed via the perhydroxyl anion or free radicals depending on pH. As the peroxide diffuses into the tooth, it can react with organic color materials found within the tooth structure leading to a reduction in color. These oxidation reactions can cause alterations in the enamel structure,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] calcium and phosphate mineral loss,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and pulpal sensitivity. The results of these studies which are in accordance with the studies done by Majeed <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Flaitz and Hicks[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed clearly that the application of carbamide peroxide bleaching gel lowered the micro-hardness of the enamel and also showed the changes in enamel are directly proportional to concentration of bleaching agent which are in similar to the studies done by Hegedus <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The results are in contrast with the study of Basting <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The oral environment can naturally rebuild enamel through a process called as remineralization, to some extent on its own, but the extent of remineralization is controlled by pH and the amount and availability of calcium and phosphate ions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The minimum thermodynamic requirement for remineralization to occur is simply that the ion activity product is greater than the solubility product constant for tooth mineral. Solubility constraints limit the level of supersaturation and forms calcium phosphate mineral, therefore, limit mineral ion concentration in remineralizing solutions to a relatively low level.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A considerably large volume of remineralizing solution is required to supply the needed mineral ions, suggesting that remineralization <italic>in vivo</italic> is a relatively slow kinetic reaction.</p><p>Casein phosphopeptides are multi phosphorylated from an enzymatic digest of the bovine milk protein casein. These peptides have remarkable ability to stabilize the calcium phosphate in solution as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), through their multi phosphoryl residues CPP bind to forming nanoclusters of ACP in metastable solution, preventing their growth to critical size required for nucleation and phase transformation. CPP-ACP nanoclusters have shown to localize at the tooth surface, which buffers free calcium and phosphate ion activities by helping to maintain a state of supersaturation with respect to tooth enamel depressing demineralization and enhancing remineralization.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The results of this study showed that there was a definitive increase in microhardness when compared to the postbleach hardness even after the specimens are maintained in artificial saliva. At normal oral pH and temperature, the addition of ACP components to the salivary system can cause the hydrolysis of ACP into apatite within a few minutes, which is roughly 20,000 times faster than normal.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The susceptibility of bleached enamel to caries is still a topic of study, but precautions should be taken as remineralization is a slow process <italic>in vivo</italic>. This study result recommends the application of CPP-ACP for remineralization after bleaching.</p><p>The advanced whitening technologies containing CPP-ACP as component are marketed, but the efficacy of the agents has to be determined. Milk protein casein can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, so judicial use of this material is recommended keeping this matter of concern in view.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Higher concentrations of carbamide peroxide bleaching gels had a definite effect of reducing the surface micro-hardness of sound enamel to significant levels. Decrease in micro-hardness was directly proportional to the peroxide concentration. CPP-ACP application enhanced remineralization of bleached enamel. The enhancing potential of CPP-ACP is in direct correlation with a degree of demineralization of enamel. The importance of bleaching as a conservative treatment option for the discolored teeth when compared to veneers and laminates cannot be undervalued, but must be used with caution and postbleaching regimen with CPP-ACP are worth consideration. Further research for the better remineralizing material should be done as the micro-harness values had not reached the baseline values.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and
