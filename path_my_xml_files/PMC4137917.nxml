Sedation was achieved with intravenous midazolam (3&#x02013;10 mg) and fentanyl (25&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g). Lignocaine (4%) was used for topical anesthesia above the vocal cords and lignocaine (2%) was used to anesthetize the airways below the cords, in 2 mL aliquots as required, up to a maximum of 6 mL. Subjects were monitored by pulse oximetry throughout the procedure and oxygen was administered routinely. Eight biopsies from secondary carinae of segmental and subsegmental bronchi in the right lower lobe were obtained. There were no complications from the procedures.

Endogenous peroxidase blocking was done with 3% hydrogen peroxide in Milli-RO water (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 15 minutes at 20&#x000b0;C to eliminate nonspecific staining, but no serum block was necessary.

Expression of PAFr was assessed on randomized and coded slides by an operator blinded to smoking and clinical status, and was expressed as the percentage of epithelium with PAFr expression.

To avoid multiple comparisons as much as possible, cross-sectional COPD groups were compared independently with the NLFS group and the results are presented as scatter plots. In the COPD groups, we performed regression analysis for PAFr expression against age, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and smoking history. For multiple comparisons (two COPD groups versus a single NLFS group), a Bonferroni correction was made (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>For the longitudinal study, data were log-transformed because of skewness and the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for within group comparisons.

There was negligible PAFr staining in normal controls. These staining patterns are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-9-853">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Image analysis confirmed that there was no difference in PAFr expression between the COPD-smokers and COPD-ex-smokers study groups (nonsignificant <italic>P</italic>-value), but the difference between the NLFS group and the COPD groups (median 0.0%, range 0%&#x02013;4.9%), was significant (ie, COPD-smokers [<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005; median 1.03%, range 0%&#x02013;21.8%], COPD-ex-smokers [<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.002; median 3.6%, range 0%&#x02013;15.5%]). The NLFS group also showed significantly higher PAFr when compared to normal controls (median 0.0%, range 0%&#x02013;0%). PAFr expression in the ICS-treated group was very similar to the other COPD groups, so no formal statistical testing was done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-copd-9-853">Figure 3</xref>). In the NLFS group, only seven of the 16 epithelia stained detectably, while, in the two COPD groups combined, 24 had detectable staining out of 27 (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); five samples from the COPD groups (two out of 17 COPD-smokers and three out of 15 COPD-ex-smokers) did not have enough tissue for analysis.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PAFr expression in the placebo-controlled ICS intervention study</title><p>There was considerable variation in PAFr expression within the COPD groups both before and after the treatment phase. The median percent epithelial expression rose in both the groups, by approximately threefold in the ICS limb (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.15) but also by approximately twofold in the placebo group over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-9-853">Figure 4</xref>). Although the final median level in the ICS groups was greater than in the placebo group, this was neither significant nor were the changes in expression over this time between the groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.4). It is possible, because of the small number of paired tissues that were available to us, that we saw a type-2 statistical error; thus, a power calculation using nontransformed data was undertaken for a potential real increase in epithelial PAFr expression with ICS, which indicated that, for these estimates of effect size, a bronchoscopic study of over 200 subjects per group would be needed to show a significant positive effect of ICS on PAFr expression.</p><p>The regression analyses showed that age and FEV<sub>1</sub> had no significant effects on PAFr expression (<italic>r</italic>=0.23 and 0.11, respectively). However, for pack-years of smoking in the COPD-ex-smokers group, there was quite a strong relationship (<italic>r</italic>=0.56; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but this was not seen in the COPD-smokers subjects (<italic>r</italic>=0.09; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.81).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we found that in vivo expression of PAFr is significantly upregulated in COPD patients as compared to NLFS. Expression in COPD-smokers and -ex-smokers was similar but quite variable in both groups. This might suggest that smoking cessation may be ineffective in downregulation of PAFr once COPD has developed. Alternatively, it is possible that especially high expression of PAFr in some smokers is both a risk factor for COPD development in the first place, and its progression, even after smoking has ceased.</p><p>Overall, our data on the effects of ICS are negative, with at the very most only modest evidence that ICS upregulate PAFr expression &#x02013; though they certainly do not decrease it &#x02013; over 6 months, as suggested in earlier in vitro and animal models.<xref rid="b27-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The present study may also have been relatively short to demonstrate an effect of ICS on PAFr expression, which could potentially elevate risk of pneumococcal disease in COPD patients. The incidence of pneumonia in patients on ICS escalates over years rather than weeks or months.<xref rid="b17-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is also possible that the effects of ICS could be more marked in peripheral airways or lung parenchymal epithelium where the clinical problem occurs, while our biopsies were taken only from relatively central airways. Pneumonia occurs at a rate of approximately 1% per year in severe COPD patients on ICS,<xref rid="b28-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and it is not known whether there is some aberrant change in this small group of individuals or if some generic change occurs on ICS that manifests clinically only in a small percentage. This issue needs further work.</p><p>The relationship between cigarette smoking and infection/colonization with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic> has been well documented, and exposure to tobacco smoke is considered as a major risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease.<xref rid="b29-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Persistence of chronic inflammation and continuous deterioration of lung function following smoking cessation may be attributed to chronic colonization and invasion of lung tissue by respiratory bacterial pathogens, again most commonly <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>.<xref rid="b30-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Bacterial adherence to lung epithelium and subsequent tissue invasion is thought to be a crucial step in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections. The major respiratory bacterial pathogens are equipped with the surface ligand known as ChoP, which is capable of binding to epithelial PAFr. Especially virulent strains of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> have been shown to adhere to its bacterial cell surface ChoP more firmly with epithelial surface PAFr.<xref rid="b19-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We suggest that our data on PAFr expression in the airway epithelium in COPD may be relevant to this as, out of an estimated 10<sup>9</sup> different bacterial species,<xref rid="b31-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> it is <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic> especially (and also <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which is more relevant in cystic fibrosis) that express the ChoP ligand.</p><p>In a collaborative study with Grigg et al,<xref rid="b18-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> we recently described significant increases in PAFr-dependent pneumococcal adhesion, PAFr transcript level, and PAFr protein expression in epithelial cell cultures exposed to cigarette smoke extract. Moreover, a specific PAFr antagonist attenuated pneumococcal adhesion. In the same study, we showed enhanced airway epithelial PAFr expression in smokers&#x02019; airways for the first time. The present study takes this observation further and confirms much greater upregulation of PAFr expression in the COPD groups than in NLFS. In contrast, Suri et al<xref rid="b32-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> reported no difference in PAFr messenger RNA transcript levels between NLFS and COPD-smokers. However, they did not quantify the PAFr immunoreactivity on bronchial biopsies, and, ultimately, it is protein expression on the epithelial surface that will matter functionally.<xref rid="b32-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Moreover, the micrograph provided by Suri et al<xref rid="b32-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> seemed to have more PAFr expression in their normal controls than we have found, but the most staining did appear to be in COPD, consistent with our finding. We now need ex vivo epithelial cultures from these patients to see if, functionally, there is greater bacterial adhesion in COPD airways in the group with the greatest PAFr expression.</p><p>The regression analysis in the two cross-sectional COPD groups produced interesting outcomes. There was no relationship between either age or severity of airflow obstruction and PAFr-expression, but pack-years of smoking was strongly related, at least in COPD-ex-smokers. The lack of this relationship in current smokers suggests that this long-term effect was confounded by the effect of current smoking. Thus, both current smoking and history of smoking seem important, but, since only a minority of smokers develop COPD, there must also be an additional individual susceptibility effect.</p><p>The role that ICS can play in COPD has been extensively studied in the recent past, and ICS are especially effective at reducing exacerbation rates.<xref rid="b14-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Other described benefits are more tentative, such as reduction in rate of decline in lung function, decreased cancer rates,<xref rid="b33-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and decreased mortality.<xref rid="b14-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, a paradoxical effect is that ICS therapy also increases the risk of lower respiratory bacterial infections, especially with <italic>S. pneumonia</italic>,<xref rid="b14-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> an effect that worsens over time.<xref rid="b17-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> An association between ICS and increased risk of hospitalizations due to pneumonia in elderly COPD patients with a high mortality rate, has also been reported.<xref rid="b15-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Animal models also demonstrate a similar effect of elevated risk of pneumonia with administration of ICS.<xref rid="b35-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>On the basis of our current data, we cannot say that this increased infective risk of ICS is related to enhanced expression of respiratory epithelial PAFr, but it remains a possibility. A much larger clinical study would be needed to determine this, but such a large bronchoscopic investigation is rather unlikely to occur. A better approach may be to see if corticosteroids have any effect on human primary epithelial cell cultures in this regard. It is notable that PAFr expression seemed to increase in both ICS- and placebo-treated COPD subjects over 6 months. Patients are recruited into such studies when they are especially well and free from infection, and this apparently spontaneous change may be a regression back to their more usual status of increased vulnerability.</p><p>There were several limiting issues in the study, especially the small numbers of samples available in the ICS intervention study. Furthermore, only large airways were studied, but we are in the process of extending this work to small airway samples and alveolar epithelium obtained at lung resection. Strengths of the present investigation include fairly robust numbers in our cross-sectional study that followed on from the smoking effect we published previously with this tissue bank. The data for the NLFS were obtained de novo and by a separate operator, but are very similar to that published earlier.<xref rid="b18-copd-9-853" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, airway epithelial PAFr expression is significantly upregulated in smokers, but is especially marked in COPD subjects, whether current smokers or not. The significance of this in the pathogenesis and evolution of COPD needs further study, but could be very important in the etiology of chronic and invasive infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>. Whether the increased expression of PAFr is a contributing cause of COPD, or a result of it, needs further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding source: National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia (Grant No 490023).
