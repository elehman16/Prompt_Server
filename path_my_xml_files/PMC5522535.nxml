Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing influenza. In this study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of an avian H5N2 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV H5N2) in healthy Thai adults and its priming immune responses with an H5N1 inactivated vaccine boost.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was done at the Vaccine Trial Centre at Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and was divided into two parts. Part 1 consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done over 18 months. We randomly assigned (2:1) healthy Thai adults aged 18&#x02013;49 years with a computer generated randomisation sequence (blocks of six) to receive either two intranasal doses (0&#x000b7;25 mL per nostril) of LAIV H5N2 (101 participants) or placebo (51 participants) 21 days apart. For part 2, an open-label trial was done in which previously vaccinated participants (40 from LAIV H5N2 group and 20 placebo) were given one intramuscular dose (0&#x000b7;5 mL) of H5N1 booster vaccine. Participants, investigators, and site-study workers were blinded from randomisation. Immune responses after subsequent immunisation were evaluated using haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation assays and circulating follicular T-helper cells and plasmablast cells were measured in serum and whole blood.

LAIV H5N2 vaccine was well tolerated. Viral shedding was detected in only six (6%) of 101 participants in the vaccine group 1 day after the first vaccination and in and two (2%) of 98 participants in the group after the second vaccination. There was no serious adverse event in both groups. 51 (50%) of 101 participants in the vaccine group and 28 (55%) of 51 in the placebo group reported at least one adverse event. 80 (84%) of 95 events in the vaccine group and 32 (78%) of 43 events in the placebo groups were reportedly suspected adverse events, probably related to the vaccine; however, most were mild in nature. After two doses of vaccine, 13 (13%) of 100 participants in the vaccine group had an increase in haemagglutination-inhibition titre of more than four-fold and four (4%) of 100 vaccinees developed a rise in neutralisng antibody titre of more than four-fold. 1 year later, after a booster with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine (part 2), 39 (98%) of 40 participants who had previously been vaccinated with LAIV H5N2 had an increase in haemagglutination-inhibition titre of greater than four-fold as early as day 7 compared with three (15%) of 20 participants in the placebo group. Peak geometric mean titre (GMT) for haemagglutination-inhibition antibodies in the previously LAIV H5N2 vaccinated group (566&#x000b7;89 [95% CI 436&#x000b7;97&#x02013;735&#x000b7;44]) were significantly higher than among those who previously received placebo (25&#x000b7;49 [11&#x000b7;82&#x02013;54&#x000b7;96]; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). The peak GMT by neutralising antibody assay in the H5N2 vaccinated group (1395&#x000b7;85 [1040&#x000b7;79&#x02013;1872&#x000b7;03]) was also significantly higher than that observed in the placebo group (17&#x000b7;41 [9&#x000b7;05&#x02013;33&#x000b7;48]; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Importantly, higher cross-reactive haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres against H5N1 (clades 1, 2.1.3.2, and 2.3.4) were detected in the LAIV H5N2 experienced group than the naive group (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our data suggest that LAIV vaccination induces long-lasting memory immune responses. The limitation of this study was that part 2 was designed as a proof-of-concept study by contrast with part 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>WHO.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>We searched PubMed for articles published in English before Sept 14, 2016, with the search terms &#x0201c;H5 vaccine candidates and LAIV&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;clinical trials and H5 vaccine&#x0201d;. Our search found a very limited number of studies on LAIV H5 viruses. Because this study was focused on the safety and immunogenicity of LAIV H5N2 influenza vaccine, we included only those studies similar to our work using live attenuated H5 vaccine candidates. Immunogenicity of an LAIV H5N2 vaccine candidate has been determined in several studies; however, only two studies investigated immunological priming effects of H5 LAIV vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidates were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in the adult population, and long-lasting immune memory responses with cross-reactivity were also observed.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>To our knowledge, no such priming and boosting strategy has been done in countries where the H5 virus is potentially circulating, such as Thailand. We showed a strong immune response to both H5N2 and H5N1 avian influenza viruses when participants were vaccinated with two doses of LAIV H5N2 vaccine candidate followed by boosting with H5N1 inactivated vaccine. Although two doses of LAIV H5N2 vaccine were poorly immunogenic as measured by haemagglutination-inhibition assay, the priming effect of LAIV H5N2 was unmasked by boosting with H5N1 inactivated vaccine. High titre of antibodies and broadly reactive and rapid antibody responses after boosting vaccination with inactivated H5N1 vaccine were detected in most previously received LAIV H5N2 participants. LAIV induced long-lasting memory responses.</p><p><bold>Implications of the available evidence</bold></p><p>Our vaccination strategy could be used to prime a population during the early pandemic period, after which a booster dose could be given during an epidemic, if needed. However, further investigation into the effectiveness of this strategy is needed when it is used in the field.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Avian influenza viruses are spreading rapidly in bird populations. Some highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses can cause severe respiratory disease and death in human beings.

In response to this potential threat, several H5N1 vaccine candidates have been prepared and evaluated in animal models and clinical trials. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) generally induce moderate antibody responses. However, the poor immunogenicity of the haemagglutinin proteins of HPAI H5N1 viruses has posed challenges for H5 LAIV development. For example, a subvirion vaccine derived from low pathogenicity influenza A/duck/Singapore/97 virus H5N3 (which is antigenically related to the HPAI H5N1 virus that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997) was not immunogenic in human beings in a phase 1 trial.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In 2006, a monovalent A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 subunit vaccine was well tolerated, but only modestly immunogenic, in a phase 1 clinical trial.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A candidate H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 LAIV, based on the A/Ann Abor/6/60 master donor virus, was developed in the USA.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The vaccine highly restricted replication in human beings and induced only low-titre haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralising serum antibody responses, even after two doses given by nasal spray.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> An H5N2 LAIV was developed in Russia using the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 master donor virus, and the haemagglutinin was derived from A/duck/Potsdam/1402&#x02013;6-86 H5N2.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The same vaccine was evaluated in small phase 1&#x02013;2 clinical trials<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> in Russia: two doses of the vaccine induced seroresponses (four-fold or greater rise in titre) to the homologous virus in 47&#x02013;55% of participants. Evidence of cross-reactive antibodies against A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 was also observed in 29&#x02013;31% of participants. Phase 1 trials of an A/turkey/Turkey/05/133 H5N2 vaccine candidate in Russia showed that the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and elicited modest immunogenicity in healthy adults.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>The immunogenicity of H5 traditional inactivated vaccines and LAIVs is not robust as measured by haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation assays.

In part 1, we evaluated immune responses and safety of LAIV H5N2 candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133. In part 2, we compared the immunogenicity of the inactivated H5 influenza vaccine single dose among study participants who in part 1 were vaccinated with LAIV H5N2 versus naive participants (previously received placebo). The main hypothesis for part 2 was that the administration of LAIV H5N2 would prime the immune system for an efficient memory response to an inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Part 1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and reactogenicity of an H5N2 LAIV. We assessed the seroconversion rate postvaccination based on serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies and neutralising antibodies. This study was done at the Vaccine Trial Centre, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, which is a 30-bed isolation ward with self-contained air conditioning and drainage system. For part 2, 60 participants were give one dose of inactivated H5N1 vaccine in a non-randomised open-label study to compare the immune responses between those previously vaccinated with LAIV H5N2 and placebo groups. Participants were healthy Thai men and women aged 18&#x02013;49 years with an antibody titre to specific H5 influenza virus of less than 1/40 by haemagglutination inhibition. Characteristics of participants were similar to those reported previously.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women, and women who planned to become pregnant within 60 days of enrolment were excluded from the study.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics review committees of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University and of WHO. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study-related activities.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>For part 1, study participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the vaccination group or the placebo group. The randomisation list was generated by an independent statistician as a block of six. The randomisation was kept in a secured safe box at the centre for data management and analysis. Only designated people were authorised to access the randomisation codes. However, complete randomisation blocks of treatment materials were sent only to the manufacturer for study vaccine preparation and distribution to study sites. All other study investigators as well as the volunteers were be blinded to the randomised codes. The emergency unblinding process could be done only when there was a special request for ethical and emergency clinical concerns by the sponsor or ethical committee or the data safety monitoring board. For part 2, all participants who were contactable throughout the study were given boosting vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>For part 1, participants were given two doses of candidate LAIV strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 H5N2 or placebo by the intranasal route, the first dose on day 1 and the second on day 28. All participants were kept in an isolation ward for 5 days after each immunisation to assess safety and were discharged only after a negative nasal swab culture. Participants who had a positive nasal swab on day 3 by PCR were given oseltamivir (150 mg twice per day for 5 days). All participants were closely monitored for any adverse reactions by a qualified physician and nurses.</p><p>The follow-up period was 60 days. We collected blood on days 1 and 28, before each immunisation, and on days 49 and 60, to measure immune responses by haemagglutination inhibition, microneutralisation, and serum IgG and IgA ELISA. We did routine laboratory safety investigations on days 28 and 49. We took nasal swabs on days 2, 3, and 5 to assess viral shedding by RT-PCR and virus isolation in chicken embryonated eggs using the WHO protocol.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>In part 2 of the study, after 1 year, 60 participants were contacted serially according to the study number previously allocated (40 participants from the LAIV H5N2 vaccinated group and 20 from the placebo group) and were given a single 0&#x000b7;5 mL intramuscular dose of an inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine on day 1. Participants were given a diary card to record any reactogenicity and adverse events at home for 3 days. We collected blood specimens before immunisation on day 1, and on days 7, 28, and 90 to test for haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titre, neutralising antibody titre, circulating follicular T-helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>), and plasmablasts.</p><p>The study vaccine for part 1 was a live attenuated influenza H5N2 vaccine candidate strain, A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133. The vaccine strain was produced using classic genetic reassortment in chicken embryos. The donor strain was A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2, which has cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive properties. The candidate strain contained haemagglutinin from A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 H5N1. The cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated vaccine candidate strain was prepared at the Institute of Experimental Medicine (St Petersburg, Russia)<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and was manufactured by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (Thailand). The liquid formulation of H5N2, at 7&#x000b7;5&#x02013;8&#x000b7;5 log 50% embryo infectious dose (EID<sub>50</sub>) per 0&#x000b7;5 mL dose, was administered intranasally at 0&#x000b7;25 mL per nostril, using a sterile syringe and nozzle sprayer. The formulation contained 6&#x000b7;8% sucrose, 1% porcine hydrolysed gelatin, 1&#x000b7;2% arginine, 0&#x000b7;1% glutamate, 1&#x000b7;1% dipotassium phosphate, and 0&#x000b7;5% monopotassium phosphate. The vaccine was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;5&#x000b0;C). The placebo consisted of the above composition without the vaccine virus with the same volume and procedure. Two doses of vaccine were given 28 days apart.</p><p>The booster vaccine was OrniFlu, an inactivated subunit adsorbed influenza vaccine (Federal State Scientific-Industrial Company Microgen for Immunobiological Medicines, Ministry of Health, Russia) obtained from purified H5N1 vaccine seed strain containing <italic>HA</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> genes of the influenza virus A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 H5N1 (NIBGR-23) and <italic>PA, PB1, PB2, NP, M</italic>, and <italic>NS</italic> genes from the A/PR/8/34 strain. The vaccine contains haemagglutinin and neuraminidase isolated from purified virions of type A avian influenza virus with serotype H5N1, grown in chicken embryos and adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and thiomersal as stabilising agent. The vaccine was stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C.</p><p>We extracted viral RNA from nasal swabs. We did RT-PCR assays with primers targeting the <italic>M</italic> gene of the virus to detect LAIV H5N2 virus. We also tested the swabs by inoculation in 10&#x02013;11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. We sequenced the virus obtained from inoculated embryonated chicken eggs to detect viral mutation by sequence analysis.</p><p>We treated serum samples with receptor-destroying enzyme and did two-fold serial dilutions in 96-well plates, starting at a dilution of one in ten. We added phosphate-buffered saline alone or virus in the absence of antibody to control wells. The virus and serum were incubated together at room temperature for 30 min, and 50 &#x003bc;L of 0&#x000b7;5% (v/v) horse erythrocytes added. The antibody, virus, and erythrocytes were gently mixed, and the results recorded after incubation for 45&#x02013;60 min at room temperature. Haemagglutination-inhibition titres were recorded as the inverse of the highest antibody dilution that inhibited haemagglutination. The viruses used in this assay were A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 H5N2, clade 2.2.1, rg-H5N1-KAN-1, which contained haemagglutinin and neuraminidase of A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 H5N1, clade 1 and <italic>PA, PB1, PB2, NP, M</italic>, and <italic>NS</italic> genes from A/PR8/34 H1N1, A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 (PRxCDC-RG), clade 2.1.3.2, and reverse genetic virus containing haemagglutinin from A/Laos/Nong Khai/1/2007 H5N1, clade 2.3.4.</p><p>The neutralising antibody titre was expressed as a value reciprocal to the highest dilution of a sample that yields a 50% reduction in the amount of viral nucleoprotein produced in the infected cultures compared with the virus control. The viruses tested were the same as those tested in the haemagglutination-inhibition assay.

The percentage of participants who reported local or systemic reactions after receiving LAIV H5N2 was lower than that reported in a study in Russia (10% <italic>vs</italic> 7% in our study). Virus shedding rate, as measured by viral culture 1 day after each immunisation, was also lower than that reported in the Russian trial (6%).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, this rate was similar to those reported in studies of using A/H5N1 LAIV strains based on A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Low replication of viruses might be explained by the limited capacity of H5 viruses to bind to cells of the upper respiratory tract, because avian H5 viruses bind preferentially to sialic acid receptors terminating in N-acetylneuraminic acid &#x003b1; 2,3 galactose, whereas &#x003b1; 2,6 galactose receptors are predominant in human upper airway epithelium.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Viral shedding after the second dose of LAIV H5N2 was strikingly lower than that seen after the first dose, suggesting that the first dose of LAIV H5N2 triggered an immune response, even though the concentrations of primary antibody were modest as measured by haemagglutination-inhibition assay. Thus, we anticipated that the chance of transmission is low. Apart from the above reason, all participants who were given placebo had negative nasal swabs for virus by both culture and PCR methods.</p><p>The inactivated H5N1 vaccine used in this study was found to be safe in both LAIV H5N2-vaccinated and vaccine-naive participants, similar to results from previous studies.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>Seroconversion, as detected by haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation assays, after two doses of LAIV H5N2 vaccine in the Thai population in our study, was lower than that observed in the Russian population (14% <italic>vs</italic> 38%).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> This finding might be due to different assay procedures, because no global standard operating procedures exist, or the different ethnic groups studied.

In agreement with a previously reported smaller study,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we detected high titres and rapid antibody responses after a single dose of inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine given 1 year later in 100% of participants who had previously been vaccinated with LAIV H5N2. However, the antibody responses were similar to those observed in the earlier study, in which the inactivated vaccine was given 5 years later (roughly 87% seroconversion rate).<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>These data suggest that LAIV vaccination induces long-lasting memory immune responses, and that these responses can be reactivated by inactivated H5N1 vaccine given 1&#x02013;5 years later. The rapid antibody response in LAIV H5N2-experienced participants after receiving inactivated H5N1 vaccine (as early as 7 days) suggests that LAIV could be used to prime a population early during a pandemic, with the option to introduce the appropriate inactivated vaccine when it becomes available. It is also likely that the priming effect of LAIV H5N2 would permit an accelerated immune response in the case of infection with an H5 pandemic virus, providing a level of protection and control that could limit the spread of infection. However, several aspects need to be investigated further: the interval between administration of the LAIV prime and the inactivated vaccine boost, the combination of prime&#x02013;boost strategies with different vaccines, the mechanisms underlying induction of an immune response by LAIV vaccine, and the quality of the cell-mediated immune response in the prime&#x02013;boost setting.</p><p>Induction of cross-protective antibodies is very important for H5 vaccine development. The findings of this study showed that the antibodies detected in LAIV-experienced vaccinees after administration of inactivated H5N1 vaccine also cross-react with H5N1 virus circulating in Thailand (A/Thailand/1[KAN-1]/04; H5N1), which is genetically similar to clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 virus and H5N1 (clade 2.1.3.2 and 2.3.4 viruses).<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> These data also indicate that giving the LAIV H5N2 vaccine would induce immune protection against different clades of H5 viruses, and that priming with H5N2 LAIV followed by boosting with H5N1 inactivated influenza vaccine elicits broad antibody responses, in terms of frequency and magnitude.</p><p>The main potential bias of part 2, which was a non-randomisation study by contrast with part 1 which was a randomised, controlled trial, could be the voluntary bias of the study participants. The characteristics of each group were similar, but there might be unknown confounders that could influence the study outcomes. Furthermore, the sample size of part 2 was calculated retrospectively as we were unable to predict how many participants could be contacted after the conclusion of part 1.</p><p>A subset of circulating ICOS+CXCR3+CXCR5+ T<sub>FH</sub> cells was reported to play a crucial part in inducing antibody responses in seasonal influenza vaccine trials.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> This study showed a dramatic increase in T<sub>FH</sub> cells in the LAIV-experienced group, but not in the LAIV-naive group, as early as 7 days after administration of inactivated H5 vaccine. This study clearly indicates that the H5N2 LAIV induced immune memory, and could partly explain the rapid antibody responses on boosting with inactivated vaccine. The increase in T<sub>FH</sub> was strongly correlated with an increased number of plasmablast cells, suggesting that T<sub>FH</sub> cells might have a key role in immunological events associated with induction of antibody responses. However, the numbers of T<sub>FH</sub> and plasmablast cells were reduced on day 28 and day 90 after boosting vaccination. Our observation was consistent with a previous study,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> which showed a peak emergence of T<sub>FH</sub> and plasmablast cells in blood on day 7 after boosting vaccination, which declined over the time. The cellular immune responses elicited by influenza specific interferon-&#x003b3; producing T cells warrants further investigation.</p><p>Our study was done using a prime&#x02013;boost strategy which, to our knowledge, has not been used in Thailand. The results provided from this study should be further evaluated for effectiveness if this strategy is applied in the field as a potential solution for pandemic control.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Subbarao</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Klimov</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characterization of an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus isolated from a child with a fatal respiratory illness</article-title><source>Science</source><volume>279</volume><year>1998</year><fpage>393</fpage><lpage>396</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9430591</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Luke</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Subbarao</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>H5N1 vaccines in humans</article-title><source>Virus Res</source><volume>178</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>78</fpage><lpage>98</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23726847</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Claes</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Morzaria</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Donis</surname><given-names>RO</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Emergence and dissemination of clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx influenza viruses&#x02014;how is the Asian HPAI H5 lineage maintained</article-title><source>Curr Opin Virol</source><volume>16</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>158</fpage><lpage>163</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26991931</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><source>Cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) reported to WHO</source><year>2012</year><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><source>Surveillance and outbreak alert.
