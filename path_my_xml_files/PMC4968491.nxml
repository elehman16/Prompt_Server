capacity and pain of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), with or without pes anserine
tendino-bursitis (PATB). The second is to compare the efficacy of two treatment methods
(physical therapy and corticosteroid injection) for patients with PATB. [Subjects and
Methods] Sixty patient with KOA and PATB (Group 1) and 57 patients with KOA but without
PATB (Group 2) were enrolled in the study. The patients&#x02019; visual analog scale (VAS),
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scores and
three-meter timed-up and go scores were measured. The PATB group was randomly divided into
two groups (Group A and B). Physical therapy (PT) modalities were applied to the first
group (Group A), and the second group (Group B) received corticosteroid injections to the
pes anserine area. Eight weeks later, patients&#x02019; parameters were measured again. [Results]
Initial WOMAC scores and timed up-and-go times were significantly higher in Group 1 than
in Group 2. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements in all measured
parameters, but no significant difference was detected between Group A and B. [Conclusion]
Patients with PATB tend to have more severe pain, more altered functionality, and greater
disability than those with KOA but without PATB. Both corticosteroid injection and PT are
effective methods of treatment for PATB. Injection therapy can be considered an effective,
inexpensive and fast therapeutic method.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pes anserine tendino-bursitis</kwd><kwd>Corticosteroid injection</kwd><kwd>Physical therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The sartorius, semitendinosus and gracilis muscles along the proximal aspect of the tibia
are called the pes anserine<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The bursa
lies under the pes anserine. Inflammation of the bursa was first described 70&#x02005;years ago<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is one of the most frequent soft tissue
pain syndromes that affect the knee<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Chronic bursitis is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or degenerative joint
disease. In one study, the incidence was found to be 2.5% in symptomatic knees<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is more common in females, obese and
type 2 diabetes patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not clear<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pes anserine tendino-bursitis (PATB) is one of the causes of pain in knee osteoarthritis
(KOA). Classic symptoms are tenderness and swelling over the medial proximal tibia or medial
knee pain mimicking medial meniscus/medial collateral ligament injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetitive trauma and excessive valgus or rotator stress on
the knee or a direct contusion can cause bursitis and tendinitis due to friction on the
bursa<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The diagnosis of PATB is based on clinical presentation. Pain can be exacerbated by going
up and downstairs. Patients may have pain while getting up from a sitting position or at
night. Chronic refractory pain increases during activity. Patients typically complain of
pain when walking on flat surfaces<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
most important physical examination finding is tenderness upon palpation of the proximal
medial tibia, approximately 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;cm below the anteromedial joint. External rotation of the
tibia and active rotation against resistance are painful<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rest, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the application of physical
therapy (PT) modalities, intrabursal local anesthetic and/or corticosteroid injections are
the treatment options<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of PATB is
associated with greater impairment, and disability in KOA. A second objective was to compare
the effectiveness of two distinct therapeutic approaches to treating KOA patients with PATB.
We hypothesized that local corticosteroid injections into the pes anserine area may have as
favorable an outcome as PT, and that the quick response to corticosteroid injections may
make this option more preferable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ethics Committee of Baskent University
(KA05/235). All patients were provided with a written explanation of the study and all gave
their written informed consent.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the patients were 2nd or 3rd radiological grade of knee
osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence scale and provision of a signed informed
consent. Patients with any knee surgery history, a history of inflammatory arthritis, or
trauma to the knee, or who received PT or injection to the knee during the last year were
excluded from the study.</p><p>A total of 176 patients, who attended the outpatient clinic complaining of knee pain and
who were diagnosed with KOA according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic
criteria, were screened. Of these patients, 82 had pes anserine tendino-bursitis (PATB+) and
94 did not (PATB&#x02212;). After the exclusion criteria had been applied, 60 of the 82 PATB+
patients formed Group 1 and 57 of the 94 PATB&#x02212;patients formed Group 2 (the control group).
Total blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor,
uric acid levels and fasting blood glucose were measured.</p><p>Functional capability and the severity of knee pain of all patients were evaluated using a
visual analogue scale (VAS), culturally adapted and validated Turkish version of the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the three-meter timed up-and-go test. The PATB group was
randomly divided into two subgroups. The treatment method for the patients was determined by
assigning them a random number (one or two) according to their appointment dates to make
sure the treatment groups were equal in size. The first group (Group A) received treatement
consisting of a hot-pack (20&#x02005;min) + ultrasound (1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 5&#x02005;min) + conventional
transcutaneous electrical nevre stimulation (TENS 20&#x02005;min) to the pes anserine region for two
weeks. The second group (Group B) received treatement consisting ofcorticosteroid (40&#x02005;mg
triamcinolone acetonide) injection to the tenderest point of the pes anserine region using
an infiltration technique. The same physician performed all injections. The measurements of
VAS, WOMAC and the three-meter timed up-and-go test were repeated eight weeks later. All
measurements (before and after therapy) were taken by another physician who was blinded to
the treatment modalities.</p><p>There were no complications in either of the two treatment groups. The patients were told
not to use any analgesic drugs during the treatment period.</p><p>Analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows 11.5 software. Normal distribution of
continuous variables was assessed by using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and data were expressed as
mean &#x000b1; standard deviation or as medians and 95% central range, as appropriate. The
differences between groups were assessed using the unpaired t-test for parametric data and
the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data. Dependent variables were assessed using the
paired t-test for parametric data and the Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data. P values of
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic data of the patients is summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic data of the patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 1 (n=60)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 2 (n=57)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49 F (81.6%) / 11&#x02005;M (18.4%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 F (77.1%) / 13&#x02005;M (22.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.7 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.0 &#x000b1; 8.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.3 &#x000b1; 3.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Group 1: knee osteoarthritis + pes anserine tendino-bursitis; Group 2: knee

PATB on pain and functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis. VAS scores in Group
1 were higher than those Group 2, however there was no statistically significant difference
between them (p=0.056). In addition, WOMAC and the WOMAC pain subscale were predominantly
higher in Group 1 (p=0.037, and p=0.011, respectively). The presence of PATB should be
considered as a factor that increases the pain during the examination and treatment planning
of patients with knee osteoarthritis. The 3-meter timed up go test times of the patients
with PATB were significantly longer than those of the patients without PATB (p&#x02264;0.001). The
WOMAC functional scale was significantly higher in Group 1 (p=0.031). This indicates that
PATB has a significantly unfavorable effect on the functionality of patients with knee
osteoarthritis, and this result is compatible with our hypothesis. That means the presence
of PATB in the patients with osteoarthritis, causes an increase in knee pain and in the
degree of severity of disability in osteoarthritis. This study also compared the efficacy of
two methods, PT and local corticosteroid injection, in the treatment of PATB. The results
demonstrate that both corticosteroid injection treatment and PT modalities are effective
against pain. Very significant results were obtained for the measured parameters and all the
WOMAC sub-scales (all p&#x02264;0.001); however, when the two treatment methods were compared, no
significant difference was found between them. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
have compared the results of acute phase treatment of PATB.</p><p>Knee osteoarthritis is a medical condition that causes severe pain and functional
limitations. In osteoarthritis, the pain arises in the bone and periarticular structures.
PATB is one of the most important causes of periarticular pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of osteoarthritis together with PATB has
been reported to be as high as 75%<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Study show that PATB has negative effects
on functionality and aggravates the pain, so PATB should kept in mind when evaluating knee
osteoarthritis.</p><p>K&#x000fc;lc&#x000fc; et al. investigated factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habit, disease
duration, educational level and exercise status that are associated with pain and disability
in patients with knee osteoarthritis, and they found BMI was the most important factor
associated with pain severity and functionality<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Malas et al. found meniscal bulging, Kellgren-Lawrence grade,
Baker cysts, and joint effusion were significantly higher in symptomatic knee
osteoarthritis, and they suggested these parameters are associated with the clinical
findings<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study results also show
that PATB is associated with clinical parameters and decreases the functionality and
increases pain and joint stiffness. As a result of these findings, patients with
osteoarthritis should be evaluated in terms of all these parameters. Co-occurrence of
periarticular soft tissue impairments may contribute to symptom severity, and may be
associated with higher disability. More clinical studies, especially those using imaging
techniques, are needed to establish the association between PATB, and symptom severity and
disability in knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>The most frequent pathologies detected by ultrasonography in painful knees as reported by
one study were suprapatellar effusion (55%), Baker&#x02019;s cyst (25%), and pes anserine bursitis.
Also in asymptomatic knees, suprapatellar effusion (25%) and Baker&#x02019;s cyst (5%) were detected
whereas no pes anserine bursitis was found<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yet another study described only two of 26 patients as having
bursitis, determined by ultrasonography, who were clinically diagnosed as pes anserine
bursitis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This shows that the pes
anserine bursa tenderness necessarily gives clinical signs and may lead to the determination
of therapeutic approaches based on physical examination in the absence of ultrasonographic
diagnostic techniques.</p><p>In Group A, not only PATB, but also osteoarthritis symptoms were treated, so the
improvement in the parameters might be due to both. In Group B, however, only PATB was
treated. As a result, the improvement in the assesment parameters shows that treatment of
PATB alone is important, so diagnosis of PATB in knee osteoarthritis before treatment is
very valuable. Detection and treatment of PATB in knee osteoarthritis, would decrease pain,
resulting in improved daily living activities, and at the same time contribute to slowing
the progression of osteoarthritis, by increasing compliance with exercise therapy.</p><p>In one study, 17 patients clinically diagnosed as pes anserine bursitis received a
corticosteroid injection and 2 weeks later their VAS, WOMAC pain, and WOMAC functional
indexes had significantly decreased<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similar favorable results were obtained in the present study with a higher number of
patients. In this study we have demonstrated that both corticosteroid injection treatment
and PT modalities are effective for pain. Two treatment modalities were compared and there
was no significant difference between them. If not contra-indicated (acute infection, poorly
controlled diabetes mellitus, bleeding disorders, etc.), corticosteroid injection therapy
should be considered as the primary treatment for PATB, since its results can be quickly
obtained, its implementation is very simple, and it is an effective and inexpensive method.
It could be the first choice of treatment method for patients with knee osteoarthritis and
PATB, especially those with low compliance with physical therapy sessions.</p><p>The major weakness of this study is that we did not use any imaging techniques. The
diagnosis was based on clinical presentation. Larson and Baum described some criteria for
the diagnosis of PATB; feeling pain while climbing upstairs and downstairs, especially in
the anteromedial part of the knee; morning stiffness of more than one hour; nocturnal pain;
having difficulty while standing up; and sensitivity and edema over the anserine bursa<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the patients were
considered as having PATB if they had the pes anserine tenderness and at least two of the
other 4 clinical signs. Ultrasonography would better make the distinction between bursitis
and tendinitis. The injections were performed with direct infiltrations into the most
sensitive point determined with palpation. In some patients, injections had the probability
of not being directly into the bursa/tendinitis but into the surrounding tissues. This was
one of the limitations of the present study. In further studies, comparison of injection
techniques with direct palpation, and ultrasonographic guidance should be performed.</p><p>The results of the present study demonstrate that corticosteroid injection therapy for PATB
has positive effects similar to physical therapy modalities in knee osteoarthritis. Although
there is no superior effect over conventional methods of physical therapy, corticosteroid
injections may be considered as an alternative method. The choice of treatment method may
vary depending on physiatrist preference and the patients compliance with therapy. More
studies with longer follow up periods are needed to evaluate long-term results in terms of
clinical efficacy and the superiority of one treatment over the other.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Forbes</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Helms</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Janzen</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Acute pes anserine bursitis: MR imaging</article-title>.
