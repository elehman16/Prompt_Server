Most of such patients are elderly, and the majority of them have coexisting cardiac and pulmonary comorbidity. The duration of TURP ranges from 60 to 75 min, and the level of the sensory blockade is required at T10 dermatome during most of the transurethral surgeries.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Common complications associated with spinal anesthesia are hypotension, bradycardia, post-dural puncture headache, backache, urinary retention, and inadequate, or failed block requiring supplementation of general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Opioids and local anesthetics administered together intrathecally have potent synergistic analgesic effects. Intrathecal fentanyl enhances the sensory block without altering the degree of sympathetic blockade.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Neuraxial administration of opioids in conjugation with local anesthetic not only improves the quality of intraoperative analgesia but also prolongs the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The side effects such as respiratory depression, pruritus, urinary retention, however, have prompted further research to develop non-opioid analgesics with less worrisome side effects.</p><p>Clonidine is a direct actin alpha adrenergic agonist which increases both sensory and motor block of local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Neuraxial clonidine does not cause respiratory depression.</p><p>Opioids and clonidine in conjunction with local anesthetics help in decreasing their dose thereby reducing side effects and prolonging the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, we evaluated the effects of addition of fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g and clonidine 30 &#x000b5;g with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg) for TURP surgeries.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Onset of sensory block</title><p>It is the time was taken to reach the maximum level of sensory block.

Lower level of the block in elderly patients also has a better hemodynamic stability. In our study, there was a significant difference in all the three groups in achieving the MULSB).

The trend of increase in VAS was significantly earlier in Group A as compared to Groups B and C. Group C has longest mean time of analgesia request. Improved perioperative analgesia following co-administration of fentanyl or clonidine and bupivacaine can be explained by a synergistic inhibitory action of these agents on A delta and C fiber conduction.

</p><p>The combination of intrathecal clonidine or fentanyl as adjuvants to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia is although equally acceptable clinically in terms of DOSB; motor block, duration of analgesia and hemodynamic stability as compared to bupivacaine alone. The advantage of shorter onset and more appropriate level of sensory block for TURP surgeries and not having pruritus, nausea and vomiting as side effects with intrathecal clonidine favor its use as adjuvant to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for TURP surgeries in geriatric patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ben-David</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Frankel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Arzumonov</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchevsky</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Volpin</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Minidose bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anesthesia for surgical repair of hip fracture in the aged</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2000</year><volume>92</volume><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10638892</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mulroy</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Regional anesthesia for outpatient surgery</article-title><source>Anesthesiol Clin North America</source><year>2003</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>289</fpage><lpage>303</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12812396</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chopra</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Talwar</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low dose intrathecal clonidine and fentanyl added to hyperbaric bupivacaine prolongs analgesia in gynecological surgery</article-title><source>J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2014</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>233</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24803764</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Frias</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>FS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pot&#x000e9;rio</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirata</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.
