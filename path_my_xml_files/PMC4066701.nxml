[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], it is related to a poor quality of life and absence from school for children and from work for parents; moreover night-time cough is the most difficult to solve and to be tolerated. Anatomically the upper airway comprehend nasal cavities, pharynx and larynx. Upper respiratory tract infections represent the most common acute illness in the community. They can range from the self-limiting common cold, to viral and bacterial infections of pharynx and larynx and to inflammation from irritating agents. Lower respiratory infections represent a less frequent problem in children, even if a more serious one, and they involve trachea, bronchi and lungs. A persisting cough is often accompanied by upper respiratory tract infection (URTIs)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], whereas other causes may be exposure to passive tobacco smoke, pollutants, aerosols and dust. A persistent cough is defined as a protracted cough lasting between 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks. According to literature two out of three children aged between 0 and 4&#x000a0;years visit their GP at least once a year with an acute respiratory infection and up to three-quarters of these will have a cough
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Prospective studies of acute cough in young children in general practice have suggested that about 50% recover by 10&#x000a0;days and 90% by 3&#x000a0;weeks, so 10% of children still have problems in the third to fourth weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent researches, many of the most common medications used to treat cough are nowadays studied to evaluate not only their efficacy, but also safety, in order to underline how benefits/risks ratio tent toward their beneficial effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In most cases, the pharmacological treatment aims to suppress the symptom (cough suppressant therapy), with synthetic agents that play an inhibitory effect on the cough reflex or act as mucolytic drugs, with the simple intent to reduce both intensity and frequency of cough in the short term, increasing the possibility to experience side effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Respiratory viruses, bacteria and irritants would cause a widespread inflammation of the mucosa of several anatomical areas, especially the upper respiratory tract mucosa, desquamation of the epithelial cells and damage of the nerve endings, which may then lead to a certain degree of hyper-reactivity of the cough reflex. Such a local environment may increase the sensitivity of the mucosa towards certain stimuli and local irritants, inducing a vicious circle that leads to an increased mucosal damage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], that may facilitate irritating agents access towards the nerve endings of the sub mucosa by activating constriction and bronchial reflexes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Starting from the above assumptions, it seems reasonable that the protective effect exerted by a mechanical barrier may represent a reliable therapeutic approach, different from the past, and able to more effectively limit the damage caused by micro-organisms and irritants on the mucosa due to an indirect anti-inflammatory action.</p><p>The barrier effect could be achieved by a particular combination of functional components (obtained from natural molecular complexes) such as resins, polysaccharides, saponins and flavonoids that are able to exert an indirect anti-inflammatory effect on the upper respiratory tract area
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the light of these considerations, it might be interesting and innovative to investigate the efficacy of a mechanical and non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention in the treatment of persisting cough.</p><p>Aim of the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was therefore to assess the effectiveness of the medical device Grintuss&#x000ae; (the study product, classified according to the Directive 93/42/EC, containing a combination of specific fractions of substances such as resins, polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids and sugars) in comparison with a placebo, in the treatment of cough persisting for more than 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In the present randomized, parallel groups, double-blind vs. placebo study, 102 children aged 3 to 6&#x000a0;years (51 for each group) were consecutively enrolled.

Cough has a high frequency in pediatrics; it tends to persist, to generate intense discomfort in both the child and parents, and it is accompanied by the risk of unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics and other treatments that may be associated to significant side effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Despite a certain number of studies, to date, a specific effective and safe treatment for cough has not yet been developed; such a treatment should improve both acute cough and cough persisting more than 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>We then evaluated the efficacy of the study product, a medical device (Class IIa according to the definition of art. 1 of Directive 93/42/EC), whose effects can be exerted by acting as a mechanical barrier, in patients with a cough persisting for more than 7&#x000a0;days. It contains functional components selected for their ability to exert a barrier effect on the mucosa, and for their indirect anti-inflammatory activity. The study product is the result of a combination of specific fractions of substances such as resins, polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids and sugars derived from <italic>Grindelia robusta, Plantago lanceolata</italic>, <italic>Helichrysum italicum</italic>, honey. Preclinical data by <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental assays strongly support that the study product possesses adhesive properties on human oral mucosa (under publication) and exerts a barrier effect against irritant agents even showing an indirect anti-inflammatory action.</p><p>Resins have adhesive properties, while polysaccharides have shown to have both adhesive and emollient properties
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Together, they create the mechanical barrier that limits the contact between irritants or micro-organisms and the upper respiratory tract mucosa, therefore reducing both the stimulation of nerve endings and the inflammation. Saponins are known for their ability to lower the surface tension
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; thanks to this property, they reduce the viscosity of the mucus allowing an easier elimination. The polysaccharides attract water and moisturize the mucosa making the mucus less viscous and easier to be expelled
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results of this study allow us to hypothesize that the study product can be helpful in acute cough and in cough that tends to persist even more than seven days (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Moreover, reducing the night-time cough score at t4 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), it is possible to achieve an improvement in quality of life, since night-time cough is less easy to control, and it creates great discomfort and causes loss of sleep both in children and parents.</p><p>The fact that the study product is effective since the first days of treatment is definitely an interesting feature, especially considering that parents, after one week of symptoms, may start to worry about it, and may seek other therapeutic intervention exposing the child to the risk of inappropriate treatment.</p><p>At last, the present study confirms the safety of the study product, since there has not been any relevant adverse event related to use of the product.</p><p>Grintuss&#x000ae; syrup is on the market since more than 10&#x000a0;years, during which the post-marketing surveillance system, in compliance with Directive 93/42/EC, has not registered incident or side effects related to the Medical Device. Grintuss&#x000ae; should not be used in case of known hypersensitivity to the components of medical device. No other contraindication have been registered. The present study confirms the safety of the study product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study support the evidence that Grintuss&#x000ae; pediatric syrup possesses an interesting profile of efficacy and safety in the treatment of cough persisting for more than 7&#x000a0;days. The treatment with Grintuss&#x000ae; is safe and effective in the relief of cough, starting on onset of application. The mechanical barrier, limiting the contact with external irritant agents or micro-organisms, helps the physiological recovery of the mucosa. The decrease of cough supports the protective role of Grintuss&#x000ae; thus showing an improvement in health. This effect moreover is especially evident at night.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>VM has been a scientific advisor and/or a speaker on educational meetings on Phytotherapy for several companies: Aboca, Dicofarm, Cristalfarma, Labomar, Lemuria, Milte.
