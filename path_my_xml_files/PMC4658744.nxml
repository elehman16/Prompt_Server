Monetary incentives are often effective at improving response rates but are, by nature, costly. Enclosing a pen with postal questionnaires has the potential to be a cheap and effective alternative.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To assess the effectiveness of including a pen in postal questionnaires on response rate, time to response, completeness of response and whether a reminder notice is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A two-arm RCT embedded within the SCOOP trial. 3,826 women, aged between 70 -85 years, were randomised to receive a pen with their 60-month follow-up questionnaire and 3,829 to receive the questionnaire alone. The results were combined with those of a previous embedded RCT in a meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 3,789 participants sent a 60-month questionnaire in the pen group, 3,500 (92.4%) returned it compared with 3,462/3,793 (91.3%) in the control group (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37, p=0.08). There was evidence of a reduction of the number of reminders required (p=0.02) and the time taken to respond (p=0.01) in the pen group. Some difference was found in the completeness of the primary outcome (p=0.05). The pooled OR of response rates from the meta-analysis was 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39, p=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The inclusion of a pen with postal questionnaires does potentially have a positive impact on RCT attrition and response rates, and on reducing the time to response and the numbers of reminders required. We estimate the cost per retained participant at &#x000a3;32, compared to &#x000a3;450 had we observed the same effect by sending a small, unconditional incentive of &#x000a3;5 with the questionnaire.</p></sec></body></article>
