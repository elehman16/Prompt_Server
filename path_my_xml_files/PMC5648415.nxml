Half of all trauma deaths are due to bleeding and most of these will occur within 6&#x000a0;h of injury. Haemorrhagic shock following injury has been shown to induce a clotting dysfunction within minutes, and this early trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) may exacerbate bleeding and is associated with higher mortality and morbidity. In spite of improved resuscitation strategies over the last decade, current transfusion therapy still fails to correct TIC during ongoing haemorrhage and evidence for the optimal management of bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Recent publications describe increasing the use of Viscoelastic Haemostatic Assays (VHAs) in trauma haemorrhage; however, there is insufficient evidence to support their superiority to conventional coagulation tests (CCTs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This multicentre, randomised controlled study will compare the haemostatic effect of an evidence-based VHA-guided versus an optimised CCT-guided transfusion algorithm in haemorrhaging trauma patients. A total of 392 adult trauma patients will be enrolled at major trauma centres. Participants will be eligible if they present with clinical signs of haemorrhagic shock, activate the local massive haemorrhage protocol and initiate first blood transfusion. Enrolled patients will be block randomised per centre to either VHA-guided or CCT-guided transfusion therapy in addition to that therapy delivered as part of standard care, until haemostasis is achieved. Patients will be followed until discharge or 28&#x000a0;days. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects alive and free of massive transfusion (less than 10 units of red blood cells) at 24&#x000a0;h. Secondary outcomes include the effect of CCT- versus VHA-guided therapy on organ failure, total hospital and intensive care lengths of stay, health care resources needed and mortality. Surviving patients will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire (EuroQol EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup>) at day 90.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">CCTs have traditionally been used to detect TIC and monitor response to treatment in traumatic major haemorrhage. The use of VHAs is increasing, but limited evidence exists to support the superiority of these technologies (or comparatively) for patient-centred outcomes. This knowledge gap will be addressed by this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02593877?term=NCT02593877&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02593877</ext-link>.

Half of all trauma deaths are due to bleeding and most of these will occur within 6&#x000a0;h from injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Haemorrhagic shock following injury has been shown to induce a clotting dysfunction (i.e. coagulopathy) within minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such early trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) may exacerbate bleeding and is associated with higher mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many more injured patients will go on to develop different types of coagulopathy at different times during the course of their treatment, either as a result of their body&#x02019;s ongoing response to trauma or as a consequence of their clinical care. Coagulopathic, haemorrhaging trauma patients have increased blood transfusion requirements, increased mortality and more adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite improvements in surgical techniques, resuscitation strategies and intensive care treatments, outcomes for critically injured patients remain poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Within the last decade research focussing on TIC has led to improved resuscitation strategies, resulting in the early and more aggressive use of blood products and coagulation factors for the management of massively bleeding patients.</p><p id="Par71">In spite of improved resuscitation strategies, current transfusion therapy still fails to correct coagulopathy during ongoing haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The mechanisms and genesis of TIC have yet to be fully elucidated, and there are many questions about how to optimally diagnose, resuscitate and monitor the critically bleeding trauma patient. It is important to detect TIC as early as possible. Conventional coagulation tests (CCT), such as prothrombin time/international normalised ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen concentration and PLT, have traditionally been used. However, there is a striking lack of evidence to support the use of these CCTs to monitor resuscitation, although threshold triggers for intervention based on CCTs have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent published evidence describes an increasing recognition for the potential of the two current market-leading Viscoelastic Haemostatic Assays (VHAs) namely thromboelastography (TEG&#x000ae;; Haemonetics Incorporation) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM&#x000ae;; TEM Innovation GmbH). Both platforms use similar test modes to rapidly and accurately determine the functional coagulation status of patient whole blood. However, the evidence base supporting a role for these VHA devices is limited, and less attention has been directed to understanding their cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness may be particularly relevant both in the context of additional therapeutic interventions required, but also in potential savings, if fewer treatments are required based on delivery of individualised assessments of haemostasis.</p><p id="Par72">The relative contribution of blood components, such as fibrinogen and platelets, to clot strength can be evaluated through the use of specific inhibitors or agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The viscoelastic properties of blood samples are recorded under low shear conditions, thereby providing a comprehensive visual profile of clot formation and breakdown (fibrinolysis).</p><p id="Par73">Unlike laboratory-based CCTs which might take more than 60&#x000a0;min for the results to be available to clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], VHA is a point-of-care device which might provide clinically relevant results within even 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min and thus may be repeated in a massive bleeding situation to identify patient-specific needs for transfusion components in a timelier manner. Furthermore, VHAs provide the potential to detect hyperfibrinolysis, and possibly hypercoagulability. However, VHA assays and testing have costs, require training and additional oversight, and may not provide insight into other potentially important haemostatic derangements at the endothelial or platelet level. In addition, other publications attest to how changes in the process and pathways for the delivery of CCTs can be modified and accelerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Whilst VHA has been used for many years in liver transplant and cardio-pulmonary surgery, robust data supporting its universal uptake in the context of trauma are lacking. Whilst some publications have attempted to identify VHA patterns and thresholds characterizing TIC and the need for massive transfusion in trauma patients, definitive evidence proving its superiority over CCTs in the diagnosis and management of coagulopathy in the acute setting is not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Although considered a preventable major cause of death, the management of coagulopathic bleeding in trauma patients remains primarily based upon retrospective registry studies of survival and extrapolating the results of transfusion practice performed in the elective, non-acute surgical setting. Treatment is diverse comprising the empiric transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) and clotting product supplements to patients, blind to the type and severity of TIC they may have &#x02013; or indeed even if they do not have coagulopathy. It is well established that blood transfusion carries significant health risks both related to transmission of pathogens and to the development of transfusion reactions. Published in 2015, the results of the Pragmatic, Randomised Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] provide the best evidence to date for optimal trauma haemorrhage resuscitation. PROPPR demonstrated that an empiric massive transfusion protocol (MTP) aiming at a ratio of 1:1:1 of blood components (RBC 1: plasma 1: platelets 1) administered from the early phase of care and during ongoing haemorrhage was associated with fewer exsanguinations in the initial 24&#x000a0;h (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and a tendency towards improved 24-h survival (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12) than a 1:1:2 ratio.</p><p id="Par76">The present prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) will employ evidence-based treatment algorithms to compare outcomes of VHA-guided resuscitation versus CCT resuscitation support in haemorrhaging trauma patients.</p><p id="Par77">The hypothesis for this comparative study is that VHA-directed therapy will enhance early haemostatic control by the targeted correction of TIC, whilst also reducing the total amount of blood products and procoagulants administered to all bleeding trauma patients, including those not having TIC. This would significantly reduce both the number of patients receiving blood transfusion and the number of transfused blood products per transfused patient, thereby improving both patient safety and resource utilisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par78">This is an investigator-initiated, multi-centred, superiority, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial performed at eight major trauma centres.

<italic>The investigators have all obtained ethics approval before being allowed to conduct and participate in the study. The investigator is also responsible for fulfilling any conditions of approval imposed by the local Ethics Committee, such as regular reporting, study timing and so on.</italic>
</p><p id="Par193">The timeframe required for subject or personal consultee (PC) consent/agreement is not compatible with the time sensitivity of this trial and, therefore, several approaches to obtaining informed consent/agreement will be used, all of which are consistent with the Mental Capacity Act (England; 2005) and the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). The subjects will be incapacitated at the time of eligibility (critical injury, mechanical ventilation, sedation). This study requires that the intervention to be performed rapidly, thereby necessitating that eligible patients are included in the trial very soon after hospital admission. Therefore, declaration for initial enrolment in the trial will be sought from a nominated consultee (NC), who is familiar with this study and its consenting process and is present at the trauma call.</p><p id="Par194">As injury is an unexpected event, it is uncommon that relatives are present at the time of hospital admission. However, if a PC for the patient is present, bearing in mind the clinical situation and their level of distress, they will be provided with brief information about the trial either verbally or in writing. If the PC objects, their wishes will be respected.</p><p id="Par195">If, and when, subjects regain the physical and mental capacity to give consent, information will be provided to them and written informed consent will be sought for continuation in the trial. For any patient who was included but does not regain full capacity, agreement will be sought from a PC for continuation in the trial. If a patient or PC declines to give consent/agreement for continuation at this stage, their wishes will be respected. These attempts will continue until subject consent or PC agreement is obtained. All interactions and attempts at contact with the PC and/or subject will be documented in a study consent log.</p><p id="Par196">In participating institutions where this is accepted according to ethics approval, patients who die before we have had the opportunity to discuss the trial and obtain consent/agreement from them or their PC, the patient will remain in the trial based on the signed declaration obtained by the NC. Should an investigator have had the opportunity to introduce themselves and discuss the trial with the PC prior to the subject&#x02019;s death but written agreement has not yet been obtained, then we will make a maximum of three further attempts (by any combination of telephone, Email or letter) as deemed appropriate in each individual case to contact the PC and obtain written agreement. If after these further attempts, the PC has either not been contactable or has not returned written agreement, then the subject will remain in the trial based on the NC declaration. If the PC objects to the subject remaining in the study at this stage, then their wishes will be respected.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par197">Not
