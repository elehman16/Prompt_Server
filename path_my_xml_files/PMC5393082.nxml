Diabetes has reached at an epidemic level, with around 366 million people with diabetes globally in 2011 and it is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. A WHO-ICMR study based on non-communicable diseases&#x02019; risk factor surveillance showed that the prevalence of self-reported diabetes was 7.3 per cent in urban, 3.2 per cent in peri-urban and 3.1 per cent in rural areas<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The prevalence levels of diabetes and prediabetes were 10.4 and 8.3 per cent, respectively<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>More than 80 per cent of diabetes deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The need for implementation of effective dietary strategies in diabetes prevention and management has been emphasized by the success of diet and lifestyle changes in preventing diabetes in high-risk patients<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Another study confirmed postprandial hyperglycaemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Postprandial hyperglycaemia produces oxidative stress, which, in turn, induces endothelial dysfunction and inflammation<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, all well-recognized risk factors for CVD. One dietary strategy aimed at improving both diabetes control and cardiovascular risk factors is the use of low glycaemic index (GI) diets<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p>Millets are small seeded grasses that grow well in dry zones as rain-fed crops, under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture in the semi-arid tropic region. These are highly nutritious, non-glutinous and non-acid-forming foods. Compared to polished rice, millets release a lesser percentage of glucose and over a longer period. This lowers the risk of diabetes<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Millet grains are considered superior among the major cereals with respect to protein, energy, vitamins and minerals. Besides, these are a rich source of dietary fibre, phytochemicals and non-starchy polysaccharides and reputed to have a low GI, and hence can be used as a therapeutic diet. This study was undertaken to assess the GI of a common Indian recipe (rice <italic>dosa</italic>) and a millet-based recipe (foxtail <italic>dosa</italic>). The aim was also to estimate the effect of a single change in the diet in any one meal with a low-GI food on the postprandial level of glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The proximate principles of rice and foxtail millet <italic>dosa</italic> are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Proximate principles of rice <italic>dosa</italic>, foxtail millet <italic>dosa</italic> and white bread</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-144-712-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p><italic>Preparation of the rice- and millet-based dosa</italic>: For the preparation of the millet <italic>dosa</italic>, 90 g of unpolished foxtail millet was purchased from the local market along with 20 g of black gram pulses <italic>dal</italic>), soaked for four hours and were ground with 90 ml of water. The batter was kept overnight for fermentation. The same recipe was followed for preparing the rice-based <italic>dosa</italic> with rice substituting the foxtail millet.</p><p>The final quantity of batter was weighed accurately. This weight (430g) of foxtail millet batter provided 36.4 g of available carbohydrate (CHO) while rice batter provided 77.0 g of available carbohydrate<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Hence, 290 g of foxtail batter and 140 g of rice batter were used to make two <italic>dosas</italic>. The participants were asked to consume both <italic>dosas</italic>. This quantity provided 50 g of available carbohydrate. The available carbohydrate was calculated by subtracting the total dietary fibre (TDF) which includes the soluble and insoluble fibre from the total carbohydrate present in 100 g of the test food. The available carbohydrate from black gram was constant in the two varieties of <italic>dosa</italic> as 20 g was used for both the recipes.</p><p><italic>Reference food</italic>: White bread was chosen as the reference food<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> (purchased from the local bakery). The available carbohydrate was calculated by subtracting the TDF from total CHO. Therefore, 101 g of bread contained 50 g of available CHO.</p><p><italic>Estimation of glycaemic index</italic>: Ten normal volunteers were selected and the reference sample and the test items were given with a two-day wash out period<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The average fasting blood glucose was 82 mg/dl (average of three different readings on three different days.) The participants were all females between the age range of 22-44 yr and body mass index (BMI) range of 23-28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The purpose of the study was explained to each participant and written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained. They consumed two <italic>dosas</italic> such that these provided 50 g of carbohydrate and four slices of bread calculated for available carbohydrate<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>After an overnight fast, finger prick blood samples were investigated at 0 (before test meal), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.

The values at 75 and 105 min were obtained by extrapolation<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The incremental area under the curve (AUC) for each meal and reference food was calculated for each volunteer separately to reflect the total rise in the glucose concentration after eating the test and reference food<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.

Hospital for Diabetes, Chennai, and the participants were enrolled over a period of eight months in 2014 and 2015 in the department of Diet and Nutrition of the Hospital. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee. The study protocol was explained to the participants and those who were willing to participate were enrolled in the study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. A total of 105 participants with T2DM (M69:F36) visiting the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, Chennai, India, who were never on insulin therapy but were on the same oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) for one year and whose blood glucose levels were above normal, were randomly selected for the study of an age group between 35 and 55 yr. The 105 eligible participants were randomly allocated to either rice or millet group on the first day and random sequences were generated using WinPepi software (New York, USA).

This may be due to the high levels of soluble dietary fibre in the millet. The TDF was reported to be 27.02 per cent, soluble dietary fibre 11.56 per cent and the insoluble dietary fibre 15.44 per cent<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. It has been reported that the high viscosity of the soluble fibre delays digestion and absorption<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>The glucose levels can be maintained to near normal with the help of dietary modification. It was observed in the present study that replacing rice-based <italic>dosa</italic> with millet-based <italic>dosa</italic> showed a significant reduction in the postprandial blood glucose levels. The results were in agreement with the previous study<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which showed a 29 per cent decrease in the serum glucose level after consumption of millet-based <italic>burfi</italic>.</p><p>The incremental improvement in glycaemic control afforded by a low-GI diet can be compared with that achieved with other medical interventions such as OHA or insulin<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. One of the potential effects of low-GI diets is to reduce insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and to reduce daily insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Wolever <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> observed a 30 per cent reduction in urinary C peptide levels in patients with type 2 diabetes on a low-GI diet, indicating reduced endogenous insulin demand. After supplementing only one meal with a lower GI food in the meal, namely breakfast in the present study, the participants showed a reduction in their glycaemic profile. A similar result in the use of low-GI foxtail millet biscuits has been reported<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>The high-soluble dietary fibre content has been found to reduce gastric emptying and absorption of glucose after a meal, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. The soluble dietary fibre component has been reported to decrease the activity of digestive enzymes, thus resulting in incomplete hydrolysis of carbohydrates, protein and fats and delaying absorption<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. There was a weak but significant correlation between the amount of TDF per 50 g carbohydrate portion of food and GI according to Wolever<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Cellulose content of the food was the best predictor of the GI of the food<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Foxtail millet contains 8.0 g/100 g of crude fibre and rice has 0.2 g/100 g of crude fibre<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The TDF in foxtail millet has been reported to be 27 per cent<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> while rice contains only 4.1 per cent<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Low-GI diets favourably influence postprandial metabolism, lowering insulin resistance and lipid and clotting parameters. Together these metabolic effects may explain the long-term benefits of low-GI diets on CVD observed in large cohort follow up studies<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>The metabolic effects relate to the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the small intestine. A reduced rate of glucose absorption after the consumption of low-GI carbohydrate foods will reduce the postprandial rise in gut hormones (<italic>e.g.</italic>, incretins) and insulin. The prolonged absorption of carbohydrate seen over time will maintain suppression of the free fatty acids (FFAs) and the counter regulatory responses, while at the same time achieving lower blood glucose concentrations. Over time, with the reduction in FFA concentrations and the rise in the respiratory quotient with tissue insulinization, glucose is withdrawn from the circulation at a faster rate. Consequently, blood glucose concentrations return towards baseline despite continued glucose absorption from the small intestine. The rise in peak postprandial blood glucose is therefore, reduced together with the incremental blood glucose area above baseline<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that obesity is related to GI or glycaemic load<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Studies on altering GI and load have indicated that if the GI and load of the first meal is lower, less food is consumed in the subsequent meal<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. The use of GI is encouraged as a way to improve the quality of carbohydrates consumed<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and use of GI is of particular benefit for controlling glycaemia, lipids and weight<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. The sample for the present study comprised only 105 patients with T2DM visiting a hospital for diabetes. This sample was only a small portion of all patients with diabetes limiting the generalization of findings. The study was limited to a one-time individual postprandial response to a single meal consisting of low-GI food. Hence, a long-term effect of consumption of millet <italic>dosa</italic> on blood lipid profile and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) in T2DM patients would be beneficial. Another limitation of the study was that the available carbohydrate was estimated using the difference method.</p><p>In conclusion, our study indicated the potential benefits of foxtail millet in the diet therapy for patients with diabetes. However, there is a scope to explore the potential benefits of millets in the management of metabolic disorders through long-term feeding interventions. If used on a long-term basis, it could be beneficial in controlling lipid profile as well as the HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in such patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Prof. M.
