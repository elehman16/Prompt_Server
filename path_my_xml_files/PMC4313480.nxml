Not long ago, the main mode used by dentists for treating deep carious lesions was by taking out the diseased tissues. However, the aim of operative dental treatment is to maintain tooth integrity as long as possible. Thus, the modern and desirable management of deep caries lesions should be centered on the principles of minimum intervention dentistry.</p><p>In dentin, caries lesions develop at different depths being the superficial layers (infected layer) the most damaged, making it difficult the preservation and remineralization of this substrate. However, in deeper layers (affected layer), although demineralization is also present, the cross-banded ultra-structure of the collagen matrix is preserved. Thus, the elimination of pathogens present in affected dentin can make the preservation of this substrate possible, especially in those areas where collagen is not injured by the carious process.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Besides, the sealing of infected carious dentine below dental restorations makes the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota less complex. However, it has also been suggested that bacterial growth occurs beneath the restoration and this growth may be restricted to those genotypes best able to exploit the environment with limited availability of nutrients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Consequently, bactericide substances can be a viable option for dentin disinfection that decreases the microbial load. Therefore, the use of cavity disinfectant solutions has been recommended.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine digluconate is considered a gold standard agent in controlling biofilm formation due to its ability to significantly decrease the levels of oral microorganisms. An ideal cavity disinfectant should also present a low toxicity or, preferably, no toxic effects to the pulp cells, especially to odontoblasts.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, it has been previously demonstrated that chlorhexidine presents cytotoxic effects on a variety of cell lines,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] similar to different chemical agents indicated for use as cavity disinfectants.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This way, it is important to look for natural alternatives for decreasing dentin contamination that lowers the pulp cells.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In this regard, leaves of <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> contain polyphenolic components with antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of microbes. The most abundant components in green tea are polyphenols, in particular flavonoids such as the catechins, catechin gallates, and proanthocyanidins.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This polyphenolic component exhibits antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, cancer-preventive, and antimicrobial properties.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Over 50% of green tea is composed of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and it has been suggested that it is the main flavonoid responsible for most of the potential health benefits attributed to green tea intake.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The effects of green tea polyphenols, more specifically against <italic>S. mutans</italic>, have been previously demonstrated. EGCG is indicated as the major polyphenol component in tea that interferes with the virulence of cariogenic bacteria.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this catechin at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% as an antimicrobial solution in a microbiological model of caries-like dentinal lesions. The null hypothesis tested was that different solutions have similar effectiveness in reducing <italic>S. mutans</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study was randomized, comprising five groups: Group I: 0.9% saline solution (negative control); Group II: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (positive control); Group III: 0.5% EGCG; Group IV: 1% EGCG; and Group V: 2% EGCG. The teeth were randomly allocated to the groups, with five experimental units per group, according to a computer generated randomization list using a table created in the Excel system (Microsoft, Richmond, CA, USA).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The experimental design was performed in triplicate in order to reduce the inherent bias related to microbiological procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Fifty caries-free third molars were collected, after the patients&#x02019; informed consent had been obtained, under a protocol reviewed and approved by the local Research and Ethics Committee (Protocol # 329.632). The teeth were stored in a 0.01% (w/v) thymol solution for a month or less and remained refrigerated until use.</p><p>Each tooth was fixed in an acrylic device and cut using a water-cooled diamond saw mounted in a cutting machine (IsoMet Low Speed Saw; Buehler, Ilinois USA) in order to obtain the dentin specimen (4 &#x000d7; 4 &#x000d7; 2 mm), a fragment of the dentin central portion of the third molar. The occlusal plane surfaces obtained were assessed by examination under a microscope, at 40&#x000d7; magnification, to ensure complete removal of enamel. Only the occlusal dentin surface was used and the other surfaces were protected with resistant acid varnish (Risqu&#x000e9;, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil), resulting in an area of 16 mm<sup>2</sup> that served as a microbial surface on which caries lesions were produced. The specimens were mounted on metal appliances, which contained two claws to fix them and a handle to allow carriage on the 24-well polystyrene plates, and immersed in sterile distilled water. They were then sterilized by autoclaving to 121&#x000b0;C for 15 min[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and stored in 100% humidity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Microbiological model of caries-like dentinal lesions[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</title><p>After sterilization, the specimen and appliance were removed from the distilled water and immersed in sterile brain-heart infusion broth (BHI CM0225; Oxoid LTD, SP, Brazil) containing 5% (w/v) sucrose.

A specific optical density was determined using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1100 <italic>pro</italic>; Amershanm Biosciences) and was used for all samples to adjust the inoculum to the same cell number. Inoculation of each BHI-containing 24-well polystyrene plates was performed only on the first day. The culture medium was changed daily during five consecutive days. The 24-well plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> during the entire experimental period. At each transfer time, samples of the cultures were streaked onto BHI agar plates and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in order to check for purity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Exposure of the specimens to EGCG and controls</title><p>A 0.9% saline solution (NaCl) was prepared at a ratio of 0.9 g/100 ml and previously autoclaved (121&#x000b0;C, 15 min). Chlorhexidine digluconate at 20% (v/v) was diluted to give 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (v/v) and, because it is an organic substance, was sterilized in a filter. EGCG from green tea (EGCG, 95%, wt/wt) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO) was dissolved into distillated water at concentration of 20 mg/ml. Then the EGCG/distillated water was diluted at concentrations of 10 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml, in this way obtaining the three different concentrations used in this study.</p><p>On the fifth experimental day, the biofilm formed over the specimens was removed and the caries dentin was exposed.

This leads the authors to reject the null hypothesis.</p><p>To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no study has previously investigated the effect of catechins on infected dentin. Thus, the discussion of the current results was performed using researches that investigated the antimicrobial effects of EGCG on the growth of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. According to Xu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] discrepant results of antimicrobial activity of EGCG can be found, depending on the type of bacterial organization. In planktonic cells, MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values in a BHI medium were 625 &#x003bc;g/ml and &#x0003e;1,250 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. Moreover, EGCG inhibited the formation of <italic>S. mutans</italic> biofilm in a BHI medium with a MBIC<sub>50</sub> (the lowest flavonoid concentration that showed at least 50% inhibition of the formation of biofilms compared with control) of 312.5 &#x003bc;g/ml. In the data presented by Mankovskaia <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the MIC values for Epigallocatechin-3-gallate against <italic>S. mutans</italic> were within reference ranges of 31.25 &#x003bc;g/ml to 625 &#x003bc;g/ml, depending on the bacterial strain and culture medium. Du <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] concluded that antibacterial activity of the dental adhesives was increased after a 200 &#x003bc;g/ml or higher concentration of EGCG incorporated. Hirasawa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that more than 2000 &#x003bc;g/ml of EGCG is required in a mouth-rinsing to be effective against <italic>S. mutans</italic> present in dental plaque. These researches suggest that EGCG may represent a natural alternative for decreasing dentin contamination with a lower possibility of damaging the pulp cells.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The concentrations in which catechins are effective as an antimicrobial agent are wide, and one of the causes is the application of different methods of determining bacterial susceptibility. Usually, lower levels of EGCG are necessary to inhibit bacterial culture in planktonic cultures than in oral biofilm. This is due to the fact that in planktonic cultures, bacteria find themselves free in suspension, whereas in the biofilms there is a structured and dynamic ecosystem, which acts coordinately. These types of microorganism organizations present distinct properties.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Biofilms are composed of a variety of species&#x02019; mechanisms that establish communication between them, including transfer of genetic material, either as virulence traits or as bacterial resistance faster than that occurring in culture planktonic.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Such characteristics favor these structures and develop resistance to many therapeutic agents.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>EGCG at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% was not effective as a cavity disinfectant on carious dentin in eliminating the pathogen. In a pilot study, these concentrations presented satisfactory results in MIC and MBC tests. Most likely the ineffectiveness in reducing or eliminating <italic>S. mutans</italic> can be attributed to interactions formed between the tea catechins and the collagen fibrils. Proteins present on the surface dentin that remained from the nutrient-rich BHI medium may bind or even precipitate catechins and that binding may jeopardize their antimicrobial activity.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, it can be suggested that there were interactions between the catechin and specific sites in the molecular structure of the collagen.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, in the present study, chlorhexidine digluconate was able to significantly decrease the levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> inside dentinal tubules. These results are in agreement with a previous study that tested this agent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> against cariogenic bacteria.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the flavonoid applied directly on carious dentin, which has not yet been investigated in the literature. In order to perform the cariogenic challenge, the authors employed the microbiological method, in which the dentinal slabs remained immersed for five days in the nutrient medium inoculated with <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The production of <italic>in vitro</italic> caries-like lesions may be achieved in different ways, but the microbiological method presents a pattern of collagen degradation morphologically more similar to natural lesions, with an evident infected layer in the dentin caries lesion simulated by that method.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Dentin submitted to a cariogenic challenge seems to be more resistant to antimicrobial therapy. In the development of the dental biofilms, salivary proteins and glycoproteins on oral surfaces and other organisms play a decisive role in bacterial adhesion.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Collagen Type I, the main organic component of dentin, is recognized by <italic>streptococci</italic> that bind to collagen and may facilitate the bacterial adhesion and tissue penetration.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Therefore, EGCG concentrations used in this study are shown to be greater than those used in studies of culture planktonic and biofilm.</p><p>The absence, until this date, of specific answers about the mechanism of EGCG anti-cariogenic points to the need for further research in this direction. There are numerous studies on the anti-cariogenic potential of the flavonoid. However, there is a great variability in the conditions and methods employed, which makes it difficult to attribute this potential anti-cariogenic to a specific factor or a set of elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>EGCG concentrations used as a cavity disinfectant was not efficient in reducing <italic>S. mutans</italic> levels compared to chlorhexidine digluconate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This project has received financial support (Grant # 131437/2011-9) from CNPq.
