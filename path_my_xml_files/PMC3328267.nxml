Over time, these impairments can cause joint deformities and deviations in the children's gait pattern, leading to limitations in moblity. Preventing a loss of range of motion is important in order to reduce secondary activity limitations and joint deformities. Sustained muscle stretch, imposed by orthotic management in rest, might be an effective method of preventing a decrease in range of motion. However, no controlled study has been performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A single blind randomised controlled trial will be performed in 66 children with spastic CP, divided over three groups with each 22 participants. Two groups will be treated for 1 year with orthoses to prevent a decrease in range of motion in the ankle (either with static or dynamic knee-ankle-foot-orthoses) and a third group will be included as a control group and will receive usual care (physical therapy, manual stretching). Measurements will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure will be ankle dorsiflexion at full knee extension, measured with a custom designed hand held dynamometer. Secondary outcome measures will be i) ankle and knee flexion during gait and ii) gross motor function. Furthermore, to gain more insight in the working mechanism of the orthotic management in rest, morphological parameters like achilles tendon length, muscle belly length, muscle fascicle length, muscle physiological cross sectional area length and fascicle pennation angle will be measured in a subgroup of 18 participants using a 3D imaging technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will provide more insight into the efficacy of orthotic management in rest and the working mechanisms behind this treatment.

The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behaviour, by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems" </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Spastic CP is the most common form of CP (85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Muscle spasticity is a clinical symptom characterized by a velocity dependent resistance to passive stretch or movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At present, in developed countries, about 2 live born children per 1000 have Cerebral Palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Range of motion (ROM) deficits in one or more limb joints are present in many children with spastic cerebral palsy with about the half of the children having ROM deficits in the ankle, knee and hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In clinical practice, it is assumed that a reduced ROM in a joint is caused by a relative shortness of the muscle tendon complex compared to the length of the bone and/or by enhanced stiffness of the muscle tendon complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>is often spastic in children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>has origin at the femur and his insertion at the calcaneus, this muscle is a major determinant of the ankle and knee ROM. The <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>was found to be shorter and stiffer in children with CP (having reduced ankle dorsiflexion) compared to typical developing children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and is expected to play a major role in the cause of limited ankle dorsiflexion ROM (measured at full knee extension). This ankle dorsiflexion ROM may lead to equinus deformities in the ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a short and stiff <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>may lead to a gait pattern with increased ankle plantar flexion and increased knee flexion in midstance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Compared to children with typical gait patterns, children with deviated gait patterns are impaired in mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and are metabolically less efficient and less resistant to fatigue during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To prevent equinus contractures and less efficient gait patterns, it is important to treat and prevent impaired ankle dorsiflexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness of stretch</title><p>It is recommended not to use surgical interventions to improve gait (and thus not to treat impaired ankle dorsiflexion ROM by using surgical intervention) until gait is matured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on joint immobilization studies of animals, it is well known that sustained muscle stretch stimulates an increase in muscle length by addition of sarcomeres in series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In analogy with these results it is expected sustained muscle stretch as treatment of spastic calf muscles, will lengthen these muscles and in particular the gastrocnemius. However, a systematic review about the effectiveness of passive stretching shows that there is conflicting evidence on whether passive stretching can increase the ROM in a joint in children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Two types of stretching were investigated: 1) Manual stretching and 2) Sustained muscle stretch. Manual stretching was defined as <italic>"holding the targeting joint to the available end ROM manually for a set amount of time, expressed as seconds, and then releasing it" </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sustained muscle stretch was defined as <italic>"holding the targeting joint to the available end ROM by mechanical means such as standing tables or position equipment for an extended period, expressed as minutes up to 5-7 hours a day" </italic>(a duration of 30 minutes stretching was the most commonly chosen in the analysed studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this review it was concluded that there appears to be only some indications that sustained muscle stretch is preferable to increase joint ROM in children with CP compared to manual stretching.</p></sec><sec><title>Orthotic management in rest</title><p>Although sustained stretch is not an evidence based treatment, it is often applied by the use of night splints that are part of the general management of children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. "Night splints" are used during night and/or during rest periods during the day. Therefore, we prefer to use the term "orthotic management in rest" instead of "night splinting". Regarding the muscle of interest in this study, the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>of children with spastic CP, sustained stretch is applied by using knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO). Static KAFOs (with ankle and knee angle fixed) as well as dynamic KAFOs (with ankle angle imposed by a spring allowing movement) are used. These orthoses hold the ankle joint at the maximal angle of dorsiflexion at full knee extension.</p><p>Using KAFOs in rest could be more effective compared to using KAFOs during active moments of the day. It might be presumed that a KAFO with fixed knee joints limits mobility, and therefore, will likely not be worn during active moments of the day. Other orthoses, like AFOs that are often used during active parts of the day, do not necessarily stretch the Gastrocnemius Muscle as the knee is allowed to flex. Knee flexion will occur during, for example, walking and sitting. To the best of our knowledge, Tardieu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] is the only study that evaluates the efficacy of orthotic management in rest in children with CP. It reports the effectiveness of orthotic treatment at night in two children, but these results are not confirmatory, due to the limited study design: 1) the number of treated subjects (2) was small, 2) there was no control group, and 3) the subject's ankle dorsiflexion was measured in knee flexion rather than extension which is more consistent with a measure of the <italic>Soleus muscle </italic>length instead of the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle</italic>. Therefore, more research is needed to establish whether their conclusions were correct and whether the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>will adapt in the same way to sustained stretch as the <italic>Soleus muscle</italic>. Despite the reported limited evidence in the literature, the efficacy of orthotic management in rest is probably considered as general knowledge. It is supposed that a KAFO prevents for reduced ankle dorsiflexion ROM when the KAFO is worn for 6 or more hours a day.</p><p>The major aim of this study is to obtain insight in the efficacy of orthotic management in rest to prevent a reduction in ankle dorsiflexion at full knee extension (clinical part of the study). Differences in the efficacy of static and dynamic KAFOs will be investigated and compared as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological properties</title><p>Recent literature shows that the morphological properties of muscles in children with CP differ from those in typically developing children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For example, muscle belly length and muscle volume are smaller in children with CP compared to typically developing children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A smaller fascicle length and smaller muscle thickness is found as well in children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mostly, the <italic>medial gastrocnemius muscle </italic>was investigated. However, very little is known about the development of these morphological properties during growth both in typically developing children and children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and the mechanisms underlying the decreasing ankle ROM during development in children with CP are unknown. Such insight is required to improve treatments for preventing reduced ankle ROM. Since the ROM of a joint is thought to be determined by the passive slack length (i.e. the smallest length at which any force is exerted) of the muscle tendon complex in relation to bone length and by the muscle tendon complex stiffness, improved knowledge of the changes in muscle morphology will likely provide insight into the etiology of reduced ROM. It is expected that the passive slack length of the muscle tendon complex will be affected by architectural variables, such as fascicle length (&#x02113;<sub>(fasc)</sub>), muscle belly length (&#x02113;<sub>m</sub>), physiological cross- sectional area (A<sub>f</sub>), angle between fascicle and aponeurosis (<italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(fasc)</sub>) </italic>and tendon length (&#x02113;<sub>t</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The muscle tendon complex stiffness is determined by the size and length of the muscle belly fibres and by the amount and arrangement of connective tissues (parallel elastic components) of the muscle tendon complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The KAFO treatments tested in this study are assumed to prevent the development of a reduced ankle dorsiflexion at full knee extension by increasing the slack length of the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>muscle tendon complex and by reducing the muscle tendon complex stiffness. However, even if effective, the question remains whether the muscle tendon complex slack length increases due to muscle architectural changes like increased fascicle length or due to the amount and arrangement of connective tissues of the muscle tendon complex or both (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for an overview of the different architectural parameters that determine the length of the <italic>medial Gastrocnemius muscle</italic>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic overview of the different architectural parameters that determine the length of the muscle tendon complex of the <italic>medial Gastrocnemius muscle</italic></bold>.

In addition, we anticipate that children who are treated with a static KAFO will show less of a response (i.e. they will have a larger decline or a smaller increase in ankle ROM into dorsiflexion) when compared to children being treated with a dynamic KAFO.</p><p>We expect that for children with CP, treatment with either KAFO will have a less negative change in gait or even a positive change in gait pattern. A positive change refers to less ankle plantar flexion and less knee flexion in midstance, compared to no KAFO treatment.

The lower leg will lie in such a way that the fibula head and the lateral malleolus of the fibula are on the same height. The foot will be firmly attached to the adjustable foot plate for fixation. The ankle will be plantar flexed by the researcher, applying an external plantar flexion moment of 4 Nm, as measured using the toque wrench. The corresponding <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(f-t) </sub></italic>is measured (further described as the 4 Nm plantar flexion angle). Subsequently, this procedure is repeated for 1 Nm plantar flexion and, 0 Nm, 1 Nm dorsiflexion, 4 Nm dorsiflexion and 6 Nm dorsiflexion. All measurements will be repeated six times and each moment will be exerted for five seconds. The <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(f-t) </sub></italic>will be read out from the inclinometer simultaneously at the end of these 5 seconds at the target ankle joint moment. Positive values refer to an external dorsal flexion moment (Nm) of the dynamometer and dorsal flexion angle (&#x000b0;) of the ankle joint. There will be five seconds rest between each repetition and two minutes rest between each condition. The conditions will always be applied in the described order.</p><p>Children have to relax their muscles and will be asked to lie quietly during the measurements. Muscle activity will be checked using the electromyography (EMG) signals of <italic>Tibialis anterior muscle </italic>and <italic>lateral Gastrocnemius Muscle</italic>. The maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVC) will be recorded before the measurements. The EMG signal will be A-D converted at 1000 Hz. After sampling, the signal will be high-pass filtered at 20 Hz to remove movement artefacts. Then, the signal will be normalized with respect to the MVC-value and filtered low pass at 5 Hz. EMG signals have to remain below 10% MVC during the angle and moment measurements to ensure muscle relaxation. Skin preparation and electrode placement of EMG will be carried out according to SENIAM guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The mean of the first 5 measurements for each condition in which the EMG signal remained below 10% MVC will be used for further analysis. The results will be used to create angle-moment plots in which, for example, the muscle tendon complex stiffness can be determined by calculating the slope of the line between the 0 Nm and 4 Nm (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The subjects will walk 5 times barefoot and 5 times with shoes and AFO if applicable, along a 10 m walkway at self-selected comfortable speed. Walking speed will be calculated from the time to complete a part of the track (5 meters, measured with infra red detectors or with a stopwatch, depending on measurement location). For follow up measurements, the patient will be requested to walk at baseline walking speed (within a range of &#x000b1; 5%). Video recordings of the involved leg(s) will be taken in the sagittal and frontal plane. Three representative steps will be chosen for the assessment of the knee angle in midstance, the minimum knee angle in stance (between midstance and second bipedal phase of foot contact) and the ankle flexion in midstance. For the video analysis, a custom-made software package will be used (the Moxie Viewer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smalll.nl">http://www.smalll.nl</ext-link>), and a software tool, allowing on screen video measurements of sagittal lower extremity joint angles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

To asses problematic behaviour of the child, the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] will be filled in by the parents. In addition, questions will also be asked about the children's sport activities, current therapies and other treatments, as well as preference sleeping positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical examination</title><p>Physical examination will be performed by the assessor to evaluate the physical characteristics of the patient. Variables to be measured are: 1) Position of the foot in standing, 2) transmalleolar axis position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], 3) gait pattern classification according to Rodda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and Becher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], 4) ROM of the ankle and knee joints, 5) spasticity, by measuring the angle of catch (AOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] of the ankle and knee, 5) selective motor control, using the Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and 6) lower leg length. For all participants, the physical examination related outcome measures will only be measured in the potentially treated legs.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol adherence</title><p>Web based diaries will be used to record the protocol adherence and will be collected by a research assistant. These diaries will be filled in during the fourth week of each month and include questions regarding KAFO use, KAFO-related complaints, sleeping problems, the use of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) as well as questions regarding stretching exercises performed over the last month. Problems with KAFO use experienced by patient and/or parents will be monitored by specific diary questions. The research assistant will call the participants at least once a month to check if there are any problems with the KAFO or motor function of the participant. Reported problems will be solved as soon as possible.</p><p>Furthermore, to check the reliability of diary reported KAFO wearing time, wearing time of the splints (for a subgroup of 10 children, recruited at VU University Medical Center) will be determined on the basis of KAFO temperature measured using a TidBit temperature datalogger (UTBI-001, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). The KAFO temperature will increase due to body heat when the KAFO is worn. A sample of KAFO temperature data will be recorded each 15 minutes during the treatment period. Parents and children are not informed about the purpose of this measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Other</title><p>To get an indication of the sustained muscle stretch that is applied by the KAFOs, two measurements will be added. 1) The ankle moment at a <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(f-t) </sub>of </italic>0&#x000b0; to simulate the static KAFO condition.

Two sets of recordings of the <italic>medial Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>will be made for each session. During 3D-ultrasound measurements, the position of the probe with a cluster marker is recorded using an active 3D marker motion analysis system (Optotrak, Northern Digital, Waterloo, Canada). In addition, 6 anatomical landmarks (lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, medial femur condyle, lateral femur condyle, medial femur epicondyle and lateral femur epicondyle) are recorded before each experiment to gain an anatomical frame of reference for post experimental 3D image reconstruction. In a prone position, the children are lying quietly on a bench. Using the ankle dynamometer, the ankle is fixed at <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(f-t) </sub></italic>corresponding to 0, 1 and 4 Nm net dorsal flexion moment.

Although orthotic management in rest in children with CP is widely applied, very little is known about the efficacy of this treatment. Therefore, more research on the efficacy of orthotic management in rest is needed. We decided to focus on the efficacy of two types of KAFOs as orthotic management in rest treatment since we expect that KAFOs will be the most effective in preventing loss of ankle dorsiflexion range. This expectation is based on the fact that a KAFO, in contrast to an ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO), is able to impose both knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion simultaneously. This may lead to more stretch on the <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>which is the target muscle of this study. The <italic>Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>is often affected in children with spastic CP, having equines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To measure the efficacy of orthotic management in rest, the ankle dorsiflexion has to be measured in a reliable and valid way. In order to achieve that, a custom designed hand held dynamometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is used to measure the ankle dorsiflexion angle. The device allows reproducible measurements of the ankle angle-moment relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This is important as ankle dorsiflexion depends on the exerted dorsiflexion moment. Standardization of this measurement procedure reduces variability of ankle moment and angle measurements and hence increases the sensitivity to measure changes in ROM. Furthermore, the device allows the investigator to correct for foot deformations by using two separate adjustable foot plates (to stabilize the talonavicular joint) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Foot deformations like equinovarus and equinovalgus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] can, if not corrected, affect the ankle dorsiflexion measurement results.</p><p>The custom designed hand held dynamometer also allows us to measure morphological parameters of the <italic>medial Gastrocnemius muscle </italic>at a standardized ankle position during repeated measurements. By measuring changes in the morphological parameters and changes in ankle ROM simultaneously, we will gain insights into the working mechanisms of orthotic management in rest. As described in the methodological section we obtain the morphological parameters by a 3D ultrasound method. We decided to use this method instead of a 2D ultrasound technique, because 3D ultrasound offers the advantage of measuring the morphological parameters in the mid-longitudinal fascicle plane. Previous research has shown that measuring outside of the mid-longitudinal fascicle plane leads to over or under estimation of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome measure of this study (ankle dorsiflexion ROM) is an impairment parameters at the body-function level of the International Classification of Function, disability and health (ICF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Improvements (or less decline) in this parameter do not necessarily lead to improvements in activity level of the ICF model, such as walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). In order to better understand the impact of orthotic management during rest on activity level, this study will also investigate improvements in gait and gross motor function level in response to treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomised controlled trial is aimed to provide insight in the efficacy of orthotic management in rest on body function level (ankle dorsiflexion range of motion) and activity level (gait, gross motor function), and will provide insight in the treatment's underlying myological adaptive mechanisms. The results of this study may provide indications for improved treatment strategies for children with cerebral palsy and in particular the use of orthoses.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CP: Cerebral Palsy; ROM: Range Of Motion; KAFO: Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis; <italic>&#x02113;</italic><sub>(fasc)</sub>: Fascicle length; <italic>&#x02113;</italic><sub>m</sub>: Muscle belly length; A<sub>f</sub>: Physiological cross- sectional area; <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(fasc)</sub></italic>: Angle between fascicle and aponeurosis; <italic>&#x02113;</italic><sub>t</sub>: Tendon length; AFOs: Ankle-Foot Orthoses; <italic>&#x003b3;<sub>(f-t)</sub></italic>: Angle between the footplate of the foot fixation and the tibia; EMG: Electromyography; MVC: Maximal Voluntary muscle Contraction; GMFM-66 IS: Electromyography; GMFCS: Gross Motor Function Classification System; AOC: Angle Of Catch; SCALE: Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity; <italic>&#x02113;</italic><sub>(m th)</sub>: Muscle thickness; <italic>&#x02113;</italic><sub>a</sub>: Length of the aponeuroses; <italic>&#x02113;</italic>A<sub>f</sub>: Length component of the physiological cross-section; ICF: International Classification of Function, disability and health.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
