Two doses of vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly 4 weeks apart to 100 healthy adults 18&#x02013;39 years of age, randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive one of four DPIV formulations or saline placebo. The response to a third dose was evaluated in a subset of nine participants remote from primary vaccination. Humoral immunogenicity was assessed using a 50% microneutralization assay. All DPIV formulations were well tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed through 12 months after the second vaccine dose. In all DPIV groups, geometric mean antibody titers peaked at Day 56, waned through 6 months after the second vaccine dose, and then stabilized. In the nine subjects where boosting was evaluated, a strong anamnestic response was observed. These results support continuation of the clinical development of this dengue vaccine candidate (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01666652).</p></abstract></article-meta><notes notes-type="disclaimer"><p>Disclaimer: The opinions or assertions contained herein are the private views of the authors and are not to be construed as reflecting the official views of the U.S. Army or the U.S. Department of Defense.

The study was conducted at the Clinical Trials Center (CTC) at the WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice Belmont Principles, and other applicable regulatory and Department of Defense requirements. The protocol and associated documents were reviewed and approved by the WRAIR Institutional Review Board, the Office of Research Protections, Human Research Protection Office, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), and GSK Vaccines. Internal audits by separate teams from the U.S. Army and GSK Vaccines were also conducted.

Clinical lots were prepared following current good manufacturing practices at the WRAIR Pilot Bioproduction Facility, Silver Spring, MD.</p><p>Adjuvants used were alum (Alhydrogel 2%, Brenntag Biosector, Frederikssund, Denmark; 10.38 mg of Al<sup>3+</sup>/mL; after dilution, each 0.5-mL vaccine dose contains 500 &#x003bc;g of Al<sup>3+</sup>), and the GSK proprietary adjuvant systems AS01<sub>E</sub> and AS03<sub>B</sub>. AS01<sub>E</sub> is an adjuvant system containing 3-<italic>O</italic>-desacyl-4&#x02032;-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL; produced by GSK), QS-21 (<italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> Molina, fraction 21) (licensed by GSK from Antigenics Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc., a Delaware, U.S. corporation), and liposome (25 &#x003bc;g MPL and 25 &#x003bc;g QS-21). AS03<sub>B</sub> is an adjuvant system containing &#x003b1;-tocopherol and squalene in an o/w emulsion (5.93 mg tocopherol).</p><p>Four different formulations of the DPIV were used: 1 &#x003bc;g/serotype/dose adjuvanted with alum (1 &#x003bc;g + alum group), AS01<sub>E</sub> (1 &#x003bc;g + AS01<sub>E</sub> group) or AS03<sub>B</sub> (1 &#x003bc;g + AS03<sub>B</sub> group), and 4 &#x003bc;g/serotype/dose adjuvanted with alum (4 &#x003bc;g + alum group).</p><p>The formulations to be adjuvanted with AS01<sub>E</sub> and AS03<sub>B</sub> consisted of inactivated vaccine, vialed and freeze-dried. Each vial, corresponding to one dose, contained 1 &#x003bc;g of each DENV serotype. DPIV was reconstituted at the time of administration by mixing the freeze-dried product with the appropriate adjuvant system. To prepare DPIV with alum, monovalent bulk vaccine lots were first diluted in buffer and combined to create the tetravalent formulation at either 1 &#x003bc;g/serotype/dose or 4 &#x003bc;g/serotype/dose. The formulated, tetravalent bulk was adsorbed on alum for 1 hour, and then vialed and stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C.</p><p>A solution of 154 mM sodium chloride was used as placebo. Placebo and vaccine injection volumes were identical (0.5 mL).</p><p>All DPIV formulations and placebos were administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle at study days 0 and 28. The booster recipients received a third dose of the same vaccine formulation they received during primary vaccination (1 &#x003bc;g + AS01<sub>E</sub> or 4 &#x003bc;g + alum).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study participants.</title><p>Healthy male and female adults between 18 and 39 years of age were recruited by staff from the WRAIR CTC. Volunteers were provided with a detailed explanation of the study and enrolled after an informed consent process. Female participants had to be of nonchildbearing potential or abstinent, or had to use adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to vaccination, had a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and agreed to continue such precautions for 60 days after completion of the vaccination series. Volunteers initially seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were a history of chronic disease, chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse, receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 90 days preceding vaccination or planned administration during the study period, as well as clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>Participants were not screened for flavivirus antibodies at enrollment but the according-to-protocol (ATP) analysis of immunogenicity included only participants who were seronegative for all four DENV serotypes at baseline (microneutralization assay [MN50] titer &#x0003c; 1:10). Serostatus for DENV was determined after enrollment based on prevaccination blood samples.</p><p>In total, 100 participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive one of the four DPIV formulations or saline placebo. The randomization was performed using MATEX, a program developed for use in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Treatment allocation at the investigator site was performed using a central randomization system on internet. The experimental vaccination numbers were allocated by dose (dose 1 or dose 2). The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for center to determine the experimental vaccination box number to be used for the subject.</p><p>In the booster phase (15&#x02013;21 months after the second vaccine dose), eligible participants were healthy adults, who had completed the primary study and received two doses of either the 1 &#x003bc;g + AS01<sub>E</sub> or the 4 &#x003bc;g + alum vaccine formulation in the primary phase. Randomly ordered listings of subjects in those two groups were used to target enrollment of five subjects per group&#x02014;with the possibility to have subjects from the other group added in case less than five subjects consented to participate in one group. Additionally, participants were excluded from the booster phase if they had received any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to booster vaccination.</p><p>A small subset of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 9) from the 4 &#x003bc;g + alum (<italic>N</italic> = 3) and 1 &#x003bc;g + AS01<sub>E</sub> (<italic>N</italic> = 6) were enrolled in the booster phase after an informed consent process and vaccinated with the same formulation as the primary doses.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Blinding.</title><p>The study was observer-blind, with the vaccine/placebo recipients and those responsible for the evaluation of all study endpoints being unaware of treatment assignments. Vaccine preparation was performed at the WRAIR Pilot Bioproduction Facility and administration of the vaccine was done at the WRAIR CTC by nurse coordinators who did not participate in any of the clinical study evaluation activities. The laboratories in charge of testing were blinded with regard to treatment allocation, and codes were used to link the subject and study to each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Safety evaluation.</title><p>Solicited injection site and general adverse events (AEs) were recorded on diary cards for 7 days after each dose. Solicited injection site AEs included pain, redness, and swelling. Solicited general AEs included fatigue, fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain), joint pain, and muscle ache. Intensities of each AE were scored as grades 1&#x02013;3, with grade 3 fever defined as an oral body temperature &#x02265; 39&#x000b0;C, grade 3 redness and swelling defined as &#x02265; 101-mm diameter around the injection site, and all other grade 3 AEs defined as those events preventing normal daily activity.</p><p>Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 28 days after each dose, and were coded with the use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Serious adverse events (SAEs), potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs), and medically attended events (MAEs) were recorded throughout the entire study period. SAEs were defined as medically significant events, including those AEs resulting in hospitalization, disability, or death. pIMDs are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune etiology. An MAE is an AE for which the subject received medical attention defined as hospitalization, an emergency room visit, or a visit to or from medical personnel.</p><p>Safety laboratory assessments, including a complete blood count (red blood cell count, white blood cell count [WBC], hemoglobin [Hgb], hematocrit, platelet count, differential and a calculated absolute neutrophil count), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and total and direct bilirubin, were performed prior to, 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, and 3 (M4), 6 (M7), 9 (M10), and 12 (M13) months after the second dose. In the booster phase, the safety laboratory assessments were not repeated at screening if they were performed and found to be within acceptable ranges within 90 days of the planned booster vaccination. All safety-related clinical laboratory values were reviewed and all abnormal values were assessed by the investigators as clinically significant or not, with respect to safety.</p><p>Because this was an FTiH study, several additional safety measures were incorporated into the study design. Enrollment occurred in two waves, starting with enrollment and evaluation of the safety data collected up to 7 days postvaccination for 20 participants (four participants per group), prior to enrollment and administration of study vaccine to Wave 2 subjects. A Safety Review Committee reviewed unblinded safety data at three scheduled intervals. The first scheduled review took place once the 20 participants from Wave 1 had completed the 7 days of safety follow-up post-dose 1 (Days 0&#x02013;6) and included all safety data available up to this time point. After the first scheduled Safety Review Committee review resulted in a recommendation to proceed and the sponsor approved, the second dose was administered to participants from Wave 1, and participants from Wave 2 were enrolled and vaccinated. The second scheduled review took place once the 20 participants in Wave 1 had completed the 7 days of safety follow-up post-dose 2 and included all available safety data from both waves. Dose 2 administration to Wave 2 participants occurred after the second unblinded safety report was reviewed by the Safety Review Committee, resulted in a recommendation to proceed, and was approved by the sponsor. The third scheduled review took place once 60 volunteers were enrolled, and Day 7 post-dose 1 safety data were available for all 60 volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Immunogenicity assessment.</title><p>Blood samples were collected on the day of each vaccination and 28 days after each dose, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the second dose, that is, M4, M7, and M13 in the primary vaccination phase; prevaccination, 7, and 28 days postvaccination in the booster phase. To characterize DPIV immunogenicity, anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies (Nab) were determined for the above-mentioned time points. Antibodies to each DENV serotype were measured at the Pilot Bioproduction Facility, WRAIR, using a 96-well quantitative MN50 performed in Vero cells as previously described.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Seropositivity was defined as a titer &#x02265; 1:10.

These assessments are ongoing and will be published at a later time.</p><p>Antibody avidity, a measure of antibody quality described previously,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> was also determined for pre- and postvaccination sera. Briefly, 50 &#x003bc;L/well of DENV antigen (sucrose gradient-purified live virus) were coated onto 96-well high-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Costar 2592) and stored overnight at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C. After incubation, the plates were blocked with 300 &#x003bc;L/well of antibody-blocking diluent (ABD), consisting of nonfat dry milk in 1&#x000d7; phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 minutes at 20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C. Heat-inactivated test serum samples diluted 1:100 in ABD were added to quadruplicate wells of DENV antigen-coated wells (50 &#x003bc;L/well). After 2 hours at 35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C incubation, the wells were aspirated and half of the wells were incubated for 10 minutes at 20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C with 200 &#x003bc;L/well of 1&#x000d7; PBS, whereas the other half of the wells were incubated with 200 &#x003bc;L/well of 8 M urea. After a 10-minute incubation, bound IgG was detected by washing all the plates five times with 1&#x000d7; PBS and adding a qualified dilution of goat-anti-human IgG-horse radish peroxidase (HRP 04-10-06, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) in ABD (50 &#x003bc;L/well) to all the wells. After 1 hour at 35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C, the plates were washed five times with 1&#x000d7; PBS and bound antibodies were visualized by adding 50 &#x003bc;L/well of tetramethylbenzidine. After 8&#x02013;10 minutes of blue color development, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 &#x003bc;L/well of a 1:25 dilution of phosphoric acid. The plates were read immediately at a wavelength of 450 nm. The optical density (OD) values for each serum sample were normalized by subtracting OD values obtained using the ELISA blanks (negative-normal human sera) for each 96-well plate. The avidity index (AI) was expressed as the ratio of the OD of wells treated with urea to the OD of wells treated without urea (1 &#x000d7; PBS) and converted to a percentage value.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>This study was exploratory; thus, all analyses were descriptive, with no statistical comparisons performed. The analysis of safety and reactogenicity in the primary phase was performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC; i.e., all participants who received at least one vaccine dose), and the immunogenicity analysis in the primary phase was based on the ATP cohorts for immunogenicity at D56, M7, and M13 (initially seronegative participants who met all eligibility criteria, complied with protocol procedures, had no elimination criteria during the study, and had immunogenicity data available at D56, M4, M7, and M13). In the booster phase, safety analysis was performed on the booster TVC (all participants who received the booster dose) and the immunogenicity analysis was based on the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity, which included all booster-vaccinated participants (i.e., those who met all eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol, and had no elimination criteria) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available prebooster and 28 days postbooster.</p><p>The percentage of doses followed by each individual solicited injection site and general AE were recorded by group with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Although titers in the AS01 and AS03 groups were higher than in the high-dose alum group, it is uncertain whether two doses of vaccine administered 1 month apart can provide long-term protection from disease for flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve vaccinees. GMTs waned in the preclinical studies as well, but peak titers and plateau titers after M7 were higher in nonhuman primates than in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve human subjects.

Longitudinal studies for these licensed vaccines, containing similar amounts of viral protein (6 &#x003bc;g and 1.5 &#x003bc;g for JEV and TBEV, respectively) adjuvanted with alum show that the decline in GMTs following the primary series is pronounced during the first year and then levels off.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Nab waning is expected, and the intent of vaccination is to induce sufficient immunologic memory so that adaptive immune responses are robust, swift, and protective when natural infection occurs.

Despite the apparent superiority of the DPIV formulations compared with LAV, in terms of peak Nab titers, it is not clear yet whether Nab titers, as currently determined, represents a mechanistic or nonmechanistic immune correlate of protection (CoP). Based on other licensed flavivirus vaccines (Japanese encephalitis, Yellow fever) where correlates exist, one would assume that Nab titers are the best candidate for a CoP for dengue fever. However, preliminary assessments of clinical efficacy and immunogenicity data (plaque-reduction neutralization test) for a chimeric LAV dengue vaccine in a majority primed population did not support this assumption.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Ongoing work in this field, including separate assessment of flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve and flavivirus-primed subjects, as well as modification of Nab assay methodology and utilization of cell-mediated immunity assays, will help to better understand the contribution of humoral and cellular responses to protection from disease.</p><p>A booster dose of DPIV, administered in the second year post primary vaccination, induced a strong anamnestic response against all four DENV serotypes (3- to 1,438-fold increase for DENV-1, 21- to 3,285-fold increase for DENV-2, 12- to 1,318-fold increase for DENV-3, and 35- to 8,016-fold increase for DENV-4), irrespective of vaccine formulation (alum- or AS01<sub>E</sub>-adjuvanted). Although long-term persistence data for the boost is lacking, the quantitative response to a booster dose is cause for optimism. Two subjects in the booster cohort, Subject A and E, had unexpected Nab titer kinetics (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) that could suggest flavivirus priming (Subject A, high plateau after dose 2) and exposure to a flavivirus while on study (Subject E, titer rise after M7). History regarding prior exposure, flavivirus vaccination, and travel were negative, however.</p><p>This report has several limitations. First, the study presented is a small phase 1 study with 20 subjects per treatment. Only descriptive statistics are provided and the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences between groups, neither with regard to immunogenicity nor to safety. Second, only 1 year of follow-up data on the entire cohort are reported here, and only humoral immunogenicity endpoints. Cellular immunity testing is ongoing and will be included in a subsequent report. Lastly, the booster dose was only administered to a few subjects and only two of the formulations were evaluated in an exploratory manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This investigational DPIV had an acceptable safety profile in 100 volunteers 18&#x02013;39 years of age. The 4 &#x003bc;g alum&#x02013;adjuvanted as well as the AS03<sub>B</sub>- and AS01<sub>E</sub>-adjuvanted formulations induced high and balanced Nab responses to all four DENV serotypes 1 month after second vaccine dose in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve healthy adult subjects. Nab titers waned during the first 6 months post-dose 2 and then stabilized at various levels depending on the formulation. A booster dose in the second year after primary vaccination induced strong anamnestic responses in two groups and in a limited number of participants, suggesting that B-cell memory lasts beyond the first year after primary vaccination. These FTiH study results support continuation of the clinical development of this dengue vaccine candidate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Guisele Ballarini, Kareem Kabra, Amy Dean, Wang Mi, Kendra Washington, Sandy Gibson, Russell Olson, and Shannon Peavy from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for their active involvement in generating the microneutralization data, Elodie Tournay for statistical support, Fanny Naessens for data management, Aur&#x000e9;lie Delaigle (GSK) for dengue project management, Debbie Daehnick for clinical study report writing, and the GSK clinical operation team for study management.
