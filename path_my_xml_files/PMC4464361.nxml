The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of GPER on cardiocyte apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) in H9C2 myocardial cells. H9C2 cells were treated with a specific GPER agonist (G1), 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) or the vehicle. The cells were subjected to 20 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. They were then randomly assigned to three experimental groups: Control, G1, E2. B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) levels were measured, Hoechst 33258 staining was performed to assess apoptosis, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) levels were determined. To test the specificity of G1, GPER-knockout cells were treated with G1 and analyzed as stated above. Compared with the vehicle-treated groups, G1 and E2-treated groups exhibited elevated Bcl-2 levels, decreased Bax levels and cell apoptosis, significantly increased SOD and ATP levels and decreased TNF-&#x003b1; levels following ischemia-reperfusion. However, G1 had no evident effects on the GPER-knockout cells. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GPER activation provided a cardioprotective effect following ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting cardiocyte apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor 30</kwd><kwd>ischemia-reperfusion injury</kwd><kwd>cardiocyte apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cardioprotection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Estrogen has protective effects in cardiovascular function (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The biological effects of estrogen are mainly mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs). Two classic nuclear ER isoforms, ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, are encoded by separate genes and have differential distribution within tissues and cells. These receptors have been demonstrated to be expressed in both neonatal (<xref rid="b2-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and adult (<xref rid="b3-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) cardiac myocytes.</p><p>In addition to the classic ERs, a G protein-coupled ER (GPER) has been found to be expressed in cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="b4-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Notably, the majority of studies which have examined ER localization with cardiac cells did not find a difference in the distribution or abundance between males and females (<xref rid="b3-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a novel G protein-coupled receptor 30, GPR30, here referred to as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), that binds directly to estrogen and mediates its action (<xref rid="b6-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have discovered coagulable cytolysis around the ischemic myocardial infarction zone without the presence of infiltration of inflammatory cells, a phenomenon similar to the morphological changes of apoptosis (<xref rid="b11-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, apoptotic cells began to appear in the ischemic margin 1 h following ischemia, and the number of the apoptotic cells increased with time and peaked at 5 h following ischemia, suggesting apoptosis may be a main feature of myocardial ischemia (<xref rid="b12-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>GPER activation improved functional recovery and reduced the infarct size in isolated rat hearts following ischemia and reperfusion (<xref rid="b13-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The potential role and the mechanism of GPER activation in cardioprotection is an important topic under investigation. The aims of the present study were to examine the role of GPER activation in cardiocyte apoptosis and SOD, TNF-&#x003b1;, ATPase expression by using a specific GPER agonist (G1) (<xref rid="b14-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) in H9C2 myocardial cells following ischemia-reperfusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Model preparation</title><p>H9C2 myocardial cells were subjected to 20 min of ischemia (in a hypoxia chamber filled with 95% N<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C) followed by 120 min of reperfusion (with 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C). The cells were then randomly assigned to three experimental groups (n=5/group): The control G1 (a GPER-specific agonist; 10 nmol/l) and E2 (1 nmol/l) groups (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

To further confirm the relative expression of Bcl-2 in both strains, western blot analysis was also performed, and the Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly enhanced in the G1 and E2 groups (<xref rid="f1-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To confirm that the G1-induced effects were due to the specific activation of GPER, G1 was administered 5 min prior to ischemia in the GPER-knockout H9C2 cells. No evident effects were found in the GPER-knockout H9C2 cells (<xref rid="f1-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and D</xref>).

The results of the present study demonstrated the protection of H9C2 cells via activation of GPER. Haas <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b18-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) concluded that GPER contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, suggesting the possibility that a number of the known vasculoprotective effects of estrogen involve GPER activation. Jean and Mansoureh (<xref rid="b19-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) reported the acute G1 treatment significantly reduced the infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion in isolated hearts from male mice. In the present study, it was identified that GPER activation inhibited cardiocyte apoptosis, significantly increased SOD, ATP and decreased the TNF-&#x003b1; expression level following ischemia-reperfusion. Additionally, the G1-mediated effects were eradicated in H9C2 cells. Taken together, these results provide evidence that GPER is the primary receptor responsible for long-term cellular changes leading to cardioprotection in H9C2 cells. Therefore the cardioprotective action of estrogen may involve the activation of GPER.</p><p>Besides activation by E2, each of these ER isoforms has specific pharmacological agonists. Bopassa <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b19-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) have demonstrated that acute G1 treatment considerably improves the recovery of cardiac function following ischemia-reperfusion. Similarly, a recent study demonstrated that G1 treatment of isolated rat hearts is cardioprotective during ischemia-reperfusion (<xref rid="b13-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion is an acute and severe injury and the extensive apoptosis and necrosis of cardiomyocytes at the earliest stage of reperfusion accounts for the majority of clinical manifestations (<xref rid="b20-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For a long time, necrosis was regarded as the sole cause of cell death in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, a recent study indicated that apoptosis also has an important role in the process of cardiomyocyte damage (<xref rid="b21-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Bcl-2 and Bax are two proteins that are directly involved in apoptosis signaling. Therefore, in the present study, the contribution of Bcl-2 and Bax to myocardial cell apoptosis induced by I/R was examined. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2 were evaluated 120 min following reperfusion subsequent to pretreatment with E2 or G1; however, the mRNA and protein expression of Bax decreased 120 min following reperfusion. The above cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 for detecting apoptotic cells. Compared with the cells subjected to I/R, pretreatment with E2 and G1 inhibited cell apoptosis. To confirm that the G1-induced effects were due to the specific activation of GPER, G1 was administered 5 min prior to ischemia in GPER-knockout H9C2 cells. No evident effects were found in the GPER-knockout H9C2 cells.</p><p>It is well established that the activation of SOD during I/R has an important role in the modulation of the cardioprotection. Liesa <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b22-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) reported that increasing SOD shortly prior to the onset of ischemia represents an improved strategy to improve the functional recovery from I/R. The present study demonstrated an increase in SOD levels induced by administering G1 and E2 in H9C2 cells prior to ischemia-reperfusion. In the GPER-knockout H9C2 cells, no elevation was identified. These data indicated that GPER activation by G1 induced cardioprotection.</p><p>Despite the appearance of numerous cytokines following myocardial ischemia, the elevation of TNF-&#x003b1; expression was shown to only be apparent during reperfusion (<xref rid="b23-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; may have an important role during the activation of the neutrophilic granulocytes (<xref rid="b12-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;, have emerged as significant contributors to myocardial dysfunction (<xref rid="b25-mmr-12-02-2425" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the present study, it was demonstrated that E2 and G1 treatment lead to the degradation of TNF-&#x003b1; following I/R. By contrast, G1 had no evident effects on the GPER-knockout H9C2 cells.</p><p>It was also identified that ATPase expression was enhanced in E2- and G1-pretreated H9C2 cells following I/R, and this effect of G1 was eliminated in GPER-knockout H9C2 cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that GPER activation protected cadiocytes following ischemia-reperfusion, which was evident from the inhibition of apoptosis, elevation of SOD and ATPase as well as reduction of TNF-&#x003b1;. These results enhance the understanding of the GPER activation-induced cardioprotection following ischemia-reperfusion. Additionally, the present study offers a potentially unique therapy in terms of a selective estrogen receptor modulator that confers cardio-protection without the increased risk for cancer. However, the mechanism through which the activation of GPER inhibits cardiocyte apoptosis remains to be investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was
