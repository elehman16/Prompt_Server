As part of an urban health initiative, the marketplace clinics located in nearby CVS, Target, and Supervalu stores committed financial support, providers, certified educators, and pharmacy staff for a community-based diabetes support group. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To measure the extent to which collaborating marketplace clinics and the community-based support group expanded diabetes care and provided self-management education for this largely urban Indian neighborhood. <bold>Methods:</bold> A controlled quasi-experimental study and 3-years retrospective analysis of secondary data were used to test whether the Minneapolis marketplace clinics and the community diabetes support group participants (n = 48) had improved diabetes health outcomes relative to the comparison group (n = 87). The marketplace complemented intervention group employed motivational interviewing and the patient activation measure (PAM&#x000ae;) in coaching diabetes self-care and behavioral modification. The federally funded comparison group received only basic self-management education. <bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>T</italic> tests and effect sizes were used to quantify the difference between the study intervention and comparison groups.

Most urban residing American Indian persons prefer to be referred to as &#x0201c;urban Indian&#x0201d; and such designation will be observed throughout this article.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to measure the extent to which collaborating marketplace clinics and community-based support groups expanded diabetes care and provided self-management education for this largely urban Indian neighborhood. The marketplace clinics located in nearby CVS, Target, and Supervalu stores committed financial support, certified educators, and pharmacy staff for the community-based support group. In our research, we focused on determining the extent to which marketplace clinics can expand health service access and promote complementary care for community-based diabetes support groups, such as A Partnership of Diabetics (APOD).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Current national and regional vital statistics had already indicated a diabetes health disparity among the Minneapolis American Indian population. National Health Survey (2010) reports show the 14.3% Minneapolis urban Indian diabetes prevalence is more than 2.5 times higher than the general population (5.3%).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The Urban Indian Health Institute, predicted that such disparate rates would have serious consequences for the Minneapolis American Indian population of 20&#x02009;000, including the nearly 3000 individuals and families suffering from diabetes-related illnesses.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The Minneapolis metropolitan area has many highly regarded health services and several outstanding health care leaders. Stressing the need for universal health care, former Health Partners and Kaiser CEO, George Halvorson proclaimed, &#x0201c;We need the courage to actually reform care&#x0201d; and bring health market forces together for the benefit of everyone.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Historically, for many upper Mississippian Native people, such transformative leadership was engendered by legendary Ojibwe Chief Hole-in-the-Day.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The American Indian Movement (AIM) and its chairman Clyde Bellecourt have sponsored and long sustained Minneapolis urban Indian health care services.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The 2015 study was conducted in concert with the principal author&#x02019;s dissertation review committee.

Based on their research, distinguished Health Partners family medicine physicians published evidence that clinical practices and community-based programs can work well together in advancing preventive care and improving health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Mayo Clinic researchers described how lower costs may be achieved by referring chronic patients to community-based health care programs.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Predictions that CVS/MinuteClinics disruptive innovation would emerge as the champion health reform implementer have not materialized.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> CVS has pulled out of many inner-city markets and has seemingly left the low-income marketplace to public health providers. The CVS/Allina strategic partnership is attempting to fill the void by instituting a community health promotion program referred to as the Backyard Initiative.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Our study evaluates whether such community health promotion, self-management education, and activation can have positive and beneficial effects for all, including the urban Indian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2150131917720556"><title>Methods</title><p>As applied research, we compared the diabetes health outcomes between the marketplace complemented group (APOD) and the federally funded Urban Indian Health Organization (UIHO). The central research question asked whether Minneapolis marketplace clinics could broaden their business plans and complement community-based diabetes care. Quantitative study methods consisted of 2 parts. First, we tested the extent to which the diabetes clinical outcome measures improved more for the marketplace-complemented, community-based group than for the federally-funded group. Second, we queried the community-based study group patient activation measure (PAM&#x000ae;) scores and attendant diabetes outcome measures.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>During the preliminary data review, we determined that a classical experimental design was not a good fit for this sample population.

During the 3-year study period, the CVS/Allina strategic partnership provided financial support of $50&#x02009;000 per year and complemented community-based diabetes care. Observable management interaction saw many instances where CVS, Target, and Supervalu marketplace clinics and their administration, providers, certified educators, and pharmacy staff engaged with and reached out to medically underserved and urban Indian persons with diabetes.</p><p>Additionally, the standardized PAM&#x000ae; survey instrument provided a strong study framework and a unifying influence among study researchers, group coordination, and participants. When the survey questions were read, discussed, and understood by the APOD participants, there was acceptance and consensus. The collective opportunity of helping one another was compelling. Not feeling alone with one&#x02019;s problems; while instead cultivating physical activity, better diet, and not delaying seeking care empowered proactive consumer behaviors such as preparing a list of questions for a doctor visit, and patient-activated self-management practices. The PAM&#x000ae; survey instrument was used to coordinate APOD motivational interviewing practices and quantify elements of access, cultural awareness, and continuity of care. Throughout the study, this community-based support group led by example to build a complementary network for this cross-cultural, medically underserved, and urban Indian community. The marketplace clinics continued outreach, and APODs commitment facilitated an ability to conduct a sufficiently large (n = 135) and lengthy 3-year comparative evaluation.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. First, we had a relatively small population and sample size. Second, our secondary data use agreement with the APOD Coordinator, was limited to participant responses to the PAM&#x000ae; survey and deidentified APOD attendance data with corresponding A1C, weight, height, and BP measures. Perhaps because of the relatively small number of participants, there was sensitivity and reluctance to provide demographic characteristics such as age, gender, or other potentially identifiable information. Because of the limited data set restriction, we were unable to fully address any demographic differences among the intervention and nonintervention groups. Going forward, more specific group comparative analysis should be done with a larger sample size and a more comprehensive data set to explore possible subgroup differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section8-2150131917720556"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This quasi-experimental with a comparison group study was conducted primarily to examine the effect of diabetes patient empowerment, activation, and community-based support with regard to improved A1C, BMI, and BP outcomes. Comparison between groups by diabetes trend (A1C) showed a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01), medium intervention effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51) that is comparable to similar cultural and ethnic minority studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2150131917720556" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The 3-year study found that the diabetes intervention was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .04), yet small for BMI (<italic>d</italic> = 0.39) and negligible for BP. The APOD intervention group study found significantly improved 6-month pretest-posttest A1C (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), BMI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .002), and PAM&#x000ae; measures, as well as large effect sizes.</p><p>The advantages of marketplace clinics complemented community-based diabetes care were verified, and new insights revealed the positive effect of the collaborative self-management intervention on diabetic patient activation levels. The marketplace engagement and financial support provided APOD start-up resources. In fact, the CVS/Allina strategic partnership provided financial support of $50,000 per year and complemented APOD community-based diabetes support. For nearly 4 years, APOD provided leadership, social support, and cross-cultural community outreach to build a complementary network.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that motivational interviewing and the PAM&#x000ae; was applied as a community-based self-management intervention in a cross-cultural setting including urban Indian persons with diabetes. There are hundreds of articles confirming that the urban Indian subpopulation lacks primary health care and is particularly at risk of increased diabetes incidence without expanded health access. However, very few evidence-based research articles, discuss matters of critical concern for the urban Indian community. That is, whether limited access to affordable health care deprives the underserved urban Indian population of fully integrated health service. The clinical significance of this study is that it accepts the urban Indian health disparity challenge and commits action research toward urban Indian health improvement.</p><p>The positive social implications drawn from these results are 2-fold. First, the marketplace and community-based complementary network offers resources, increased access to quality care which may have benefit in reduced diabetes health disparity. The second benefit comes as marketplace resources are matched with Indian Health Service resources and steps are taken to share these pooled resources more equitably with the urban Indian two-thirds majority of the United States&#x02019; 5 million American Indian population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study could not have been completed without the kind communicative interaction with the Minneapolis, Phillips and Little Earth of United Tribes communities.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e801"><title>Author Biographies</title><p><bold>Robert Rick</bold>, PhD, MPH, BSE, is a faculty member at Bemidji State University, Minneapolis Metro Area Business Administration and has a combined 25 years with Minnesota state and public/private industry.
