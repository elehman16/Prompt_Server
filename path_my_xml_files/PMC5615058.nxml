The premise of specialized early intervention (SEI) services is that intervention in the early years of illness can affect long-term outcomes. In this study, we investigate whether DUP affects treatment response after 5 years of SEI treatment compared to 2 years of SEI treatment. As part of a randomized controlled trial testing the effect of prolonged SEI treatment 400 participants diagnosed within the schizophrenia spectrum were recruited. For this specific study participants were dichotomized based on DUP, treatment delay, and time from first symptom until start of SEI treatment. The groups were analyzed with regard to treatment response on psychopathology, level of functioning, and cognitive functioning. The participants with a short DUP had a tendency to respond better to the prolonged treatment with regards to disorganized and negative dimension. For participants with short duration from first symptom until start of SEI treatment there was a significant difference on the negative dimension favoring the prolonged OPUS treatment. The finding of an effect of prolonged treatment for participants with a short total treatment delay could mean that prolonged SEI treatment is more beneficial than treatment as usual (TAU) so long as it is provided in the early years of illness and not just in the early years after diagnosis.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Treatment timing: The earlier the better</title><p id="Par3">The duration of untreated psychosis influences the long-term outcomes of treatment. Nikolai Albert, at the Copenhagen Mental Health Centre, and a team of Danish researchers have investigated the effects of a specialized early intervention program (OPUS) in 400 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and compared the effects of OPUS after two and five years. Their findings suggest that five years of specialized early intervention was most beneficial when the total duration from symptom start to treatment was shorter than 6 months. The treatment was particularly effective at improving patients&#x02019; disorganized behavior and negative symptoms such as blunted emotions and lack of motivation. These findings support previous studies suggesting that patients are more responsive to treatment in the early years of illness and highlight the importance of avoiding delays within the mental health service provision.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The critical phase theory from which early intervention in the psychosis field grew was proposed in the early to mid-nineties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Based on studies of patients with first-episode schizophrenia it appeared that the first 5 years after onset of illness were more fluctuating compared to the later years, when symptom level and functional deficits seemed to stabilize.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Based on this background, it was suggested that interventions in the early years could have a disproportionally large impact on the long-term outcome of the illness than interventions in the more static later years. Randomized clinical trials have confirmed that psycho-social treatment programs with assertive treatment, social-skill training, and family involvement can exert an impact on the early course of first-episode psychosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> The effects seen on long-term outcomes have been more contradictory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> The specialized early intervention (SEI) programs that were established in many developed countries typically treat patients from 1 to 3 years after their initial diagnosis, not for the entire first 5 years as originally suggested.</p><p id="Par5">Even if the intent of the SEI treatment is to treat patients as early as possible after onset of illness, implementation of SEI services has not uniformly led to a reduction in the time from onset until treatment start.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Subsequently, another part of the early intervention movement focused on the impact of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and initiatives to reduce the time from onset of illness to initiation of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The DUP has been found in several studies and meta-analyses to have an impact on clinical and functional outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Whether DUP is a marker or determinant of outcome has been debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and several predictors of outcome have been found to be associated with DUP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> One of these is mode of onset; it has been argued that DUP is a marker of onset mode rather than an independent predictor of outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> It is still assumed that DUP is one of the few malleable predictors of outcome and, therefore, should be a focus for intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> One large randomized clinical trial, testing the effect of society-level awareness campaigns to reduce the DUP, showed that the campaigns significantly reduced the DUP and thereby positively affect the functional level 10 years later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>

If the aim of the SEI treatment is to provide high-resource treatment as early as possible after first symptoms and at least within the first 5 years of illness, it is imperative that the DUP not be so long as to place the treatment outside of the critical phase.</p><p id="Par7">Using data from a study of prolonged SEI treatment with no integrated program to shorten DUP we explored (a) whether DUP influenced treatment response, (b) whether delays within the mental health systems exerted an influence on response to the SEI treatment, (c) whether mode of onset was associated with DUP, and (d) whether mode of onset could explain the effect of DUP on outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Baseline values</title><p id="Par8">A total of 317 participants had a psychotic diagnosis within the schizophrenia spectrum.

We found a trend effect in the intervention group on disorganized dimension and negative dimension for participants with a DUP &#x0003c;3 months. We did not find any beneficial effects of prolonged SEI treatment for the group with a treatment delay of &#x0003c;3 months; however, sensitivity analyses indicated a significant interaction on the psychotic dimension and trend for negative symptoms and remission. Participants who had a total treatment delay shorter than 6 months had a more favorable response to the intervention treatment on the negative symptoms than those with a total treatment delay of more than 6 months. Even though mode of onset was significantly associated with DUP, there was no evidence that it could explain the enhanced treatment response seen in the short DUP group.</p><p id="Par16">DUP has been found to predict outcome in several studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> but there is no agreement on what duration should be considered long. One study divided DUP into five groups (0&#x02013;7, 7&#x02013;28, 28&#x02013;90, 90&#x02013;365, and &#x0003e;365 days) and found that the three shortest groups had more favorable outcomes than the longest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Another study grouped DUP at 1 month, 3 months and 1 year and found effects on the psychotic symptoms at the 8-year follow-up favoring participants with a DUP shorter than 3 months, but remission rates were higher only in the group with a DUP shorter than 1 month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of the effect of DUP found significant effect on outcome, but there was no effect of what threshold the included studies had used to dichotomize between short and long DUP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> We chose a relative low cutoff point in our primary analyses to ensure that most of the SEI treatment had been delivered within the 5-year critical period.</p><p id="Par17">One of SEI treatment&#x02019;s major achievements has been its ability to affect negative symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and our findings suggest that this is also true of prolonged SEI treatment provided that the treatment is provided within the first years of illness. These results are in line with the RAISE study, which found that patients with a short DUP (&#x02264;74 weeks) benefited substantially more from the 2-year intervention treatment than those with a long DUP (&#x0003e;74 weeks).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Both these studies support the critical period hypothesis, which suggests that the later static years (plateau phase) are less receptive to treatment interventions and that the window of opportunity for changing the course of schizophrenia is within the first 5 years of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par18">A recent study investigating differences in outcome based on onset of either medical treatment, SEI treatment, or both combined indicated that the beneficial impact of short DUP on outcome was strongest if the end of DUP was defined as both adequate medical treatment and enrollment in a SEI program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Our finding of an effect on the negative symptoms for participants with a total treatment delay of &#x0003c;6 months support the notion that adequate treatment for patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia should be considered both medical treatment and psycho-social treatment.</p><p id="Par19">We found no effect of reducing the treatment delay to 3 months, but dichotomizing the treatment delay at 6 months showed tendencies on three domains. We do not believe that this result is due to a special effect of the arbitrary 6 months dichotomizing; the finding could be due either to a type I error in the former or a type II error in the latter. Since the number of participants was increased in the secondary analyses with treatment delay dichotomized at 6 months, that these results are more likely to be closer to the true impact. This would imply that, in addition to looking into methods to shorten the DUP, we should also be aware of the importance of delays within mental health services and strive to make referral to relevant treatment facilities as prompt and effective as possible.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="Par20">This study is a sub-group analysis; the power calculations were not made to detect differences within these smaller populations. Therefore, the risk of type I and type II errors is enhanced. We, therefore, view this study as an exploratory study and caution that results should be viewed as indicative, not as definitive. However, a study such as this is important for suggesting further directions for research. Also, there is an attrition bias toward the least ill at baseline being more likely to attend the follow-up interview. We corrected for this using multiple imputations, setting the number of imputations as high as 100. At both assessment points we used raters blinded to randomization and at follow-up the raters were blinded for baseline results. Clinicians and participants were not blinded. We randomized a relatively large group; randomization procedures were carried out at an external site with investigators blinded to allocation sequence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par21">Given the nature of the study we cannot draw any definitive conclusions on the moderating effect of DUP on the response to prolonged SEI treatment. Prior studies of SEI treatment have shown effect of treatment for shorter programs (1&#x02013;3 years). The primary study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> of the effect of prolonged SEI treatment did not find any effect on the functional, cognitive, or psychopathological domains; however, this study finds that prolonged SEI treatment have a beneficial effect on negative symptoms, and suggests effects on other psychopathological domains, given that the treatment is provided early in the course of illness. Our findings support the critical period hypothesis in that the first years after illness onset seem to be more receptive to interventional treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par22">This study was a sub-group analysis of participants from a large randomized superiority trial, The OPUS II study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> The main study was set up to test the effect of 5 years of SEI treatment compared to 2 years of SEI treatment followed by 3 years of standard treatment.

The treatment delay, therefore, reflects the referral time to OPUS treatment. If there were waiting lists for OPUS treatment, patients were treated by the community health center while they were waiting. The treatment delay might in some cases reflect a long hospitalization or that patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia but discontinued from treatment before their referral to OPUS and at a later time started their specialized treatment. Patients who were hospitalized or treated in community health centers prior to start of their OPUS treatment would routinely be prescribed antipsychotic medication, but we have no estimate as to the extent to which this actually occurred or if patients were compliant with the treatment. Duration was dichotomized into short treatment delay (&#x02264;3 months) and long treatment delay (&#x0003e;3 months).</p><p id="Par33">Finally, the DUP and the treatment delay were added together into one variable, Total treatment delay, and this variable was dichotomized into short total treatment delay (&#x02264;6 months) and long total treatment delay (&#x0003e;6 months). This variable gave an estimate of the time from first psychotic symptom until initiation of the recommended OPUS treatment.</p><p id="Par34">We chose a rather short DUP as cutoff because we wanted to ensure that the prolonged 5-year treatment was provided within the first years after onset of illness. However, given the arbitrary nature of any dichotomizing, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which the DUP and treatment delay were dichotomized at 6 months and total treatment delay was dichotomized at 9 months. For the DUP, we also conducted sensitivity analyses dichotomizing the DUP around 1 month. OPUS teams are part of the adult mental health services and, therefore, patients who are diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder prior to their 18th birthday are treated in adolescent services until their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.
