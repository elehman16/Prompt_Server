It can reduce the chemical drugs induced toxic effects to improve the quality of life (QOL). This study applies the highest quality of clinical trial methodology to examine the role of TCM in improving QOL of postoperative non-small-cell lung cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Four hundred eighty patients will be recruited into seven different research centers in China. These patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into either a treatment group or a placebo group. Each group will receive treatments of 3-weekly chemotherapy with TCM or placebo for four cycles. The primary outcome will involve the evaluation of QOL and the secondary outcome assessments will include two-year disease-free survival rate and disease-free survival. Other efficacy assessments are changes of TCM symptoms and toxicity. Side effects and safety profile of the therapy would be evaluated at the same time. The investigators expect that TCM therapy combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy solely in terms of QOL improvement and disease-free survival extension. "Intention-to-treat" analysis will include all randomized participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from the clinical trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with or without TCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov (Identifier: NCT01441752).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, accounting for 26&#x02013;29% of all cancer deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Increasingly, lung cancer is becoming a global health problem, with greater than 1 million deaths annually attributed to lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer diagnoses and more than 75% of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, the prognosis for NSCLC continues to remain poor, with a 5-year survival of 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>At present, the high rate of recurrence and metastasis of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is one of the leading causes resulting in failure of treating lung cancer. More than 35% of postoperative lung cancer patients with stage I died in 5&#x02009;years due to recurrence or metastasis; the 5-year survival rate of stage II, IIIa, IIIb was 31%, 17.9% and 11.7% respectively. The survival rate was improved by 5% with adjuvant chemotherapy after resection, so regimen consist of platinum-based two chemical medicines are commended as the adjuvant chemotherapy for treating postoperative NSCLC patients, but the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting, hair loss, and bone-marrow depression can decrease quality of life (QOL) of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These adverse reactions need to be treated, otherwise which will impact the completion of treatment. Literature and preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival and improve QOL, but high-level evidence is desperately needed to support this finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Over the past 10&#x02009;years, many oncologists focused on survival advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients. Data from JBR.10 study showed that overall QOL and functional domain scores are somewhat compromised after thoracotomy and pneumonectomy; but scores improve fairly early in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As expected, adjuvant chemotherapy has an immediate negative impact on a number of aspects of QOL in individuals with NSCLC who have undergone resection with curative intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Chief among these is the symptoms that reflect most of the serious adverse effects associated with platinum-based chemotherapy: fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, QOL in clinical assessment has become more and more prominent in clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Over the past decade, Chinese medicine has made progress in the treatment of lung cancer patients. Chinese medicine has some unique advantages over chemical drugs, such as improving the quality of life, reducing recurrence rate and prolonging overall survival, etc. Regarding KPS score, traditional Chinese medicine can stabilize and improve the KPS scores after surgery in 82.0% to 90% patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, it can improve QOL significantly by using NCI-L evaluation. 85% to 87.5% of postoperative patients can stabilize and improve the body weight after receiving TCM therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two comparative studies from Japan indicated Chinese herbal medicine to be effective in reduction of chemotherapy-induced muscle pain and diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Professor Liu Jiaxiang in Longhua hospital affiliated to Shanghai university of TCM has been doing clinical research on advanced lung cancer patients since the 1960s. His team have completed four prospective randomized clinical studies supported by China's State Science and Technology. The result showed that disease stable rate was 67.83%, 1, 3 and 5-year survival rate was 60.94%, 31.86% and 24.22% respectively in the treatment group. Median survival was 417&#x02009;days (13.9&#x02009;months). The immune function and QOL were improved after treated with combined Chinese and Western medicine compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This reflected characteristics and therapeutic effect of Chinese medicine on treatment of lung cancer based on syndrome differentiation. But these studies have methodological issues and can&#x02019;t be widely accepted worldwide.</p><p>This paper has been compiled to outline the methodology for a randomized-controlled clinical study the effect of chemotherapy combined with or without TCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients that adhere to the CONSORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] checklist in its design.</p><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with or without TCM in QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients.
