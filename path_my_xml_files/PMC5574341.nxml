blended essential oil on psychophysiological response in stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects were 14 adult stroke patients randomly divided into the experimental
group (7 patients) and the control group (7 patients). Physical and psychological stress,
mood state and sleep satisfaction was measured using evaluation instruments and body
temperature was measured with infrared thermography (T-1000). [Results] Measurements
included physical and psychological stress, and mood state of the experiment group became
significantly lower than that of the control group. The body temperature and sleeping
satisfaction of the experimental group became significantly higher than that of the
control group. [Conclusion] The present study suggested that aroma therapy and foot bath
that can be used as alternative physical therapy that offers an overall beneficial effect
on psychophysiological response such as reduced stress, mood state and increased body
temperature, sleeping satisfaction of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Massage</kwd><kwd>Foot bath</kwd><kwd>Psychophysiological response</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Physical hypofunction such as reduced range of joint movements and spastic muscle paralysis
caused by hemiplegia due to stroke brings about physical and mental distress that limits
social activities and daily life performance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such serious problems act as negative stress on self-esteem,
lifestyle, and the quality of life of stroke patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, effective intervention activities that allow stroke
patients to perform independent movements and to cope with the stresses due to changed
lifestyle and social biases are needed<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The most common symptoms including the loss of comprehension ability, sudden communication
difficulties, and damage to the motor and sensory nerves due to the stroke are psychological
stressors along with depression, anxiety, anger, frustration, fear, and helplessness<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Mood state refers to the state that emotional changes or abnormalities have occurred as a
result of stress, and internal stress due to physical paralysis after stroke, fear of human
relationships, stress between individuals, and discomfort for hospital environment manifest
themselves as mood state, which significantly influences disease recovery<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sleep disorders after stroke can generally be induced by physical, psychological, and
environmental factors<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since sleep
deficiency can increase the possibility of accidents such as fracture due to a fall because
of increased fatigue and anxiety, and become the cause of stress that adds the feeling of
helplessness in life and depression, it is necessary to help the stroke patients achieve the
appropriate amount of sleep. Maintaining body homeostasis by providing the opportunity to be
comfortably stable through an appropriate amount of sleep and recovering individual&#x02019;s energy
and well-being status can help recovery from the illness<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Massage is a method of relieving the accumulated fatigue by stimulating the skin, and it
makes it easier to fall asleep by stabilizing the mind through alleviating muscle
stiffness<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, research has
been conducted to find out its effect, and stress reduction, fatigue recovery, pain relief,
anxiety reduction, and sleep improvement have been reported as the effects of massage<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The slow-stroke back massage among various massages is a massage
method of stroking along the erector muscles on both sides of the spine to stimulate the
parasympathetic nerves. It is used as a relaxation therapy for patients with anxiety
disorders<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies on
aromatherapy reported its effects on anxiety, depression, sleep, fatigue, stress<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Though the use of aromatherapy involving
essential oils has increased recently, not only in daily life but also in the medical field,
scientific data on its clinical effects are still insufficient<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Foot bath has been reported to provide an excellent effect on reducing stress along with
sleep improvement by reducing pain through the effects of promoting blood circulation and
inducing body relaxation response<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As such, back massage using essential oil and foot bath are used in real life since they
are economical and safe to perform, but studies on the intervention effects of both back
massage using essential oil and foot bath are difficult to find not only in domestic
physical therapy societies but also in all academic disciplines. Accordingly, the present
study attempted to find out the effects of both back massage using essential oil and foot
bath on psychophysiological response, which is the stress, body temperature, mood state, and
sleeping satisfaction of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 14 adult stroke patients randomly divided into the
experimental group (7 patients, group treated with back massage using essential oil and foot
bath) and the control group (7 patients). The subjects were informed that the experimental
group would have both back massage and foot bath five times in one week with each session
lasting for 30 minutes, and the control group would not have both back massage and foot bath
during the same period. Both experimental and control group had general physical therapies
five times in one week with each therapy session lasted for 30 minutes, and the subject
selection criteria were as follows. Subjects were selected among the patients who were
diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke within the last six months to two years and included
those who did not have wound, flare, edema, or suppuration; those who were currently not
taking hypertension medicine, antidepressants, and sleeping pills; and those who understood
the purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to participation

intervention. Essential oil should be diluted before use since the chemical composition of
essential oil is neutralized when it is used with a carrier oil. For the experimental group,
ten drops of juniper, seven drops of lavender, five drops of orange, three drops of
patchouli, and eight drops of rosemary were used, and for back massage, essential oil was
blended to 3% of the whole volume with 50&#x02005;ml of jojoba oil<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The back massage method used in the present study was the basic method of Swedish massage

filled up to the ankle in the foot bath for 30 minutes. Foot bath training was conducted in
advance to ensure the accuracy and proficiency of the technique by creating a foot bath
protocol to explain its entire process before the feet. Second, pour water into the foot
bath tub. Third, the temperature of foot bath water was adjusted to 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C by using a water
temperature gauge. Fourth, foot bath was performed sitting in a chair for 30 minutes with
both feet in the foot bath tub. Fifth, both feet were towel dried after the foot bath and
finished with foot lotion to prevent dryness<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To measure the stress, we used the instrument tools, which is composed of two areas of 15

essential oils and foot bath on psychophysiological response, which is the stress, body
temperature, mood state, and sleeping satisfaction of stroke patients.</p><p>First, back massage and foot bath were found to reduce stress. Satou et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> found significant decrease in
psychological stress after aromatherapy massage using aroma oil on elderly patients under
long-term hospitalization, and Chung &#x00026; Choi<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the effects of aroma massage on stress in women college
students. In addition, the findings of the present study were consistent with previous
research results in that Kim &#x00026; Kim<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>
found that aroma self-foot reflexology massage can be utilized as an effective intervention
for stress and fatigue, and Effati-Daryani et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> found that Lavender cream with foot bath can be used for reducing
their stress, anxiety and depression. It seems that stress reduction is achieved by the
promotion of metabolism and blood circulation due to the active aroma ingredients,
relaxation of tense muscles while receiving the massage, stability of mind and body, and the
foot bath. In addition, back massage and foot bath were found to minimize the stress of
stroke patients since the stress was reduced significantly more for the experimental group
than the control group.</p><p>Second, back massage and foot bath were found to increase the body temperature. Plakornkul
et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> found the body temperature
increased on and around the neck, shoulder, and arm after Thai traditional massage, and
Gholami-Motlagh et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> found greater
body temperature increase for the back, neck, and chest Swedish massage than leg, arm, and
face Swedish massage. Furthermore, the findings of the present study were also consistent
with previous studies in that Portillo-Soto et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the massage therapy increased skin temperature and calf
blood flow, and Liao et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
foot bath are an effective way to affect skin temperature change. It is thought that both
back massage and foot bath using aroma oil would help provide an increase in body
temperature by the effect of blood circulation.</p><p>Third, both back massage and foot bath were found to improve the mood state.
Gholami-Motlagh et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> found the
massage therapy on the back, neck, and chest is distributed improved the mood state, and
Effati-Daryani et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and Edge<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> found the physical and psychological
stresses were alleviated when a foot bath was taken regularly every day. In addition, the
results of the present study were in agreement with previous studies in that Keiko et
al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> found the activity of the
autonomic nervous system was reduced and relaxation and comfort were significantly increased
after the foot bath. It is thought that aroma back massage and foot bath improve mood state
by the emotional stability and fatigue recovery induced by physical and psychological
relaxation for fatigue and stress and normalized antagonism of the autonomic nervous
system.</p><p>Fourth, the back massage and foot bath were found to improve sleeping satisfaction.
Longworth<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that slow back
massage was effective for reducing patients&#x02019; tension, fatigue, and sleep improvement due to
the effect of inhibitory reflex of muscle spindles and palpation habituation by influencing
the parasympathetic nerves, and Saeki<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>
found that the foot bathe frequently applied to adult women as a nursing activity provided
sleep improvement and comfort, and had physiological effect of relaxing the function of
autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, the results of present study were consistent with the
results of previous studies of Sung &#x00026; Yochihara<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> who found significant effects of the foot bath on sleep onset,
sleep maintenance, and sleep efficiency, and Tsuchie<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> who found the effectiveness of foot bath for sleep improvement by
the improved blood circulation due to smooth metabolism caused by the stimulation on
peripheral blood vessels when the foot is immersed in warm water. It is thought that aroma
oil improves the quality of sleep by acting on the autonomous nervous system responsible for
sleep and life rhythm, and the foot bath improves sleep satisfaction by maximally relaxing
distal skin blood vessels and by the intervention that can increase the body temperature at
the same time. Later, it will be necessary to analyze of physiological activity according to
the absorption of the aroma oil used in this study and to evaluate the changes of body
according to back massage and foot bath through electrophysiological method.</p><p>As discussed above, it was confirmed that the rehabilitation programs in hospital had
significant effect on the psychophysiological response. The back massage using blended
essential oils and foot bath can provide physical and psychological sense of well-being to
stroke patients by increasing the body temperature and sleep satisfaction due to
psychological effect of the aroma as well as stress and mood state reduction by muscle
stimulation, relaxation and increased blood circulation through bodily contact, it can be
used as the alternative physical therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship between activities of daily living and
