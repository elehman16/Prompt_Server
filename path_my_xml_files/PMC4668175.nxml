function improvement. This study therefore aimed to confirm the effect of balance training
with additional motor imagery on balance and gait improvement in subacute stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] Participants were divided into an experimental or control group.
The experimental group received balance training for 20 minutes/day with mental imagery
for 10 minutes/day, three days/week, for four weeks. The control group received only
balance training for 30 minutes. Before and after the 12 sessions, balance and gait
ability were assessed by the researcher and a physical therapist. [Results] After
completion of the 4-week intervention, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test,
Functional Reach Test, and Four Square Step test scores significantly increased in the
experimental group. In the control group, Berg Balance Scale and Functional Reach Test
scores significantly improved. Changes in the Timed Up and Go test, Functional Reach Test,
and Four Square Step Test scores after intervention were significantly higher in the
experimental than in the control group. [Conclusion] Specific balance training with
additional motor imagery may result in better rehabilitation outcomes of gait and balance
ability than balance training alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Motor imagery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke can cause permanent disability in patients. Strokes can cause a combination of
motor, sensory, cognitive and emotional impairments resulting in impairment of balance and
gait ability in patients as well as impairment of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The major goals of rehabilitation in stroke
patients are improving balance and gait ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is the ability of an individual to maintain or move within
a weight-bearing posture without falling<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance ability requires the person to maintain their body&#x02019;s center of gravity within the
base of support<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many research studies
have demonstrated a relationship between balance ability and gait speed, independence, and
appearance of an individual and have demonstrated abnormal patterns<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is an essential function in maintaining gait and
normal movement in stroke patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Accordingly, various therapeutic methods have been used for the improvement of balance, such
as core strength exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, visual
feedback training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and task-related
training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, several studies about a mental practice for rehabilitation of stroke patients
have been reported<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mental imagery (MI) is a
rehabilitation method, which involves the use of motor imagery content with repetition of
movement processes. Many previous research studies have reported that cortical functional
reorganization following mental practice contributes to the improvement of hand function in
stroke patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally several
previous studies have shown that the MI in combination with physical therapy has been
effective in improving balance and gait performance in stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there have been divergent opinions about the
effectiveness of MI on balance and gait function. There have been a few studies, which have
investigated the influence of specific balance training with additional MI in stroke
patients.</p><p>The importance of effective rehabilitation in the early stages for stroke patients is
increasing. MI is a clinically practicable and cost-effective supplement that may enhance
outcome in acute stroke patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, most of the previous studies of MI training were conducted for chronic stroke
patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been a few
studies of subacute stroke patients, which have only focused on an improvement in gait
function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study was
performed to confirm the effect of balance training with additional MI on balance and gait
improvement in sub-acute stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty subacute stroke patients (10 males and 10 females) participated in the study in the
rehabilitation unit. The inclusion criteria for the present study were as follows:</p><p>(1) A diagnosis of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) &#x0003c; 3 months after stroke
onset</p><p>(2) Korean mini-mental state examination score &#x0003e; 24</p><p>(3) A capability to stand up, maintain standing balance, and walk more than 10&#x02005;m
independently.</p><p>We explained the purpose of this study to the patients and obtained their informed consent.
The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the Sahmyook University. All of the
procedures in the study were conducted as per the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Participants were divided into an experimental or control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.1 &#x000b1; 9.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.2 &#x000b1; 7.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.0 &#x000b1; 12.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.2 &#x000b1; 12.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.6 &#x000b1; 12.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.2 &#x000b1; 10.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of onset (days) </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.1 &#x000b1; 4.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ischemic/Hemorrhagic stroke</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right sided lesion/Left sided lesion</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>). The experimental group received balance training for 20 minutes/day with
additional mental imagery for 10 minutes/day, three days/week, for a period of four weeks.
The control group received balance training for 30 minutes/day. Before and after the 12
sessions, balance and gait ability were assessed by the researcher and a physical therapist.
All participants received balance training, which consisted of four practices for 20 minutes
as follows:</p><p>(1) Standing on an unstable balance pad and then implementing a head flexion and extension
and rotation to the left and right</p><p>(2) Shifting the weight from left to right while standing on even floor</p><p>(3) Standing on one leg for 5 seconds</p><p>(4) Walking in a straight line.</p><p>After the balance training session, MI was implemented in subjects in the experimental
group in an isolated, quiet room. The MI was recorded by a physical therapist using standard
Korean language. The MI program was composed of guided balance training. The participants
performed the MI while they were in a comfortable condition, sitting in a comfortable seat,
with an armrest and backrest. Before the 10-minute MI, the participants were guided to a
state of relaxation by deep breathing for 2 minutes.</p><p>Before and after training, balance ability was evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale
(BBS). Since the BBS has been shown to have excellent validity and outstanding intra-rater
and inter-rater reliability (interclass correlation = 0.99), it is extensively used as a
measurement tool for balance function. BBS is correlated well with other clinical balance
scales and with measurements of gait speed for stroke patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a clinical test of dynamic standing balance tasks.
Patients were seated in a chair. They were then ordered to stand up and walk as quickly and
safely as they could for a distance of 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit
down again. The time was recorded from the point at which the patient stood up from the
chair until he or she returned to the same sitting position. The test was implemented
thrice. The average time of the three tests was taken as the result of the test.</p><p>Functional Reach Test (FRT) is an upper-extremity balance task used in this study. The
subject stood comfortably and perpendicular to a wall. A yardstick, which was horizontally
attached to the wall, was applied at the subject&#x02019;s acromion level. The subjects extended
their fisted hands along the yardstick. The position of the third metacarpal was recorded
before and after a maximal forward reach. The mean score of three successful trials was
calculated.</p><p>The Four Square Step Test (FSST) is a clinical test of dynamic standing balance that
measures the time taken to step over four walking sticks, which are placed in a
cross-configuration on the ground by using a set movement sequence. The combination of
cognitive and physical demands is a key attribute of this test. Scores on the FSST have been
found to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change post-stroke. A score of 15&#x02005;s or more,
or the inability to perform the FSST may also identify the risk of falls in people after
stroke. In this study, the FSST was conducted as per a standardized protocol, which has been
used previously in post-stroke patients.</p><p>We analyzed the data using SPSS version 21.0 software (SPSS for windows; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare the BBS, TUG, FRT, and
FSST scores before and after the intervention. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare
the changes in the scores of the tests after the intervention between the groups. P &#x0003c;
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the participants, age, height, weight, duration after onset,

function in patients with subacute stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there have been very few studies that have evaluated the
influence of balance training with additional MI on balance in the subacute stage of stroke.
Thus, our study aimed to confirm the effect of balance training with additional MI on
balance and gait improvement in sub-acute stroke patients.</p><p>Our results showed that the balance training with additional MI produced a significant
improvement, which was greater than balance training alone in enhancing the balance and gait
abilities of subacute stroke patients. However, there was no significant difference in the
BBS score in subacute stroke patients.</p><p>In previous research studies on chronic stroke patients, additional MI produced a greater
positive influence on balance recovery<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In a study on chronic stroke patients, Yoo et al. demonstrated that physical therapy with
additional MI had an additional positive effect on improving and maintaining a symmetrical
stance posture<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, many
previous studies have reported the effectiveness of physical therapy with additional MI on
balance and gait ability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the
subjects of the previous studies were in a different stage of recovery, our results were
similar, with the FRT and FSST scores showing a significant improvement in the balance
training with MI group compared to the balance training alone group in subacute stroke
patients. Hwang et al. also reported that the BBS score of chronic stroke patients improved
by 69% after physical therapy with additional MI in chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the BBS scores increased
after the intervention, but this was not significant. The reason for this outcome may be due
to a small number of subjects and a short- term duration of training. In addition, the
specific balance training with additional MI was applied in a different stage of recovery as
compared with previous studies of general physical therapy with additional MI.</p><p>In our study, the change in the TUG test score was greater in the balance training with
additional MI group than in the balance training alone group in subacute stroke patients.
Similar to the previous studies on subacute stroke patients, significant differences were
found in the scores between the two groups. The results of the walking test showed greater
improvement in the physical therapy with additional MI group, who were guided with vivid
kinesthetic imagery, than in the patients of the muscle relaxation group. In another study,
gait training with additional MI improved balance and gait abilities significantly more than
only gait training in subacute stroke patients. Engagement in gait training with additional
MI may increase self-efficacy, thus having a positive influence on motivation and
self-confidence<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study
on chronic stroke patients, Dickstein et al. reported that gait speed was enhanced in the 6
weeks physical therapy with additional MI group<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Hwang et al., demonstrated that the walking velocity
increased after MI training for 4 weeks<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The current study found that specific balance training with additional MI may have a better
effect than balance training alone on gait and balance ability. These findings almost
coincide with previous studies that have investigated the influences of balance training
with additional MI on gait and balance ability in chronic and subacute stroke patients.
Balance training with additional MI may therefore have the effect of enhancing gait and
balance ability. This study has some limitations. First, this study only involved a small
number of subjects. Second, the severity of the condition of the subjects was relatively
mild as the subjects in this study were able to walk more than 10&#x02005;m independently. Third,
this study used a short-term duration of training. Further studies with a greater number of
subjects and long-term follow-up will be required to investigate the effects of balance
training with additional MI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all of the study participants.</p></ack><ref-list><title>ReferenceS</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hochstenbach</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Donders</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulder</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Long-term outcome after stroke: a disability-orientated
