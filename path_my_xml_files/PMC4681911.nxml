following intense exercise. Massage is commonly used to manage muscle damage resulting
from exercise. However the effect of massage after exercise is still not clear. The
purpose of this study was to examine the effect of manual lymph drainage on muscle damage
and on the removal of blood lactate following submaximal exercise (SE), as part of a
solution to the challenging problem in sports medicine of muscular recovery after
exercise. [Subjects and Methods] Eighteen healthy male students, with moderate exercise
training, were randomly assigned to either receive manual lymph drainage (MLD) or serve as
controls. Both groups were subjected to a graded exercise test, performed on a treadmill
ergometer, to determine each subject&#x02019;s individual anaerobic threshold (IAT). Seven days
later, all subjects were made to run for 30 minutes on the same treadmill ergometer, at a
running speed equivalent to the IAT. One group received MLD treatment, while the control
subjects received no treatment. [Results] Following an increase immediately after
exercise, lactic acid (LA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels dropped rapidly
and significantly at the end of MLD application and two hours after SE in the subjects
receiving MLD. The course of creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels was comparable, and
with myoglobin showing a significant difference at 2&#x02005;h after SE, and CK at 24&#x02005;h after SE.
[Conclusion] Manual lymph drainage after SE correlated with a more rapid fall in LA and of
the muscular enzymes of LDH, CK and myoglobin, and may have resulted in an improvement in
the regenerative processes elicted by structural damage to the muscle cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Manual lymph drainage</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd><kwd>Submaximal exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Exhaustive and/or unaccustomed exercises (particularly those involving high intensity
muscle contractions) are known to induce temporary muscle damage. This damage includes a
series of events occurring. It causes damage to the sarcolemma and the muscle cell membrane.
This damage results in the release of biochemical markers of muscle damage including (e.g.
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin (Mb)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Coaches, athletic
trainers, and athletes should seek scientific support for therapeutic interventions which
claim to help reduce the effects of muscle damage and speed of recovery from exercise and
athletic endeavors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, improving
muscle recovery after physical exercise is an important topic in sports medicine.</p><p>Many researchers investigated various intervention to treat muscle damage such as active
recovery, massage, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, supplementation and
compression garments<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Massage is also commonly assumed to enhance muscle recovery from
intense exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However the effect of
massage after delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is still not clear<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recently review and meta-analysis demonstrated that
therapeutic massage is the only intervention that has a positive effect on the recovery of
&#x0201c;muscle soreness&#x0201d; and function; however, its mean effect is too small to be considered
clinically relevant<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The potential
benefits of massage on recovery include increased blood circulation and venous return,
greater lactate clearance, decreased pain sensation, and general well-being<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) is a massage technique that involves the skin surface only and
follows the anatomic lymphatic pathways of the body. Unlike other types of massage, it
produces neither blush nor pain and promotes lymph flow<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some biochemical
markers, such as CK, LDH, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Mb are particularly
significant in the evaluation of tissue damage<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Creatine kinase, a dimeric enzyme with a particularly large
molecule (80,000 Da) cannot penetrate enter into the bloodstream following muscular injury.
And under injury conditions, it passes into the lymphatic system from the intercellular
fluid and is transferred to the general circulation from the thoracic lymph nodes. This has
led to the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between lymphatic circulation and CK
levels<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Havas et al. studied the
effect of peripheral lymphatic flow reduction, achieved by bed rest, on serum CK after
exercise. They concluded that physical inactivity of short duration reduces the lymphatic
transport of CK and the secretion of muscle enzymes<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently, there is a lack of controlled research to support the
efficacy of manual lymph massage in accelerating the rate of post-exercise blood clearance
of lactate and biochemical markers such as CK, LDH, and AST<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although acute submaximal exercise (SE) may induce tissue damage
in trained individuals, MLD applied immediately after exercise can reduce tissue or muscle
damage and also help the removal of blood lactate. In this study, we have investigated the
effect of MLD on reducing tissue or muscle damage and removing blood lactate and muscle
enzymes after SE in moderately trained individuals was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eighteen healthy and moderately trained male students took part in this study. The subjects

Germany) under standardized conditions to determine the anaerobic threshold. The exercise
test began at 8&#x02005;km&#x000b7;hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and increased by 1&#x02005;km&#x000b7;hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every three
minutes. Heart rate was recorded by a Polar monitor (Electro, Finland). Blood lactate levels
were measured in capillary blood drawn from a hyperemic ear lobe, at rest and at the end of
each exercise level. The subjects ran until their blood lactate levels exceeded 5&#x02005;mmol/L.
Seven days after the graded exercise test, all subjects ran 30 minutes on the same treadmill
ergometer, at a running velocity equivalent to the IAT. Capillary blood samples to determine
the lactate concentrations were taken from a hyperemic earlobe before the beginning of each
test procedure.</p><p>MLD was applied by a trained physiotherapist, who used specialized hand movements in a
range of different sequences. The treatment was carried out as very light, completely
pain-free, rhythmical translational movements of the skin in the flow direction of the lymph
vessels. The subjects lay in the supine position with their knees bent. The MLD started with
abdominal lymph drainage after which central lymph stimulation was performed. MLD was
consecutively applied to the right and left lower extremities (leg) consecutively. Each
treatment session lasted approximately 30 minutes. The control group did not receive any
therapy.</p><p>Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein shortly before MLD. Serum and plasma
were separated by centrifugation at 1,500 &#x000d7; g for 15 minutes. All serum and the plasma
samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C until analysis. Serum levels of AST, LDH, CK and plasma levels
of lactate were determined by an autoanalyzer (Architect c8000, Abbott Inc., Abbott Park IL,
USA), using test kits by the same manufacturer. Serum myoglobin level was determined by a
chemiluminescentce immunoassay analyzer (Architect i2000, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
Illinois, USA) using the commercial kits recommended by the manufacturer. The blood samples
were taken: 1) directly before the submaximal exercise (B-SE); 2) directly after the
submaximal exercise (A-SE); 3) after 30&#x02005;min rest / after the MLD application (A-MLD-R); 4) 2
hours after the submaximal exercise (2hA-SE) 5); 24 hours after the submaximal exercise
(24hA-SE) and 6) 48 hours after the submaximal exercise (48hA-SE)</p><p>The SPSS 16 statistical package was used for statistical analyses. The Mann and Whitney
U-test for two independent samples was performed for intergroup comparisons. Differences

following MLD<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. We observed a
significant fall in both LA and LDH immediately after MLD, and their application, with
levels remained low at the end of the second hour. This is an aspect in which this study
offers a superior feature. LDH levels fell after 48 hours in Schillinger&#x02019;s study.</p><p>The main cause of fatigue developing during exercise is LA builds up. Accumulation of LA
increases the H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentration, thus reducing action potentials. This in turn
reduces calcium secretion from the sarcoplasma and muscle enzyme activity. The first sign of
fatigue that follows is a loss of strength in voluntary muscle contraction<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Dierking and Bemben, LA is
also responsible for the muscle pain accompanying delayed fatigue, which continues for 24&#x02013;48
hours after exercise<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise also
depletes cellular ATP. This results in increased cellular permeability and in increases in
the serum concentrations of skeletal muscle enzymes such as CK, LDH and AST<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, an increase which are also affected also
by the type and intensity of exercise and the duration of muscular activity. The overall
serum CK evolution shows an increase especially at 24&#x02005;h after exercise, and the effect that
may persist for more than 4 days<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. While
Schillinger&#x02019;s study did not establish a significant difference in CK levels, the present
study showed that MLD was followed by a decrease in CK within 24 hours, and a reduction in
delayed muscular fatigue. The results of both studies suggested that MLD contributed to
mitigation of muscular damage and enhanced the regenerative process of muscle cells. In our
opinion, such a contribution is significant, especially for athletes who have to strive
daily to present their best performance in competition. However, Nogueira et al. analyzed CK
before and (except CK), 24 h, 48 h, 72&#x02005;h and 96&#x02005;h after an exercise protocol. They
classified individuals as &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; responders at the peak of maximum voluntary
concentric muscle contraction. The classification of the subjects into low and high
responders groups was important for demonstrating that the most responsive group to strength
decrease after eccentric exercise also showed higher DOMS levels. This notwithstanding, a
relationship with CK could not be established<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Different methods including massage, cold application, tensing and light exercise are used
to help recovery after exercise. Studies of these methods are as yet insufficient for the
purpose of drawing definitive conclusions. Published studies considering massage performed
post-exercise have investigated its effect on variables such as delayed muscle pain,
sensitivity, and muscular function and performance. Abad et al. reported there was no effect
of post-exercise massage on delayed muscle pain reduction<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>; Farr et al. indicated that massage has no effect on muscle
performance and function, it does diminish pain intensity<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mancinelli et al. investigated the effect of massage on
post-exercise symptoms of 22 trained women using the pressure pain threshold, shuttle race
times and vertical leaps as outcome measures, and reported it resulted in muscular pain and
an improvement in vertical leaps<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Emiliano Ce et al. performed a study comparing the effects of deep/superficial massage with
those of passive tension and active to passive recovery on the lactate level in the blood.
They concluded that neither of the two massage methods (deep vs superficial) or the passive
static tension application was correlated to a significant change in lactate levels; in
other words, that they could be used as an alternative to active recovery (at 50%
VO2<sub>max</sub>)<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
contradictory results can be explained by the absence of a standard procedure for the
different techniques used under the description of &#x0201c;massage&#x0201d; and the small numbers of
subjects in the different studies<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Another application thought to be potentially useful for recovery is intermittent pneumatic
compression (IPC). A study performed by Draper investigated the contribution of intermittent
pneumatic compression on the muscle inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and DOMS in
trained athletes after long distance running. The results indicated statistically there was
no significant difference in CRP or pain levels between the control run and treatment
run<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results aren&#x02019;t compatible
with our results. However, the data suggests the test subjects recovered one day after
receiving IPC than to the control, and a full day recovery for a professional athlete is
very important. Studies with greater numbers of subjects comparing MLD to different recovery
methods, following up values, especially CK serum levels, up to 120 hours are still needed
in order to proceed to a further advance our understanding of muscular recovery.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Alberto Duarte</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Evidence of the physiotherapeutic interventions used
