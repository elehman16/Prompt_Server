Inflammation is associated with increased circulating plasma catecholamine activity [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which can be modified by treatment with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoreceptor (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR) antagonists. These drugs are beneficial in experimental models of sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], myofibrillar remodeling in congestive heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and myocarditis [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Sympathetic over-activity during cardiovascular disease may be characterized by an increase in HR and correspondingly lower heart rate variability (HRV) [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HRV reflects the dynamic interplay between the multiple physiologic mechanisms, and is a measure of the instantaneous HR and R-R intervals (intervals between QRS complexes of normal sinus depolarization) [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HRV may be an important prognostic indicator in cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Primary therapy of cardiovascular disease includes &#x003b2;-blockers, such a propanolol, metoprolol and atenolol [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which target either the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR (cardioselective antagonist) or &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR (non-selective antagonist), resulting in beneficial negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.</p><p>Beta blockers do not treat the primary cause of the cardiovascular disease. The effect decreases over time, necessitating altered dose rates and/or medication [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is uncertain whether a decreasing effect of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonists represents a receptor effect, such as tachyphylaxis, and/or is due to disease progression.</p><p>A link between inflammatory disease and adrenergic activity has been suggested following a study investigating &#x003b1;-adrenoreceptors (&#x003b1;-AR) and a potent inflammatory mediator, the complement 5a (C5a) fragment [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and this link may extend to &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-ARs. Furthermore, while basal levels of C5a may have a role in normal cardiac physiology [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], excessive C5a can damage the heart [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonists are cardioprotective by inhibiting the expression of chemokines during severe sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The role of the complement 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) in the cardiac response to inflammation and atenolol treatment is unknown.

Importantly, all the mice pre-treated with PMX53 survived the surgical intervention. The HR of the non-treated GutIR operated wild type mice began to decline towards the end of a 2.5 hr observation period and 5/9 mice were euthanased before the 5 hr mark due to marked clinical deterioration, meaning that further statistical comparisons between HR were meaningless. Ischemia, and subsequent reperfusion injury, is commonly associated with an inflammatory response and tissue damage [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and may contribute to ongoing cardiac disease and, in this study, a marked reduction in survival rate was shown. Interestingly, there is some evidence that adrenergic receptors may be associated with inflammatory pathways, particularly the complement 5a (C5a) receptor [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which, in itself, has been linked to cardiac disease [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and, specifically, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The link between inflammatory and adrenergic receptors was strengthened by the finding that absence of a C5aR1 had a major impact on the HR profiles, with wild type (normal) mice having a higher HR.The ANS, especially the sympathetic nervous system, plays a major role in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis, including during alterations in physiological status, such as during anesthesia, which is reflected as a variation in HRV [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There were no differences in the frequency-domain measures between the two strains of mice, yet anesthesia increased the sympathetic tone only in the knock-out mice, despite overall HR being lower than wild type mice. It would therefore appear possible that the C5a receptor may be important in the response to sympathetic activity during anesthesia and absence of this receptor in this type of knockout mouse disturbs the regulation of the cardiovascular sympathovagal tone or, alternatively, possibly disrupts the parasympathetic responses.</p><p>Analysis of HRV is typically performed using ECG and/or 24-hr Holter monitoring, which permit short-term (30&#x02013;60 min) or long-term (up to 24 hr) recording respectively [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

In this present study, the published techniques to collect and analyze HR and HRV in conscious mice [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were adapted for use in anesthetized mice. The advantage of the current model was that movement artifacts were reduced, permitting the detection of small but important changes in ECG that may otherwise be obscured [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A feature of the current study was the application of HRV analysis, which considers both time- and frequency-domains, as a non-invasive electrocardiographic marker of autonomic modulation of the HR, including the relative predominance of sympathetic or parasympathetic systems [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HRV reflects the dynamic interplay between the multiple physiologic mechanisms which regulate the instantaneous HR and R-R interval (intervals between QRS complexes of normal sinus depolarization) [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The electrical activity and contractile force of the myocardium is largely modulated by the ANS. In the normal physiological state, there is interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflows [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while dysregulation of the ANS control of the heart may induce malignant dysrhythmias [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A decrease in HRV has been shown to reflect disturbances of the ANS that are related to increased cardiovascular dysfunction, including sudden cardiac death [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Atenolol will increase HRV and reduce the LF Norm component leading to reduced sympathetic activity in the hearts of healthy rodents [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which is a useful outcome to control sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in disease states [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the current study, atenolol effectively attenuated HR over time, compared to baseline, which was consistent with earlier reports [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the reduction in HR was significantly greater in the WT mice, which could suggest that the C5aR1 may also be necessary for maximal response of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR to an agonist. This may also explain a smaller bradycardic effect of atenolol on the CD88-/- mice, even allowing for the lower initial baseline HR.</p><p>Furthermore, atenolol effectively increased HRV over time, in both wild type mice and CD88-/- mice. Again, maximal efficacy of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonist appeared to also require the presence of the C5aR1, although HRV gradually increased over time, which suggested that the prolonged stressors (the anesthesia) attenuated the efficacy of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonist. These findings suggested that the effects of atenolol may diminish by 90 min, which is about the half-life of atenolol in the rat [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and we assumed that it may be similar or shorter in mice, although we could not find any publications describing the pharmacokinetics of atenolol in mice.</p><p>Alternatively, the route of administration may affect atenolol activity in mice. Most values of the frequency domain measured in the wild type mice were not significantly different to baseline. However, graphically, the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonist (atenolol) post-intraperitoneal (fast-acting route) administration were observed to have reduced LF Norm, increased HF Norm and thus induced a lower LF/HF ratio at all time-points, compared to the placebo treatment group, suggesting predominant parasympathetic tone of the heart. Only at one time point (60 min post-atenolol) shown by the CD88-/- mice revealed that the LF/HF ratio was significantly reduced compared to the placebo treatment group. The non-significant observations were consistent with a study where healthy volunteers administered intravenous (acute &#x003b2;-blockade) did not modify the normalized component significantly, while oral administration (chronic &#x003b2;-blockade) significantly reduced the LF/HF ratio [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It would appear that any effects of atenolol over time should consider the pharmacokinetic profile in the target species or the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR density. Of greater significance for the current study was that absence of the C5aR1 in mice increased HRV and reduced HR, which was similar to the effect of antagonizing &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR in the wild type mice (Study 2). Furthermore, the normal response to increase circulating plasma catecholamine activity in response to stress (Study 1), namely increased HR, is attenuated with absence of the C5aR1. It is uncertain if there is a physiological relationship between &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and C5aR1, although it has been previously reported that C5aR interacts with the &#x003b1;-AR in the hypothalamus of rats [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, we successfully demonstrated a possible association between &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and CD88, but it is unclear if the association is direct or casual. The role of the complement system, particularly the biological function of C5a and its receptors (CD88 and C5L2) has been well characterized [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but the role of the complement system in general, and C5a in particular in normal and diseased cardiovascular systems is not well understood and debate remains as to whether it plays a protective or deleterious role in specific disease states [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Decreased HRV observed in mice with over-expression of atrial &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] would probably benefit from either &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonist or a possible new therapeutic regime where antagonizing the C5aR, especially CD88, is an attractive strategy to treat and prevent a number of clinical conditions caused by excessive complement activation, especially in the heart.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>Anesthesia was essential for this study, both to be able to undertake the surgical interventions and to reduce movement artefact during HRV assessment, but is also known to profoundly alter autonomic regulation. However, lower concentrations of isoflurane, such as in the current study, have been reported to induce a reflex increase in sympathetic tone [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which may be considered further support to the findings in the current study that the C5aR is required for maximal responsiveness in the &#x003b2;1-AR. Furthermore, it should be recognized that HRV only provides a very indirect marker of autonomic regulation. Frequency domain analysis does not provide a quantitative assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic balance [<xref rid="pone.0146022.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but was used in the current study to provide some index of autonomic activity over time. We also only had a limited availability of the CD88 knock-out mice, which were donated by a collaborator, whereas greater numbers in the groups may have increased statistical significance. Due to the limited number of the knock-out mice, we were not able to proceed with a GutIR operated CD88-/- mice for further observation of HR and HRV analysis which would be deemed useful to further support the evidence of association/interaction of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and C5aR1.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated the feasibility of using a quantitative analysis of beat-to-beat fluctuation in the healthy anesthetized mouse to assess the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences in HR modulation. Thus, application of a standardized HRV technique and study protocol of anesthetized mice should allow appropriate comparison among future studies typically in these two strains of mice. The methods would be useful to investigate the ANS system modulation in abnormal hearts in mouse models of disease such as myocarditis, ischemia and hypertrophy which has been associated as a potential underlying arrhythmogenic substrate. Here we demonstrated that both the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and C5aR1, specifically CD88-/-, indicated a possible association/interaction in the mice myocardium. This study also suggests that looking at the receptors in-vivo studies is crucial. Expression of the receptors in the healthy mice versus mice subjected to reperfusion injury upon pre- and post- treatment using atenolol and PMX53 is crucial as a further study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Trent Woodruff from the School of Biomedical Science for the source of the CD88-/-mice.
