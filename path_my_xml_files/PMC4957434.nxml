The licensed vaccines HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted (Cervarix; GSK Vaccines) and HPV-6/11/16/18 (Gardasil; Merck &#x00026; Co) were first approved as regimen including 3 doses (3D) with administration over a 6-month period. Reduced dose schedules could make vaccination easier to implement and more affordable, creating the potential for higher vaccination coverage and improved cervical cancer protection [<xref rid="JIW036C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Evaluation of schedules including 2 doses (2D) of the HPV vaccine for girls was first prompted by the observation that 3D schedules elicited HPV-16/18 antibody titers approximately 2-fold higher in girls than in young women [<xref rid="JIW036C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the age group in which efficacy was demonstrated in clinical studies [<xref rid="JIW036C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A preliminary immunogenicity study evaluating the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine showed that 2D given at months 0 and 6 to girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years was immunologically noninferior 1 month after the last dose to 3D given at months 0, 1, and 6 (M0,1,6) to women aged 15&#x02013;25 years, and that antibody titers were sustained at high levels for up to 5 years [<xref rid="JIW036C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the preliminary study was not powered to formally compare immunogenicity between groups beyond 1 month after the last dose. Therefore, the current large phase III study was designed to formally evaluate noninferiority and safety of 2 alternative 2D schedules (months 0 and 6 [M0,6] and months 0 and 12 [M0,12]) in girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years compared with 3D in women aged 15&#x02013;25 years over a 3-year period. The study is ongoing, and here we report data up to month 12 or month 13 (depending on the group).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study is an open trial of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine with 3 parallel groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw036/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). Girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years were randomized (1:1) to receive 2D (M0,6 or M0,12) and women aged 15&#x02013;25 years were allocated to receive 3D (M0,1,6). Each 0.5-mL vaccine dose contained HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 viruslike particles (20 &#x000b5;g each) adjuvanted with the adjuvant system AS04, containing 50 &#x000b5;g 3-O-desacyl-4&#x02032;-monophosphoryl lipid A adsorbed on aluminum salt (500 &#x000b5;g Al<sup>3+</sup>). Doses were administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid region of the nondominant arm.</p><p>The primary objective was to evaluate noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of 2D (M0,6) in girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years versus 3D in women aged 15&#x02013;25 years 1 month after the last dose. Secondary comparisons were to evaluate noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies (ELISA) for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D at 6, 12, 18, and 30 months after the last dose, for 2D (M0,12) versus 3D, and for 2D (M0,12) versus 2D (M0,6) at 1, 6, and 12 months after the last dose. Other secondary objectives included HPV-16/18 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA), cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in terms of frequencies of HPV-16/18-specific T-cells and memory B-cells, reactogenicity, and safety. Prespecified exploratory objectives were HPV-31/45 antibodies (ELISA) and CMI. and post-hoc exploratory objectives were avidity of HPV-16/18 antibodies.</p><p>For the current analysis, HPV-16/18 ELISA, PBNA, CMI, and safety data are available up to 6 months after the last dose (month 12) for the 3D (M0,1,6) and 2D (M0,6) groups and 1 month after the last dose (month 13) for the 2D (M0,12) group. HPV-16/18 antibody avidity and HPV-31/45 ELISA and CMI data are available up to 1 month after the last dose (month 7) for the 3D (M0,1,6) and 2D (M0,6) groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw036/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01381575) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol and other materials were reviewed and approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy girls and women aged 9&#x02013;25 years at the time of first vaccination were enrolled at 33 sites in Canada, Germany, Italy, Taiwan, and Thailand. Enrollment started in June 2011. The last visit of the vaccination phase was in January 2013. Women of childbearing potential were to be abstinent or to have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days before first vaccination and agreed to continue such precautions for 2 months after the last vaccine dose. Women were excluded if they were pregnant or breastfeeding, had a confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition or an allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, or had previously received HPV vaccination, 3-O-desacyl-4&#x02032;-monophosphoryl lipid A, or AS04 adjuvant. Written informed consent was obtained from the subject or subject's parent/legally acceptable representative. Informed assent was obtained from subjects below the legal age of consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>The randomization list was generated by GSK Vaccines using a standard SAS program. A randomization blocking scheme (1:1 ratio) ensured that balance between the two 2D schedules was maintained. Treatment allocation at each site used a central randomization system on the Internet. Within each age stratum, the randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for center. Investigators and participants were not blinded to group assignment. Enrollment in each group was stratified by age to give an approximately equal distribution of girls aged 9&#x02013;11 years and 12&#x02013;14 years in 2D groups and women aged 15&#x02013;19 years and 20&#x02013;25 years in the 3D group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Time points for blood sample collection are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw036/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>. HPV-16/18 antibodies were measured by ELISA for all subjects. HPV-16/18 nAbs and CMI and HPV-31/45 antibodies (ELISA) and CMI were measured in a subset of subjects (the first 50 in each age stratum in each group at preselected sites). HPV-16/18 antibody avidities at month 7 were measured in a subset of randomly selected subjects from the 2D (M0,6) and 3D (M0,1,6) groups in the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort (ATP-I, evaluable subjects meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol with no elimination criteria, for whom data were available).</p><p>HPV-16/18/31/45 antibodies were determined with viruslike particle&#x02013;specific ELISA [<xref rid="JIW036C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Seronegativity was defined as a titer lower than the assay cutoff (8 ELISA units [EU]/mL for HPV-16, 7 EU/mL for HPV-18, and 59 EU/mL for HPV-31/45). HPV-16/18 antibody avidities were measured with modified ELISA in which chaotropic agent (1 mol/L sodium thiocyanate) was added to disrupt the interaction between antibody and antigen [<xref rid="JIW036C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The avidity index was expressed as the ratio (percentage) of antigen-specific antibody titers with to those without the chaotropic agent. HPV-16/18 nAbs were determined using PBNA [<xref rid="JIW036C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Seronegativity was defined as a titer lower than the assay cutoff (40 ED<sub>50</sub> [effective dose producing 50% response] for each antigen). Antigen-specific memory B-cells were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay [<xref rid="JIW036C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells producing immune markers (CD40L, interferon &#x003b3;, interleukin 2, or tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;) in response to in vitro stimulation using a pool of HPV peptides were quantified with intracellular cytokine staining, followed by flow cytometry [<xref rid="JIW036C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety</title><p>Solicited local and general symptoms were recorded on diary cards for 7 days after each vaccination. Unsolicited symptoms were recorded for 30 days after each vaccination. Grade 3 symptoms were defined as redness or swelling &#x0003e;50 mm in diameter, fever &#x0003e;39&#x000b0;C, urticaria distributed on &#x02265;4 body areas, and, for other symptoms, as preventing normal activity. Pregnancies and outcomes, serious adverse events, medically significant adverse events, and potential immune-mediated diseases were reported throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The target enrollment of 1428 subjects (476 per group) was estimated to give approximately 1140 evaluable subjects (380 per group) for evaluation of the primary objective 1 month after the last dose, assuming that 20% of subjects would be nonevaluable. This sample size allowed detection of a 5% difference between the 2D (M0,6) and 3D groups for seroconversion rates and a 2-fold difference for geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) with 98% power.</p><p>For the primary objective, noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the seroconversion difference (3D-2D) was &#x0003c;5% and the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (3D/2D) was &#x0003c;2. The criteria were assessed sequentially with GMT ratios assessed only if noninferiority was demonstrated for seroconversion. If the primary objective was reached, noninferiority of HPV-16/18 immune responses (ELISA) was to be sequentially assessed using the criteria defined above for other comparisons. The noninferiority limits were based on margins set for previous studies [<xref rid="JIW036C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Confirmatory testing was not performed for other secondary or exploratory objectives.</p><p>Seroconversion and seropositivity rates (with exact 95% CI) and GMTs (with 95% CI) were calculated by prevaccination status. GMTs were computed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log titer transformations. Antibody titers below the assay cutoff were given an arbitrary value of half the cutoff in this calculation. Two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CIs for differences between groups in the percentage of seroconverted subjects were computed. Two-sided 95% CIs of GMT ratios between groups were computed using an analysis of variance on log<sub>10</sub>-transformed titers, including vaccine group as a fixed effect.</p><p>Noninferiority analyses were based on initially seronegative subjects in the ATP-I. Supplementary analyses were done for initially seronegative subjects in the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) (subjects who received &#x02265;1 vaccine dose for whom data were available).

The month 12/13 ATP-I for secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analyses included 427 of 482 (88.6%) in the 3D group, 534 of 550 (97.1%) in the 2D (M0,6) group, and 394 of 415 (94.9%) in the 2D (M0,12) group. A larger proportion of subjects in the 3D group than in 2D groups were excluded from the ATP-I owing to an incomplete vaccination course or noncompliance with the vaccination schedule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIW036F1">1</xref>).

The high and similar avidity of HPV-16/18 antibodies in 2D (M0,6) and 3D groups suggest that the quality of the immune response is also comparable for both schedules [<xref rid="JIW036C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The immunological noninferiority of 2D (M0,12) compared with both 3D (M0,1,6) and 2D (M0,6) 1 month after the last dose, and the clinically acceptable safety profiles of the different schedules further support the use of 2D schedules of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in girls, with flexibility around the administration of the second dose.</p><p>Serum nAbs, thought to be the major basis of protection conferred by HPV vaccines [<xref rid="JIW036C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], were also in the same range or higher for the 2D schedules versus the 3D schedule. Similar responses were observed in 2D and 3D groups against nonvaccine HPV types 31 and 45 (to month 7 only), suggesting that a 2D schedule may give cross-protection similar to that observed previously [<xref rid="JIW036C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. B-cell and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, which may be important for long-term vaccine-induced protection [<xref rid="JIW036C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], were also similar in all groups. Interim results from an ongoing study of an extended (months 0, 6, and 60) schedule of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in a real-world setting in Mexico also showed immunological noninferiority of the 2D schedule compared with the standard 3D schedule in girls aged 9&#x02013;10 years [<xref rid="JIW036C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Because efficacy studies in 9&#x02013;14-year-old girls are not feasible for ethical and practical reasons, most regulatory authorities allow immunobridging data to infer efficacy in preteen/adolescents. Because immunogenicity profiles were similar for 2D schedules in girls and the 3D schedule in women, we infer that 2D of the HPV-16/18 vaccine administered to preteen/adolescent girls will give a similar level of protection compared with 3D in young women, in whom high vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical trials [<xref rid="JIW036C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Preliminary evidence that efficacy can be achieved with &#x0003c;3 doses was also observed in a post-hoc nonrandomized analysis of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) [<xref rid="JIW036C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and a post-hoc analysis combining data from the CVT and the PATRICIA (Papilloma Trial against Cancer in Young Adults) trial [<xref rid="JIW036C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Four years after vaccination of women aged 15&#x02013;25 years, 1 and 2 doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine seemed to protect against cervical HPV-16/18 infections, similar to the protection provided by the 3D schedule. Two doses separated by 6 months also provided some cross-protection. In the CVT, HPV-16/18 antibody responses in women who received 2D were durable over 4 years of follow-up, with GMTs being at least 24- and 14-fold higher, respectively, than those observed in natural infection [<xref rid="JIW036C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of data from the present study, and the preliminary immunogenicity study [<xref rid="JIW036C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the HPV-16/18 vaccine has received marketing authorization in several countries for a 2D schedule in preteen/adolescent girls, with flexibility around the timing of the second dose, from 5 to 13 months after the first dose. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate reduced number of doses or extended schedules of the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine [<xref rid="JIW036C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW036C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and this vaccine has also recently received marketing authorization for a 2D schedule in adolescents. An ongoing head-to-head trial (NCT01462357) showed that a 2D schedule of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine elicited superior HPV-16/18 antibody responses in adolescent girls compared with 2D and 3D of the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine 1 and 6 months after the last vaccine dose [<xref rid="JIW036C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Girls vaccinated at a young age will require many years of protection against HPV infection to prevent HPV-associated cancers; therefore, longevity of immune responses at a sufficiently high level are important for a 2D schedule. Follow-up in the current study is ongoing over a 3-year period and is required to determine longer-term noninferiority. In addition, follow-up of the 2D (M0,12) schedule is currently complete only to 1 month after the last dose, so evidence comparing the two 2D regimens is limited. Information from further follow-up time points is needed for a more complete picture of immunogenicity. However, data from the preliminary immunogenicity study in girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years who received a 2D (M0,6) schedule of the HPV-16/18 vaccine showed that antibody titers remained high over a 5-year period, and modeling predicts that antibody titers could persist for &#x02265; 21 years [<xref rid="JIW036C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The reactogenicity and safety profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in the current trial was clinically acceptable in both 2D and 3D groups and generally similar to that reported elsewhere [<xref rid="JIW036C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The proportion of subjects reporting some types of solicited general symptoms, and unsolicited symptoms, was numerically lower for 2D groups than the 3D group. These apparent differences could be due to the different ages of subjects enrolled in the 2D and 3D groups, rather than the reduced number of doses, but a previous study showed no difference in reactogenicity on the basis of age for the standard 3D schedule [<xref rid="JIW036C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], strengthening the implicit notion that 2D are less reactogenic than 3D.</p><p>A strength of our study is that it offers a comprehensive evaluation of the immunogenicity of 2D schedules, including ELISA, nAbs, CMI, and avidity assessments, with consistency of results across these end points. The evaluation of 2 alternative 2D schedules (M0,6 and M0,12) was a unique feature of this trial and supported registration of a flexible 2D schedule of the HPV-16/18 vaccine. The diversity of geographic and ethnic origins, and group sample sizes were also much larger in our study than in other trials comparing 2D versus 3D schedules [<xref rid="JIW036C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="JIW036C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, our study was not powered for secondary and exploratory immunogenicity end points (PBNA, CMI, avidity), which were measured in a smaller subset of subjects, and statistical comparisons were not made between groups for these immunogenicity end points or for reactogenicity.</p><p>In summary, we show that 2D schedules of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered over a 6- or 12-month interval to girls aged 9&#x02013;14 years are immunologically noninferior to the standard 3D schedule in women aged 15&#x02013;25 years, the age group in which high vaccine efficacy has previously been demonstrated in clinical trials. The flexibility around the timing of the second dose, giving the option of annual vaccination over 2 consecutive years, is an added benefit. Reduced dose schedules of HPV vaccines may facilitate vaccination implementation and reduce cost, allowing for higher vaccination coverage and potentially more girls being protected from cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw036/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <uri xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.
