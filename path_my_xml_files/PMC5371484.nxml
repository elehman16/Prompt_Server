Two previous studies evaluated IVR monotherapy over a 2-year period and reported macular atrophy incidences of 25.8%<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and 71.4%.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Schmitz-Valckenberg et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that semiautomated software (RegionFinder, version 1,5,0; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) for quantifying geographic macular atrophy associated with dry AMD, which uses confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, yielded both accurate and reproducible results. The FAF signal is very low, or even extinguished, in areas of macular atrophy, because healthy and aging/suffering RPE cells contain lipofuscin, the dominant fluorophore in the retina. Therefore, FAF images are useful for macular atrophy detection and sizing.</p><p>Isopropyl unoprostone (IU; R-tech Ueno, Tokyo, Japan) is a metabolized form of prostaglandin F2&#x003b1;, a chemically synthesized docosanoid (22-carbon basic skeleton). Topical 0.12% and 0.15% IU ophthalmic solutions were approved for clinical use in Japan in 1994 and in the United States in 2001, respectively. <sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Topical IU decreases intraocular pressure by increasing the uveoscleral and trabecular outflow. The route of penetration of IU into the posterior ocular tissues is by direct diffusion through the eye<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> or through the ocular blood circulation via the nasal and conjunctival vascular systems. Topical IU has been used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension for many years, but clinical studies have shown that topical IU use can increase retinal and choroidal blood flow.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> One study demonstrated that human choroidal blood flow improved after ocular instillation of 1 to 4 drops of 0.12% IU, q30&#x0200a;min for a total of four doses, after the blood flow was decreased by an injection of endothelin 1 (ET-1) intravenously.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>The IU molecule is a big potassium (BK, maxi-K) channel activator, not a prostaglandin F receptor agonist.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The BK channel only reaches the activation threshold during cell depolarization and/or when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are high. <sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> It has been demonstrated in vivo that the IU molecule protects retinal ganglion cells against ET-1-induced neuronal injury through extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In an in vivo model, IU inhibits glutamate stimulation and opens maxi-K channels, which are potassium channels that reach an activation threshold only during depolarization and/or at high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The resultant large efflux of K<sup>+</sup> hyperpolarizes the cell, thereby closing voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and limiting neuronal damage by decreasing influx of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Additionally, an in vitro study demonstrated that IU inhibits apoptosis of rat retinal neuroglial progenitor R28 cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> More recently, IU was shown to protect mouse cone photoreceptors and human RPE cells against oxidative stress and light-induced damage through BK channel activation.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>Clinical studies of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) showed that topical administration of 0.12%<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and 0.15%<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> IU may lead to improved retinal sensitivity. Reduced choroidal blood flow was shown to occur in patients with RP and was suggested to play a role in photoreceptor damage.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The authors suggested that choroidal circulation improvements might preserve photoreceptors in RP patients. In support of an impaired choroid circulation, an increase in plasma ET-1 levels, reflective of decreased foveal choroidal blood flow, has been reported in some RP patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, multiple instillations of IU were shown to partially block ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of human choroidal vessels.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In AMD patients with macular atrophy, the improvement of choroidal circulation might be important for preventing the secondary death of photoreceptors.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> In this study, we examine the safety and efficacy of topical 0.15% IU in preventing macular atrophy enlargement in eyes with exudative AMD.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the Kagawa University, Faculty of Medicine, approved this study, which was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (ID: UMIN000007881). This prospective, placebo-controlled, pilot study was conducted between May 2, 2012 and November 8, 2013 in the Department of Ophthalmology of Kagawa University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before any study procedures or examinations were performed and study conduct adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All participants were diagnosed with exudative AMD and met all of the following criteria: age between 40 and 85 years; a decimal best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) &#x02265;20/200; detectable macular atrophy on FAF imaging and fundus examination; and a dry macula for at least 6 months after treatment with IVR and/or photodynamic therapy (PDT) for exudative AMD. The exclusion criteria included the following: signs of exudative changes, including intraretinal or subretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachment, or hemorrhage; presence of any other retinal disorder potentially confounding the clinical assessment (eg, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, or retinal artery occlusion); myopia greater than 6 diopters; any previous treatment with direct laser photocoagulation; presence of significant media opacities (eg, cataract or corneal opacity); and pregnancy. All patients had been treated at least once with a variety of medications before enrollment.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Randomization was performed by alternately assigning patients to the IU and placebo groups as they entered the study.

Both preparation bottles and caps were identical so that the subjects remained masked to group assignment.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Definition of macular atrophy</title><p>Macular atrophy was defined as a hypofluorescent area detected by FAF imaging, which included fibrovascular scarring, drusen, and surrounding RPE atrophy, in this study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the percent of macular atrophy enlargement from baseline to 54 weeks.

All follow-up, examinations and evaluations were performed by a single physician (C.S.).</p><p>All patients underwent the following examinations at each study visit: FAF imaging, decimal BCVA, and optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany). The presence of macular atrophy was determined using digital red-free fundus photographs (TRC-50DX; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) and FAF images (Spectralis HRA&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;OCT), obtained at each visit.</p><p>Retinal FAF images were obtained with an excitation light bandwidth of 488&#x0200a;nm in a 30&#x000b0;&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;30&#x000b0; field of view centered on the macula. The images had a resolution of 768&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;768 pixels. The RegionFinder software was used to identify the areas of macular atrophy and define the borders. Detection and measurement of macular atrophy was performed by a single examiner (A.F.) who was masked to treatment assignment. Fundus color photographs and FAF photographs were used to detect and measure the size of macular atrophy.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Statistics</title><p>This study was designed to have 90% power for detecting a difference in the enlargement rate of macular atrophy of 15% from baseline to 54 weeks using a 2-sided, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test and a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the required sample size was calculated to be 26 patients per study group. For this calculation, the standard deviation of enlargement rate of macular atrophy was assumed to be 15 based on the previous reports.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup></p><p>Baseline values and proportions were compared between groups using unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact tests (if any frequency was &#x0003c;5) for categorical or binomial variables, respectively.

Although, the area of macular atrophy was not significantly different between the IU and placebo groups at any point examined, the average area of macular atrophy in the 2 groups became progressively farther apart over the 54-week study (21&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;15% in the IU group, and 111&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;96% in the placebo group). However, the enlargement rate of macular atrophy was significantly different between the IU and placebo groups, suggesting that topical administration of 0.15% IU may slow macular atrophy progression. Moreover, the mean logMAR BCVA improved in the IU group, but it slightly declined in the placebo group at 54 weeks.</p><p>A previous study showed that instillation of 3 to 4 drops of 0.12% IU led to a partial mitigation of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction in the human choroid.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> These findings indicate that topical administration of IU may also significantly increase blood flow in the retinal and choroidal circulations in both animals and humans.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> This may be helpful to patients with AMD because prior studies have suggested that inadequate choroidal perfusion and/or choroidal microarchitecture ischemia may lead to hypoxia and ischemia in the overlying RPE.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Given that maintenance of the RPE and outer retina is so important for good vision,<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> the choroid is also considered to play an important role in visual acuity. The choroidal circulation provides nutrients to and removes metabolic wastes from the RPE and outer retina.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Thus, an impaired choroidal circulation likely disrupts normal retinal function, leading to visual deterioration. It has been well-documented that choroidal flow and choriocapillaris volume are negatively correlated with aging.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Because administration of topical IU has been shown to rescue both RPE and photoreceptor function, it may prevent macular atrophy progression and/or enlargement.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>The issue of VEGF-dependent ocular homeostasis has yet to be examined clinically, but preclinical data suggest that VEGF<sub>121</sub> may be an essential retinal neuroprotectant during ischemic conditions.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Moreover, some believe that pan-VEGF blockade, particularly VEGF<sub>121</sub> blockade, is responsible for macular atrophy enlargement in eyes with AMD and, ultimately, poor visual prognoses.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> According to the results based on 7-year outcomes of eyes treated with ranibizumab for AMD, macular atrophy, with a mean area of 9.4&#x0200a;mm<sup>2</sup>, was detected on FAF images in 98% of eyes.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> This study also determined that the atrophic area was significantly correlated with a poor visual outcome. The development of macular atrophy leading to RPE atrophy may be related to the frequency with which pan-VEGF-A blockade treatments are administered.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> This could be a serious issue in maintaining good vision in patients with exudative AMD treated with anti-VEGF agents, since follow-up loss was very important in this study, likely due to the duration of the follow-up and comorbidities of patients.</p><p>There have been several reports stating that damage to the RPE was observed after PDT in eyes with classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in young patients or secondary CNV in pathologic myopia.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> Although a medical history of PDT was not correlated with enlargement of macular atrophy in our study, the relationship between PDT treatment and the development of macular atrophy in AMD is impossible to deny. Furthermore, because there were significant correlations between the subtype of AMD and retinal angiomatous proliferation in the area of macular atrophy, this treatment might be effective in each genotype, particularly, retinal angiomatous proliferation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). It is possible that treating eyes with macular atrophy with topical 0.15% IU may slow or prevent vision loss in AMD patients.</p><p>In summary, our results show that topical 0.15% IU applied 3 times per day may be a useful treatment for progressive macular atrophy secondary to exudative AMD. However, considering the heterogeneity of the patients included in this study, the sample size was too small. Unfortunately, there are no current treatment options for this condition. Therefore, the effect of topical IU on macular atrophy and vision should be further investigated in larger trials with longer follow-up periods.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AMD = age-related macular degeneration, BCVA = best-corrected visual acuity, BK = big potassium, CNV = choroidal neovascularization, ET = endothelin, FAF = fundus autofluorescence, IU = isopropyl unoprostone, IVR = intravitreal ranibizumab, logMAR = logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, OCT = optical coherence tomography, PDT = photodynamic therapy, RPE = retinal pigment epithelial, VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Author contributions: Contributors to the study conception and design&#x02014;C.S. and F.S.; data acquisition&#x02014;C.S., A.Y., and A.F.; analysis and interpretation of the data&#x02014;C.S., M.M., A.T., and Y.M.; drafting and revising the article&#x02014;C.S. and F.S; final approval&#x02014;C.S.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial disclosure: The authors disclose the following: The R-tech Ueno Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) provided 0.15% IU and placebo eye drops.
