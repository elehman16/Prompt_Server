<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Consequently, the implications of routine prenatal iron prophylaxis for maternal and child health in these settings remain uncertain.

Delivery nurses were informed of the study and asked to put the birth records of the study women into separate study boxes. Study women were to be identified by the coloured identification cards stapled to the maternity cards. However, separating birth records did not succeed very well and only 2258 (52%) of the birth records were found.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Tracing</title><p>To find the birth data of the 2068 women whose data were missed by the original data collection method, we undertook extensive tracing by applying different methods (described in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file</xref>). Matching of women in admission and birth record books to trial women was made using a combination of probabilistic matching procedures and manual checking of the similarity of the background characteristics of the women (age, parity, name, residence, date of admission/birth, recruitment date). Probability distributions of the matching likelihood were categorised into three levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Women's deaths</title><p>We obtained information of all deaths of women aged 15&#x02013;49&#x02005;years recorded in Maputo City and neighbouring Matola City civil registration during the period January 2007&#x02013;April 2010, overall 9670 women. We coded the handwritten cause of death from the death registers before matching to the study women. The 9670 deaths were matched against the trial women in the same way as matching for births, but the probabilities were then categorised into four levels. Manual checking was performed.</p><p>For all dead women, a theoretical date of giving birth was calculated: the estimated conception date+280&#x02005;days. For consistency, this theoretical date was used, even if we had the actual birth date; for those without conception date, the actual birth date, if available, was used. Using the time between the conception date and date of death, women's deaths were classified into: (1) death during pregnancy or &#x0003c;42&#x02005;days postpartum; (2) death during 42&#x02013;365&#x02005;days postpartum; (3) combining groups 1 and 2. Three deaths were recorded by the original data collection,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but only one was found in the death register. In the current paper, these three deaths were added to the first group.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Twin pregnancies (n=48 pairs) were included in the analysis because their numbers were similar in the two groups and their exclusion did not alter the results. Subgroup analyses were performed for women's death by HIV status, and (in the selective group) by Hb levels at recruitment and iron tablets given at recruitment. The statistical significance of the differences in continuously distributed birth outcomes were analysed by the two sample Student's t-test, and that of categorical outcomes by Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test (if cells contained &#x0003c;5 cases). Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>Generalised linear models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RR with 95% CIs) of the effect of the intervention on binary birth outcomes (low birth weight, preterm birth, caesarean section delivery, perinatal death, women's death). To estimate the effect of iron group on birth outcomes, we undertook: (1) a complete case analysis (ie, analysis of combined data collected by original data collection and those traced); (2) by multiple imputation (ie, imputing data for birth outcomes missed using the original data collection method before tracing); and (3) by analysing different scenarios of matching the traced outcome data to the trial women. The multiple imputation (20 imputed data sets) was undertaken using the multivariate normal model as described by Little and Rubin.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The interaction between the assigned intervention group and gestational age at enrolment (as a continuous variable) was studied. The interaction measured how much the risk of outcomes in the selective group as compared to the routine group changed by each additional week in the timing of enrolling into the study. Stata V.11 statistical software was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Birth data were available for 3301 (76%) of the 4326 pregnant women: 2258 (52%) were retrieved by the original collection method and 1043 (24%) by tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011280F1">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011280TB1">table 1</xref>).

By HIV-status at recruitment, deaths occurred differently in the two iron supplementation groups, and all extra deaths in the selective group occurred among HIV-negative women. However, the numbers of deaths were small in each subgroup, and none of the differences were statistically significant.</p><p>When we excluded women recruited at &#x02265;36&#x02005;week&#x02019;s gestation (n=24) and those missing gestation age at recruitment (n=277), the birth outcome results did not substantially change. The death rate during pregnancy and &#x0003c;42&#x02005;days postpartum remained higher in the selective group, but risk ratios became statistically non-significant (data not shown). When we studied the interaction between the iron supplementation groups and gestational age at enrolment, we found no statistically significant interaction in regard to birth outcomes (p values ranged between 0.131 and 0.959). The p values of the interaction in regard to women's deaths also were statistically non-significant, except in two cases with a borderline significance (p=0.056). In the selective group (compared to the routine group), the risk of death during pregnancy or &#x0003c;42&#x02005;days postpartum increased by each additional week in enrolling into the study (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.26), and the risk during pregnancy or &#x02264;365&#x02005;days postpartum RR was 1.06 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results reported in this paper, as well as previously,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> showed that two policies of giving iron to pregnant women, either as routine supplementation to everyone or treating only women with low Hb, had similar health outcomes during pregnancy and at birth. There were some small differences favouring one of the groups, but none of these differences were statistically significant. However, women's deaths during pregnancy and &#x0003c;42&#x02005;days postpartum suggested a worse outcome in the selective iron group. There were various inaccuracies in outcome data collection, but they should have been comparable in both groups, giving unbiased though inaccurate results. The results nevertheless did not change when evaluated using multiple imputation of birth outcomes.</p><p>The lack of strong differences in birth outcomes between selective and routine iron prophylactic groups, which were similar when we undertook complete case analysis, analysis by tracing mechanisms and multiple imputations, gives confidence that these results may not have changed if all birth outcomes were ascertained using the original data collection method. Our findings are comparable with the results of some previous studies undertaken in malaria-endemic low-income settings, which showed no effect of iron prophylaxis on child outcomes,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> but in contrast with other studies that have shown some benefits of iron supplementation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In our study, two iron policies were compared, while previous studies have compared iron supplementation versus no supplementation. A recent meta-analysis found that while iron supplementation decreased the risk of anaemia and low birth weight, it had no effect on other birth outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> That study, however, included studies undertaken in different countries, not stratified by whether malaria was endemic. Thus, there still is paucity of data of iron prophylaxis in regard to maternal and child outcomes and the impact of various environments is not clear.</p><p>A common opinion is that in malaria-endemic areas, iron prophylaxis during pregnancy should not be given without malaria prophylaxis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In our trial setting, malaria prophylaxis was the recommendation, but high coverage was unlikely (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file</xref>). However, it seems to have been more common in the more rural than urban health centres. There was no difference in regard to the iron supplementation group.</p><p>Matching of the study women to death registers revealed more deaths in the selective iron group, compared to the routine group. In subgroup analyses of the selective group, the death rates were not different by Hb level measured at recruitment or consecutive (therapeutic) iron supplementation. If the lack of iron was the reason for more deaths in the selective group, there should have been more deaths in the low Hb women, but this was not the case. On the other hand, the women with low Hb were given a higher dose of iron than the women in the routine group, which confuses the issue, as large doses could have been harmful. The dose of folic acid was higher in the selective group, which could have been harmful,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> a possibility which we did not consider at the time we planned the study. Another possible reason, although we think it to be unlikely, could result from the uncertainty in matching the trial women to the death register.</p><p>Neither did the cause of death suggest reasons for this unexpected finding of more deaths. HIV infection could have been a confounder or a modifier in regard to deaths. In theory, it is possible that varying iron treatment in the two groups led to different ways of administering HIV treatment, but we have no data supporting it. Likewise, the possibility of repeated Hb measurement increasing HIV spread is a theoretical possibility, but we have no evidence that the hygienic rules of using Hemocue were not followed. We think that the most likely reasons for extra deaths in the selective group were a chance finding. The positive interaction of gestation age at enrolment to extra deaths, that is, the later a woman arrived, the more likely the extra deaths in the selective group, supports the chance finding.</p><p>As far as we are aware, this is by far the largest trial assessing the effectiveness of prenatal prophylactic iron on maternal and child health in malaria-endemic and HIV-prevalent settings. Strength is the comparability of the groups due to randomisation and the large number of participants. Results are generalisable to the local prenatal care; since the trial was made in real circumstances, it included most women entering the care sites, and it allowed treatment of anaemia. Both with regard to the compliance of nurses to the trial protocol and women's reported uptake of iron and folic acid tablets, we achieved adequate adherence.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>There were a number of limitations, including relatively weak interventions, unknown accuracy of data and loss to follow-up. Women in Maputo enter prenatal care late, and thus our trial is on iron prophylaxis starting in mid-pregnancy or late pregnancy, and does not inform of iron supplementation starting in early pregnancy. Many women had only a few visits after the recruitment visit, and the compliance of non-visitors is unknown. They may have visited other health centres, have no visits or bought iron tablets by themselves. Some collected data were inaccurate due to inherent problems of measures, such as gestation age or due to poor recording in our data sources, such as perinatal deaths. Low intervention intensity and inaccuracies in measurement tend to diminish true differences between the groups, artificially leading to a &#x02018;no difference&#x02019; conclusion.</p><p>We could collect birth data with our original data collection method only for half of the women. By using available registers and telephone calls to women, follow-up could be improved, and we obtained 76% of the birth data. In regard to mothers' death, we had a relatively complete source in death registers coverage estimated to be at least 85%. However, the traced birth data were less complete than the data by the original data collection method. Of those untraced, we assume that the most common reason was self-referral to higher level hospitals, where study women's births were lost among many other births. Some women gave birth at home (estimated 10% of all women) or had late miscarriages (no estimate of the numbers), and data from these women were not readily available from health centre records.</p><p>A particular problem was that all birth records, which usually were large books containing information of all admissions and/or births over several weeks or months, were not valued after they were completed. They were not properly stored and they could be borrowed by students who might not return them. Consequently, at the time of retrospective data collection, some of them could not be found. Poor archiving was true also for electronic data, and technical problems were common.</p><p>Identifying the study women by record linkages was a challenge. There was no unique identification number and names were written in a variety of ways. The records were handwritten and often filled out in a hurry, making them susceptible to mistakes. The probabilistic matching strategy we applied was able to overcome some of the problems, but still the matching may contain uncertainties.</p><p>Our experiences in this trial demonstrate challenges in the follow-up of participants in large-scale prenatal trials in low-income settings. Apparently, the problem we faced with missing births and tracing would have been reduced if we had better prior knowledge of the problem; thus, we would have improved the trial design and built different or additional data collection strategies. It would have been good to put more effort to map in detail the routines and data collection practices in the local care facilities. Our experience also suggests that either only outside data collectors should have been used or the incentives to the routine care nurses should have been built to better encourage data gathering, for example, by paying per collected data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that in this malaria-endemic and HIV-prevalent low-income setting, routine and selective iron prophylaxis during pregnancy were largely comparable with regard to birth outcomes, but more women might have died during pregnancy or early postpartum in the selective iron supplementation group. Taking into account the low price of iron medication, the problems of reliable routine measurement of Hb<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> and the logistic simplicity of routine iron supplementation, we recommend routine iron prophylaxis during pregnancy in Maputo city and similar areas until further data accumulate and better Hb and iron status measurement tools are available. This recommendation concerns iron prophylaxis started in mid-pregnancy or late pregnancy and assumes that malaria prophylaxis is in place. However, taking into account that iron deficiency is only one of the causes of anaemia and the growing concern that iron supplementation is associated with increased risk of infections, more large-scale studies are needed in malaria-endemic and high HIV-prevalence low-income settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by two grants from the Academy of Finland (2004: 210631; 2010: 139191).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EH designed and is responsible for the conception of the PROFEG Trial.
