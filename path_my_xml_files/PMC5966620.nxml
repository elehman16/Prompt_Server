Patients were given 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of placebo, spironolactone 25&#x02013;50 mg, bisoprolol 5&#x02013;10 mg, and doxazosin 4&#x02013;8 mg and the change in home systolic blood pressure was assessed as the primary outcome. In our three substudies, we assessed plasma aldosterone, renin, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) as predictors of home systolic blood pressure, and estimated prevalence of primary aldosteronism (substudy 1); assessed the effects of each drug in terms of thoracic fluid index, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance at seven sites with haemodynamic monitoring facilities (substudy 2); and assessed the effect of amiloride 10&#x02013;20 mg once daily on clinic systolic blood pressure during an optional 6&#x02013;12 week open-label runout phase (substudy 3).

Home systolic blood pressure reduction by spironolactone was predicted by ARR (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0&#x000b7;13, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and plasma renin (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0&#x000b7;11, p=0&#x000b7;00024). 42 patients had low renin concentrations (predefined as the lowest tertile of plasma renin), of which 31 had a plasma aldosterone concentration greater than the mean value for all 126 patients (250 pmol/L). Thus, 31 (25% [95% CI 17&#x02013;33]) of 126 patients were deemed to have inappropriately high aldosterone concentrations. Thoracic fluid content was reduced by 6&#x000b7;8% from baseline (95% CI 4&#x000b7;0 to 8&#x000b7;8; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) with spironolactone, but not other treatments. Amiloride (10 mg once daily) reduced clinic systolic blood pressure by 20&#x000b7;4 mm Hg (95% CI 18&#x000b7;3&#x02013;22&#x000b7;5), compared with a reduction of 18&#x000b7;3 mm Hg (16&#x000b7;2&#x02013;20&#x000b7;5) with spironolactone (25 mg once daily). No serious adverse events were recorded, and adverse symptoms were not systematically recorded after the end of the double-blind treatment. Mean plasma potassium concentrations increased from 4&#x000b7;02 mmol/L (95% CI 3&#x000b7;95&#x02013;4&#x000b7;08) on placebo to 4&#x000b7;50 (4&#x000b7;44&#x02013;4&#x000b7;57) on amiloride (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our results suggest that resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining state, most likely due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion.

In PATHWAY-2, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25&#x02013;50 mg per day) was more effective at lowering blood pressure than bisoprolol (5&#x02013;20 mg daily), doxazosin (4&#x02013;8 mg daily), or placebo.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This finding is supported by evidence from observational studies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">We previously reported the results of the PATHWAY-2 randomised controlled trial, which showed that low-dose spironolactone (25&#x02013;50 mg daily), when added to standard blood pressure-lowering drugs, was substantially more effective at lowering blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension than placebo or alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs (bisoprolol or doxazosin). On Sept 17, 2017, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the search terms &#x0201c;resistant hypertension&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pathophysiology&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mechanisms&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;amiloride&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hemodynamics&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;aldosterone&#x0201d; for reports in English published up to July 31, 2017. Our search strategy included reports of randomised controlled trials as well as open and observational studies of drug treatment of resistant hypertension that included any data analysing mechanisms and pathophysiology of resistant hypertension or the use of amiloride. The available evidence was scarce. Findings from two observational studies had suggested that plasma renin concentrations were often more suppressed than anticipated in patients with resistant hypertension, consistent with this being a sodium-retaining and volume-expanded state. In another study, non-invasive haemodynamic measurements via impedance cardiography were used to establish whether treatment adjusted on the basis of haemodynamic characteristics would be more effective than empirical treatment at lowering blood pressure in resistant hypertension, but the findings were inconclusive. In a prospective study of 88 consecutive patients referred to a university clinic for resistant hypertension, researchers reported that 18 (20%) had increased urinary aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin concentrations, despite salt intake in excess of 200 mmol/24 h. Background treatment, including &#x003b2;-blockade, was not discontinued. Authors of other observational studies and commentaries have speculated that many cases of resistant hypertension might result from undetected aldosterone-producing adenomas. Results of many studies have shown the efficacy of low-dose (2&#x000b7;5&#x02013;5&#x000b7;0 mg) amiloride added to thiazide, including reduction of morbidity and mortality. We have previously reported the efficacy of high-dose (10&#x02013;40 mg) amiloride in treated hypertension, but amiloride has not previously been compared with spironolactone or other drugs in patients with resistant hypertension.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">In the PATHWAY-2 trial, spironolactone reduced blood pressure substantially more than conventional antihypertensive drugs in patients with resistant hypertension. In order for the results of PATHWAY-2 to change practice, it was important to show a mechanistic basis underpinning the superiority of spironolactone. The results of the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies show that the efficacy of spironolactone as an antihypertensive drug could be anticipated from our findings that resistant hypertension is a salt-retaining condition, associated with high aldosterone-to-renin ratios, and that spironolactone was substantially superior to the other standard antihypertensive drugs in reducing indices of salt and water retention&#x02014;ie, it was reducing blood pressure primarily via diuretic actions. Physicians who are hesitant to prescribe spironolactone for hypertension, either because it is not a universally licensed indication, or because of antiandrogen-related intolerance, will be reassured by our additional finding that amiloride 10&#x02013;20 mg achieved similar reductions in blood pressure as spironolactone, with similar, slight changes in electrolytes.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">We propose that spironolactone, or amiloride if spironolactone is not tolerated, should be first-line treatment for resistant hypertension, in addition to background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic, in patients with an eGFR greater than 45 mL/min/1&#x000b7;73m<sup>2</sup> and serum potassium within the normal range. Among this cohort are likely to be some &#x02014;perhaps many&#x02014;patients whose hypertension is caused by primary aldosteronism. We encourage a reconsideration of which diagnostic thresholds for primary aldosteronism are appropriate in patients with resistant hypertension, to facilitate recognition of a potentially curable aldosterone-producing adenomas in patients with resistant hypertension.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">Understanding the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension would help to delineate the pathophysiological basis of resistant hypertension and provide a rationale for developing alternative treatment strategies for patients in whom spironolactone is poorly tolerated. The hypothesis underpinning PATHWAY-2 was that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state (despite background treatment with thiazide-type diuretics) and that further diuretic (more correctly, natriuretic) treatment would be the most effective means of lowering blood pressure.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> PATHWAY-2 incorporated a series of prespecified hormonal and haemodynamic measurements designed to facilitate investigation of the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension and its drug treatment.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> We now report the results of these analyses, which address three clinically important questions.</p><p id="para100">First, what is the relation between baseline plasma renin, aldosterone, and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, bisoprolol, doxazosin, and placebo? Consistent with our hypothesis that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state, we expected plasma renin to be relatively suppressed despite background treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic&#x02014;ie, the so-called A+C+D treatment strategy.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A finding of a suppressed renin concentration, despite treatments that usually increase plasma renin, would be consistent with resistant hypertension being a sodium-retaining state. We also hypothesised that the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, but not to other drugs, would be greatest in participants with the lowest plasma renin concentrations and highest ARRs, consistent with sodium retention being largely a consequence of autonomous aldosterone production. The proportion of patients exceeding validated thresholds for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was also assessed.</p><p id="para110">Second, we aimed to assess the haemodynamic responses to the various drug treatments and placebo and their effect on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and thoracic fluid content, testing the hypothesis that the superior action of spironolactone in lowering blood pressure in resistant hypertension would be consistent with those of a diuretic.</p><p id="para120">Third, we hypothesised that if the superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension was due to its natriuretic actions, then amiloride would similarly decrease blood pressure. Like spironolactone, amiloride is a distal tubular diuretic that inhibits the aldosterone-sensitive epithelial sodium channel. Notably, a low-dose thiazide and amiloride combination achieved a greater reduction in blood pressure from baseline than high-dose thiazide alone in patients with hypertension in the PATHWAY-3 trial.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para130">PATHWAY-2 was a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover trial done at 12 secondary care sites and two primary care sites in the UK, in patients aged 18&#x02013;79 years with systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg and home systolic average blood pressure of at least 130 mm Hg despite treatment with maximum tolerated doses of three blood pressure-lowering drugs (ie, A+C+D).

The objective of substudy 1 was to compare the ability of plasma aldosterone, renin, and ARR to predict the blood pressure response to each drug and to explore the role of aldosterone in patients with resistant hypertension. Thus, patients recruited after 2012 with available baseline aldosterone measurements were included in substudy 1.</p><p id="para160">Patients were eligible for substudy 2 dependent on which location they were recruited from; seven of the 12 secondary care sites had the necessary specialist equipment. Substudy 2 assessed the effects of spironolactone, bisoprolol, and doxazosin treatments on thoracic fluid, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance and whether patients' most effective drug was predicted by increased baseline measurements of the parameter most likely to be reduced by that drug.</p><p id="para170">After the double-blind rotation, patients were offered the option of returning to primary care or continuing into an open-label runout phase (substudy 3). This opportunity for a non-randomised study of an alternative to spironolactone arose from the need for a period between each patient's final visit and completion of their electronic record, after which their best treatment could be unmasked. In this open-label phase, we assessed whether amiloride would have similar superiority to the other study drugs as was hypothesised for spironolactone, and, if so, whether a correlation between responses would support switching from spironolactone to amiloride in patients who became intolerant of spironolactone.</p><p id="para180">All study participants provided written informed consent as part of consent for the main trial and the protocol for these studies was approved by the Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para190">In the main PATHWAY-2 trial, after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients rotated through four cycles of once-daily oral treatment with spironolactone 25&#x02013;50 mg, doxazosin 4&#x02013;8 mg, bisoprolol 5&#x02013;10 mg, and placebo, each for 12 weeks with forced titration to the higher dose after 6 weeks. The order in which drugs were administered to each patient was randomly assigned via a central computer system. Patients and investigators were masked to drug treatment groups. Blood was collected at the end of the placebo run-in, and batched results did not inform eligibility of individual patients for either the main trial or its substudies. Plasma renin was measured in a central laboratory as direct renin mass using the LIAISON automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Plasma aldosterone was also measured using the LIAISON automated chemiluminescent immunoassay<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> or by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="para200">For substudy 2, non-invasive haemodynamic assessments of fluid balance, cardiac performance, and vascular resistance were done with the patient supine, at baseline and at the end of each treatment cycle, using thoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiography (CardioDynamics BioZ Impedance Cardiography Hemodynamic Monitor, CardioDynamics, San Diego, CA, USA).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Four pairs of electrocardiogram electrodes were applied to the base of the neck and the lower thorax at the diaphragm level, and a high frequency, low magnitude current was applied. The difference between input and sensed voltage is established by the impedance of the thorax, which is inversely proportional to thoracic fluid volume. Stroke volume is calculated from the change of impedance (thoracic fluid content) over the cardiac cycle time. Because cardiac output and total body fluid volume is related to body mass, all blood flow parameters were indexed to body surface area in m<sup>2</sup>. Stroke index was calculated as stroke volume divided by body surface area (mL per heart beat per m<sup>2</sup>). Cardiac index (cardiac output) was calculated as stroke index multiplied by heart rate (L/min/m<sup>2</sup>). Systemic vascular resistance index was then derived from the measurements of cardiac index and blood pressure (dyn&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;&#x02008;&#x02008;&#x02008;sec/cm&#x02075;/m<sup>2</sup>).

Seated clinic blood pressure was measured after 6 and 12 weeks of amiloride treatment.</p><p id="para220">In the main PATHWAY-2 study, blood pressure was measured both as a home blood pressure average and seated clinic blood pressure. For substudy 1 examining the relations between hormones and the blood pressure response to treatment, home systolic blood pressure measurements were used. Home blood pressure was a single mean of 24 seated home blood pressure readings recorded in the morning and evening for 4 consecutive days, with triplicate readings at each measurement session. Home blood pressure was recorded over the 4 days before the baseline visit at the end of placebo run-in, and before the 6-week and 12-week visits of each double-blind treatment cycle. If incomplete, a minimum of six of the 24 possible blood pressure recordings over 4 days was required, or patients were excluded from the analysis.</p><p id="para230">Home blood pressure was not recorded during the open-label amiloride runout phase. Thus in substudy 3, the clinic blood pressure-lowering effect of amiloride was compared with clinic blood pressure reduction on other active treatments or placebo. Clinic blood pressure was the average of the last two of the triplicate readings recorded at the 6-weekly study visits during both the double-blind treatment cycles and the open-label amiloride runout.

In the haemodynamic substudy (substudy 2) of patients at the seven sites that had a CardioDynamics BioZ Impedance Cardiography Hemodynamic Monitor (SonoSite, San Diego, CA USA), the main outcomes were the changes in thoracic fluid index, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance between baseline and the end of each double-blind treatment. In the amiloride substudy (substudy 3) of patients who continued after the double-blind treatment cycles into an optional open-label runout on amiloride, the main outcome was change in clinic systolic blood pressure between baseline and end of 6 weeks (low-dose) or 12 weeks (high-dose) of amiloride treatment.

It seems reasonable now to conclude that resistant hypertension, as previously suspected,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> is predominantly a salt-retaining state, often caused by primary or secondary aldosteronism.</p><p id="para390">One of the best measures of sodium balance is plasma renin, as shown by the dose-related, several-times increases in plasma renin caused by each of the diuretic treatments in PATHWAY-3.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Definition of normal ranges for plasma renin is difficult in patients receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs&#x02014;in particular the A+C+D classes required for a diagnosis of resistant hypertension, all of which increase concentrations of plasma renin.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> However, the median plasma renin value of 34 mU/L in PATHWAY-2 was only three times greater than the median value (11 mU/L) in the 605 patients with untreated hypertension in PATHWAY-1, who had similar blood pressure values on no treatment.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Because we can compare the same patient's response to each of a diuretic drug (spironolactone; efficacy inversely correlated to renin) and RAS-blocking drug (bisoprolol; positively correlated), we can establish the point between the bottom and top of the renin distribution at which the diuretic is predicted by the plasma renin concentration to be less effective than the RAS blocker (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In the patients with resistant hypertension in PATHWAY-2, this point lies at the extreme right of the renin distribution, with all but 3% of patients predicted to respond better to diuretic than RAS blocker. This finding is in striking contrast to the effects seen in the previously untreated patients of PATHWAY-1, in whom a crossover comparison of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and losartan 100 mg was done, and the diuretic efficacy is predicted by plasma renin concentration to exceed that of the RAS blocker in fewer than half the patients.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Notably, the relatively low median plasma renin in PATHWAY-2 is not due to impaired renal clearance because the eGFR was normal. Nor was it due to excessive dietary sodium intake as the 24 h urinary sodium was typical of that seen in western Europe.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="para400">Aldosterone secretion is normally suppressed when renin is low, unless there is autonomous aldosterone production&#x02014;eg, from an aldosterone-producing adenoma. This aldosterone suppression is apparent during acute salt loading, in cross-sectional studies of dietary sodium intake, in some of the rare monogenic causes of hypertension, and in patients whose low-renin hypertension is due to derivatives of naturally occurring mineralocorticoids.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Unsuppressed plasma aldosterone values raise suspicion that they are the driver of salt retention. The paucity of patients with low plasma aldosterone and low plasma renin in our study is consistent with aldosterone having a primary role in many patients with resistant hypertension.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, none of the patients, even one whose hypertension was cured by removal of a 7 mm aldosterone-producing adenoma,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> exhibited the triad of spontaneous hypokalaemia, completely suppressed renin, and plasma aldosterone of more than 550 pmol/L that is currently required for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism if a suppression test (the alternative method of diagnosis) is to be avoided.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p id="para410">The absence of this triad could be anticipated from the eligibility criteria for PATHWAY-2. Yet, despite our exclusion of patients with known or suspected secondary hypertension, even the more conservative of our estimates for primary aldosteronism frequency (10%) exceeds the prevalence of 99 (5&#x000b7;9%) of 1672 unselected patients with hypertension who were recruited from primary care (like most patients in PATHWAY-2), and is similar to the 126 (11&#x000b7;2%) of 1125 newly diagnosed patients referred to specialist clinics.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Our estimate was enabled by the recent prospective comparison of confirmatory tests for primary aldosteronism, showing that a post-captopril ARR greater than 60&#x000b7;94 pmol/L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per mU/L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is equivalent to a positive saline suppression test, because all patients at entry to PATHWAY-2 were already treated with maximum-tolerated doses of RAS blocker. At most, nine patients might have been excluded from PATHWAY-2 if entry had (implausibly) required two ARR estimations in all screened patients and follow-up confirmatory tests when ARR was higher than 60&#x000b7;94 pmol/L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per mU/L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p id="para420">However, the criteria for suspecting and diagnosing primary aldosteronism are likely to miss many of the zona glomerulosa subtype of aldosterone-producing adenomas. Their responsiveness to angiotensin and frequent gain-of-function mutations in an L-type calcium channel<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> imply that their aldosterone secretion might be reduced by RAS or calcium blockers sufficiently to decrease to less than guideline thresholds, but insufficiently to prevent increasingly severe and high-risk hypertension. Zona glomerulosa-like aldosterone-producing adenomas, unlike the classical Conn's adenoma, are more common in men than in women, are often small, and are more likely to present as resistant hypertension than a CT finding.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our post-hoc finding of sex difference in the aldosterone&#x02013;renin association is therefore notable in this context. The same is true of unilateral or bilateral hyperplasia, the pathological basis on which is increasingly recognised as clusters of aldosterone synthase-rich zona glomerulosa cells. These clusters have a several-times higher expression of adrenocorticotropic hormone receptors than adjacent zona glomerulosa, and many clusters have the same somatic mutations as are found in zona glomerulosa-like adenomas.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><p id="para430">We have therefore reported an analysis independent of ARR, which points to a substantially higher upper estimate for prevalence of primary aldosteronism in patients with resistant hypertension than the 10% estimated by ARR. Acute changes in aldosterone concentrations can result in dramatic changes in urine sodium-to-potassium ratio.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> At a steady state, these are less apparent, but they contribute to an index based on the SUSPPUP ratio that has only slightly lower accuracy than ARR itself in detecting patients with proven primary aldosteronism.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The correlation of blood pressure response to spironolactone but not to the other drugs in PATHWAY-2 offers some independent support for the sodium-to-potassium or SUSPPUP ratio as a diagnostic threshold. The 48 (38%) of 126 PATHWAY-2 substudy patients who had a ratio greater than the published threshold<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> of 5&#x000b7;3 (mmol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is similar to the proportion of unselected patients with hypertension who have an apparently normal ARR but develop acute hyperaldosteronism on stress (eg, treadmill test) or ultra-low dose (30 ng) of adrenocorticotropic hormone.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> In one study,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> the SUSPPUP threshold of 5&#x000b7;3 (mmol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> had lower accuracy; however, some variation is unsurprising because ARR itself has no single, universally agreed threshold.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p id="para440">What practical role, then, do we now envisage for the assessments and interventions reported here? The non-invasive haemodynamic measurements were previously proposed as a device for selecting the best treatment in resistant hypertension.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, we did not find the measurements to be useful for prediction, perhaps because only one drug was the best in the large majority of patients. Of greater practical value might be our finding that amiloride seems similarly effective to spironolactone in the treatment of resistant hypertension. The efficacy and tolerability of amiloride when used in adequate doses are supported by our randomised comparison of amiloride 10&#x02013;20 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 25&#x02013;50 mg in PATHWAY-3.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although spironolactone was well tolerated over 12 weeks, gynaecomastia is a concern with longer-term treatment. Retrospective reports that its anti-androgen activity is associated with lower incidence of carcinoma of the prostate might persuade some patients to tolerate the gynaecomastia.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Amiloride could now be considered an alternative for patients in whom spironolactone is not tolerated.</p><p id="para450">As for the increased awareness of primary aldosteronism as a potentially preventable or curable cause of resistant hypertension, possible investigations and treatments in selected centres and patients will probably vary greatly, as will what can be more widely recommended on the basis of available clinical and health economic evidence. Prospective evaluation of sodium-to-potassium ratios might allow their use as an initial screening filter. Management of primary aldosteronism is rapidly changing as less invasive modalities become available for diagnosis and treatment of functional adenomas.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p id="para460">Our study has some limitations. By design, only some of the patients in PATHWAY-2 participated in the various substudies. However, baseline characteristics were similar between the cohorts. Prospective power was calculated for the primary outcome in PATHWAY-2, but not for the individual substudies, which were intended to allow prespecified, secondary mechanistic analyses that might help to explain the results of the main study. In our favour, the size of the study proved much larger than necessary to detect the primary outcome, having been powered to detect a difference of only 3 mm Hg between spironolactone and other drugs, at an &#x003b1; of 0&#x000b7;003;<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> indeed, post-hoc analysis of the first cycle of treatment showed the superiority of spironolactone in just 80 patients.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Urine aldosterone measurements might have helped to confirm a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism. Finally, the similarity and correlation of the amiloride responses with those previously measured on spironolactone add qualified support for use of open-label treatment to simplify and encourage complex rotation studies,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> but do not guarantee that the two potassium-sparing diuretics are interchangeable. The finding that only the spironolactone response correlated with SUSPPUP might point to spironolactone as the more effective drug when aldosterone is the cause of sodium retention, and amiloride when the cause is clearly downstream.</p><p id="para470">We conclude that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone is an effective treatment of resistant hypertension because resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining condition probably due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Amiloride seems to be an effective, well tolerated alternative to spironolactone. Finally, our findings should encourage debate about whether thresholds for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism should be reconsidered in patients presenting with resistant hypertension, and about the possibility of earlier diagnosis of primary aldosteronism to prevent development of resistant hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
