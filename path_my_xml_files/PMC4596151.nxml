Training people to inhibit simple motor responses (key presses) to high-energy density food pictures reduces intake in laboratory studies. We examined whether online response inhibition training reduced real-world food consumption and weight in a community sample of adults who were predominantly overweight or obese (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;83). Participants were allocated in a randomised, double-blind design to receive four 10-min sessions of either active or control go/no-go training in which either high-energy density snack foods (active) or non-food stimuli (control) were associated with no-go signals. Participants' weight, energy intake (calculated from 24-h food diaries), daily snacking frequency and subjective food evaluations were measured for one week pre- and post-intervention. Participants also provided self-reported weight and monthly snacking frequency at pre-intervention screening, and one month and six months after completing the study. Participants in the active relative to control condition showed significant weight loss, reductions in daily energy intake and a reduction in rated liking of high-energy density (no-go) foods from the pre-to post-intervention week. There were no changes in self-reported daily snacking frequency. At longer-term follow-up, the active group showed significant reductions in self-reported weight at six months, whilst both groups reported significantly less snacking at one- and six-months. Excellent rates of adherence (97%) and positive feedback about the training suggest that this intervention is acceptable and has the potential to improve public health by reducing energy intake and overweight.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>We examine whether response inhibition training alters real-world eating behaviour.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Food no-go training (active) reduces energy intake, weight and food liking.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Non-food no-go training (control) has no effect pre-to post-intervention.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Both groups show reduced snacking at one and six-month follow-ups.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Active training is associated with self-reported weight loss at six-months.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Response inhibition</kwd><kwd>Cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Energy intake</kwd><kwd>Food liking</kwd><kwd>Disinhibition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity has shown an increase over the past 30 years and the majority of adults in the US and UK are now overweight or obese (65&#x02013;70%; <xref rid="bib16 bib67" ref-type="bibr">Flegal, 2005; Wang &#x00026; Beydoun, 2007</xref>). Overeating in a food-rich environment is a key contributor to rising obesity levels (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hill, Wyatt, Reed, &#x00026; Peters, 2003</xref>) begging the question, how can we support people to reduce their over-consumption of food? Weight management interventions need to include behaviour change strategies that improve eating behaviour and reduce energy intake (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cavill &#x00026; Ells, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several models of self-control, notably dual process models, indicate that one important determinant of behaviour toward palatable, high-energy density foods is the unintentional elicitation of motor impulses towards these foods (<xref rid="bib24 bib43 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann, Friese, &#x00026; Wiers, 2008; Metcalfe &#x00026; Mischel, 1999; Strack &#x00026; Deutsch, 2004</xref>). These fast-acting, associatively-mediated impulses are thought to be regulated by a slow, controlled, reflective system that enables explicit goals and personal standards to influence behaviour, e.g. via top-down cognitive control. The strength of the impulses towards food and whether or not they give rise to consumption, depends on the interaction between the impulsive and reflective system, which are reflected in individual differences in food reward-sensitivity and self-control, respectively (<xref rid="bib23 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann, Friese, &#x00026; Roefs, 2009; Lawrence, Hinton, Parkinson, &#x00026; Lawrence, 2012</xref>). Individuals who show a strong reward-related response to foods combined with low levels of self-control are particularly susceptible to overeating and overweight, whereas those with effective self-control appear to be protected (<xref rid="bib36 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Nederkoorn, Houben, Hofmann, Roefs, &#x00026; Jansen, 2010</xref>). This supports substantial evidence linking behavioural measures of poor self-control, namely motor response inhibition measured using stop-signal and go/no-go tasks (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Verbruggen &#x00026; Logan, 2008a</xref>), to overeating and overweight (<xref rid="bib3 bib18 bib30 bib44 bib45 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Batterink, Yokum, &#x00026; Stice, 2010; Guerrieri et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Houben, Nederkoorn, &#x00026; Jansen, 2014; Nederkoorn, Braet, Van Eijs, Tanghe, &#x00026; Jansen, 2006a, 2012; 2006b</xref>). Thus regulation or reduction of food-related impulses seems to be required to control eating behaviour in our plentiful food environment and is a promising target for weight management interventions aimed at the habitual or impulsive system (<xref rid="bib41 bib57" ref-type="bibr">Marteau, Hollands, &#x00026; Fletcher, 2012; Van't Riet, Sijtsema, Dagevos, &#x00026; Bruijn, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Laboratory studies suggest that the inhibition of responses to specific stimuli can be trained using consistent stimulus-stop or no-go associations, resulting in automatic response inhibition (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Verbruggen &#x00026; Logan, 2008b</xref>). More specifically, response inhibition is said to be 'automatic' when it is triggered by the retrieval of stimulus-stop associations from memory (<xref rid="bib38 bib65" ref-type="bibr">Logan, 1988; Verbruggen &#x00026; Logan, 2008b</xref>). Training response inhibition to specific snack food stimuli reduces the subsequent intake, choice and self-served portion size of those foods (<xref rid="bib26 bib28 bib29 bib37 bib56 bib59 bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Houben, 2011; Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011, 2015; Lawrence, Verbruggen, Morrison, Adams, &#x00026; Chambers, 2015; Van Koningsbruggen, Veling, Stroebe, &#x00026; Aarts, 2014; Veling, Aarts, &#x00026; Papies, 2011; Veling, Aarts, &#x00026; Stroebe, 2013a; 2013b</xref>). These training effects are particularly pronounced in restrained eaters (<xref rid="bib28 bib37 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011; Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), who are prone to overeating when disinhibited and frequently attempt to diet with or without success (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Lowe, 1993</xref>). Response inhibition training effects on food choices are also stronger in those with a high appetite and in those who frequently consume the palatable, high-energy density &#x02018;no-go&#x02019; training foods (<xref rid="bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2013a; 2013b</xref>), suggesting stronger training effects in those most vulnerable to overeating and overweight.</p><p>In terms of the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of food response inhibition training on reduced food intake and choice, findings suggest that stimuli associated with response inhibition show reductions in motor excitability and reward value (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Verbruggen, McLaren, &#x00026; Chambers, 2014</xref>). For example, the automatic motor impulses activated by stimuli, and in particular palatable food cues, are reduced following response-inhibition training (<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib29 bib59 bib64" ref-type="bibr">Chiu, Aron, &#x00026; Verbruggen, 2012; Chiu, Cools, &#x00026; Aron, 2014; Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2015; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Verbruggen &#x00026; Logan, 2008a</xref>), and this may be associated with reduced food consumption (<xref rid="bib29 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2015; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <italic>cf</italic>&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Houben, Havermans, Nederkoorn, &#x00026; Jansen, 2012</xref>). In terms of reward value, affective cues associated with no-go responses show a reduction in rated valence (<xref rid="bib14 bib62 bib60" ref-type="bibr">Doallo et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Veling, Holland, &#x00026; van Knippenberg, 2008; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2013a</xref>) and more negative implicit affective reactions (<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib27 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Houben et&#x000a0;al., 2011; 2012; Veling &#x00026; Aarts, 2009</xref>). If food-associated response inhibition training effectively boosts automatic motor inhibition and reduces the reward value associated with food cues, it could help at-risk individuals control their food intake. This study therefore examined the effects of repeated sessions of food-associated no-go training, delivered via the internet, on a range of &#x02018;real world&#x02019; measures of eating behaviour.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>The present study</title><p>Previous studies have employed both stop-signal and go/no-go tasks to train associations between foods and motor inhibition. Stop-signal tasks impose a delay between the stimulus and a stop signal and so require the cancellation of an initiated response, whereas the no-go signal is presented at the same time as the stimulus so a response should not be initiated (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Schachar et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Recent findings from our lab suggest that food no-go training (&#x02018;action restraint&#x02019;) may be more effective than stop-training in reducing food intake (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams, Verbruggen, Lawrence, &#x00026; Chambers, 2014</xref>, discussed in <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) so here we used a food go/no-go task based on our lab studies, in which high-energy density foods (greater than 4&#x000a0;kcal/g) were consistently associated with no-go signals and healthy, lower-energy density foods were consistently associated with go-signals.</p><p>Lab studies to date have compared food response inhibition training to control conditions requiring either consistent or inconsistent &#x02018;go&#x02019; responses to foods, which may have inadvertently increased approach towards, and intake of food in control participants (<xref rid="bib37 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015; Schonberg et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). To avoid this potential confound, the present study employed a control condition in which participants were trained to inhibit responses to non-food pictures and were never exposed to pictures of high-energy density foods. As the active group were repeatedly exposed to images of high-energy density food (paired with no-go responses) during training, mere exposure effects would predict <italic>increased</italic> food intake in the active relative to control group (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fedoroff, Polivy, &#x00026; Herman, 1997</xref>); any reduction is therefore likely due to the food-associated inhibition training, which may include related processes such as food cue exposure with response prevention.</p><p>Participants completed four sessions of food-related (versus control) no-go training in one week and effects on weight loss, energy intake and daily snacking frequency were measured. We also examined training effects on two variables used in previous laboratory studies - subjective ratings of food images (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2013a</xref>) and food intake in a taste test presented immediately following an additional training session (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Finally, we measured the longer-term effects of training by contacting participants one month and six months after their final session and asking them to provide their current weight and snacking frequency. We predicted that the active group would show a greater reduction than the control group in weight, snacking frequency, energy intake and snack food intake in the taste test. We also expected a larger reduction (devaluation) in subjective ratings of the high-energy density (no-go) foods in the active relative to control group.</p><p>Since the current research was conducted a similar study has been published that associated stop signals with many palatable foods and drinks in a dieting sample to facilitate weight loss (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling, Koningsbruggen, Aarts, &#x00026; Stroebe, 2014</xref>). Four weekly training sessions delivered via the internet resulted in weight loss in the active group relative to a control group that, like here, was trained to inhibit to non-food images. The <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> sample included predominantly young, healthy females, and the effects of no-go training on weight loss were greater in higher BMI participants. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> suggested that further work was required to determine whether the food no-go intervention is associated with weight-loss over the longer term, whether it is effective in more overweight participants, and what the possible mechanisms of training effects are before this promising intervention can be recommended as a weight-loss tool. All of these factors were addressed in the current study, which recruited predominantly middle-aged overweight or obese adults, followed them up over a longer period of time and examined some putative mechanisms underlying training effects. The current study is therefore relevant in assessing the potential of food no-go training on weight loss and eating behaviour in those most in need of intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups, with a between group factor of response inhibition training (active versus control) and a within subjects factor of time (pre versus post-intervention).

These included open-ended questions about the sweetness, saltiness and taste of the two foods, along with Likert scales measuring palatability and usual frequency of consumption. This test provided a more immediate and objective measure of training effects on consumption and attempted to replicate previous studies where consumption in the laboratory was measured following a single training session (<xref rid="bib26 bib28 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Houben, 2011; Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011; Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><label>2.8</label><title>Training task</title><p>During the online training task, pictures of 18 food (or non-food in the control group) and 18 non-food filler objects were presented individually on the left or right-hand side of a computer screen for 1250&#x000a0;ms followed by a 1250&#x000a0;ms inter-stimulus interval. Participants had to press a button (&#x02018;c&#x02019; for left and &#x02018;m&#x02019; for right) as quickly and accurately as possible to indicate the side of presentation (go-trials; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). On half of the trials, the frame surrounding the picture was bold, which was a signal for participants to withhold their response (no-go trials, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Each of the 36 images was presented once per block and participants completed 6 blocks per training session. They were provided with feedback (accuracy and mean go RT) at the end of each block to increase their motivation, and had to press a key to continue with the task.</p><p>In the active training task images consisted of 18 foods, of which 9 were healthy (fruit, vegetables, rice cakes) and 9 high-energy density (greater than 4&#x000a0;kcal/g; biscuits, chocolate, crisps &#x02013; see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary methods</xref>), along with 18 non-food filler pictures (clothes). In the control training task images consisted of 18 household objects (furniture, stationery, gardening tools) and the same 18 filler clothes pictures. Food and non-food images were matched as closely as possible for size, colour and visual complexity. Each picture was presented inside a rectangular frame against a white background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>In the active group, high-energy density food images were <italic>always</italic> paired with no-go signals (resulting in 54 high-energy density food-no-go trials per training session), whereas healthy foods were <italic>never</italic> paired with no-go signals (54 healthy food-go trials per training session). The filler images of non-food items (clothes) were equally associated with go and no-go signals (54 go and 54 no-go trials per training session), resulting in 50% no-go trials overall. The inclusion of filler images with unpredictable responses served to make the task more challenging and engaging, and aimed to make the rule less obvious in order to recruit learning in the automatic, associative system, rather than the explicit, rule-based system. In the control group, participants completed an identical task except that pictures of non-food objects replaced the food pictures. The &#x02018;go&#x02019; non-food images included electrical items, furniture and buckets and the &#x02018;no-go&#x02019; non-food images consisted of DIY tools, gardening tools and stationery. The speed and accuracy of responses to foods and non-foods was measured and stored on a secure server.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><label>2.9</label><title>Procedure</title><p>A timeline of the study is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>. Researchers visited participants at their home or place of work to complete an introductory baseline session where participants were informed about how to complete the 24-h diaries and daily FFQs, and gave consent. Participants then performed the baseline stimulus evaluation test on the researcher's laptop, rating food liking and image attractiveness. The researcher then weighed the participant and gave them a set of seven daily FFQs and two 24-h food diaries to complete during the following baseline week (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>).</p><p>After the first week of recording baseline FFQs and 24-h diaries participants started their online response inhibition training at their home or place of work. The researcher showed the participant how to access the online training, read them the instructions and gave them a unique identification code. When participants were ready, they entered their identification code, which was randomly assigned to either the active (response inhibition) or control condition by the computer script using a random number generator. Participants had been told that they would receive either an active or control training task but were given no further information and were therefore blind to condition allocation. After completing the training (10&#x000a0;min), participants were given another set of seven daily FFQs and two 24-h food diaries to complete at home during the intervention (training) week.</p><p>Participants were then asked to complete a second, third and fourth training session on their own over the following three days (intervention week<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">2</xref>). We did not check and encourage compliance (e.g. using reminder phone calls or emails) because we wanted to determine the feasibility of online food no-go training by measuring &#x02018;natural&#x02019; rates of compliance. As indicated above, 82% of participants completed all four training sessions with half doing this on the requested days (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary materials</xref>). After the intervention week, researchers visited the participants for the third and final time to collect their intervention week FFQs and 24-h food diaries and administer the stimulus evaluation (ratings) test again. Participants then completed the online training task for a final time followed by the taste test. They were also given four filler questionnaires during the taste test (as in <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) to keep them occupied whilst being exposed to the food. Participants were told they could eat as much food as they wanted and were left alone for 15&#x000a0;min, after which the researcher returned, took the food away, weighed the participants and debriefed them. A funnelled debriefing interview (taken from <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) asked participants a series of questions to gauge awareness of the task (stimulus-no-go) associations and to gather feedback about the intervention (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>).</p><p>Finally, participants were asked to complete a short follow-up questionnaire one month and six months after study completion by phone or email, where they provided current (self-reported) weight and monthly FFQ for the past four weeks. Participants were no longer blind to condition allocation at these follow-ups: Due to the probing nature of the debrief interview, participants may have guessed which group they had been allocated to so we decided to un-blind participants during debriefing to standardise awareness. The active participants were given detailed information about the rationale of the training task, however the control participants were informed that general inhibition training may also facilitate weight loss. A small number of participants (16%) voluntarily completed a small number of additional training sessions in-between the one-month and six-month follow-ups. Excluding these participants did not make any difference to the results (see footnotes in Results section).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.10"><label>2.10</label><title>Power analysis</title><p>An a priori power calculation (conducted using G-power 3.1.5) based on data from a single-session food no-go training study (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) determined that a total sample of N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55 would be required to obtain statistical power at the recommended .80 level (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1988</xref>).

The modprobe SPSS macro (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hayes &#x00026; Matthes, 2009</xref>), which explores interactions in multiple regressions, was used with training condition (dummy-coded) as the focal predictor variable, measured weight change at 2 weeks as the dependent variable and baseline BMI as the moderator variable.

Participants completed up to four go/no-go training sessions during the intervention week in either an active (food-associated response inhibition) or control (non-food-associated response inhibition) condition. Participants in the active relative to control condition showed significant weight loss from pre-to post-intervention as well as a reduction in energy intake and liking of high-energy density (no-go) foods. High rates of adherence (97%) and positive feedback suggest the intervention is highly acceptable.</p><p>Weight loss from baseline to post-intervention in the active group supports recent research showing that similar food no-go training facilitated weight loss (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Both studies demonstrated similar medium intervention (between-group) effects on weight loss (d<sub>s</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.54 and 0.57) and add to laboratory research showing that food response inhibition training reduces the intake, choice and self-served portion size of no-go foods (<xref rid="bib26 bib28 bib29 bib37 bib56 bib59 bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Houben, 2011; Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011, 2015; Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015; Van Koningsbruggen et&#x000a0;al., 2014; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011, 2013a, 2013b</xref>). Self-reported weight loss at six-month but not one-month follow-up in the active group suggests that training effects may persist over longer periods. However, these follow-up data should be interpreted with caution as participants were no longer blind to condition allocation and, whilst self-reported weight is considered a satisfactory measure in web-based weight interventions (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Pursey et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), it can over-estimate intervention effects on weight loss (e.g. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Allom &#x00026; Mullan, 2015</xref>). Future studies will therefore need to corroborate these findings using objectively measured weight.</p><p>Training effects on measures of eating behaviour were more mixed. Daily snack food intake (FFQs) showed a small but unreliable decrease from the baseline to intervention week and did not differ between groups, supporting similar negative findings from <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> who used a more comprehensive 24-h FFQ. However, daily calorie intake estimated from 24-h food diaries did show a significant reduction in the active compared to control group, suggesting that food diaries may be a more sensitive and representative measure of daily intake than FFQs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bingham et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). FFQs list specific foods only and do not measure portion size (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Paalanen et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>); participants may have been consuming smaller portions of snack foods or less of other type(s) of high-energy density food in our study. Interestingly, there were similar significant decreases in monthly snacking frequency at follow-up relative to screening in both groups, suggesting that monthly FFQs may be a more sensitive outcome variable than daily FFQs. This could be due to the summation of subtle changes in snacking frequency over a longer period of time, or because the FFQ at screening was undertaken prior to involvement in the study and therefore participants may have reported higher levels of snacking due to a lack of demand characteristics or self-monitoring (which may have already reduced snacking during the baseline week). The reduction in monthly snacking at follow-up in both groups points to non-specific intervention effects, such as self-monitoring (FFQs and 24-h food diaries), which could have made all participants more aware of their eating behaviour resulting in reduced intake (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Burke, Wang, &#x00026; Sevick, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, during debriefing half of the participants in each group voluntarily reported that they had found the self-monitoring component &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d;.</p><p>The debriefing interviews also revealed that more active (40%) than control (12%) participants thought that the training had influenced their snacking behaviour. This could reflect either subjective awareness of genuine training effects or demand characteristics. We favour the former interpretation as do not believe that many participants knew which group they were in; they had no prior knowledge about this research and were given no information about the different tasks &#x02013; those in the control group did not know that the active participants were seeing foods in their task, and vice-versa. Participant debriefing from our lab studies suggested that those receiving active training believed that exposure to tasty food pictures in the task may have made them hungrier and eat more food in the subsequent taste test (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), so one cannot assume that seeing foods made participants aware of which group they were in. Similarly, as many studies have examined the effects of general executive function training (e.g. working memory or response inhibition tasks involving neutral stimuli) on impulsive behaviours (e.g. <xref rid="bib32 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Houben, Wiers and Jansen, 2011; Bickel, Yi, Landes, Hill, &#x00026; Baxter, 2011</xref>), we felt that the control task was a plausible &#x0201c;brain training&#x0201d; intervention and participants would not necessarily guess they were in the control group.</p><p>In terms of possible mechanisms underlying the food no-go training effects, findings from the stimulus evaluation (liking ratings) offer tentative but inconclusive support for stimulus devaluation (<xref rid="bib62 bib60 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2008, 2013a; Houben et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Active training reduced liking of high-energy density no-go foods, and this drop in liking was moderately associated with weight loss in the active group however it did not mediate training effects on weight loss. Perhaps more extensive, sensitive or implicit measures of stimulus evaluation are required to detect mediation effects (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Houben et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Ratings of image attractiveness also changed pre-to post-intervention (decreasing for high-energy density foods but increasing for healthy foods) however this occurred in both groups, pointing to general intervention effects such as self-monitoring. The different results observed for liking and attractiveness could be linked to, respectively, a greater sensitivity to detect hedonic reactions and motivation to consume the foods (liking of taste) as opposed to general affective responses (attractiveness of image).</p><p>The lack of direct correlation between change in daily calorie intake and measured weight loss from pre-to post-intervention also raises questions about the mechanism underlying training effects on weight loss. It has been suggested that 24-h diaries and recalls are a sensitive dietary assessment tool at the group level but not at the individual level, unless multiple recalls are used (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ma et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). As this was a preliminary study and we wanted to avoid excess burden on participants, we only used two diaries in our pre- and post-intervention week, which may not have provided sufficient sensitivity to detect individual changes that were correlated with weight loss (<xref rid="bib49 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pears et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Ma et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that other mechanisms that were not measured, such as changes in exercise, contributed to weight loss.</p><p>We did not observe any effects of food response inhibition training on consumption in the taste test in contrast to previous studies (<xref rid="bib26 bib28 bib29 bib59 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Houben, 2011; Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011, 2015; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Most previous studies were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions where participants were asked not to eat for 2 or 3&#x000a0;h and were seen individually in a lab at specific times of day, whereas the current taste test was conducted in an uncontrolled context (participants' place of work or home) without the time of day, time since last food intake or hunger levels being controlled. These methodological differences may have contributed to lower levels of consumption in the current study (151&#x02013;187&#x000a0;kcal) compared to the 358&#x02013;415&#x000a0;kcal consumed in our lab studies that used an identical taste test and very similar response inhibition training (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In addition, all lab studies have used control conditions matched for food cue exposure, i.e. control participants had to execute a &#x02018;go&#x02019; response to high-energy density foods on at least half of the trials. This may have increased approach motivation towards foods (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Schonberg et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) or primed disinhibition (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Guerrieri, Nederkoorn, &#x00026; Jansen, 2012</xref>) and therefore increased the subsequent intake of food in taste tests, confounding the interpretation of results (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>BMI did not moderate training effects on weight loss, unlike in a previous study (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). However, the current sample was older and more overweight than in <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> and was similar to their high BMI group. It is possible that once the majority of participants in a sample are overweight (here, 78%), there is no further moderation of food-response inhibition training effects by BMI (i.e. a ceiling effect). Future studies in unselected samples would clarify which factors moderate training effects and for whom such training is likely to be effective.</p><p>The current study had a number of limitations. First, it is unclear how participants' self-monitoring interacted with the food response inhibition training &#x02013; future studies should examine the effects of these factors separately and in combination on weight loss. It would also be useful to measure weight after the baseline week of self-monitoring to measure and control for its effect in both groups. Second, due to time constraints only a limited number of potential mechanisms of training were examined; studies could also examine changes in food-related inhibitory control and motor excitation (<xref rid="bib64 bib59 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Verbruggen &#x00026; Logan, 2008a; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Chiu et&#x000a0;al., 2012, 2014</xref>). Future studies could also include additional control conditions matched for food cue exposure (such as passive viewing of the same images presented in the active training task) to control for related processes such as food cue exposure with response prevention. Finally, as food response inhibition training may be especially effective for restrained eaters and chronic dieters (<xref rid="bib28 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Houben &#x00026; Jansen, 2011; Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>: <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) studies should continue to examine this in more detail using e.g. the dietary restraint scale (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Herman &#x00026; Polivy, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Now that promising short-term effects of online food response inhibition training have been established here and in a previous study (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) several important issues remain to be examined. First, more objective and detailed measures need to be taken at follow-up to determine longer-term training effects. It would also be useful to examine whether more training sessions conducted over longer periods of time, e.g. 14&#x02013;25 sessions over 4&#x02013;6 weeks (<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Houben et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), followed by &#x02018;booster sessions&#x02019; at weekly or monthly intervals produces larger and more long-lasting reductions in weight and calorie intake. Future research could also examine the effects of personalized training, whereby participants choose or upload their own high-energy density food images (that they would like to consume less of) as no-go stimuli, and select their own &#x02018;desirable&#x02019; low-calorie food images (that they would like to consume more of) as go stimuli. No-go training effects are stronger when foods initially evoke stronger impulses (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Veling, Aarts, &#x00026; Stroebe, 2013b</xref>), so personalized training using &#x02018;problem&#x02019; foods should be more effective than the standardized training presented here. Another potential research avenue is to examine whether combining food no-go training with other interventions (e.g. implementation intentions as in <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veling et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) or adding more explicit instructions/information about hypothesized mechanisms strengthens training effects. Finally, it would be useful to assess whether alternative methods of delivering the training (e.g. via mobile devices) makes it easier and more accessible, without reducing its effectiveness. In the current sample, 62% of participants thought the training would be acceptable on a smartphone, with some commenting positively on the privacy or convenience of this mode of delivery. The remaining 38% thought smartphone delivery would be problematic, with common reasons including the small size of the screen and buttons, and potential distractions if engaged in other activities or in public. Whilst future empirical research will help to identify how to optimize food no-go training effects, individuals will ultimately choose whether, when and how to do this type of training so offering flexibility may be important.</p><p>To conclude, this study suggests that food response inhibition training modifies real-world eating behaviour, reducing calorie intake and facilitating weight loss in a sample of predominantly middle-aged, overweight adults. High rates of adherence and positive feedback suggest the intervention is highly acceptable, and as it could be made freely available online it has the potential to help reduce the burden of overweight and obesity in an accessible and cost-effective manner.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"
