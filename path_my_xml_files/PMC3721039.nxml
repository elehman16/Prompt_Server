A total of 66 patients who underwent LDLT between 2001 and 2007 were enrolled in this study. According to different doses of tacrolimus, the recipients were randomly divided into two groups: the low-dose tacrolimus group (group A) and the normal-dose tacrolimus group (group B). The blood concentration of tacrolimus and its side effects including infection, hyperglycemia, hypertension, high blood creatinine and jaundice were monitored once a week at the perioperative period, and once a month thereafter. Besides, the survival rates of the recipients were analyzed at the 1- and 3-year time point after operation. Among these patients, no significant acute rejection was detected after LDLT. The incidences of infection, hyperglycemia, liver dysfunction and renal impairment in group A were markedly lower than those in group B. However, no significant differences were detected in the incidence of hypertension between the two groups. Moreover, the recipients in each group had a similar survival rate according to the results of 1- and 3-year follow-up. The incidence of side effects that associated with tacrolimus positively correlated with tacrolimus blood concentration. In conclusion, long-term and low-dose administration of tacrolimus is a safe and effective treatment for LDLT recipients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>living donor liver transplantation</kwd><kwd>tacrolimus</kwd><kwd>low dose</kwd><kwd>side effect</kwd><kwd>survival rate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is developed as a technique aimed at reducing the number of recipients waiting for liver transplantations. Since Strong et al. performed the first successful LDLT in 1989<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">[1]</xref>, there has been a significant increase in the number of LDLTs. Cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus form the basis of immunosuppressive regimens and are used at most liver transplantation centers. However, CsA therapy is associated with severe adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, dyslipidemia and hypertension. Recent studies showed that tacrolimus is preferred over CsA as an immunosuppressive agent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">[3]</xref>. In addition, another study suggested that although liver grafts from living donors showed immune compatibility to some extent, compatibility could be improved by lowering the concentration of immunosuppressive agents in blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">[4]</xref>. Approximately 10% of LDLT recipients could survive without intake of any immunosuppressive agents. Low dose administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as tacrolimus, might reduce the risk of graft rejection, as well as cut down the cost of immunosuppressive therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">[5]</xref>. However, correlation between the dosage of tacrolimus and the associated side effects and survival rates in LDLT patients is largely unknown. In this study, we performed 66 cases of LDLT and carried out long-term follow up in these recipients. The blood concentration of tacrolimus and the incidences of infection, hyperglycemia, hypertension, high blood creatinine, jaundice and survival rate were monitored periodically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and clinical information</title><p>A total of 66 patients who underwent LDLT at the authors' affiliated hospital between January 2001 and June 2007 were enrolled in this study. Among these patients, there were 45 males and 21 females, aged from 4 to 43 years (average 22.4&#x000b1;2.6 years). The primary diagnoses included Wilson's disease (38 cases), post-hepatic cirrhosis (22 cases) and primary hepatic carcinoma (6 cases). The liver grafts were donated from the patients' mothers (47 cases), fathers (16 cases), or wives (3 cases). The grafts were obtained from the following locations: the left lateral lobe (29 cases), the right lobe (28 cases), the left lobe (8 cases), and the extended right lobe (1 case). All the 66 recipients have undergone long-term follow-up. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the authors' affiliated institution.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Immunosuppressive regimens</title><p>Of the 66 cases, we administered the standard immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus (FK506, Fujisawa, Osaka, Japan), methylpred nisolone (Pfizer, Dalian, Liaoning, China) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Shanghai Roche, Shanghai, China). The recipients were randomly divided into the low-dose tacrolimus group (group A, <italic>n</italic> = 33) and the normal dose tacrolimus group (group B, <italic>n</italic> = 33). In the two groups, an identical immunosuppressive regimen was given, except the dose of tacrolimus administration. In group A, tacrolimus was given at a mean dose of 0.05 mg/kg&#x000b7;day during the first year and at 0.03 mg/kg&#x000b7;day thereafter. In group B, FK506 was given at a mean dose of 0.1 mg/kg&#x000b7;day initially and at 0.05 mg/kg&#x000b7;day thereafter. The dose of tacrolimus was modestly adjusted according to blood concentration. Methylpred-nisolone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were administered at conventional doses.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Monitoring blood concentration of FK506 and the incidence of infection, blood glucose, blood pressure, blood creatinine and jaundice</title><p>In the two groups, the blood concentration of FK506 was monitored once a week during the perioperative period, and once a month thereafter (TDx/FLx, Abbott, IL, USA). At the same time point, the blood samples were examined to detect the amount of leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), blood glucose, blood creatinine and serum bilirubin (Automated Biochemical Analyzer, AU2700, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan).

It is widely used to prevent allograft rejection in organ-transplant recipients. However, tacrolimus showed multiple side effects, such as infection, hyperglycemia, hypertension, renal injury and neurotoxicity, among which nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are the most serious side effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">[7]</xref>. These side effects are closely related to the blood levels of immunosuppressive agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">[9]</xref>. Among these side effects, most of the infectious complications after liver transplantation occur during the first month after transplantation, and to a lower extent, between the second and the sixth month after transplantation. After the sixth month, patients can be divided into two different categories according to the degree of immunosuppression achieved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">[10]</xref>. In this study, the incidence of infection in group A was significantly lower than that in group B. Three patients had infections in group A (1 patient had urinary tract infection and 2 patients had upper respiratory tract infection). In contrast, 11 recipients in group B had infection after LDLT (7 recipients had upper respiratory tract infection, 3 recipients had gastrointestinal tract infection, and 1 recipient had an unknown infection). Tacrolimus is known to be more diabetogenic than cyclosporine, particularly during the first month, when a high dose of these drugs is administered. However, when the doses are reduced significantly during long-term administration, this difference is decreased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">[11]</xref>. In the current study, during the early stage after transplantation, the incidences of hyperglycemia were 24.24% and 36.36% in group A and B, respectively. Thereafter, the incidence markedly decreased in group A, but not in group B. Therefore, the reduction of hyperglycemia occurrence is mainly related to low dose of FK506. In addition, the occurrence of hyperglycemia had also been related to liver dysfunction. As the level of serum bilirubin is closely associated with liver function, low dose of tacrolimus contributed to a lower incidence of jaundice. Among all these side effects, the most severe one is renal injury, which is most frequently associated with the toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">[13]</xref>. These drugs may cause renal failure by the following pathogenic mechanisms, including functional change which occurs as a result of renal arteriolar vasoconstriction, leading to reduction of glomerular filtration rate and eventually the development of tubular necrosis, structural injuries, such as ischemic arteriolopathy, glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and renal fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">[14]</xref>. In this study, the incidence of renal dysfunction in group A was significantly lower than that in group B. However, none of the patients suffered from apparent nervous system injury.</p><p>A previous study showed that immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids induce arterial hypertension. In this study, all the patients were administered an identical dose of corticosteroids, except tacrolimus. The percentages of patients with high blood pressure (HBP) were 6.06% and 9.38% in group A and B, respectively. Therefore, there was no correlation between the incidence of HBP and the dose of tacrolimus. Moreover, despite that low dose of tacrolimus contributed to a lower incidence of adverse effect, no significant difference in survival rate was detected between the two groups according to the 3-year follow-up data.</p><p>Graft ischemia reperfusion injury, surgical trauma and other factors are also associated with liver dysfunction, and reduced resistance to infection, all of which could overlap with the side effects of tacrolimus. Therefore, we could not assess the side effects precisely. In summary, the administration of low dose of tacrolimus lowers the incidences of side effects without decreasing the long term survival of LDLT recipients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
