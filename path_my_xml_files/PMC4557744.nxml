However, consumption of fatty fish, the main source of LC n-3-PUFAs is low in Western countries. Intakes of LC n-3-PUFA can be increased by taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil, algal oil, or krill oil. Recently, conflicting information was published on the relative bioavailability of these omega-3 supplements. A few studies suggested that the phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than the fish oil ethyl ester (EE) or triglyceride (TG) forms. Yet studies did not match the doses administered nor the concentrations of DHA and EPA per supplement across such comparisons, leading to questionable conclusions. This study was designed to compare the oral bioavailability of the same dose of both EPA and DHA in fish oil-EE vs. fish oil-TG vs. krill oil in plasma at the end of a four-week supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-six healthy adults (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22/arm) were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, three-treatment, multi-dose, parallel study.

Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at 4, 8, 12, 48, 72, 336, and 672&#x000a0;h.

However consumption of LC n-3-PUFA in the Western diet is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While no recommended daily intake for LC n-3-PUFA exists, authoritative bodies such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommend 500&#x000a0;mg/d for cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Intakes of LC n-3-PUFA can be increased by greater fish consumption or by taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil, algal oil or krill oil. Recently there has been conflicting and confusing information published on the relative oral bioavailability of these omega-3 supplements with a few studies suggesting that the phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than the ethyl ester (EE) or triglyceride (TG) forms of fish oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Yet some studies did not match the doses administered, the number of capsules provided, and/or the amounts of DHA and EPA per supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An open label study by Ulven, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] supplemented adults for seven weeks with nonequivalent doses of either krill oil (3&#x000a0;g/d) or fish oil TG (1.8&#x000a0;g/d) compared to a control (non- supplemented) group. The total EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA concentration and number of capsules administered were also not matched, making comparative bioavailability of these oils difficult. Schuchardt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] conducted an acute crossover bioavailability study comparing a single dose (1.68&#x000a0;g) of fish oil TG, EE and krill oil but the total concentration of each fatty acid, DHA and EPA was not equal between formulations. In order to reach a comparable total dose of EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA, subjects consumed 14 capsules of krill oil compared to 4 capsules of the fish oil. This was a single-dose kinetic study with the last sample collected at 72&#x000a0;h. The benefits of LC n-3-PUFA are based on chronic consumption. Therefore, it is important to assess levels of DHA and EPA after longer term use. Arterburn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated that steady state plasma levels of LC n-3-PUFA were achieved after 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The objective of this double-blind, randomized, three-treatment, multi-dose, parallel study was to compare the relative oral bioavailability of a 1.3&#x000a0;g/d dose of DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA in the form of fish oil-EE vs. fish oil-TG vs. krill oil. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that total plasma levels of DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA would not be significantly different between the formulations at Week 4. Total dose of EPA and DHA was approximately 816&#x000a0;mg/d and 522&#x000a0;mg/d, respectively regardless of formulation. The primary outcome was to assess and compare the total plasma levels of EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA across all 3 treatments at the end of the 4-week (Hour 672) study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and study design</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a flow chart of subject disposition.

Major exclusion criteria included a history or presence of diabetes, high triglycerides (&#x02265;240&#x000a0;mg/dL), or high cholesterol (&#x02265;240&#x000a0;mg/dL); history or presence of allergic or adverse response to omega-3-acids or sensitivity or allergy to fish or shellfish; history of coagulation disorder or current anticoagulation therapy; use of any nutritional supplements, omega-3 supplements, fish oil, chia, krill oil, or flaxseed within 3&#x000a0;months prior to the first dose of study product; consumed walnuts or any other food product supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., orange juice) or fatty fish &#x0003e;2 times per week within 14&#x000a0;days prior to the first dose; history or presence of any major, clinically significant disease or condition. Subjects were admitted to the research unit 24&#x000a0;h prior to study product administration and remained at the unit until 12&#x000a0;h after the first dose on Day 1. Subjects continued daily dosing over 28 consecutive days (4&#x000a0;weeks). Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1), and at 4, 8, 12, 48, 72, 336, and 672&#x000a0;h after dosing for fatty acid analyses. Fasting blood draws were taken pre-dose and at hour 672. A standard high fat meal was administered prior to first dose of study product. Vital signs and clinical lab values (including lipids) were measured during and at the end of the study, respectively.

The results demonstrate &#x0003c;24&#x000a0;% difference in bioavailability among the 3 products. The four week time course of supplementation was chosen as this time period typically demonstrates that omega-3 fatty acid plasma levels reach plateau (as observed in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) in healthy adults and is an estimate of steady-state levels and representative of short term intake. Our results also show nearly identical bioavailability among the groups at early timepoints (&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;h) of the plasma time course, illustrating no better bioavailability of one product versus another when equivalent concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids are administered. In contrast, a study by Kagan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of EPA from an algal oil supplement compared to krill oil at 5&#x02013;10 h post-supplementation with greater peak and total systemic exposure parameters, likely reflecting the greater EPA content of the algal product. Another single-dose, acute bioavailability study very recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found higher plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA levels at 72&#x000a0;h in krill oil vs. krill meal or fish oil, but did not find higher levels between the krill meal and fish oil, even given the same dose with relatively equal amounts of DHA and EPA. As Kohler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] pointed out, this result argues against an interpretation that phospholipids are better absorbed than triglycerides and suggested that a longer term supplementation study, measuring RBC levels, was needed. As phospholipid levels represent only one fraction of the total fatty acid profile, it may also be important to measure changes in the other lipid fractions or measure total plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid changes over time.</p><p>No significant differences in mean RBC concentrations of DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA at week 4 were obtained between our three formulations, again demonstrating similar bioavailability. This is important as it shows an integrated picture of DHA+ EPA utilization in the body and RBC levels are a proxy for long-term bioavailability. The DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA percent of total RBC fatty acids, the omega-3 index, is an important cardiac risk factor and our study demonstrates that all these products provide adequate DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA levels to achieve this benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The geometric mean ratio for DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA comparing fish oil-TG vs krill oil in RBCs at Week 4 were significant, indicating comparable bioavailability between these two products. For RBC DHA levels only, all three oil formulations were equally bioavailable. Since RBC fatty acid content is importantly related to tissue fatty acid status, these results suggest no differences in bioavailability in tissues among the fish oil formulations and krill oil in this 4&#x000a0;week study.</p><p>Examination of the individual fatty acids, DHA and EPA each showed comparable bioavailability in plasma levels at Week 4 among the fish oil and krill oil products. However, DHA concentrations at hours 336 and 672 were lower in the fish oil-EE group compared to fish oil-TG or krill oil groups, as seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. Other studies have indicated lower plasma levels of DHA and/or EPA with fish oil-EE administration versus re-esterified TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], suggesting lower bioavailability and reduced functional outcomes, e.g. triacylglycerol lowering with the EE form. However not all studies have shown this effect and the marketed product approved for hypertriglyceridemia, <italic>Lovaza&#x02122;</italic> is a fish oil-EE formulation that significantly reduces triacylglycerol.</p><p>Our study demonstrated comparable bioavailability among the 3 formulations, however variability and wider confidence intervals were observed, especially in the plasma levels. This variability likely impacted the bioequivalence assessments among the groups and may be due to inter-individual variability and the smaller sample size in this parallel study. A larger study or one with a cross-over design may further elucidate these findings.</p><p>Different results observed in other omega-3 studies using krill oil and fish oil may be due to non-equivalent doses or unmatched DHA and EPA concentrations, non-compliance, especially when large numbers of capsules were used, or confounders such as increased dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The compliance in our study was over 90&#x000a0;% (measured by plasma fatty acids levels and capsule counts) and dietary intake of omega-3s was low in this study sample. The formulations were well tolerated and no differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, of which there were very few, were noted. It is possible that the phospholipid content in krill oil may affect its bioavailability, however krill oil composition in various commercial products varies widely in phospholipid content from approximately 19&#x02013;81&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and this has not been systematically examined in longer-term dosing trials. The krill oil used in our study contained 43.7&#x000a0;% phospholipid (not a minor component) and demonstrated similar bioavailability to both TG and EE fish oil forms.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate similar plasma and RBC levels of EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA were achieved with fish oil and krill oil products when matched for dose and EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA content in this four week study, indicating comparable oral bioavailability irrespective of formulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Karin Yurko-Mauro, Jaroslav Kralovec, Eileen Bailey-Hall and Norman Salem, Jr are employees of DSM Nutritional Products.
