All teeth were stored in 0.9% saline and were immersed in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 8 h to remove surface-adhered organic material. The teeth were decoronated at the cementoenamel junction using water-cooled high-speed fissure bur (Prodottoda; Diamir Srl Loc., Resia, Italia).</p><p>The canal lengths were measured by placing a size 15 K-file (Kerr/Sybron, Romulus, MI, USA) into each root canal until the tip of the file was visible at the tip of the apical foramen. The working length was established 1 mm short of the apex. Root canals were instrumented at the working length with a size HyFlex CM #40, 0.04% files (Coltene/Whaledent, Switzerland) using a step-down technique. Then, root canals were prepared from crown to apex using sizes 1&#x02013;4 Gates Glidden Drills (Man&#x000fd;, Inc. Takanezawa-machi, Shioya-gun, Tochigi-ken, Japan). The roots were irrigated with 10 mL of 5.25% NaOCl and then dried with Paper Points (Meta Dental Co. Ltd., Korea). One hundred and twenty roots were randomly assigned to eight experimental groups of 15 teeth each (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and the remaining ten roots were used as positive and negative controls of five specimens each. The canal sealers were mixed and handled according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Root canals obturation was done using single cone obturation technique by checking for resistance to displacement or &#x0201c;tug back.&#x0201d;</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Grouping</title><p>

</p><p>The corresponding 0.04% Taper #40 gutta-percha cones were then inserted into the root canals of all the specimens of the groups with firm pressure. The excess gutta-percha extending from the coronal part of the canal was removed with a heated spoon excavator.</p><p>Radiographs were taken to confirm the quality of root canal. After filling and postpreparation were completed, the surfaces and coronal openings of all roots were coated with two layers of sticky wax (Cavex Set Up Regular Cavex Holland BV, RW Hearlem, The Netherlands), except for the apical 2 mm. Between phases of the experiment, the specimens were stored in 100% humidity.</p><p>The specimens used as positive and negative controls were instrumented, and the two positive control roots were filled with a loosely fitted gutta-percha cone without endodontic sealer and the two negative controls were not obturated. The apical foramen of the positive control was completely covered with two layers of sticky wax, except for the apical 2 mm, whereas that of the negative control was completely covered with two layers of sticky wax.</p><p>The postspaces were prepared immediately in Groups I, III, V, and VII with Peeso reamers from size 1 to 4 at 4000 rpm to a depth that left 5 mm of gutta-percha apically. In Groups II, IV, VI, and VIII, the samples were stored in 0.9% saline at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 week, and the postspaces were prepared with Peeso reamers from size 1 to 4 at 4000 rpm to a depth that left 5 mm of gutta-percha apically.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Dye penetration</title><p>The roots were then placed in 2% methylene blue dye and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min (REMI R-8C) all at room temperature.

The restoration of endodontically treated teeth often requires intracanal postretention.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To create space for post, some filling material is removed from the canal, and during the preparation of this space, the root filling material may be dislodged by creating voids in the obturation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Several studies have shown that the integrity of the remaining obturation after removal of root canal filling materials may depend on a number of factors, and some of these factors are techniques and instruments used for removal,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the length of the remaining materials,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] endodontic obturation techniques,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] cements used, time of their setting, and time of removal of root filling[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which determines the durability of final restoration. Removal of the obturating material from the root canals for postspace can be done by thermal, chemical, or mechanical methods.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Several studies[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have reported that no statistical difference in apical leakage could be observed before or after postpreparation with various techniques. Furthermore, Hiltner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported no significant difference in leakage when comparing gutta-percha removal using flame-heated endodontic plugger, Peeso reamer, GPX burs, and Touch&#x02019;n Heat electrically heated spreader.</p><p>The integrity of apical seal is proportional to the amount of remaining filling material. It has been reported in studies that 4&#x02013;5 mm of apical gutta-percha should be retained apically which may provide adequate apical seal.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>It is generally agreed that lateral condensation of gutta-percha cones with a sealer in the root canal is one of the most reliable methods for filling the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, this technique produces many irregularities in the final mass of gutta-percha. There is also inadequate dispersion of sealer, leaving voids in and around the gutta-percha cones.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Thus, a number of different obturating techniques have been introduced with the aim of securing better adaptation of the canal.</p><p>Gutta-percha has no adhesive qualities or adaptability to dentin of the root canal wall, so it must be used in combination with sealer. If leakage occurs, it can take place at either the gutta-percha/sealer interface or the sealer/dentin wall interface.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Grossman[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied the physical properties of sealers (e.g., flow, setting time, and shrinkage.) and postulated that sealing ability may be related to those physical properties, and that manipulation of the material during or after filling could affect the ability to produce a good seal. The ability of a sealer to bond to the tooth structure is of considerable importance.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Adhesion to dentin and the lack of tensile strength of some of the sealers probably create gaps and voids caused by crumbling of the set material.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Torabinejad <italic>et al</italic>. have stated that if a root filling material does not allow penetration of small particles such as dye molecules, it is more likely to have the potential to prevent microleakage of bacteria and their by-products.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] As methylene blue has a low molecular weight and penetrates more deeply along the root canal filling, this was used as a leakage marker for the current study.</p><p>It is well known that root filling materials penetrate better into dentinal tubules in the absence of the smear layer.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In the present investigation, 17% EDTA and 5.25% NaOCl were used as materials to remove the smear layer.</p><p>Sadr S <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested that apical leakage was enhanced by pressure than capillary action of passive dye penetration.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, the use of a centrifuge eliminates some of the effects of any air that may have been entrapped in voids within the root canal filling.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>This <italic>in vitro</italic> study was carried out to compare the sealing ability of zinc oxide-eugenol-based Endoflas FS, resin-based AH Plus, silicone-based GuttaFlow, and MTA Fillapex root canal sealer using dye penetration in relation to the preparation of immediate and delayed postspace.</p><p>The negative control group showed no leakage at all, indicating the two coats of sticky wax were efficient enough in preventing dye penetration. The positive control showed maximum dye penetration, thereby confirming the efficacy of methylene blue dye penetration in leakage studies.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Immediate postspace preparations showed least apical leakage as compared to delayed preparations with Group III (AH Plus sealer) showing the lowest mean apical leakage value followed by Group V (GuttaFlow sealer). Whereas highest mean apical leakage value was observed in Group II (Zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealer - delayed preparation) followed by Group VIII (MTA Sealer).</p><p>ZOE provides an excellent seal when it sets, according to Karapanou V <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] but it has low resistance to fracture and a significant decrease in their physical properties when contaminated with moisture because of their high solubility,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which is the probable reason for the increased leakage.</p><p>Delayed postspace preparation done using AH Plus sealer showed dye penetration which was significantly more than immediate postspace preparation; this was in accordance with the results of Goodacre CJ <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A study by &#x000d8;rstavik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] concluded that all epoxy-based materials show some expansion after setting. AH Plus expanded up to 0.4% after 4 weeks and depicted a slight but continuous expansion up to 1.2% during the next 4-week period. These dimensional changes of the material upon setting could be the possible reason for minimal apical leakage.</p><p>GuttaFlow, the new silicon-based sealer, presents promising physical, chemical, and biological properties. Although there are doubts regarding the filling capability of this filling material, which seems to be deficient because of the voids present in the filling mass,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] its adequate marginal sealing capacity can be explained by the expansion property (0.16% at 25&#x000b0;C and 0.76% at 37&#x000b0;C) of this polydimethylsiloxane-based sealer during polymerization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Borges <italic>et al</italic>. evidenced that the solubility of MTA Fillapex was statistically higher than that of AH Plus even though both materials fulfill the ANSI/ADA,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] according to which a root canal sealer should not present solubility higher than 3%.</p><p>When the postspace is prepared at the time of obturation, the sealer does not form a lasting bond to the gutta-percha or root canal wall. When the heated instrument or rotary instrument is introduced into the canal to remove the gutta-percha, the sealer is still within its working time and allows the sealer to set without introducing microfractures where the sealer is in contact with the gutta-percha and root canal wall. When the sealer is set during delayed postspace preparation, it is possible that the rotational forces of the Gates Glidden Drill cause movement of the gutta-percha and thus break the bond at the sealer interface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>
