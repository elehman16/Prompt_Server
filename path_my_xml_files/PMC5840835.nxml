This study sought to determine feasibility and acceptability of integrating MT into school-based health education (primary outcomes) and to explore its possible effects on healthy behaviors (exploratory outcomes). Two high schools in Massachusetts (2014&#x02013;2015) were randomized to health education plus MT (HE-MT) (one session/week for 8&#x0202f;weeks) or to health education plus attention control (HE-AC). Dietary habits (24-h dietary recalls) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA/7-day recalls) were assessed at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and 6&#x0202f;months thereafter. Quantile regression and linear mixed models were used, respectively, to estimate effects on MVPA and dietary outcomes adjusting for confounders. We recruited 53 9th graders (30 HEM, 23 HEAC; average age 14.5, 60% white, 59% female). Retention was 100% (EOT) and 96% (6&#x0202f;months); attendance was 96% (both conditions), with moderate-to-high satisfaction ratings. Among students with higher MVPA at baseline, MVPA was higher in HE-MT vs. HE-AC at both EOT (median difference&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;81&#x0202f;min/week, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.005) and at 6&#x0202f;months (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.004). Among males, median MVPA was higher (median difference&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;99&#x0202f;min/week) in HE-MT vs. HEAC at both EOT (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.056) and at 6&#x0202f;months (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.04). No differences were noted in dietary habits. In sum, integrating school-based MT into health education was feasible and acceptable and had promising effects on MVPA among male and more active adolescents. These findings suggest that MT may improve healthy behaviors in adolescents and deserve to be reproduced in larger, rigorous studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Integrating mindfulness training into high school health education is feasible.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">The program is scalable because health education is commonly taught in US schools.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Larger studies are needed to establish its efficacy on health behaviors.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>School-based interventions</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0020">Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are modifiable risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease, the principal cause of death in the United States and worldwide (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Benjamin et al., 2017</xref>).

One significant outlier with respect to baseline MVPA was removed from subsequent analyses.

This approach was feasible and acceptable to a large majority of students. MT also improved MVPA at EOT especially among male and more active adolescents, which was maintained at 6&#x0202f;months of follow-up, while no significant differences were observed in dietary behaviors.</p><p id="p0130">Findings on MVPA are promising and even more relevant if we consider that all students (and not only physically inactive ones) were included in the study, likely producing a ceiling effect. It is noteworthy that effects were more pronounced among more active adolescents and among males. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that PA improves proprioception, which is also one of the focuses of MT (i.e., via practices directing attention to body sensations and to the entire body). More active adolescents may be more aware of their bodies and somewhat &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; to mindfulness practice.</p><p id="p0135">The lack of effect on dietary habits could be explained by a number of factors. First, due to budgetary constraints, we were able to conduct only one 24-h dietary recall (vs. the recommended three) at each time-point, which likely did not adequately capture dietary habits. In addition, the study was conducted in winter when fruits and vegetables prices are higher, a fact that might have limited the availability of fruits and vegetables among our low-income students.</p><p id="p0140">Notable strengths of this study include its ethnically diverse population, the use of an attention control condition, and the integration of MT into school health education classes with the advantage of not imposing transportation burdens on students and their families to receive MT outside of regular school hours. We also acknowledge a number of limitations of this study, including its small sample size, the involvement of only two schools, and the use of self-reported assessments of MVPA.</p><p id="p0145">Findings from this study need to be reproduced in larger studies involving schools from different geographic areas. Such studies should also use objective assessments of physical activity (e.g., accelerometry) and employ alternative strategies (e.g., on-line dietary recalls, which can be easily administered via computer interface) to improve the collection of dietary information.</p><p id="p0150">In conclusion, integrating MT into existing health education classes was feasible and acceptable and showed promising effects on exercise behaviors. Because health education is taught in &#x0003e;60% of high schools in the US, (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brener et al., 2011</xref>) this approach &#x02013; if proven effective &#x02013; could be easily disseminated across schools. The availability of qualified MT instructors is increasing nationwide (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mindfulschools.org/resources/directory" id="ir0015">http://www.mindfulschools.org/resources/directory/</ext-link>) and thus access to MT will likely become easier and cheaper in the future. Alternatively, if this approach is proven effective, health education teachers could be trained to deliver MT to students.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0155">This project was funded by a grant (R21HL119665) from the <funding-source id="gts0005">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</funding-source> (NHLBI) to Drs.
