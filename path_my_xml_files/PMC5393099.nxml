However, following the introduction of less toxic agents with comparable efficacy, clinical application of this class of medication is limited, especially as monotherapy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The main concerns regarding the use of AG are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Acute tubular necrosis is the most common complication of these agents. AG-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in 10%&#x02013;20% of patients. The proximal tubule cells in renal cortex are more vulnerable to AKI. Following attachment to megalin, AG enters the cells by endocytosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is the final pathway of AG-induced tubular cells ischemia and necrosis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Several strategies including once-daily dosing regimen, correction of volume depletion, and electrolytes disturbances before administration of AG and antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, deferoxamine, methimazole, selenium, superoxide dismutase, lipoic acid, dimethyl-sulfoxide, N-acetylcysteine, and melatonin) have been examined for the prevention of AG nephrotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Statins may prevent drug-induced AKI. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties and improving endothelial function have been detected for statins.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] At least two experimental studies demonstrated that statins including atorvastatin and simvastatin prevented or reduced free radicals-induced proximal tubule cells damage caused by gentamicin.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Considering the limitations of serum creatinine (SCr) as a marker of kidney function in clinical practice and on the other hand, being cumbersome, costly, and not readily available direct measurement methods of Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), several new markers of renal function such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been studied. NGAL is among the most extensively evaluated novel AKI biomarkers in different clinical settings such as cardiopulmonary bypass, diabetic nephropathy, contrast-induced nephropathy, and cisplatin nephrotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In this randomized clinical trial, the effects of atorvastatin were compared with placebo on urine NGAL in patients received amikacin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was related to a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (ID Number: IRCT201301283449N11) that a part of its results has been published recently.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] During a 1-year period from June 2013 to July 2014, the study was performed on patients hospitalized in the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Imam Khomeini Hospital, a tertiary teaching hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The patients or their responsible first-degree family signed the study consent form and Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital approved the study. Adult patients (16&#x02013;65-year-old) with documented Gram-negative infection sensitive to amikacin were primarily screened for recruitment. All patients were received 15 mg/kg/day amikacin (DarouPakhsh Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company, Iran) in two equal divided doses every 12 h as intravenous infusion over 30 min.</p><p>Patients with at least one the following characteristics were excluded from this study: (1) documented kidney dysfunction (defined as estimates GFR &#x0003c;60 ml/min), (2) absolute or relative contraindications to statin use including liver dysfunction (defined as serum liver enzymes levels over five times of the upper limit of normal), documented history of atorvastatin hypersensitivity, and documented history of drug-induced myopathy or creatine phosphokinase (CPK) over five times of the upper limit of normal, and (3) concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic agents (e.g., vancomycin, amphotericin b, calcineurin inhibitors) or probable nephroprotective agents (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, N-acetylcysteine, and melatonin).</p><p>Sample size of the current study was calculated by considering &#x003b1; = 0.05, 80% power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2; = 0.8), and data of two relevant experimental studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Using simple randomization method, recruited patients were assigned to either atorvastatin or placebo groups. Patients in the atorvastatin group received 40 mg/day oral atorvastatin (Sobhan Darou, Iran) for 7 days. Individuals in the placebo group received placebo (Sobhan Darou, Iran) orally for 7 days. A 28-day follow-up period was considered for the included patients.</p><p>Required features of the study population (age, sex, concomitant diseases, drug history and cause of hospital admission, and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score II at time of ICU admission) were extracted from their medical records. The patients&#x02019; vital signs were monitored daily. In addition, relevant laboratory data including renal and liver function tests, CPK, electrolytes, and cell blood count were registered from the patients&#x02019; ICU daily charts.</p><p>For measuring urinary NGAL, 10 ml of venous blood and urine samples were collected from each patient at baseline, days 1 and 7 of the treatment course. Urine samples were collected at morning from the patients&#x02019; urine bags containing 12-h urine. Urine and blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the time of analysis. Urinary NGAL level was measured using commercially available ELISA kit (Donghu Hi-Tech Development, P.R China). Measurement of serum as well as urine creatinine was performed by an auto-analyzer (Biotechnica BT-3000, Italy) using modified Jaffe colorimetric reaction.</p><p>AG-induced AKI was defined as a doubling of SCr from the baseline value.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Chi-square or Fisher's exact test (if more than 25% of the categories have expected frequencies &#x0003c;5) was used for comparing categorical variables between the groups. The mean changes in the patients&#x02019; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), SCr, and urine NGAL at baseline, days 1 and 7 of amikacin treatment were assessed by the repeated measure analysis. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant for all the above analytical tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Initially, 67 patients were screened. Fifty-five patients met inclusion criteria of the study.

However, nephrotoxicity is the major limiting factor for their clinical use.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Following hospital admission, AKI was detected in 2%&#x02013;5% of patients in non-ICU wards. Prerenal azotemia due to dehydration, surgeries and drugs are the most common causes of AKI in these patients. Critically ill patients are more vulnerable to AKI due to older age, severity of baseline diseases, hemodynamic instability, infections, receiving multiple nephrotoxic agents, and mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The incidence of AG nephrotoxicity in our study was 8%. Possible disparity in this rate in our survey with that reported from literature (10%&#x02013;20%) may be due to variation in the definition of AKI, presence of associated risk factors (e.g., underlying renal dysfunction, concomitant nephrotoxic agents), and the type of studied AG (amikacin versus gentamicin).</p><p>Amikacin accumulates in the epithelial cells of renal cortex, especially in the proximal tubule cells. Amikacin enters the cells by endocytosis through known cations transporters; megalin and cubilin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Intracellular isoprenoid pyrophosphates regulate function of these transporters. Isoprenoid pyrophosphates are metabolites of mevalonate. As it is known, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is the main enzyme involved in the synthesis of mevalonate. Multiligand receptor megalin is a GTP-binding protein that mediates endocytosis of AG. By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity and consequently, decrease in the intracellular isoprenoid pyrophosphates, atorvastatin may limit renal cells accumulation of AG and following their cytotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>For the first time in 2009, Ozbek <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the administration of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) along with gentamicin (100 mg/kg/day) prevented increases in BUN and SCr, reduction in calculated creatinine clearance and renal tissue glutathione levels and elevation of kidney malondialdehyde and NO levels in rats. The authors attributed the nephroprotective effects of atorvastatin against gentamicin nephrotoxicity to the inhibition of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well as nuclear factor kappa-&#x003b2; (NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2;) signaling pathways and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study published 1 year later, nontoxic doses of simvastatin (IC50 1.3 microM), rosuvastatin (IC50 16.3 microM), and pravastatin (IC50 38.8 microM) attenuated gentamicin accumulation and cytotoxicity to renal proximal tubule cells through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Finally, Jabbari <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that prophylactic administration of simvastatin (from 2 to 10 mg/kg/day) led to improvement in the histopathology and renal function tests in a dose-dependent manner in rats received low-dose (50 mg/kg/day) and high-dose (80 mg/kg/day) gentamicin probably through its antioxidant effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Pharmacokinetic parameters of statins may influence their nephroprotective effects. Lipophilic statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin are predominantly excreted by liver and do not produce suitable concentrations in the kidney cells. Hydrophilic statins including rosuvastatin and pravastatin may be better options for this goal.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the nephroprotective effects of statins against drug-induced AKI. Inhibition of drug accumulation in the proximal tubular cells, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, upregulation of endothelial NOS, activation of the antioxidant defense enzymes, inhibition of MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; signaling pathways, reducing ischemia and angiotensin II-induced AKI, downregulation of angiotensin receptors, and decrease in endothelin synthesis are the main proposed pathways.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, no significant difference was detected regarding urinary NGAL/urine Cr ratio between the atorvastatin and placebo groups. Similarly, the mean changes in urine NGAL/urine Cr ratio did not differ significantly in patients with and without AG nephrotoxicity. To eliminate effects of patients&#x02019; hydration status, measured urine NGAL concentration was adjusted by urine creatinine level. Urinary NGAL as a biomarker of acute renal damage was used for detecting AKI. Urine NGAL increases rapidly due to an upregulated expression and secretion in different sites of the tubule about 6 h after a renal injury.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In accordance to our findings, Shinke <italic>et al</italic>. implicated that urine NGAL to urine creatinine ratio was comparable between patients with and without AKI.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Similarly, the changing pattern of urine NGAL during amphotericin b treatment demonstrated a nonsignificant increase in both patients with and without amphotericin b nephrotoxicity (unpublished data). These results were in contrast to findings of at least three other similar clinical studies in the setting of cisplatin-induced AKI.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Shahbazi <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that urine NGAL to urine creatinine ratio increased significantly after cisplatin infusion.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] A preliminary clinical trial about the effect of ascorbic acid on colistin-associated nephrotoxicity, urinary excretion of NGAL during and at the end of colistin treatment was significantly higher than baseline values.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Similar findings were observed in the setting of contrast-induced nephropathy.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Finally, Najmeddin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that serum NGAL changes from the baseline were more in the high-dose extended-interval dosage regimen (20 mg/kg every 24 h) in comparison with the moderate-dose nonliberal-interval dosage regimen (12.5 mg/kg every 12 h) at the third (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and fifth (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) day of amikacin treatment.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In most clinical studies discussed above, urine and serum NGAL has increased significantly during the treatment with investigated nephrotoxic agents. Negative results in the current study can be partially justified by the limited measurement frequencies of urine NGAL, inadequate follow-up period, and relatively small sample size of the study. In addition, since the upregulation of NGAL occurs mostly in the thick ascending limb of Henle and the collecting ducts, the real role of NGAL in detection of AKI in proximal tubule, as the most common site of the injury in AKI caused by most medications such as AG, has been questioned.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>The major novelty and strength of our study is determining the role of urine NGAL as a biomarker of renal function in patients receiving amikacin for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Small sample size and inadequate statistical power (due to implementing several inclusion/exclusion criteria and the preference of most intensivists to prescribe antibacterial agents rather than AG), measuring urine NGAL for only three times for each patient (due to financial problems), and considering certain SCr cut points rather than GFR calculated by a an exogenous agent or formula can be taken into account as the main drawbacks of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our current data suggested that the changing pattern of urine NGAL/urine Cr ratio did not differ significantly between the atorvastatin and placebo groups during the early phase of amikacin treatment. Similarly, the mean urine NGAL/urine Cr ratio did not differ significantly in patients with and without amikacin nephrotoxicity. Considering the limitations of this pilot study, performing an investigation with a larger sample size, more frequent and close urine sampling, longer follow-up duration, and exploiting an exogenous agent such as urinary inulin clearance or the plasma 99mTc-DTPA for calculating GFR is needed to determine the accuracy and clinical applicability of urine NGAL as a biomarker of renal function in patients receiving AG.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>BH contributed in conducting the study, acquisition of data, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
