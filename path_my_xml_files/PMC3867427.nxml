Several new anti-inflammatory treatments currently in development for these diseases such as phosphodiesterase(PDE)-4 and p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors, target neutrophilic inflammation, but their clinical development has been hampered by dose-limiting side effects after oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs is driven by the release of chemotactic factors secreted by structural cells within the lung, such as epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells, and by resident inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and recruited neutrophils. The major neutrophil chemoattractants are CXC chemokines, including CXCL1 (GRO-&#x003b1;), CXCL5 (ENA78) and CXCL8 (interleukin-8), all of which are increased in concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with COPD, severe asthma and CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These neutrophil chemokines activate a common chemokine receptor CXCR2, which is expressed on the surface of neutrophils. The tripeptide PGP, which is generated from extracellular matrix proteins through the action of matrix metalloproteinases, is also a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (matrikine) that activates CXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These chemokines also attract circulating monocytes, which differentiate within the lung to macrophages that are thought to drive neutrophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This suggests that blocking CXCR2 would be an attractive therapeutic approach to the treatment of neutrophilic inflammation, since small molecule inhibitors to these G-protein receptors have now been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several small molecule CXCR2 antagonists have now been developed for oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Oral administration of the CXCR2 antagonists navarixin (SCH527123) and SB-656933 have previously been shown to inhibit the increased neutrophils in induced sputum as a result of ozone challenge in normal volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ozone challenge is difficult as it involves prolonged administration of ozone in specially designed exposure chambers and the need for subjects to exercise. Inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is well established as an inducer of neutrophilic inflammation in normal volunteers and is easier to administer than ozone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether inhaled LPS challenge could be used to assess the anti-neutrophilic effect of a CXCR2 antagonist AZD8309 in normal volunteers.</p><p>Studies in animals have shown that neutrophilic inflammation induced by LPS is attenuated in CXCR2-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and small molecule CXCR2 antagonists inhibit pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation induced by inhaled LPS in several animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. AZD8309 is a potent small molecule reversible CXCR2 antagonist. Recently oral administration of ADZ8309 has been shown to inhibit neutrophilia induced by endotoxin instillation into the nose of normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study we investigated the effect of orally administered ADZ8309 on pulmonary inflammation induced by inhaled LPS in healthy subjects, by measuring inflammatory cells and mediators in induced sputum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way crossover design in which healthy adult subjects were recruited in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Neutrophil elastase (NE) activity was determined by an end-point read kinetic assay run in a 96-well plate format. Samples were incubated with N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, (Calbiochem, Nottingham UK), which is cleaved by NE yielding a fluorescent product, 7-amino-methyl-coumarin. Results were reported as fluorescence units and there was no lower limit of quantification applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the neutrophil count in sputum. This was analyzed using a multiplicative 2-period crossover ANOVA: the logarithm of the count was modelled additively with factors treatment, period and patient. The exponential log of the mean treatment difference and its confidence interval was used to compare the ratio of geometric means of the count, for AZD8309 to placebo. The treatment p-value was also computed non-parametrically using Wilcoxon test (the treatment difference was compared between the two randomization sequences). Other sputum variables (macrophage count, relative cell counts as well as immunological mediators) were analyzed in the same way.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject demographics</title><p>Twenty subjects were randomized to treatment at Visit 2 and 16 completed the study.

The main findings of this study are that following LPS challenge, AZD8309 markedly reduced total leukocyte numbers and neutrophil numbers in sputum and reduced sputum concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL8, LTB<sub>4</sub> and NE. Furthermore, there were no serious adverse events to an LPS challenge of 30 &#x003bc;g or dosing with study drug, indicating that this is a useful and convenient way to initially evaluate the effect of anti-neutrophilic drugs, such as CXCR2 antagonists. Short-term treatment with AZD8309 300&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. was well tolerated with no findings of clinical concern. A potentially interesting additional finding was the observation that AZD8309 administration significantly increased the recovery in FEV<sub>1</sub> after the small bronchoconstrictor effect of LPS challenge.</p><p>Our primary outcome variable of sputum neutrophils revealed approximately 80% reduction in subjects receiving AZD8309 compared to placebo. The increase in neutrophils in sputum obtained in the placebo group was as expected, based on dose&#x02013;response data previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with a similar increase in inflammatory mediators and markers of neutrophil activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The result of the primary variable, together with the fact that sputum biomarkers (CXCL1, CXCL8, NE and LTB<sub>4</sub>) that are markers of neutrophil activation, were observed to be lower in subjects receiving AZD8309, suggests that these effects are mediated through CXCR2. The effect on inflammatory mediators may not mediated directly through CXCR2 but reflect the reduction in numbers of activated neutrophils in the airway, since these cells release CXCL8, LTB<sub>4</sub> and NE. Overall, the results obtained in this study clearly show that AZD8309 has a positive effect in attenuating the inflammatory response induced by LPS inhalation, and the fact that all subjects achieved trough plasma concentrations of AZD8309 above the pharmacologically active 3 &#x000d7; IC<sub>50</sub> concentration required to antagonize the CXCR2 receptor for the duration of the study gives confidence that the effects seen were mediated via the expected pharmacological mechanism.</p><p>AZD8309 also antagonises the CCR2b receptor but it is 10-fold less potent than at CXCR2 so that even at maximal plasma concentrations achieved in our study there would be little if any antagonism of CCR2b. CCR2 are involved in the recruitment of monocytes form the blood so may be contributory to the increased numbers of macrophages in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The reduction in sputum macrophages is more likely explained by an inhibitory effect on CXCR2 which are expressed on circulating monocytes. Our findings are similar to the reported effects of two other CXCR2 antagonists on ozone challenge in normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A preliminary study with the CXCR2 antagonist, navarixin (MK7123, SCH 527123) in patients with COPD showed a reduction in sputum neutrophil counts (by approximately 50%) but no significant change in FEV<sub>1</sub> after three months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However in a further study with 6&#x000a0;months dosing, a significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> of up to 168&#x000a0;ml was demonstrated compared with placebo treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> was greatest in a sub-group of patients who continued to smoke and these patients also demonstrated an increased time to their first moderate/severe exacerbation. A reduction in sputum neutrophil counts was also shown in a different subset of these patients. The study also demonstrated a significant dose-related reduction in systemic neutrophil counts compared with placebo although no difference in infection rates were noted compared with the placebo group (see below). Further Nair <italic>et al.</italic> studied SCH527123 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In patients with severe asthma and after four weeks dosing found a 36% reduction in sputum neutrophil percentages; but no significant differences in FEV<sub>1</sub>, IL-8 release or neutrophil elastase release.</p><p>Treatment with AZD8309 also showed a reduction in circulating neutrophil numbers. This effect has also been observed in the Phase 1 studies with AZD8309 (unpublished observations) and with navarixin in normal subjects and in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the Phase 1 studies the effect on circulating neutrophils was transient and reversible on stopping dosing. Similarly, in this study circulating neutrophil numbers returned to pre-dosing levels as shown in the follow-up visits after stopping treatment with AZD8309. In the present study we were also able to investigate the effect of AZD8309 on blood neutrophil numbers after a pro-inflammatory insult using LPS challenge that leads to mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow and a transient increase in circulating neutrophil numbers. AZD8309 had no effect on the observed increase in blood neutrophils after LPS challenge suggesting that neutrophils can be mobilized from the bone marrow regardless of treatment with a CXCR2 antagonist, and demonstrating that this is not a compound that causes bone marrow toxicity and resulting neutropenia. These observations suggest that the apparent reduction in circulating neutrophils produced by CXCR2 antagonists is caused by margination of neutrophils in the pulmonary circulation which can be rapidly mobilised to the systemic circulation.</p><p>AZD8309 300&#x000a0;mg bid was well-tolerated and adverse events were similar between treatment and placebo groups. There were no findings of clinical concern, and no indications that AZD8309 adversely affected lung function. The transient increase in body temperature observed in both treatment limbs of the study during the first 8&#x000a0;hours following LPS challenge has previously been reported with previous LPS challenge studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>CXCR2 is expressed not only on circulating leukocytes but also on smooth muscle, submucosal glands and the central nervous system, so side effects might be expected after administration of a potent antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A role for CXCR2 in neutrophil migration <italic>in vivo</italic> has been demonstrated in several animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but less is known of the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of CXCR2 expression on structural cells or on other populations of inflammatory cells, such as dendritic cells, mast cells and T-lymphocytes, which also express CXCR2.</p><p>An interesting and unexpected finding of this study was the effect of AZD8309 on lung function following LPS challenge. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the LPS-induced initial fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> was similar for AZD8309 and placebo. However there appears to be a faster recovery after AZD8309 compared to placebo, which may reflect the effect of reducing neutrophil recruitment into the lungs and the reduced effects of mediators, such as reactive oxygen species and other bronchoconstrictor mediators, released from neutrophils on lung function.</p><p>This study details the use of a small number of healthy subjects in a short and simple challenge procedure which is reasonably reproducible. In order to validate our findings further it would be necessary to expand the trial to accommodate not only larger numbers patients COPD, severe asthma or CF. Furthermore, acute exacerbations of these pulmonary diseases are associated with increased neutrophilic inflammation in the airways so CXCR2 antagonists may be effective in preventing and treating exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, oral administration of an anti-inflammatory treatment has a significant advantage as it may improve access to peripheral airways compared to inhaled administration and this is particularly important in COPD and severe asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that a CXCR2 antagonist given by oral administration can significantly inhibit both the inflammatory cellular response (neutrophils) and selected mediators in sputum following LPS challenge.
