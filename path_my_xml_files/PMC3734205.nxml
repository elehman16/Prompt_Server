Its poor response is ascribed to destruction of the integrated neuromatrix in experience of pain. Deep brain stimulation is a promising technique to modulate activity of implicated structures. However, traditional approaches targeting sensori-motor substrates have failed to affect disability. The offending lesion in thalamic pain syndrome that almost invariably destroys sensory pain pathways may render these classical approaches ineffective. Instead, we hypothesize that targeting structures representing emotion and affective behavior-ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule, may alleviate disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We present the design of our phase I randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover trial that examines safety, feasibility and efficacy of our proposed approach. In our ongoing trial, we intend to enroll ten patients with thalamic pain syndrome. Following implantation, patients are randomized to receive active deep brain stimulation to the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule or sham for 3 months, after which they are crossed over. The primary endpoint is Pain Disability Index. Other outcomes include visual analog scale, depression and anxiety inventories, quality of life, and functional neuroimaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Designing trials of deep brain stimulation for pain is challenging owing to the ethical-scientific dilemma of introducing a control arm, complicated blinding, heterogeneous etiologies, patient expectations, and inadequate assessment of disability. The quality of evidence in the field is classified as level III (poor) because it mainly includes a multitude of uncontrolled case series reporting variable outcomes, with little regard for the placebo effect related to implantation. Without valid data on efficacy, use of deep brain stimulation for pain remains &#x0201c;off label&#x0201d;. We present our trial design to discuss feasibility of conducting sham-controlled phase I studies that may represent significant refinement for the field. Double-blinding would reduce influence of patient expectations and therapeutic confusion amongst investigators. With a cross-over approach, the dilemma regarding including a control group can be mitigated. Use of homogeneous etiology, measurement of disability, depression and quality of life, besides pain perception, all represent strategies to evaluate efficacy rigorously. Functional imaging would serve to define mechanisms underlying observed effects and may help optimize future targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01072656">NCT01072656</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd><kwd>Neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Thalamic pain syndrome</kwd><kwd>Deep brain stimulation (DBS)</kwd><kwd>Ventral striatum</kwd><kwd>Anterior limb of internal capsule</kwd><kwd>Post-stroke pain</kwd><kwd>Central pain</kwd><kwd>Brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Thalamic pain syndrome: refractoriness to traditional management</title><p>Chronic neuropathic pain, defined as &#x02018;pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], is one of the most prevalent disorders, affecting about 8% of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although it can be associated with peripheral or central pathology, pain of central origin, such as that following stroke, is more resistant to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In fact, pain associated with lesions of somatosensory thalamic nuclei or somatosensory thalamo-cortical projections, following subcortical stroke, is particularly intractable and extraordinarily frustrating for patients and physicians. Also referred to as thalamic pain syndrome (TPS) or Dejerine-Roussy syndrome, the disorder is characterized by unrelenting pain, associated paradoxically with numbness (anesthesia dolorosa) on the affected side. Its prevalence is estimated to be 8% across all stroke patients but can be as high as 18% in those with sensory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Poor responsiveness in TPS is attributed to disruption of the pain neuromatrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The neuromatrix is an integrated framework of somatosensory, limbic and cognitive networks in the brain interacting with thalamo-cortical pathways in the experience of pain. Since mechanisms of pain in TPS span across such widespread cerebral structures within the neuromatrix, a promising technique involves modulating activity of these structures with invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Almost four decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] DBS was introduced to target structures involved in pain transmission and opioid-mediated analgesia, such as the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter. Fifteen years later, results continued to be disappointing in TPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] even though response across other etiologies was staggering. Emphasis was then shifted to target the sensory thalamic nodes based on the premise that stimulating the thalamus would inhibit hyperactivity within pain-transmitting neuronal fibers associated with unrelenting pain in TPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. DBS of the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus, however, generated inconsistent benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More recently, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was introduced as a less invasive alternative, based on the hypothesis that motor cortical influence via cortico-thalamic pathways would reduce thalamic hyperactivity in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Tsubokawa <italic>et al</italic>. initially demonstrated positive results across several central pain syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but promise for patients with TPS was subsequently irreproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, it is critical to re-evaluate substrates that have been targeted with DBS, to understand and resolve reasons for their failure in TPS over the last 40 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Importance of identifying novel nodes for targeting with DBS in TPS</title><p>We suggest there may be several reasons for failure of traditional DBS that targets sensorimotor substrates in management of TPS. First, the offending lesion in TPS damages sensorimotor targets such as the ventral-posteromedial and ventral-posterolateral targets that are critical to conduct the effects of contemporary DBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Second, since pain experience and disability is an integrative phenomenon of nociception influenced by affect and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], substrates that are key for regulation of emotion and behavior, such as ventral striatum (VS) and anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), could be more effective in influencing the experience of disability. Patients with TPS experience severe allodynia and suffer from learned behaviors of anticipating pain, which exacerbates disability. DBS that modulates VS/ALIC may modify learned affective behavioral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] as in obsessive compulsive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and, thus, would potentially be more effective in mitigating pain-related disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges in designing a clinical trial of DBS in treatment of TPS</title><p>Our group has recently suggested departing from the traditional approach of targeting DBS to sensorimotor substrates and instead provided rationale for a novel DBS target involving VS/ALIC in the management of chronic neuropathic pain in TPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Examining efficacy of a novel node of DBS in a population with refractory chronic neuropathic pain, however, is challenging because the paradox of experience-subjectivity of pain affects assessment of outcomes, while patient expectations from the investigational procedures as well as surgical and neuro-stimulation interventions may generate several confounds. The quality of contemporary evidence regarding effectiveness of DBS in pain is currently classified as level III because studies thus far, have enrolled heterogenous etiologies, incorporated inadequate experimental blinding and controlled poorly for confounds of placebo. In addition, little regard has been given to the risk for therapeutic confusion in the investigative team about benefits of treatment, or to key outcome measures that evaluate the experience/disability of pain or its effect on quality of life, rather than severity on a numerical scale of pain perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives and hypothesis</title><p>Here, we present the protocol design of our current pilot clinical trial where we examine: 1) safety and feasibility of delivering DBS to VS/ALIC in a double blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial in patients with TPS; 2) efficacy of the intervention with respect to pain-related disability, quality of life, neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes and individual ratings of perception of pain; and 3) reorganization within affective networks of the pain neuromatrix with DBS delivered to VS/ALIC, which will be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magneto-encephalography (MEG).</p><p>We hypothesize that DBS targeting VS/ALIC will modulate the affective component of TPS and consequently, improve pain-related disability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A pilot, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, two-group crossover clinical trial design is being employed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of DBS targeting VS/ALIC in TPS.

DBS lead implantation is completed in the same fashion as previously described by our group, but for the VS/ALIC target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The VS/ALIC is targeted approximately at its junction with the anterior commissure and the electrodes are advanced further ventrally along the trajectory towards the VS. Once inserted, intraoperative testing with macrostimulation through the DBS lead is performed. Based on prior experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we have noted that the most ventral electrode contacts elicit acute changes in mood or anxiety. At this stage, it is unknown if stimulation also produces changes in pain perception. If no effects are seen, the implanting team may consider revising the location of the lead(s). Once a location is identified, DBS leads are anchored to the skull and surgical sites are closed. The implantable pulse generator (IPG) is positioned in the infraclavicular area and connected to DBS leads under general anesthesia. Since the surgical intervention and general anesthesia may be a risk for cognitive decline, we serially assess cognitive function to note whether any patients experience negative effects on cognition related to our interventions (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phase IV: DBS programming and titration</title><p>DBS programming is initiated at least a month after DBS surgery to allow for resolution of microlesional effects. In acute programming, patients are asked to report changes in mood, anxiety, pain or suffering with activation of one or more electrode contacts.

Maintaining a blinded study is important because of the subjective nature of reports of pain and disability. Loss of blinding may occur due to the magnitude of the therapeutic effect or any other subjective perception that indicates that active DBS or sham is delivered. Safeguards have been incorporated to prevent loss of experimental blinding; for instance, stimulation is turned to 0 V after the programming and titration in phase IV to minimize the chance of memory of stimulation affecting the patient&#x02019;s perception of receiving active DBS or sham in blinded phase V. In addition, patients and blinded investigators are asked separately via questionnaire, what they believe is the status of the stimulation (active or sham). At the end of the study, we will evaluate how effective the blinding strategy was in order to guide us forward.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes of efficacy</title><p>Outcomes of pain, pain-related suffering and disability, depression and anxiety, functional status, motor abilities, and suicidal ideation are collected at several time points (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><sec><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>Instead of using the historically accepted criterion of 50% analgesia (using the VAS), we instead chose a 40% effect on the PDI as our primary endpoint.

Our group has demonstrated that DBS delivered specifically to the VS/ALIC is associated with cortical-subcortical fMRI activation that represents affective networks in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. MEG use with implanted DBS has also been shown to be safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We chose to utilize both fMRI and MEG to reveal substrates of affective dimension of pain because their unique strengths are complementary. Whereas fMRI is associated with superior spatial resolution, MEG possesses very high temporal resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Both MEG and fMRI are exploratory in this study. With fMRI, one of our goals is to evaluate resting state fMRI, comparing networks when DBS is turned on versus when it is turned off. Patients will undergo resting-state fMRI at pre-operative baseline, during the randomized blinded phase and during follow up. Thus, by comparing the DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, we will be able to assess the effects of active versus sham DBS without confounds related to placebo or study-related effects. The next goal is to correlate changes in the neural networks related to the placebo effect; we intend to do so by comparing effects of DBS-off stimulation between active, sham and pre-operative baseline phases. With MEG, we aim to harness its high temporal resolution to assess possible effects of DBS on pain anticipation. The primary hypothesis is that DBS will have a significant effect upon the affective sphere of chronic pain. Pain anticipation is one of the conditions leading to pain habituation and chronic pain. Thus, we theorize that improvements in the affective sphere will also be correlated to how cortical networks in patients with TPS modulate in pain anticipation. In order to test this concept, we have created a visual paradigm of pain anticipation that consists of a simple, three-second countdown. The type of visual paradigm encodes whether or not a painful stimulus would follow the countdown. One of the limitations related to this paradigm is that we do not have a full characterization of how healthy individuals respond to pain anticipation in this task. This can limit our understanding of how processing of pain anticipation is abnormal in individuals with TPS, and could as well limit the interpretation of effects of active DBS. In order to address these limitations, we are also evaluating a cohort of 10 healthy subjects to allow comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical and data analysis plan</title><sec><title>Safety and feasibility</title><p>The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of delivering DBS to the VS/ALIC in patients with TPS in a double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established as an advisory group to evaluate adverse events and judge overall integrity and conduct of the study. DSMB review at the outset, half-way through the enrollment process and at the end, will record numbers of participants enrolled, participants lost to follow up, deviations from protocol, threats to blinding and adverse events, following which, decisions about continuation or recommendations for changing or ending the study could be made.</p><p>If DBS is acutely and significantly effective in patients who are randomized to receive DBS of the VS/ALIC first, then there is a chance that patients may notice substantial worsening of the pain (assuming that the intervention is effective) and the validity of the experimental blinding may be compromised. In this case, to investigate the effect on blinding, we will record the patient&#x02019;s and the blinded investigator&#x02019;s subjective perception (to the best of their ability to guess) of whether active DBS or sham was being delivered during the blinded phase. If the relapse in pain is considered to be threatening or if there is suicidal ideation, then stimulation will be re-initiated and/or patient will be allowed to escape randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, if patients receive sham stimulation first, a relapse in pain will be managed with medical management at that time, because we do not anticipate much change in their baseline pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size estimation and efficacy</title><p>Since the study is designed as a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study, we will also be able to evaluate whether any potential trend indicates efficacy, which would help compute effect sizes and variance in DBS versus sham phases to estimate sample sizes for adequate power in future. Our within-subject, crossover design would also yield the magnitude of placebo effect related to the surgical process itself that is an important practical issue to consider in effect-size estimates for the future.</p><p>This study was initially planned to involve a total of 34 patients. The sample size was estimated based on changes in PDI in patients with central pain syndrome in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It was determined that to detect an effect size of 0.5 (equivalent to a 7-point decrease in PDI), a total of 34 patients would need to have been included for statistical power of 80% on a two-sided test with a type I error probability of 0.05. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has, however, determined in its review that the study should initially enroll 10 patients as part of a phase I, safety study.</p><p>Due to the small sample size of the proposed pilot phase I trial, procedures for corrections for multiple comparisons cannot be instated; the scope of the subsequent phase II trial would be better suited to include such procedures. By examining only a priori hypotheses, we aim to mitigate the probability of making type I errors. Therefore, we will compare the differences in the primary and secondary outcomes in the third month of DBS with those in the third month of sham stimulation using the paired <italic>t</italic>-test at &#x003b1; = 0.05. Despite the sample size limitation, we expect the study to be informative in estimating the magnitude of the placebo effect after DBS for pain, as well as variances in outcome that to date are unknown. These will be valuable in designing subsequent phase II and III studies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>Our protocol aims to test the safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a novel, neuromodulation therapy for intractable TPS. Our approach is based on the premise that failure of traditional cerebral neuromodulation in TPS with DBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] emerges from over-reliance on modifying the percept of pain by stimulating sensory-discriminative substrates that may be unviable owing to the offending lesions. Further, since the affective component of pain experience is equally, if not more important than the perceived intensity of pain, targeting regions such as VS/ALIC may successfully modify pain experience without necessarily modifying perception of pain intensity. The level of evidence, however, supporting efficacy for DBS in chronic neuropathic pain is mainly considered class III (descriptive case series, unblinded designs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], attributed to poor control of confounders of therapeutic benefit of neuromodulation. While addressing our research question, we have built study design refinements to potentially inform current and future clinical DBS trials in the field.</p><p>The ethical-scientific dilemma of introducing a control arm is particularly intense in neurosurgery, given the risk of interventions to the brain. However, since DBS allows for all patients to be implanted at first and then be randomized to active stimulation or sham, studies have explored randomized controlled designs in the use of DBS, particularly in movement disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, to balance ethical issues (potentially effective treatment compared against control or less effective treatment) with the importance of generating rigorous empirical evidence, we have incorporated a randomized, controlled, crossover design, where both active DBS and sham groups switch to the other intervention after 3 months from their initial randomization. That therapeutic benefits may carry over from the DBS into the sham phase cannot be completely discounted. By evaluating outcomes between active DBS and sham in the third month of corresponding treatments, we expect to minimize the influence of carry over; by noting difference in outcomes between the third month of the initial treatment and the first month of the intervention after crossover, we may also be able to define an adequate time lapse for future crossover studies.</p><p>Despite the inclusion of a placebo-controlled phase, altogether, patient expectations from undergoing a clinical-like investigational DBS procedure, therapeutic confusion within the investigative team, and unintentional cues during programming, can introduce several unwanted influences in clinical trial design. By introducing blinding for patients and employing a team where the investigator collecting outcome data is blinded and the surgeon and programming physicians are unaware of outcomes during the blinded phase, we aim to minimize unintentional cues and ensure investigator equipoise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We are also minimizing unintentional cues by allowing adequate time (approximately 1 month) to elapse between programming for DBS and randomization to the intervention group, so that memory of the experience of stimulation is reduced. Nevertheless, a caveat exists. The therapeutic effects may influence patients&#x02019; perceptions, and thus, the integrity of experimental blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. For instance, early effects on mood and anxiety may inflate perceived benefits. To study this possibility, we will document the frequency with which patients can guess the allocated treatment and we will relate the Beck depression and anxiety inventories with PDI to note whether the placebo of DBS confounds therapeutic differences from the sham. We acknowledge, however, that small sample size may limit our ability to draw concrete inferences.</p><p>Finally, to allow systematic study of efficacy, adequate controls in enrollment and analysis would be critical. We are maintaining diagnostic consistency by restricting inclusion only to TPS etiology. Although such a step limits the sample size, it addresses the criticism of previous DBS studies where heterogeneity of etiologies and targets affected concrete conclusions about therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. With regards to analysis, instead of using the typical 50% response on the VAS as the success criterion, we base our choice of outcomes upon the intended therapeutic benefit. Because the affective experience of pain, rather than pain intensity itself, may be influenced with DBS of VS/ALIC, the Pain Disability Index has been chosen instead, and a success criterion with this measure has been defined at 40%. Since we anticipate a relation between affective and cognitive benefits and alleviation of pain disability, detailed neuropsychological pain, and cognitive and psychiatric assessments are explored to study interactions between pain, mood, anxiety, and depression, as well as personality and memory/experience, and the overall effect on quality of life. Long-term follow-up time points have been built into the design to allow calculation of long-term efficacy or stimulation tolerance. Last, our pilot study also represents the first attempt at investigating the proof-of-mechanism of a novel target of neuromodulation in TPS so that the influence of such targeting on pain networks can be described.</p><p>The benefits of DBS in chronic neuropathic pain, especially in TPS, are still less than adequate, to justify approval for widespread clinically labeled use. We propose that identifying better clinical alternatives in DBS may potentially improve efficacy of the approach. More importantly, however, it is incumbent on the field to incorporate well-controlled, blinded trial designs to explore the benefits of current as well as novel DBS targets. Based on recent recommendations, our trial involving DBS of the VS/ALIC may serve as an example of feasibly creating protocols that improve the quality of the evidence base.</p><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing and is actively enrolling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALIC: anterior limb of internal capsule; BDI: Beck Depression Inventory; C-SSRS: Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale; DBS: deep brain stimulation; DSMB: Data Safety and Monitoring Board; EuroQOL(EQ-5D): Euro Quality of Life scale; fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging; IPG: implantable pulse generator; MADRS: Montgomery-Asburg Depression Rating Scale; MCS: motor cortex stimulation; MEG: Magneto-encephalography; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NEO_FFI: NEO Five Factor Inventory; PANAS: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PDI: Pain Disability Index; TPS: thalamic pain syndrome; VAS: visual analog scale; VS: ventral striatum.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>AM has the following conflicts of interest to disclose, none of which are directly pertinent to this research: Intellect Medical (advisory board, consultant, share holder), ATI and Cardionomics (shareholder), and Monteris (consultant).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors made significant intellectual contributions.
