Currently, Indians experience CVD deaths at least a decade earlier than their counterparts in countries with well-established market economies.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Out of so many risk factors for essential hypertension, stress is one of modifiable risk factors as recently reviewed by WHO scientific group. Chronic psychological stress and negative affective states contribute significantly to the pathogenesis and progression of hypertension.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Since stress is nowhere defined, the hypothesis is untestable. However, it is an accepted fact that psychosocial factors operate through mental processes, consciously or unconsciously, to produce hypertension. Virtually all studies on blood pressure (BP) and catecholamine levels revealed significantly higher noradrenaline levels in hypertensives than normotensives. This supports the contention that over activity of sympathetic nervous system has an important part to play in the pathogenesis of hypertension.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Psychosocial stress has also been shown to induce endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Scientists have tried to study the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by stress in experimental models and laboratory induced stress in volunteers.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These studies have demonstrated increased heart rate (HR) and BP and thus an increase in oxygen demand.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>These hypertensive patients also display acute peaks in BP as per circadian rhythm. These peaks are associated with work stress and psychobehavioral responses to stress such as anger, anxiety, tension and nervousness.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Numerous approaches are available for stress management that can decrease these patient's suffering and enhance their quality of life.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Relaxation methodologies in the form of yoga (asanas, pranayama, transcendental meditation and progressive muscular relaxation) has become more popular recently, though these techniques have been practiced in the past. Yoga is an ancient system of relaxation, exercise and healing with origins in India. Pranayama, the formal practice of controlling the breath, lies at the heart of yoga. The Sanskrit word pranayama consists of two parts: Prana and ayama. Ayama means &#x0201c;stretch&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;extend&#x0201d; and describes the action of pranayama.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Pranayama breathing has shown to alter autonomic activity as it increases parasympathetic activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] If hypertensive patients could adopt a simple relaxation technique that would reduce stress and its physiological effects, they may be able to control their BP better, decrease the requirements for antihypertensive drugs and respond better during such physiologically stressful events. Studies have shown a decrease in BP with pranayama.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, in hypertensive patients, myocardial oxygen demand (MVO<sub>2</sub>) can be a better marker of predicting CVD. Rate pressure product (RPP) is an index of MVO<sub>2</sub>. RPP is calculated as product of systolic BP and HR.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The studies have shown different effects of relaxation therapies on BP in different populations.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of pranayama on RPP in mild hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was carried out on both males and females of age group 20-50 years having mild hypertension. Patient diagnosed with mild hypertension (stage I) according to criteria developed by European Society of hypertension were enrolled.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Patients with secondary hypertension or with previous experience of yoga or history of major cardiac/renal/pulmonary disease or history of any surgery in the recent past or history of major medical illness in the past such as tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma were excluded. Subjects were divided in two groups. Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 25) was a control group and received antihypertensive drugs for 6 weeks. Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 25) was study group which received pranayama along with antihypertensive drugs for 6 weeks. The study was approved by Institute Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Training schedule of pranayama</title><p>The philosophy of Yoga is sometimes pictured as a tree with eight branches: Pranayama (breathing exercises), Asana (physical postures), Yama (moral behavior), Niyama (healthy habits), Dharana (concentration), Prathyahara (sense withdrawal), Dhyana (contemplation) and Samadhi (higher concoiusness).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Pranayama is a method of relaxation, which involves minimal training, can be learnt quickly and more importantly can be applied immediately to everyday situations. There are hundred different styles of pranayama from beginners to advanced. The following pranayama are easy and safe. The techniques of the following pranayama were taught to the patients of Group B and practiced regularly for 6 weeks. All of them were given written instructions.</p><p>Pranayamas taught were:</p><p>

Further, the growth of psychoneuroimmunology has strengthened the scientific foundations of mind-body technique. As tools for influencing the mind positively have assumed extensive application in a wide variety of illness, it is important to examine their efficacy.</p><p>In the present study, we measured effect of pranayama on RPP in mild hypertensives. RPP is a reliable index of myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac work and it correlates well with the oxygen consumption of normal subjects as well as patients with angina pectoris.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, demographic were comparable in both groups and cardiac parameters measured (BP, HR, RPP) were also similar in both groups at baseline. The proportion of male patients was more in both groups. This is expected as hypertension affects male gender more in the age groups we compared.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Most of the patients were in the age group of 35-50 years and this is in accordance with changing trends where hypertension is affecting more younger people especially due to life-style pressures and high demanding professions. Earlier studies also reported more incidence of hypertension in younger individuals.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>BP decreased in both groups when compared to baseline levels, however the decrease was significant in the Group B where pranayama was added to regular antihypertensive therapy. The decrease was more in Group B as compared to Group A given only antihypertensive drugs. This indicates that pranayama has led to more decrease in BP. One of the earlier study reported that treatment by anti-hypertensive drugs produce the greatest lowering of BP.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Treatment by weight reduction, yoga and muscle relaxation each produced smaller, but appreciable, changes in BP and salt reductions were inferior to those of other regimens and were not significantly different to the effect of placebo treatment.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Similarly HR decreased significantly in both groups, however this decrease was comparable in both groups indicating that antihypertensive drugs alone and along with pranayama decreased HR to a similar extent. Earlier studies have shown that pranayama can lead to decrease in BP and HR.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The isolated changes in BP and HR sometimes may not convey the overall effect of pranayama on the disease process. Hence, RPP which is a product of systolic BP and HR and is a better index of MVO<sub>2</sub> and is very useful parameter.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] RPP is especially important in patient care as this is an indirect indicator of myocardial oxygen consumption and load on the heart, thereby signifying a lowering of strain on the heart. The RPP also provides a simple measure of overall HR variability (HRV) in hypertensive patients and is a surrogate marker in situations where HRV analysis is not available.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Hence, the reduction in RPP in our study implies better autonomic regulation of the heart in hypertensive patients. A previous study from our laboratories reported that pranayama training of 3 months duration modulates ventricular performance by increasing parasympathetic activity and simultaneously decreasing sympathetic activity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] This may explain significant decreases in HR and BP observed in the present study with pronounced effects on the heart.</p><p>In the present study, RPP decreased significantly in both the groups indicating that antihypertensive drugs alone as well as along with pranayama decreased RPP. This is in accordance with the earlier study showing that antihypertensive drugs were effective in controlling the variables of hypertension.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The decrease in RPP in both groups, indicates the fact that antihypertensive drugs alone as well as along with pranayama decrease MVO<sub>2</sub>, which decreases the load on heart and hence cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The decrease in RPP was more in group which practiced pranayama for 6 weeks along with antiyhypertensive drugs. These finding indicate that pranayama adds on to antihypertensive action of drugs and more decrease in RPP than antihypertensive drugs alone.</p><p>The significant reduction in RPP indicates a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption and load on heart. This can be explained on the basis of decrease in sympathetic drive to the heart. A practitioner of pranayama not only tries to breath, but at the same time, also tries to keep his/her attention on the act of breathing, leading to concentration. These acts of concentration remove his attention from worldly worries and de-stress him/her. Stress free individual adapts better to the daily emotional, physical and mental stress. This stress free state of mind evokes relaxed responses. In this relaxed state, there is dominance of parasympathetic nerve activity. Our findings are in consistent with an earlier study which reported that yogic training produces a significant decrease in BP associated with improvement of baroreflex sensitivity and attenuation of sympathetic and rennin-angiotensin activity.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] This was also in accordance with the results of earlier studies where they observed a significant reduction in resting HR after 2 weeks of yogasanas and pranayama training.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Systolic BP, diastolic BP and mean pressure showed a significant reduction at 3 weeks of the training period. Whereas in another study, pranayama training produced a decrease in basal HR but systolic, diastolic BP did not change in either pranayama group or control group though there was a significant reduction in RPP in pranayama group.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Hence, the results of the present study conclude that pranayama leads to better control of BP in mild hypertensive patients. The further studies are needed to explore the effects of these techniques in various stages of hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
