Impairment of attention, memory, reaction time, and depressed level of consciousness are often reported.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Delayed functional recovery as a consequence of cognitive dysfunction would lead to prolonged hospital stay in patients undergoing GA. This is of great importance where time to discharge after anaesthesia is short as after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Daycare surgeries are becoming more and more popular to cater to the needs of patients with tight work schedules and delayed recovery due to cognitive dysfunction is definitely not warranted. When providing GA, the goal is to achieve optimal surgical conditions while ensuring an early recovery. The causes of prolonged recovery of cognition and memory after anaesthesia and surgery are multifactorial. Various studies have implicated agents such as propofol and sevoflurane in the development of post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Agents such as propofol, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub> O), midazolam, and fentanyl act on various types of receptors in the brain and these in turn may lead to POCD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sevoflurane and propofol are two most commonly used anaesthetic agents in day care cases. The present study was an attempt to compare the effects of sevoflurane with that of propofol in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under GA as regards POCD in the immediate post-operative period (up to 4 h after surgery).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This double-blinded randomised comparative study was conducted from November, 2012 to November, 2013 after obtaining approval of the Ethical Committee of the Institution. A total of 80 female patients posted for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be performed under GA were included, after informed consent and divided into two groups of 40 patients each with the help of a computer generated randomisation list. The primary endpoint was to compare early post-operative cognitive functions between the two groups. Haemodynamic events, post-operative recovery and pain were also evaluated. A previous study by Flouda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that explicit memory score correlating to bispectral index (BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) 61-80 was 0.066 &#x000b1; 0.089 and 0.004 &#x000b1; 0.015 for anaesthetic agents propofol and sevoflurane, respectively. Assuming the same, at 2-sided type 1 error of 0.05 and power of 90%, a sample size of 32 per group was required to detect a significant difference. But we decided to take 40 patients per group for the study to account for drop outs. The principal investigator enrolled the patients and an anaesthesiologist not related to the study finally assigned the patients to the respective groups. Pre- and post-operative data were collected by a blinded observer who would not administer anaesthesia to the study subjects. Propofol was used in Group P and sevoflurane in Group S. All patients underwent a thorough pre-anaesthetic check-up. Inclusion criteria comprised female sex, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I physical status, age group between 18 and 60 years, education till high school and pre-operative mini mental state examination (MMSE) score &#x0003e;23. Exclusion criteria included male patients, age &#x0003e;60 years or &#x0003c;18 years, ASA Grade-II or higher, allergy to the drugs to be used, patients receiving treatment with anti-anxiety drugs, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics, patients with known psychiatric illness, drug or alcohol abuse, patients having chronic pain syndrome, Alzheimer's disease or presenile dementia, pregnant and lactating women, history of jaundice in the past, patient refusal, patient's education level below high school and pre-operative MMSE score &#x0003c;23. All patients were kept nil orally from 8 h before surgery and pre-medicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally on the night before surgery and 1 h prior to surgery. Pre-operative data were collected 1 h prior to surgery. In the operation theatre, baseline haemodynamic parameters (heart rate [HR], electrocardiography [ECG], non-invasive blood pressure [NIBP], pulse rate and pulse oximetry [SpO<sub>2</sub> ]) were recorded in all patients. After securing the intravenous (IV) line, injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg IV, injection glycopyrrolate 5 &#x003bc;g/kg IV and injection ondansetron 4 mg IV were administered to the patients.</p><p>In Group P, anaesthesia was induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg IV slowly till surgical plane of anaesthesia was achieved (BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> value at 40-60). Injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was administered and trachea was intubated with an appropriate sized cuffed endotracheal tube. Maintenance of anaesthesia was done using oxygen: N<sub>2</sub> O at the ratio of 33:67, propofol infusion at the rate of 100&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;g/kg so as to maintain BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> value between 40 and 60 and vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg) supplements. Continuous intra-operative monitoring for ECG, HR, NIBP, BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was performed.</p><p>In Group S, anaesthesia was induced with inhalation of O<sub>2</sub> and sevoflurane (5%) till BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> value of 40-60 was reached and maintenance of anaesthesia was with oxygen: N<sub>2</sub> O (33:67), sevoflurane and vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg) supplements. Rest of the procedure was kept uniformly same as in Group P. Anaesthesia was maintained at a BIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> level of 40-60 by adjustment of flow of propofol or minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane. Injection paracetamol 15 mg/kg IV was administered to all the patients intra-operatively. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg.</p><p>Data collection and analysis were done as per following tests both pre-operatively (1 h prior) and post-operatively (at 5 min; 1, 2 and 4 h): (1) California verbal learning test (CVLT)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] &#x02013; Patients were asked to remember the names of five fruits so as to check verbal memory. (2) Digit span test (DST)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] &#x02013; Patients were asked to repeat four, five or six digit numbers to assess numerical memory. (3) Rivermead behavioural memory test (RBMT)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] &#x02013; Patients were shown a picture of an animal pre-operatively and asked to identify this animal post-operatively and also asked if the location of the animal was same so as to check the recall of day to day items by picture recognition. (4) RBMT[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was used to check the semantic memory through recall of date of birth post-operatively. (5) Patients were asked to recall the names of the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon post-operatively. (6) MMSE[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] score &#x02013; evaluated prior to surgery in order to know if there was any pre-existing cognitive dysfunction. Same was evaluated after reversal of anaesthesia.</p><p>Recovery from anaesthesia was determined by Aldrete recovery scoring system.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Post-operative pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) score up to 4 h post-operatively.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Software used for statistical analysis was the SPSS version 18.0 (2009). The level of statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for all tests. For each participant, we calculated the proportion of correct responses given post-operatively. Based on these results, we estimated the mean responses in each of the questions for propofol and sevoflurane groups separately. Normality and equal variance <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for quantitative variables. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to check the calculated memory scores and to analyse different hemodynamic data for both the groups. For nominal data, the Chi-square test was applied. Correlation coefficients of Pearson (for normally distributed variables) were used to test possible correlations between memory and quantitative variables (age, duration of anaesthesia/surgery).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULT</title><p>Demographic data were comparable between the two groups of 40 patients each [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

The term cognition comes from the Latin verb congnosco (con &#x02018;with&#x02019; + gnosco &#x02018;know&#x02019;).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Three types of cognitive deterioration after surgery are delirium, short-term cognitive disturbance and true POCD which is a subtle deterioration in cognitive function lasting for weeks, months or longer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It has been subjected to extensive research. Apart from anaesthetic agents, various other suspected factors are glucocorticoid levels, pre-existing cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, age, brain hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and genetic aspects.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] One study by Terri[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] however, offered firm evidence that commonly used inhaled anaesthetic agents do not increase the incidence of cognitive problems such as delirium in the early post-operative period. Anaesthetic drugs may act by causing long-term receptor changes, apoptosis, changes in cholinergic binding and gene expression.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The incidence of POCD which is reported in various studies involving the same form of surgery and anaesthesia varies immensely. This may be due, in part, to methodological issues as well as to individual patient differences. Large differences are apparent in available literature such as the choice of test batteries (too easy or too difficult tests), the interval between sessions, the time of post-operative assessments, the endpoints to be analysed, statistical methods, change of test personnel, suitability of normative population and period of follow-up and attrition.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the present study, short-term POCD is evaluated. Traditionally, intelligence tests or tests developed for clinical neuropsychology have been used mostly in the geriatric age group. Post-operative delirium in elderly is one of the most under-diagnosed clinical entities in anaesthesiology practice, which enhances the morbidity and mortality on this subset of the population.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We could find a few such studies with younger patients undergoing anaesthesia, comparing these drugs. Similar studies[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have showed that sevoflurane affects the implicit memory and cognition of adequately anaesthetised subjects less than propofol. There was no benefit of using total IV anaesthesia with propofol and opioid over the conventional balanced volatile technique in terms of recovery and cognitive functions.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Emergence and return of cognitive function were significantly faster after propofol compared with sevoflurane when assessed 60 min post-operatively in another study.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Thus, the inferences of different studies have been different. In our study, propofol has been shown to affect explicit memory and other cognitive functions more in the immediate post-operative period. Sevoflurane, an inhalational anaesthetic of the ethereal origin with low solubility in blood and body tissue is characterised by rapid induction and recovery and has been found to have less cognitive impairment than propofol.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Sevoflurane with a blood gas partition coefficient of 0.65 might, therefore, be a better drug as far as short-term preservation of cognitive functions are concerned and hence a better option in day care surgeries.</p><p>The limitation of this study was that it was not possible for us to follow-up the patients beyond 4 h post-operatively. A short-term comparison between the two groups was therefore planned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Propofol was found to have a significant impact on cognitive functions and memory in comparison to sevoflurane in the immediate post-operative period of up to 1 h. At 2 and 4 h post-operatively, the values were not significantly different for many of the variables except for verbal memory which was affected in the propofol group even at 4 h. Therefore, sevoflurane anaesthesia might be a better option in day care surgeries where patients have to be discharged early.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Department of
