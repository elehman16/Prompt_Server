The implant service commits to lifetime follow-up. The patient commits to regular adjustment and rehabilitation appointments in the first year and annual follow-up appointments thereafter. Offering remote follow-up may result in more stable hearing, reduced patient travel expense, time and disruption, more empowered patients, greater equality in service delivery and more freedom to optimise the allocation of clinic resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This will be a two-arm feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 60 adults using cochlear implants with at least 6&#x02005;months device experience in a 6-month clinical trial of remote care. This project will design, implement and evaluate a person-centred long-term follow-up pathway for people using cochlear implants offering a triple approach of remote and self-monitoring, self-adjustment of device and a personalised online support tool for home speech recognition testing, information, self-rehabilitation, advice, equipment training and troubleshooting. The main outcome measure is patient activation. Secondary outcomes are stability and quality of hearing, stability of quality of life, clinic resources, patient and clinician experience, and any adverse events associated with remote care. We will examine the acceptability of remote care to service users and clinicians, the willingness of participants to be randomised, and attrition rates. We will estimate numbers required to plan a fully powered RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was received from North West&#x02014;Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee (15/NW/0860) and the University of Southampton Research Governance Office (ERGO 15329).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results will be disseminated in the clinical and scientific communities and also to the patient population via peer-reviewed research publications both online and in print, conference and meeting presentations, posters, newsletter articles, website reports and social media.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN14644286; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>OTOLARYNGOLOGY</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This will be the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a triple approach to remote care for people using cochlear implants.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No formal power calculations were performed as this is the first study of its kind and acts as a feasibility RCT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The generic Patient Activation Measure (PAM) may not be sensitive enough to show change in people with cochlear implants: a condition-specific empowerment measure may be required.</p></list-item><list-item><p>People using cochlear implants who volunteer to take part may not be representative of the population of people with implants.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cochlear implants are the most successful of all neural prostheses;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> they can provide hearing to people with severe to profound deafness. Approximately 1200 people receive a cochlear implant in the UK each year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The total number of people with implants is &#x0223c;14&#x02005;000 in the UK and 600&#x02005;000 worldwide.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Numbers are likely to increase rapidly: only &#x0223c;5% of eligible people in the UK have received an implant,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the number of people of retirement age is projected to increase by 28% by 2035<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> meaning a further increase in the number of hearing-impaired people. Cochlear implant care in the UK is provided at 1 of 19 tertiary centres involving assessment, surgery, and a resource-intensive acute phase of device adjustment and rehabilitation. These centres may be several hours away from the patient's home necessitating travel expense, time off work and family disruption. Currently UK implant centres review patients on a clinic-led schedule; this means that review appointments can occur that provide little benefit to the patient. Conversely when some patients attend a routine appointment, there is hearing deterioration which the patient had not noticed. This is often remedied by replacing equipment that the patient could have done at home. Making this care pathway patient-centred instead may provide a more efficient and effective service and allow more timely identification of issues.</p><p>When a patient attends a long-term follow-up appointment, the following tasks may be performed: speech recognition testing, device adjustment, rehabilitation, equipment check and troubleshooting, and provision of replacement or upgraded equipment. We propose that at least some of these tasks could be performed by the patient themselves at home, and that people using cochlear implants should only attend the clinic when there is clinical need (no more routine appointments). Potential benefits for the patient are:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>More stable hearing (problems identified and resolved quicker);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Better hearing (ability to fine tune when away from clinic);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Convenience of not travelling to routine appointments;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduction of travel cost and time, time off work and disruption to family life;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased confidence to manage own hearing;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Greater equality in service delivery (same level of service regardless of distance from clinic).</p></list-item></list></p><p>It may also mean that the clinic has greater resources (time, money, space) to see complex cases and the expanding population of new patients, although health economics analysis will not occur in this trial. People using cochlear implants and their families would generally like to take a more active role in their care and welcome the use of technology to assist self-care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The National Health Service (NHS) has a strong commitment to supporting self-care for people with long-term conditions<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with &#x02018;the vision of a citizen-centred, digitally enabled, health and social care system&#x02019;.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evidence shows a significant improvement in outcomes when patients use self-management tools<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and those who are activated and involved in their care tend to have better health outcomes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

The levels can change as the person using a cochlear implant becomes more used to listening, more experienced at doing the task and as physiological changes occur. Most cochlear implant centres offer frequent appointments in the first few months following implantation and annual adjustment appointments thereafter.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Device adjustment usually occurs in the clinic in a sound-treated room, led by an experienced clinician. Several centres are now offering remote device programming.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;32</xref> However, these reports continue to use a clinician-centred model involving the patient attending a centre closer to their home where an assistant is present, and the cochlear implant centre clinician leading the session using video conferencing and remote desktop connection.</p><p>People using cochlear implants have commented that they would like to be able to adjust their device parameters in their own home or work environment, rather than just in the sound-treated clinic room.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The company Cochlear have introduced a self-fitting paradigm (Remote Assistant Fitting) using the speech processor remote control that patients already have. This allows adjustment of programming to be done by the patient at anytime and anywhere with equivalent hearing outcomes to audiologist-led sessions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Rehabilitation</title><p>Many clinical resources are devoted to rehabilitation after people receive a cochlear implant; the new sound can be difficult to get used to. Rehabilitation appointments are frequent in the first year and may be offered annually thereafter.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Computer-based auditory training completed by the patient at home can significantly improve their speech recognition.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>Equipment troubleshooting/repairs/spares provision/upgrades</title><p>Cochlear implant speech processors are complex; some parts need regular replacement in order to keep the device in optimum condition.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> No reminder is given on the device.

This is necessary preparatory work for a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will be extended across the UK. It is a prospective RCT whereby 60 patients will be randomised to either a control group (usual clinical care) or a remote care group where they are given access to new remote care tools. The patients in the remote care group will monitor their hearing at home, and some can fine tune their hearing to suit their own real-world environment. Their other needs will be met through a personalised online support tool. Assessment of front-line staff perceptions of remote care will also be formally evaluated using repeated interviews with 10 staff members at the start, midpoint and end of the project. Empowering the patient to self-care at home could enable better and more stable hearing and a more convenient and accessible service.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This will be a two-arm feasibility RCT involving 60 adults with cochlear implants with at least 6&#x02005;months device experience in a 6-month clinical trial of remote care (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011342F1">figure 1</xref> flow chart).
