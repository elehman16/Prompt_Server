Approximately 90&#x000a0;% have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the number of people with T2DM is currently increasing in every country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specifically, in China, the prevalence of diabetes has increased from less than 1&#x000a0;% in 1980 to 11.6&#x000a0;% in 2010, making China the country with the highest absolute disease burden of diabetes in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating evidence supports early initiation of insulin treatment in T2DM. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that intensive glycemic control in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM reduced long-term micro- and macrovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tight glycemic control early after diagnosis of T2DM may lead to slower progression of the disease and delay the need for intensified treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Insulin is recommended as the most powerful option of second-line therapy in T2DM if individualized glycemic targets are not met within a reasonable time frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An important focus of insulin initiation in T2DM is that glycemic control should be achieved while still ensuring a low risk of hypoglycemia because the risk of hypoglycemia is a major reason for clinical inertia in initiating insulin treatment in T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unfortunately, most current basal insulin analogs do not allow glycemic control over a full 24-h period, and are often limited by their day-to-day variability and thereby a potentially higher risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, basal insulin preparations with improved pharmacological properties and an even lower risk of hypoglycemia are needed.</p><p>Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an insulin analog with an ultra-long duration of action &#x0003e;42&#x000a0;h. Owing to a unique protraction mechanism with IDeg monomers being slowly and continuously released into the circulation, a stable glucose-lowering effect across 24&#x000a0;h and less day-to-day variability in the glucose-lowering effect has been observed with IDeg compared with insulin glargine (IGlar). With these pharmacological properties, IDeg allows for flexibility in dosing without compromising glycemic control or increasing the risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Clinical studies have confirmed that IDeg is non-inferior to IGlar in HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction with once-daily dosing in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve or insulin-treated patients with T2DM and causes a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) greater than or similar to that of IGlar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, meta-analyses have shown that in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM the total daily dose at end of trial was 10&#x000a0;% lower with IDeg than with IGlar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and that IDeg compared with IGlar reduced the rate of overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, using the Treatment Related Impact Measures-Diabetes Device (TRIM-D Device) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the IDeg delivery device has been rated significantly better for device function and with less device bother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] compared with the IGlar delivery device.</p><p>The rationale for the current trial was to confirm the efficacy of IDeg and to compare the safety of IDeg with IGlar, both in combination with metformin in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM in a multinational trial, with two thirds of the patients enrolled in China to support IDeg registration in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This was a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial conducted at 68 centers in Brazil, Canada, China, South Africa, Ukraine, and United States between June 2013 and May 2014. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2000 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Randomization was performed using an interactive voice/web response system at each dispensing visit. Randomization was stratified according to region: China/non-China. The trial was open label, but treatment group assignment was blinded for internal titration surveillance committee members, internal safety committee members, external members of the cardiovascular event adjudication committee, and everyone involved in defining analysis sets and performing data review until the database was locked.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedures</title><p>At randomization, all subjects discontinued their OADs except for metformin, which was to be continued maintaining the pre-randomization dose level and dosing frequency throughout the trial. IDeg was administered once daily between the start of the main evening meal and bedtime, and IGlar was administered once daily according to local labeling. The starting dose of both insulin products was 10 U with dose titration each week. Mean value of pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) measured on 3 consecutive days before each scheduled visit or telephone contact was used for optimal titration according to a titration algorithm, with a target pre-breakfast SMPG of 4.0&#x02013;4.9&#x000a0;mmol/L (Online Resource Table S1).</p><p>Blood samples for central laboratory-analyzed FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and measurements for nine-point SMPG profiles were collected before randomization and after 12, 16, and 26&#x000a0;weeks. Adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycemic episodes were collected throughout the trial. All other safety parameters were collected at the beginning and end of the trial, and for body weight and insulin antibodies also after 12&#x000a0;weeks. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were completed at baseline and after 12 and 26&#x000a0;weeks. After 26&#x000a0;weeks, all subjects switched to Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH insulin, Insulatard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Protaphane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Novolin N&#x02122;, 100&#x000a0;IU/mL, 3&#x000a0;mL FlexPen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and continued using metformin for a 1-week follow-up period to allow for the measurement of insulin antibodies. A 1-week interval (corresponding to &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;<italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) was necessary to allow for washout of trial insulin. During this period, subjects were treated with NPH insulin, which owing to the much shorter half-life ensured lower insulin levels at the antibody sampling time point, consequently reducing the risk for interference with the antibody measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Efficacy Assessments</title><p>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (%) after 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.

In accordance with previous trials in the large clinical development program for IDeg, non-inferiority vs. IGlar in terms of glycemic control was met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite the large sub-population of Chinese subjects with an assumed high carbohydrate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], basal-only treatment ensured adequate glycemic control in a large proportion of subjects (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0&#x000a0;%; 54&#x000a0;% with IDeg and 51&#x000a0;% with IGlar) without requiring additional bolus insulin.</p><p>As shown by the total TRIM-D Device score, subjects were more satisfied with the IDeg device compared with the IGlar device. The result in this trial is consistent with a previous crossover trial where subjects were randomized to receive either IDeg or IGlar for 16&#x000a0;weeks, and were crossed over to the alternative basal insulin for the remaining 16&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In that trial, an even larger treatment difference in TRIM-D Device score in favor of IDeg was seen. Importantly, subjects in that trial were using insulin vials and syringes prior to the trial; thus, the results were not affected by recent insulin pen experience, similarly to the trial reported here where the subjects were insulin na&#x000ef;ve.</p><p>The treat-to-target design allows for direct comparison of safety measurements such as hypoglycemia without confounding differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. In this trial, 20 and 23&#x000a0;% lower rates of overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia, respectively, were found with IDeg compared to IGlar, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This was accompanied by the odds of achieving the glycemic targets of HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7 and &#x02264;6.5&#x000a0;% without confirmed hypoglycemia being 24 and 33&#x000a0;% higher with IDeg than with IGlar, although not statistically significantly different. Similar results have been seen in other IDeg trials of 26&#x000a0;weeks duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and a statistically significant difference in nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia rates was shown in a 52-week trial (36&#x000a0;% lower rate for IDeg compared with IGlar) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A pre-specified meta-analysis has been conducted to confirm superiority of IDeg over IGlar for hypoglycemic episodes using pooled individual subject-level data from seven previous IDeg trials. For basal-only insulin treatment in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with T2DM, the meta-analysis showed rates of overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes that were statistically significantly lower by 17 and 36&#x000a0;%, respectively, for IDeg compared with IGlar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, a meta-analysis performed on the same data, using three alternative definitions of nocturnal hypoglycemia, supported statistically significantly lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia in the range of 27&#x02013;44&#x000a0;% with IDeg vs. IGlar in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, the numerical differences in hypoglycemia rate between IDeg and IGlar observed in the present trial are in accordance with comprehensive pooled analyses of previous trials in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with T2DM on basal-only therapy.</p><p>In this trial, the within-subject day-to-day variation in pre-breakfast SMPG, assessed by CV% was 12.9&#x000a0;% with IGlar and 14.2&#x000a0;% with IDeg, with the difference between treatments being statistically significant. In other trials testing IDeg vs. IGlar in T2DM with basal-only insulin treatment, generally higher levels of within-subject variability in pre-breakfast SMPG were seen (CV% of 16&#x02013;18&#x000a0;%) with statistically significantly lower CV% in favor of IDeg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or no difference between treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, the observed difference in the present trial is not believed to be of any clinical relevance.</p><p>The trial had several strengths. Including an insulin-na&#x000ef;ve population ensured that expectation bias was reduced. Furthermore, the treat-to-target design used to achieve improved and similar glycemic control in the two treatment groups ensured that comparisons among groups in frequency and severity of hypoglycemia were interpretable in ultimate risk-benefit assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The trial was limited by the open-label design, but because appropriate placebo injection devices were not available, it was not possible to employ a fully blinded double-dummy design. Still, because accurate quantification of hypoglycemic episodes was important, we tried to limit reporting bias by using an objective definition of hypoglycemia, i.e., either PG &#x0003c;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (where the majority of subjects will have symptoms) or severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance. As in any open-label trial, there was a risk of greater caution when titrating the dose of the new drug (IDeg); however, when comparing IDeg with IGlar this was not reflected in the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG over time, or in the proportion of subjects reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets at the end of the trial. Because the dosing time of IGlar was not captured in this trial, it was not possible to explore the impact of dosing time on glycemic control. Finally, as in any other clinical trial, the population was selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, implying that the clinical applicability of this trial is limited to patients who fit those criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This trial confirmed the non-inferiority of IDeg vs. IGlar in HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction when initiating once-daily basal insulin in patients with T2DM. IDeg provided adequate glycemic control with a low rate of overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia, and no safety issues were detected. Overall, the findings from this trial, with two thirds of subjects enrolled in China, demonstrate that IDeg provides a new and safe option for initiating insulin therapy in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on OADs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
