Eccentric resistance exercise with its high-force producing potential, at a low energetic cost, may be ideally-suited to address muscle impairments in this population. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically-induced, work (RENEW) versus traditional (TRAD) resistance exercise on mobility, balance confidence, muscle power and cross sectional area, as well as the number of days high fall risk older adults survived without a fall event over a 1 year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Randomized, two group, four time point (over 1 year) clinical trial testing RENEW versus TRAD as part of a 3 month multi-component exercise fall reduction program (MCEFRP).

Fall incidence doubles in those beyond 75&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and a previous history of falling is an additive risk for future falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Muscle impairments in the lower extremities have been identified as critical, yet modifiable, risk factors that should be therapeutically targeted in exercise interventions for fall prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Specifically, muscle weakness imposes a three to four-fold greater risk of a fall. Muscle atrophy too has an impact on fall risk though lesser than muscle weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Deficits in muscle power are even more important than muscle strength for safe mobility function through dynamic balance and protective responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This focus on muscle for fall prevention has been highlighted in The National Council on Aging&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Falls Free Initiative&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in consensus opinions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and clinical guideline statements from the Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy and the American Physical Therapy Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Resistance exercise can address deficits in muscle power and size along with impairments in mobility and confidence. Therefore, resistance exercise has been systematically highlighted as a necessary component of a successful multi-component exercise fall reduction program (MCEFRP). Eccentric resistance exercise has gained considerable attention within the last 15&#x000a0;years due to its appropriateness and tolerability for older adults who might otherwise be limited by their diminished muscular strength and aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The unique properties of eccentric muscle action (low energy cost, high muscle force production), coupled with findings from previous pilot trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] that eccentric exercise can mitigate deficits in muscle size, strength and mobility while lowering the fall risk profile of older adults, makes eccentric exercise an alluring add-on to a MCEFRP. Further, the amplified effects of eccentric versus concentric exercise on muscle strength and mass have been systematically reported in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To date, however, no large-scale randomized controlled trial has compared the relative merits of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically- induced, work (RENEW) verses traditional resistance exercise (TRAD) as part of a MCEFRP on mitigating fall events in a high fall-risk older adult population.</p><p id="Par15">The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to test RENEW versus TRAD as the resistance exercise component part of a 3 month MCEFRP. Importantly, this trial was not designed to test whether a MCEFRP was effective at mitigating falls as multiple studies have reported reductions of ~13&#x02013;30% and these studies have been recently reviewed systematically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Here we simply were testing the merits of RENEW as the resistance exercise component part of a MCEFRP and comparing it to a TRAD component. We hypothesized the effect of RENEW as part of the MCEFRP would be greater than the effect of TRAD on increasing mobility and balance confidence, muscle power, and muscle lean tissue cross sectional area. Further, we expected those experiencing RENEW, versus TRAD, would increase the number of days high fall risk older adults survived without a fall event over a 1 year period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants, randomization and study time points</title><p id="Par16">Following a multi-step screening process that included contacting potential participants from a patient database at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center via mailed letters, follow-up phone screening, and finally an in-clinic assessment, 134 older adults met the criteria for high fall risk and volunteered to participate (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Training sessions were individualized and supervised, but performed in groups of two to five participants over a 3 h period at a rehabilitation wellness center at the University of Utah. The MCEFRP consisted of multiple modes of exercises performed in a circuit that alternated higher-intensity and dynamic activities with lower-intensity, static tasks. Aerobic exercise was performed on a NuStep recumbent trainer (NuStep Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), seated stationary cycle ergometer, or overground treadmill. Flexibility exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] designed to improve joint range of motion were completed for 30&#x02013;60s per exercise at a perceived intensity of a strong pulling sensation without pain included: pectoralis stretching in a doorway, seated hamstrings stretching, standing calf stretching, trunk rotation stretches, and prone positioning for hip flexor stretching.

Upper extremity resistance exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] of the shoulder rotator cuff, deltoid and scapular muscle systems in addition to the elbow flexors, extensor and rotators were performed over a 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min period using free weights. The free weights for these upper extremity resistance exercises were increased as tolerated every 2 weeks provided the participants could complete three sets of 15 repetitions with appropriate form. The only difference in the MCEFRP for the two groups was the type of lower extremity resistance training performed, i.e., RENEW or TRAD. There was no attempt at matching the workloads of the two lower extremity resistance exercise regimens, though the amount of time spent doing lower extremity resistance exercise progressed in both groups to a maximum of 15&#x000a0;min. Adhering to a minimum of 18 of the 36 MCEFRP sessions was required.</p><p id="Par20">The TRAD resistance exercise group performed (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) three sets of 15 repetitions of a seated bilateral leg press exercise (Tuff Stuff PS &#x02212;230 Deluxe Leg Press, Tuffstuff, Chino, CA) at 60&#x02013;65% of their one repetition maximum (RM) for the initial 2 weeks. Training sessions for the remaining 10&#x000a0;weeks were performed at 70% of 1-RM, which was assessed every 2 weeks thereafter. In addition, the TRAD group performed standing multi-directional straight leg exercises with a weighted cuff placed just proximal to the ankle. The training loads for this exercise were increased as tolerated every 2 weeks provided the participants could complete three sets of 15 repetitions with appropriate form.</p><p id="Par21">The RENEW group performed (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) progressive resistive eccentric exercise of the knee and hip extensor muscles using a recumbent stepper-ergometer (Eccentron&#x02122;, Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment, Hanover, MD) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Briefly, the stepper speed ranged between 12 and 18&#x000a0;rpm as the participant resisted the stepper pedal action and eccentric muscle contractions were induced in the knee and hip extensor muscles. Visual feedback of the work performed for each revolution was displayed on a computer monitor. Participants performed eccentric resistance exercise and negative work (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) from approximately 15&#x02013;75 degrees of knee flexion as they resisted the motorized movement of the stepper pedals via resistance action of the knee and hip extensors. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] between 6 and 20 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Bilateral MRI scans of the thighs were obtained and subjects were placed supine in a 3.0 Tesla whole body imager (Siemens Trio, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany). The legs were scanned in a coronal plane and the midpoint of the thigh was determined and defined as halfway between the superior margin of the femoral head and the inferior margin of the femoral condyles. Axial imaging (5&#x000a0;mm thick slices at 1&#x000a0;cm intervals) of the legs was then performed over 1/2 the length of the femur, centered at the midpoint of the thigh. Separate fat and water images were created with custom software using the three-point Dixon method. A tissue model was then used to calculate estimates of total fat and non-fat volume fractions on a per-pixel basis, which were displayed in image form. Five images from the middle 1/3 of each thigh were used to determine average cross-sectional area of lean tissue. Manual tracing eliminated subcutaneous fat and bone and isolated the fascial border of the thigh to create a subfascial region of interest. Total lean tissue was calculated by summing the value of percent lean tissue fraction over all pixels using custom-written image analysis software (MATLAB; The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts). This sum was multiplied by the area of each pixel to give total lean tissue cross-sectional area within the region of interest.

During the 3&#x000a0;months (0&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months) of the MCEFRP intervention project personnel instructed participants in fall event definitions and asked at each session (3 times per week) if they had a fall, near fall, new medication, or change in health status. If there was a report of a fall or near-fall the project staff recorded the event and reminded the participant to call the reporting number that had been provided on a refrigerator magnet as soon as possible after an event throughout the entire study. At the conclusion of the active intervention period (3&#x000a0;months), participants were provided nine stamped postcards for monthly (3&#x000a0;months &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;months) reporting of falls or near-falls, changes in medication use, and changes in physical condition. A designated research assistant monitored the telephone report line and monthly postcards. If a postcard was not received for a month or an event that had not been reported on the telephone or via a returned postcard was identified, the research assistant initiated contact. During the telephone interview regarding fall or near-fall events regardless of how the event was detected, a structured interview about the circumstances and consequences of the fall or near-fall event was conducted. A proxy (family member or friend designated by the participant at enrollment) was contacted if the participant could not be reached after five attempts or the participant sounded confused or unreliable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par27">An intent-to-treat approach was used and any missing primary or secondary data points were assumed to be missing at random.

Further, there was no differential effect of RENEW or TRAD on the number of days high fall risk older adults survived without a fall or a near-fall event. These results were not expected since earlier findings with mobility-limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], frail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and generally healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] older adults engaging in eccentric resistance exercise of the lower extremities for 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks have previously demonstrated improved mobility and muscle responses that exceeded those stemming from more traditional-types of resistance exercise regimens. Two defining properties of eccentric muscle contractions, i.e., the force production potential being uniquely high yet the energy cost to produce this force being uniquely low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], are thought to underlie these previous RENEW effects. The characteristics of eccentric resistance exercise interventions have recently been reviewed and deemed well-suited for older adult rehabilitation populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] since many are exercise-limited and impaired in their abilities to produce sufficient muscle force to preserve their muscle mass and function. Moreover, eccentric muscle control is an essential component of balance recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Without sufficient load on lower extremity muscles, many older adults enter a downward spiral of sarcopenia, which can result in life-threatening falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Despite the potential for amplified muscle, balance and confidence responses after eccentric exercise others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] have reported that either eccentric or traditional resistance exercise-induced loads on muscle can produce similar results in older adults. This study is the first to report the effect of RENEW as part of a MCEFRP on the prevention of fall events. We hypothesized more fall-event-free survival days would follow in the RENEW group over 1 year, but instead saw an equivalent effect to the TRAD group in the number of days a fall or near fall event were averted.</p><p id="Par35">A recent updated review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reinforces the notion that multi-component exercise interventions can reduce the risk and rate of falls in at-risk older adults living in the community. Exercise programs of three or more hours per week that include challenges to balance can reduce the rate of falls by 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moreover, the evidence supports the hypothesis that increasing muscle strength and power should reduce the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The MCEFRP did have an effect on fall risk factors considered reversible with exercise interventions. That is, independent of whether RENEW or TRAD was employed modest increases in mobility (4%), balance confidence (6%) and leg muscle power (14%) did occur after engaging in a MCEFRP and these improvements were sustained over all non-exercise follow-up time points (i.e., 9&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months). Leg lean tissue cross sectional area, however, remained unchanged immediately following the MCEFRP but decreased (1%) in the non-exercise follow-up period. Previously eccentric resistance exercise, when compared to more traditional resistance exercise, has demonstrated greater effects and/or superior mobility, balance and muscle responses in high fall risk older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The comparison of the current large randomized trial to this small non-randomized pilot study is difficult as a different eccentric resistance exercise device was used and dissimilar testing modes were employed. A more recent randomized study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], however, may be a more appropriate comparator as similar muscle and mobility outcomes were reported when using the identical eccentric device and protocol for 3 months of resistance exercise with older survivors of cancer (90% having 8+ years of survival since their breast, prostate or colorectal cancer diagnosis). Those survivors of cancer who performed eccentric resistance exercise were comparable to the high fall risk individuals who participated in the MCEFRP as they were equivalent in age (75&#x000a0;years), gender distribution (&#x0003e;60% female), BMI (28&#x000a0;kg*m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), mobility level (pre-exercise 6&#x000a0;MW distance of 417&#x000a0;m) and were characterized by a similar suite and number of comorbidities. With that, this report of a sample of high fall risk older adults who participated in a pragmatic fall prevention trial, highlighted by rigorous surveillance of fall events, represents similar usefulness of eccentric resistance exercise and the equivalence of either RENEW or TRAD as part of a MCEFRP. We conclude the community dwelling older adults did improve their annual fall event rate as 100% of participants had fallen in the year prior to the MCEFRP, but during the year following enrollment &#x0003c;50% of participants experienced a day when a fall or near fall occurred.</p><p id="Par36">It can be challenging when interpreting the results from this large randomized trial when a no-intervention control group was not included, however, this study was not designed to determine the effectiveness of a MCEFRP. More than 150 clinical trials have evaluated exercise in the prevention of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nor was this study designed to determine the effects of resistance exercise alone on the risk of falls. This too has been dissected in at least eight previous studies in samples with the average age greater than 75&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Rather, this study was designed as a larger extension to previous smaller eccentric trials that suggested the effect of RENEW might be superior to TRAD. We have clearly concluded that an effective MCEFRP can use either RENEW or TRAD as its mode of strength training. Less clear are how to interpret the respective mobility, muscle and balance responses to the MCEFRP as they were variable in both the RENEW and TRAD groups making it difficult to decipher whether one of these risk factors might differentially influence the number of days a high fall risk participant survived without a fall or fall event. Finally, despite rigorous accounting of fall and near fall events (and 3 months of extensive training of the participants during the MCEFRP on what constitutes a fall or near fall event), the latter can be subjective. Therefore, near falls may have been either over- or under-represented in our results. We included near falls in our study design since it has been used as an outcome previously and prior research has indicated older adults can distinguish near falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">There are several strengths to this test of RENEW versus TRAD as part of a MCEFRP that collectively make it unique. The trial design met the recent recommendations stemming from a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] for fall prevention practices using exercise in community dwelling older adults. The recruitment strategy was successful in targeting a large number of well-characterized, community-ambulating older adults who were clearly at-risk for falling having experienced one or more falls in the previous year and averaging more than five comorbidities. The MCEFRP was in a group exercise setting for 3 h per week and included two approaches to strength training coupled with high challenges to balance. Adherence and participation rates were high and both performance and self-report outcomes were assessed. Finally, this study followed the consensus recommendations for the acute monitoring of fall events during and immediately following MCEFRP. Further, the monthly fall surveillance approach over the 1&#x000a0;year follow-up is a strength as collectively these fall event tracking approaches are employed in less than 50% of previous multicomponent fall prevention trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">The purpose of this study was to test if RENEW or TRAD had differential effects on both fall risks and fall events in a high fall risk group of older adults.
