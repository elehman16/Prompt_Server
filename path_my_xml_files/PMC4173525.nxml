This is often accomplished by prior administration of a sedative drug before transfer to the OR. Midazolam is the most commonly used drug for this purpose.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Premedication with midazolam has been shown to be more effective than parental presence or placebo in reducing anxiety and improving compliance at induction of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The beneficial effects of midazolam include sedation, anxiolysis, and reduction of postoperative vomiting.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Undesirable effects, including restlessness, paradoxical reaction, and negative postoperative behavioral changes, have made it a less than ideal premedication.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although amnesia is considered an advantage by some authorities, it has also been regarded as a possible disadvantage by others[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Clonidine, an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, has been suggested as another option for premedication in children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a newer &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist with a more selective action on the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor and a shorter half-life.

Sixty children of ASA physical status I or II aged between 5 and 12 years were scheduled to undergo ophthalmic day-care surgery.</p><p>Children were randomly allocated to group-D and group-M. The children were taken to the preoperative holding area in the presence of one parent. All children received EMLA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cream unless contraindicated and then a 24-G I.V. line was secured after 15 min. Baseline heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and blood pressure (BP) were measured before any drug administration. Group-D patients received inj. dexmedetomidine 0.4 mg/kg diluted in 10 ml given slowly I.V. Group-M patients received inj. midazolam 0.05 mg/kg I.V. as premedication. Inj. glycopyrolate 0.004 mg/kg I.V. was given.</p><p>Sedation score was noted at 5 min after premedication. At 10 min, response to parent separation was noted. The patients were taken to OR and ECG, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and NIBP monitors were applied. Response to induction in the form of mask acceptance was noted at 15 min. They were induced using propofol and scoline was given as a muscle relaxant. They underwent intubation and an endotracheal tube was fixed after checking proper placement. Anesthesia was maintained using 50% oxygen and sevoflourane as the inhalational agent, with inj. atracurium as muscle relaxant. Surgeries were mostly of 45-90-min duration. Intra-operative BP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and pulse were noted. After that the patients were reversed with inj. glycopyrolate and inj. neostigmine, and extubated. They were observed for postoperative agitation and shivering till 2 h, and were discharged after fulfillment of modified Aldrete score &#x02265;9 points.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-248-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The demographic data of the patients will be studied for each group.</p><p>The means of continuous variables (age, weight, pulse rate, BP, oxygen saturation) were compared using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>The demographic data for categorical variables (sex, ASA class, shivering) were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test.</p><p><italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic characteristics for all the patients have been summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic distribution.

There is a general as well as financial benefit to the family unit in that there is reduced dislocation to family life relating to parent's time off work, travel to and from hospital, arranging baby-sitters, etc., Parents are actively and continuously involved with the care of their child in day-care surgery units as opposed to their peripheral role when children are admitted as inpatients. There is a decreased risk of hospital-acquired infections because of reduced contact with potentially infectious hospital staff and inpatients. Finally, there is financial saving for both the institution and the parent.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist that has sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Here in this study we compared dexmedetomidine and midazolam as premedication in pediatric patients undergoing ophthalmic day-care surgery.</p><p>Akin <italic>et al</italic>., studied intranasal dexmedetomidine vs. midazolam for premedication of pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. Study group-M (<italic>n</italic> = 45) received 0.2 mg/kg intranasal midazolam and group-D (<italic>n</italic> = 45) received 1 &#x003bc;g/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine. Satisfactory mask induction was achieved by 82.2% of the patients in group-M and 60% of those in group-D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in either sedation score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.36) or anxiety score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.56) upon separation from parents. The number of patients who required postoperative analgesia was higher in the midazolam group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.045).</p><p>Kamal <italic>et al</italic>., studied the effect of oral dexmedetomidine vs. oral midazolam as premedication in 60 pediatric patients assigned to receive either oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (group-M, <italic>n</italic> = 30) or oral dexmedetomidine 3 g/kg (group-D, <italic>n</italic> = 30) prior to a standardized sevoflurane anesthetic. There was no significant difference in the pre- and postoperative levels of sedation between the two groups, but onset of sedation was significantly faster in group-M (28.4 &#x000b1; 13.7 vs. 39.5 &#x000b1; 14.3 min; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Group-D showed significantly lower pain scores in the immediate postoperative period, with fewer patients requiring rescue analgesics than in group-M (10 vs. 17, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Incidence of postoperative agitation was significantly less in the dexmedetomidine group (23% vs. 47%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Postoperative shivering and vomiting occurred less in group-D. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in group-D during the intra- and postoperative periods.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>During induction, stress response to laryngoscopy was attenuated by dexmedetomidine and also at the time of extubation, BP and pulse did not show any variation, whereas in the midazolam group, stress response was not attenuated at both time of intubation as well as extubation. Oxygen saturation was maintained in both groups, with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 being statistically not significant.</p><p>Munro <italic>et al</italic>., reported that reduction of BP and heart rate were &#x0003c;20% of baseline in children who were sedated with an initial dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg I.V. dexmedetomidine, followed by a maintenance infusion during cardiac catheterization.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A pharmacokinetic study of I.V. dexmedetomidine in children done by Petroz <italic>et al</italic>., showed that 0.66 and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg I.V. dexmedetomidine given over 10 min produced a significant reduction of heart rate (&#x0003c;15% compared with baseline) and systolic BP (&#x0003c;25% compared with baseline).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the dexmedetomidine group, 67% patients were calm in the postoperative period, 27% patients needed assurance, and only 6% patients were agitated. So we can clearly say that postoperative agitation caused by sevoflourane is possibly reduced by dexmedetomidine. In the midazolam group, only 17% patients were calm, whereas 70% patients needed assurance. So we can say that midazolam is not effective in preventing postoperative agitation in comparison with dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Zub <italic>et al</italic>., examined anesthesia records to determine the most effective anxiety-reducing anesthesia premedicant for children prior to surgical procedures. Based on their retrospective review, Zub <italic>et al</italic>. recommended 3-4 &#x003bc;g/kg oral dexmedetomidine to reduce anxiety. This study used the oral dosing that Zub <italic>et al</italic>., recommended, yet there were no significant differences between dexmedetomidine and midazolam in reducing anxiety as evidenced by mask acceptance scores or parental separation scores. It should be noted, however, that children receiving dexmedetomidine were less likely to experience emergence delirium.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is also effective in prevention of postoperative shivering. Only 27% patients experienced shivering in comparison with the midazolam group, where 63% patients experienced shivering. We believe that the proven effect of dexmedetomidine on shivering prevention is by reducing vasoconstriction and shivering threshold centrally.</p><p>Bicer <italic>et al</italic>., studied the efficacy of dexmedetomidine compared with meperidine and placebo in preventing post-anesthetic shivering. They studied 120 patients (ASA I&#x02013;II) scheduled for elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery of about 1-3-h duration. Forty patients in each group randomly received 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine, 0.5 mg/kg of meperidine, or 0.9% saline as placebo, intravenously. Post-anesthetic shivering was seen in 22 patients in the placebo group, 4 patients in the meperidine group, and 6 patients in the dexmedetomidine group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Karaman <italic>et al</italic>., evaluated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in prevention of postoperative shivering. Sixty patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were allocated randomly to two groups to administer either dexmedetomidine as a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg for 10 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h (group-D, <italic>n</italic> = 30) or a normal saline infusion (group-S, <italic>n</italic> = 30). Post-operative shivering was observed in 14 patients in group-S and three patients in group-D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>So by summarizing the above comparison we can conclude that dexmedetomidine by having more sedative quality, analgesic effect, no respiratory depression, decreased incidence of postoperative agitation, and shivering has proved as a superior premedication in the pediatric age group having more hemodynamic stability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
