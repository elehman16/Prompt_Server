Current resuscitation guidelines require rapid fluid administration as a cornerstone of paediatric shock management. However, little evidence is available to inform clinicians how to most effectively perform rapid fluid administration where this is clinically required, resulting in suboptimal knowledge translation of current resuscitation guidelines into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to determine which of the two commonly used techniques for paediatric fluid resuscitation (disconnect&#x02013;reconnect technique and push&#x02013;pull technique) yields a higher fluid administration rate in a simulated clinical scenario. Secondary objectives include determination of catheter dislodgement rates, subjective and objective measures of provider fatiguability and descriptive information regarding any technical issues encountered with performance of each method under the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study will utilise a randomised crossover trial design. Participants will include consenting healthcare providers from McMaster Children's Hospital. Each participant will administer 900&#x02005;ml (60&#x02005;ml/kg) of normal saline to a simulated 15&#x02005;kg infant as quickly as possible on two separate occasions using the manual fluid administration techniques under the study. The primary outcome, rate of fluid administration, will be evaluated using a paired two-tailed Student t test.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This protocol has been approved by the Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>These will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and presented at one or more scientific conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Registration</title><p>Protocol Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01774214</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Statistics &#x00026; Research Methods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Few studies evaluate practical considerations important to the achievement of the American College of Critical Care Medicine Surviving Sepsis paediatric fluid resuscitation benchmarks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This article will detail the protocol for a randomised controlled trial comparing two different techniques of manual fluid resuscitation for infants in shock.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A randomised crossover trial design will be used to compare the efficiency of two manual fluid resuscitation techniques as performed by 16 healthcare provider subjects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outcomes will be determined from data obtained by direct observation and video review by blinded independent assessors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data will be used to inform paediatric fluid resuscitation practical recommendations.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A randomised crossover trial design is the most rigorous design to address the research question.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Findings will provide objective data upon which to base pragmatic recommendations in future resuscitation guidelines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limitations include the use of a study setting involving a non-clinical model as a patient surrogate.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paediatric shock is a life-threatening condition with causes including sepsis, haemorrhage, dehydration and allergy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Guidelines for the management of paediatric shock from the American Heart Association (AHA) Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) and the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) recommend rapid fluid resuscitation as an essential component of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>

This will determine the order in which the two interventions will be performed. Given the nature of the study and its small size, no stratification or blocking will be utilised.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Model and interventions</title><sec id="s3f1"><title>Model setup</title><p>The setup used for this study will consist of a model simulating a 15&#x02005;kg child and include a peripheral IV catheter. A 22 gauge, 1.00 inch IV catheter will be affixed to the hand of the model in typical clinical fashion to simulate in vivo conditions. The distal end of the catheter will be secured in an unobstructed manner within conduit tubing leading to a graduated cylinder, in which the accumulating fluid may be continuously visualised. The proximal end of the IV catheter will be connected to a 7-inch catheter extension set. See online supplementary appendix 2 for an illustration of the model. For the DRT setup the proximal end of the catheter extension set will be capped with a needle-less syringe lock. An excess supply of 60&#x02005;ml syringes will be provided when subjects are to perform fluid administration using the DRT method, along with needle-less adaptors to facilitate the safe preparation of syringes of fluid from the provided 1-litre bag of normal saline. For the PPT setup, the proximal end of the catheter extension set will be connected to a triple stopcock, with a 60&#x02005;ml syringe at the second port, and standard IV tubing leading to a 1-litre bag of normal saline at the third port. Only one syringe will be required to perform the PPT manual fluid administration method. Online supplementary appendices 3 and 4 provide schematic representations of the DRT and PPT setups, respectively, including the specific parts to be used in our trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3f2"><title>Interventions</title><p>The study intervention is the method of manual fluid administration that the HCP participant will use to administer 60&#x02005;ml/kg (900&#x02005;ml) of normal saline to the simulated patient. As this is a randomised crossover trial, each of the two interventions will be applied to an HCP participant on two separate occasions. The interventions are
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>DRT: As DRT is a two-person technique, an assistant will be provided who will perform the role of fluid syringe preparation. It is important to note that when the DRT intervention is being performed, the HCP participant will not be permitted to switch roles with the assistant as, in our experience, this does not occur in the setting of a real resuscitation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PPT: This is a single-provider technique and no assistant is required.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Trial flow</title><p>On the first day of participation, following consent, participants will undergo randomisation. HCP participants will be scheduled to attend the testing site in pairs. The reason for this is a practical one: when an HCP participant is randomised to the DRT, they will require an assistant, as this is a two-provider technique. We will engage the second study participant, who is in attendance at the same time also to be tested, to act as the assistant for the other participant in this instance. On each testing day, a coin toss will be used to determine which of the two participants in attendance is tested first.</p><p>Example:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Day 1: Participant A performs DRT (participant B assists)&#x02192;30&#x02005;min break&#x02192;participant B performs PPT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Day 2: Participant A performs PPT&#x02192;30&#x02005;min break&#x02192;participant B performs DRT (participant A assists).</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s3g1"><title>Standardisation procedure</title><p>Prior to undergoing formal testing, HCPs will watch a brief standardisation video that will provide an overview of the roles/techniques to be performed including a demonstration. Providers will be afforded the opportunity to practice each technique briefly prior to formal testing to account for and attempt to minimise any training or learning effect. Participants will be permitted up to 3 syringes/syringe volumes to practice the technique to be performed after which time formal testing will proceed. The practice period is limited so that this will not result in participant fatigue.</p></sec><sec id="s3g2"><title>Participant testing</title><p>The research assistant will be responsible for verifying the integrity of all equipment prior to formal testing and for ensuring compliance with study procedures according to a checklist. The HCP participant will then be provided with a brief clinical vignette for the simulated clinical situation: child in decompensated shock with hypotension, fever and rash. Testing will begin on verbal prompt and cease at participants&#x02019; discretion when they believe that they have administered the required 900&#x02005;ml of normal saline. All testing will be video-recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s3g3"><title>Washout period</title><p>A 30&#x02005;min washout period is selected to mitigate for any potential fatigue which may have occurred as a result of acting as an assistant prior to undergoing formal testing as a participant. We chose 30&#x02005;min based on our experience with a currently enrolling trial in which participants also perform manual fluid resuscitation using syringes. In that study, a minimum 10&#x02005;min rest period is required between evaluations with an opportunity to take a longer break if desired (this has been offered to all participants and none have requested). In our upcoming study, participants will manually administer a larger volume of fluid. We therefore conservatively selected a 30&#x02005;min washout period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Data collection</title><p>Upon completion of each intervention, a research assistant will record data of interest on a data collection form (see online supplementary appendix 5). Each participant will also complete a post-trial questionnaire to collect demographic data including information regarding prior experience with paediatric fluid resuscitation (see online supplementary appendix 6). Participants will also be asked to rate how fatiguing they found the intervention to be on a seven-point Likert scale. Following testing on the second occasion, participants will be asked to complete the remaining portion of the questionnaire, related to performance of the second intervention.</p><p>All testing trials will be video-recorded as was carried out in our recently conducted study with good results. In that study, we successfully focused the video camera on the IV cannula and extension tubing site and did not capture any participant identifiers. We found actually timing participant testing with a stopwatch proved difficult in practice and that this was inaccurate. Outcome data was therefore obtained by independent and blinded dual review of trial video recordings using a specific data extraction protocol, which showed excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.9997). We intend to utilise a similar procedure in the planned trial with several notable differences. In our previous trial, we carefully prepared the fluid-filled syringes for the HCP participants and colour-coded them, which allowed us to determine the fluid administration time for each 300&#x02005;ml bolus by observing the administration site. In this trial, however, a different method is required as HCPs will be preparing the syringes themselves, resulting in variable volume and no colour coding of the syringes. To determine the fluid volume administered (and resulting rates), we will therefore need to film the graduated cylinder in which the fluid administered to the model will be collected.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Blinding</title><p>The investigators will be blinded to the randomisation schedule. It will not be possible to blind the investigators to the allocation of participants. The research assistants involved in extracting outcome data from the trial video recordings will not be otherwise involved in the study and will be blinded to its purpose. It will, however, be obvious from the video-recordings which technique the provider is performing. Participants will be blinded to the amount of fluid being collected in the graduated cylinder as an indicator of how much fluid has been administered to the model. We plan to shield from view of the participant the graduated cylinder in which the administered fluid is being collected.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s3j1"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome is a comparison of the overall fluid infusion rates achieved by the two studied techniques. This will be calculated from total volume (determined by research assistant at completion of intervention) and time data collected by the blinded assessors from the video recordings of each trial.

This equates to a difference in fluid administration rate of approximately 0.2&#x02005;ml/s and would require 12 participants with paired data to achieve 80% power. Accounting for the possibility of participant dropouts or other unanticipated issues, we conservatively plan to enrol 16 HCPs in total. If all 16 HCPs complete testing, this would yield a power level of 90% based on the calculations of our statistician co-investigators. We believe that it is reasonable to power our sample size calculation at the 90% level, knowing that if we experience any dropouts that we will retain (in all likelihood) a minimum of 80% power.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval for the conduct of this study was obtained from the Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board 23 October 2012 (Project no. 12&#x02013;358), and all procedures will be conducted in accordance with the Tri-council Policy Statement: Ethical conduct for research involving humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> All participants will undergo a process of informed consent, and will be made aware that participation is strictly voluntary.
