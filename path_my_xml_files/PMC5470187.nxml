Rhythm-centred music making (RMM) has been shown to improve physical, psychological and social health. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of RMM on quality of life, depressive mood, sleep quality and social isolation in the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised controlled trial with cross over was conducted. 54 participants were recruited with 27 participants in each arm. In phase 1, group A underwent the intervention with group B as the control. In phase 2, group B underwent the intervention with group A as the control. The intervention involved 10 weekly RMM sessions. Patient related outcome data which included European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) scores were collected before the intervention, at 11th and at the 22nd week.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 participants were analyzed at the end of the study. The mean age was 74.65&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.40&#x000a0;years. In analysing the change in patient related outcome variables as a continuous measure, participation in RMM resulted in a non-significant reduction in EQ5D by 0.004 (95% CI: -0.097,0.105), GDS score by 0.479 (95% CI:-0.329,1.287), PSQI score by 0.929 (95% CI:- 0.523,2.381) and an improvement in LSNS by 1.125 (95% CI:-2.381,0.523). In binary analysis, participation in RMM resulted in a 37% (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.370, 95% CI: 0.355,5.290), 55.3% (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.553, 95% CI: 0.438,5.501), 124.1% (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.241, 95% CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.677,7.419) and 14.5% (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.145, 95% CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.331,3.963) non-significant increase in odds of improvement in EQ5D, GDS, PSQI and LSNS scores respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Participation in RMM did not show any statistically significant difference in the quality of life of the participants. It is however, an interesting alternative tool to use in the field of integrative medicine. Moving forward, a larger study could be performed to investigate the effects of RMM on the elderly with an inclusion of a qualitative component to evaluate effects of RMM&#x000a0;that were not captured by quantitative indicators.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was retrospectively registered.

Since 1949, the World Health Organization has defined health as &#x0201c;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease and infirmity&#x0201d;. With people living longer than before, the concept of quality of life, which comprises of objective descriptors and subjective evaluations of physical, material, social, and emotional wellbeing together with the extent of personal development and purposeful activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], has become an important aspect in the measurement of the health of an individual and it has been recognized as an important health outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The self-assessed health status is also a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Integrative medicine is an emerging field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that has been defined as &#x0201c;patient-centred, healing oriented, and embracing conventional and complementary therapies&#x0201d; with a focus on the person as a whole, including one&#x02019;s lifestyle, not just the physical body itself. It addresses the importance of nonphysical influences like emotional, spiritual and social health on physical health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and it has been shown to be helpful in improving care for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Depression and sleep duration has been found to have effects on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Depression is a common mood disorder among the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which has been listed as one of the top ten causes of disability burden (in years of life lost to disability) in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is known that sleep and its characteristics have various effects on the physiology of the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and that having adequate sleep and good sleep quality is an important part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Rhythm-centred music making (RMM), defined as the active playing of drums and various other percussion instruments, has been found to have benefits in areas of emotional, psychological and social outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with improvements in mood, reduction in anxiety, stress relief and relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

This therapeutic experience through music making empowers the individual and allows them to take the intervention into their own hands. On top of the effects on emotional, psychological and social outcomes, it has also been shown by one study that drumming could lower blood pressure post-intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], postulating the possibility of it bringing about improvements in the physical health of the elderly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The active playing of rhythmic music using various percussion instruments, including drumming, is a type of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] whereby the effects on the elderly has yet to be adequately explored. The purpose of this study was to explore the benefits that RMM has on the quality of life of the elderly. The effects of RMM on depressive symptoms, sleep quality and social isolation in the elderly were also studied as secondary outcomes. With the results from this study, RMM could be used as a possible tool for clinicians in the field of Integrative Medicine.

The strengths of the study include a crossover study design that provided a control for each intervention arm through randomization and the generalized linear models using GEE to account for phase, order and baseline patient outcome effects.</p><p>It is noted from Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> that the baseline patient related outcome variables for both groups were significantly different when comparing EQ5D and LSNS. Thus, an adjusted analysis was performed with the results reflected in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.</p><p>The effects of RMM on EQ5D scores as a primary outcome showed a non-significant decrease in quality of life in the continuous analysis and a non-significant increase in odds of improvement in EQ5D scores. In studying the effects of RMM on GDS, PSQI and LSNS scores as secondary outcome measures after correction for baseline patient related outcome variables, results showed a general trend of increasing the probability of improvement in depressive mood, sleep quality and social isolation with participation in RMM even though it was not statistically significant for both continuous and binary analysis. The effects of RMM on the psychological health of participants with improvements in anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], stress, anger and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] has been shown in various other studies as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Even though the scores for EQ5D as the primary outcome measure were not significantly different post-intervention, the RMM sessions were well-received by the majority of the participants of the intervention group. RMM could be a new activity adopted by various communities and nursing homes to engage the elderly as a form of recreational activity with benefits on the health of an individual. It could also be a possible non-pharmacological therapy in the field of Integrative Medicine where the focus is not only on the physical health but also on treating the patient whole including their lifestyle as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The participants of this study were from a population of community living elderly in Singapore. Hence, the results of the study could be applicable to the elderly population locally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p>Results from the study showed possible improvements in depressive mood, sleep quality and social isolation in individuals but due to limited statistical power from a small sample size as this is a pilot study, the changes were not statistically significant. Also, as it is difficult to comprehensively quantify the benefits of RMM on the individual participants, a qualitative study could be conducted in the future to objectively study the effects of RMM that were not captured by the patient-related outcome measures in this study. However, this quantitative study provides the ground work for future exploration of the&#x000a0;impact of this intervention on quality of life, sleep quality, depression and social isolation. With regards to future studies conducted on RMM, if a cross over study design was to be chosen, a suitable duration for a washout period could be incorporated to take into account a carryover effect from the intervention. A randomized controlled trial design without crossover could be considered as it is difficult to quantify a sufficient washout period and the intervention may result in a learned effect unlike drugs, resulting in an incomplete washout.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Participation in RMM did not show any statistically significant difference in the quality of life of participants. It is however, an interesting alternative tool to use in the field of integrative medicine and moving outside the field of medicine, it could be a new form of recreational activity adopted by the elderly in the community as well as in nursing homes. Moving forward, a larger study could be performed to investigate the effects of RMM on the elderly with an inclusion of a qualitative component to evaluate effects that were not captured by quantitative indicators.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional file</title><p>
