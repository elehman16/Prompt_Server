Background</title><p>During anesthesia, continuous body temperature monitoring is essential, because of the most common risk of perioperative hypothermia, caused by inhibition of thermoregulation during anesthesia, as well as patients&#x02019; exposure to a cool environment. Monitoring is also required to detect malignant hyperthermia (<xref rid="A31046R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="A31046R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). General anesthesia causes a shunt to move from core to peripheral level and this decreases the difference between core and peripheral temperatures. Such a difference remains constant, after reaching the anesthetic steady condition, which lasts for around 10 - 15 min from the start of anesthesia (<xref rid="A31046R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Anesthetic-induced impairment of normal thermoregulatory control and the resulting core-to-peripheral redistribution of body heat represent the primary cause of hypothermia, in most patients (<xref rid="A31046R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hypothermia, in children, is defined as a lower than 36&#x000b0;C core body temperature (<xref rid="A31046R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which results in increased morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="A31046R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Risk of hypothermia increases with general anesthesia, leading to severe symptoms, in children. During hypothermia, the basal metabolism of the body decreases by up to 30% (<xref rid="A31046R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), while vasoconstriction of the skin is impaired (<xref rid="A31046R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The combination of increased sweating thresholds and reduced vasoconstriction increases the inter threshold range ten-fold, from its normal value of 0.2 - 0.4&#x000b0;C to approximately 2 - 4&#x000b0;C. Temperatures, within this range, do not trigger thermoregulatory defense mechanisms. Therefore, by definition, patients are poikilothermic within this temperature range (<xref rid="A31046R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Surgery can also cause loss of body temperature by three to four times (<xref rid="A31046R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Hypothermia can occur in patients who undergo major surgeries, by up to 20%, which is also accompanied by various symptoms that can increase the clinical consequences of patients, especially high-risk patients (<xref rid="A31046R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These consequences include respiratory disorders (<xref rid="A31046R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), apnea (<xref rid="A31046R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), hypoxia, carbon dioxide retention, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, left shift of oxygenation curve, heart disorders, platelet dysfunction, dysfunction of coagulation enzymes, increased bleeding, increased transfusion requirements (<xref rid="A31046R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), increased lesion infection, change in drug metabolism (<xref rid="A31046R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and thermal discomfort (<xref rid="A31046R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A more severe loss of temperature, inability to generate heat inside the body and lack of thermoregulatory response, in children, make them more susceptible to hypothermia than adults (<xref rid="A31046R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, correct and continuous measurement of the core body temperature, during surgery, is very important for controlling temperature conditions in patients, especially children. Since measurement points of the core body temperature (e.g. tympanic membrane, pulmonary artery, distal esophagus and nasopharynx) are not easily accessible, near core sites are used. These include the mouth, axilla, bladder, skin surface, and rectum (<xref rid="A31046R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Measuring temperature in rectum, as a method of measuring the core body temperature, has remained unchallenged for a century (<xref rid="A31046R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although it has also been considered a golden standard for the routine determination of body temperature, this method is a frightening method for children and may cause psychological consequences, in older children. Furthermore, this method can cause discomfort and pain for patients with infection or pre-rectal mobility. The rectum is an unsanitary region with high contamination risk (<xref rid="A31046R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Also, this method could be related to the transmission of HIV (<xref rid="A31046R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Rectal and tympanic temperatures were not representative of cardiac temperature, whereas esophageal temperature was representative of cardiac temperature (<xref rid="A31046R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In short, considering rectum temperature measurement, as a golden standard for measuring the core body temperature, is questionable (<xref rid="A31046R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Continuous measurement of skin temperature is also a safe method. Skin temperature is lower than the body temperature. Axiliary temperatures, as well as those measured on the forehead (<xref rid="A31046R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), foot, and upper part of the abdomen (<xref rid="A31046R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), in infants, are considerably different from the core body temperature. If the temperature difference between the core body temperature and skin temperature is measured, a correction factor can be used to estimate the core body temperature in infants (<xref rid="A31046R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec134594"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to measure skin temperature over the carotid artery and compare it with rectum temperature, to propose a model for the accurate estimation of near core body temperature in children. The secondary aim of the study was the determination of skin temperature over the carotid artery and its comparison with the rectum temperature, according to age, type of operation and duration of operation, in children.</p></sec><sec id="sec134597"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec134595"><title>3.1. Sample Size</title><p>After having the study approved by local ethic committee, 124 patients within the age range of 2 - 6 years old, admitted to Children&#x02019;s Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, for the purpose of surgery, were selected. All patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II and were scheduled to undergo standardized general anesthesia. Patients with any medical condition precluding the placement of any temperature probe, or any neurological conditions affecting thermoregulatory functions (e.g. cerebral palsy) were excluded.</p><p>After installing the monitoring equipment, 1 &#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl was administered, as the pre-medication. The anesthetics were administered initially by face mask application, in incremental doses to deliver maximum inspired concentrations of 8% - 7% sevoflurane. Then, tracheal intubation was performed. Anesthesia was continued by isoflurane anesthetic inhalation and oxygen. The respiratory system was set in the manner that carbon dioxide blood (CO<sub>2</sub>) was equal to 35 - 45 mmHg, at the end of the exhalation. The flow rate of fresh gas was set at three litters per minute. Intravenous &#x0fb02;uids were at room temperature and the prescribed ringer serum followed the 4/2/1 rule. First, we inserted the rectal probe and then, the orthopedists or urologists and their colleagues sterilized the operation site. The rectal probe was connected to the monitoring system continuously, during the operations, and we monitored the patients&#x02019; temperature constantly. However, we only recorded its average every 10 minutes. All the data were measured and recorded under steady anesthetic conditions. Temperature of the operating room was constantly set at 23 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C, by a central thermostat. The patients&#x02019; clothing, during the operation, was the conventional disposable operating room clothing. Required actions were taken in case of observing hyperthermia or hypothermia. In order to measure the temperature, one probe was placed inside the rectum and the other was installed on the skin surface, above the point with maximum carotid artery pulse. Since general anesthesia distributed core body heat toward the periphery and reduced core temperature, we measured these temperature differences, upon reaching an anesthetic steady state. The temperature differences, upon reaching an anesthetic steady state, have been calculated as mean &#x0201c;three&#x0201d; (two - four) centigrade differences. The patients reached the anesthetic steady state in 30 minutes and we started documenting the temperatures from the 30<sup>th</sup> minute. The temperatures of rectum and skin over the carotid artery were measured and recorded, every 10 min. The thermometers, Temperature Channel 2 Probe Type YSI 400 (Pooyandegan Rah Saadat Co. Ltd., Tehran, Iran) had the following characteristics: compatible range 0 - 50&#x000b0;C, accuracy &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C, alarm sources error messages. Then, the patients were randomly divided into two groups (each including 62 subjects), namely modeling (MG) and validation groups (VG).</p></sec><sec id="sec134596"><title>3.2.

Discussion</title><p>The present study showed that skin temperature over the carotid artery can be used as a non-invasive method for estimating rectum temperature, which accurately reflects near core temperature, among infants and children undergoing elective surgery with general anesthesia. One advantage of measuring temperature via skin is that this method makes continuous evaluation of the body temperature possible and provides core body temperature measurement much safer than other invasive methods. In the present study, no patient experienced any kind of skin damage. Measuring rectum temperature is not a desirable method for nurses and parents, and many hospitals have discarded this method. This is a cultural reluctance, which especially exists in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand (<xref rid="A31046R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The skin over carotid artery is an appropriate criterion for the core body temperature, because of its proximity to a large artery (<xref rid="A31046R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the present study, it was shown that the method of measuring skin temperature over carotid artery had an acceptable accuracy, in terms of estimating rectum temperature. This method is completely safe and can be applied for patients on whom invasive methods cannot be used, due to cases with medical complexity.</p><p>It is necessary to use alternative methods for estimating core body temperature. Measuring body temperature of infants and children, via the skin over carotid artery, is a simple, accessible, safe and accurate method, which can predict near core body temperature, using a model, and can be practically used for anesthesia in infants and children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors of this article are indebted to the Research and Development Center of Sina Hospital,
