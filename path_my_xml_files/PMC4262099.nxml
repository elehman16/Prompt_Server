with diffuse and significant arterial plaque. This procedure, however, is not free
of postoperative complications, especially pulmonary and cognitive disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study aimed at comparing the impact of two different physiotherapy treatment
approaches on pulmonary and cognitive function of patients undergoing CABG.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Neuropsychological and pulmonary function tests were applied, prior to and
following CABG, to 39 patients randomized into two groups as follows: Group 1
(control) &#x02013; 20 patients underwent one physiotherapy session daily; and Group 2
(intensive physiotherapy) &#x02013; 19 patients underwent three physiotherapy sessions
daily during the recovery phase at the hospital. Non-paired and paired Student t
tests were used to compare continuous variables. Variables without normal
distribution were compared between groups by using Mann-Whitney test, and, within
the same group at different times, by using Wilcoxon test. The chi-square test
assessed differences of categorical variables. Statistical tests with a p value &#x02264;
0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Changes in pulmonary function were not significantly different between the groups.
However, while Group 2 patients showed no decline in their neurocognitive
function, Group 1 patients showed a decline in their cognitive functions (P &#x02264;
0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Those results highlight the importance of physiotherapy after CABG and support the
implementation of multiple sessions per day, providing patients with better
psychosocial conditions and less morbidity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Myocardial Revascularization / rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Postoperative Care</kwd><kwd>Physical Therapy Speciality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is effective to treat advanced coronary artery
disease (CAD), improving quality of life and prognosis of patients with that condition<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although CABG is the standard surgical option for CAD, the potential for postoperative
complications may interfere with patient recovery. The most frequently complications
are: pulmonary and/or cognitive function decline; infections; cardiac arrhythmias; acute
myocardial infarction; and acute renal failure<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> . Undoubtedly, pulmonary complications are the most frequent
findings<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The decrease in total lung capacity (TLC) and subdivisions [vital
capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV) and expiratory
reserve volume (ERV] following CABG may trigger complications<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This decrease
results from the monotonous pattern of shallow breaths without periodic maximal
insufflations due to respiratory drive depression caused by both anesthesia and the
surgical technique<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Other causes of morbidity in the postoperative period of CABG include neurological
complications, which affect up to 75% of the patients<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These complications are divided into three levels: 1)
cognitive changes (incidence ranging from 33% to 83%); 2) postoperative delirium
(incidence ranging from 10% to 30%); and 3) stroke (incidence ranging from 1% to 6%)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Affective and cognitive changes, described as changes in
intellectual and behavioral functions, have been defined as comprising the inability to
perform arithmetic functions, large mood swings, and explosive temper. Unfortunately,
these cognitive changes have not received considerable attention, but are part of the
patients&#x02019; complains as follows: &#x0201c;I am not the same after surgery&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t have the
same disposition&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p><p>The mechanisms of neurocognitive changes are still a matter of debate. Possible
hypotheses include cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral macro- and microembolism, and
secondary encephalic damage due to systemic inflammatory response<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.
Investigations exploring potential interventions to maintain normal cognitive function
are important, mainly when considering the negative impact of its moderate or minor loss
on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although physiotherapy is considered to improve post-CABG functional mobility, its
ability to prevent pulmonary and/or neurocognitive complications has not been
sufficiently investigated. In addition, the frequency of the physiotherapy treatment
approaches can differ, and there is no consensus on its ideal protocol. This study
assessed the impact of two different physiotherapy protocols on pulmonary and
neurocognitive functions of patients recently submitted to CABG<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a prospective study with patients randomized into two subgroups of different
physiotherapy treatment approaches, by use of a list made from a table of random
numbers. Control patients (Group 1) underwent physiotherapy only once a day in the
morning. The intensive physiotherapy group (Group 2) underwent the same treatment three
times a day: morning, afternoon and early evening. This study was performed at S&#x000e3;o Paulo
Hospital, in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, and at Santa Casa de Miseric&#x000f3;rdia of the city of
Santos, both in the state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. Approval of the local ethics committee
was obtained prior to study initiation, and all patients signed a written informed
consent.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited by the cardiac surgery team. The inclusion criterion was
to undergo CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The exclusion criteria were as
follows: emergency surgical indication for CABG; age &#x0003e;&#x000a0;74&#x000a0;years; left ventricular
ejection fraction &#x0003c; 30%; and cognitive deficits preventing the performance of
neurocognitive tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Clinical Evaluation</title><p>Postoperative complications were assessed via search in the patients&#x02019; medical records
by the same medical team and meeting standardized diagnostic criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary Function Evaluation</title><p>Pulmonary expiratory volumes and respiratory muscle strength were assessed during the
preoperative period, and on the third and sixth postoperative days. The last
evaluation was on the day of hospital discharge. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and
forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were determined with a
spirometer (Microquark, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). Maximal inspiratory and expiratory
pressures (MaxIP and MaxEP, respectively), which are indicators of respiratory muscle
strength, were assessed with a manovacuometer (Gerar&#x000ae;, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). All
procedures abided by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
Statement on respiratory muscle testing<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The pulmonary function results were interpreted by the first
author (ESC), who was blind to group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive Function Evaluation</title><p>The cognitive assessment, carried out in all patients, consisted of a battery of four
tests applied by a certified psychologist (RM) in the pre- (one day before surgery)
and postoperative (on the day of hospital discharge) periods. The tests included: the
Digit Span Subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; the Benton Revised Visual Retention Test<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>; the Trail Making Test<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; and the Digit Symbol Subtest of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Those tests focused on different cognitive aptitudes. Selective attention, ability
for alternating sequence, mental flexibility, and visual skill to search were
assessed by using the Trail Making Test. Short-term memory, visual skill and
attention were assessed by using the Digit Span Test. Recent memory and verbal
immediate recall were assessed by using the Digit Symbol Test, and visual motor
coordination speed, by using the Coding Test. Finally, visual memory, visual
discernment and visual motor skill were assessed by using the Benton Visual Test. All
these tests are acknowledged by the American Society of Neuropsychiatry<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>Patients were instructed about the tests before taking them to ensure their
understanding<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The psychologist interpreted the cognitive tests
blindly to group assignment<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiotherapy Protocol</title><p>On the first and second postoperative days, the patients remained at the
Postoperative Intensive Care Unit under the care of the cardiovascular surgery
physiotherapy team and following a specific postoperative protocol. The physiotherapy
protocol of this study was applied by co-authors ESC and CAC during length of stay in
cardiac ward on the third postoperative day. This day was chosen to avoid
interference with the medical staff of the intensive care unit.</p><p>The breathing exercises consisted of the following trainings with four sets of ten
repetitions: diaphragmatic breathing pattern; and ventilatory pattern inspiration in
2 times associated with elevation of the arms. This protocol is based on respiratory
kinesiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Variables were expressed as means, proportions, standard deviation and frequency,
according to their nature. Continuous variables with normal distribution were
compared intragroup (same group at different times) and intergroup (Group 1 versus
Group 2) by using paired and non-paired Student <italic>t</italic> tests,
respectively. Chi-square test was applied for categorical variables. For variables
without normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison between
different groups, and Wilcoxon test for intragroup analysis at different times.</p><p>Assuming a 5% alpha error and a 20% beta error, a sample of at least 18 patients in
each group was estimated to be necessary to detect a 30% difference between the
physiotherapy protocols evaluated. Statistical tests with p value &#x02264; 0.05 were
considered significant. The SPSS for Windows, version 11, was used for statistical
analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The sample consisted of 39 patients with mean age of 61.95 &#x000b1; 8.5 years, and 17 (43.6%)

complications may influence patient recovery. However, patient care during early
recovery does not only focus on complication and morbidity prevention, but is also aimed
at improving the patient&#x02019;s functional recovery.</p><p>In this study, CABG with CPB showed morbidity related to abnormalities of the
respiratory and neurocognitive functions. The oxygenation and artificial circulation
employed in that type of surgery, in addition to the procedure itself (sternotomy), are
likely culprits for those changes<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.
In this sample of patients, the motor and sensory stimulation delivered by physiotherapy
sessions three times a day improved the cognitive functions despite lack of additional
effect on the pulmonary functions.</p><p>Of the risk factors involved in neurocognitive dysfunction in the perioperative period,
three specifically stand out: age, educational level, and previous diseases.
Particularly important risk factors in the intraoperative period are as follows: embolus
formation; CPB time; air bubbles originating from the oxygenator; blood pressure level;
and the temperature elevation that may occur in the postoperative period<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>The mean CPB time of 95.05 minutes found in this study was not a risk factor for
complication per se. In medical literature, there is concern about time longer than
100&#x000a0;minutes<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In accordance with other studies, we found a
significant decrease in lung volume, lung capacities and respiratory muscle strength
(FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, MaxIP and MaxEP) during the postoperative period (third
postoperative day)<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In both groups,
all respiratory variables (FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, MaxIP and MaxEP) decreased, but without
statistical significance. These changes are due to an increase in the peak pressure of
airways and a decrease in lung compliance, indicating an elevation in respiratory system
resistance, which can be influenced by CPB, surgical incision, diaphragmatic
dysfunction, pain and immobilization in bed<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Most factors described emphasize the importance of
physiotherapy in this population. Less pain, better chest mobility and alveolar
ventilation are known to minimize the likelihood of postoperative complications, thus
leading to less morbidity<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. It is
also well-known that breathing exercises may attenuate the decline of respiratory
variables in the postoperative period of thoracic surgeries. Our findings indicate that
one daily physiotherapy session was sufficient to produce the desired pulmonary
improvements during the acute postoperative phase. Surprisingly, the group performing
more physiotherapy exercises had a significantly better restoration of neurocognitive
functions. Therefore, the increase in the frequency of physiotherapy sessions may reduce
postoperative morbidity related to neurocognitive dysfunction, which usually lasts days
and even months after heart surgery, impairing memory, concentration, language,
understanding, learning, speed of response and visual motor integration. It is worth
noting that such negative effects have been linked to the quality of life of patients
undergoing CABG<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We hypothesized
that the increase in physiotherapy frequency may result in a greater stimulation of the
sensory/motor system, providing a greater activation of afferent nerves to the
neurocognitive system and influencing a better patient outcome.</p><p>The major exclusion criterion for this study was age older than 74 years. Neurocognitive
function decline in the postoperative period (reported as up to 9%) is much more common
and expected above that age. The cohort assessed in this study had a mean age of 60
years, which has been related to a smaller effect on neurocognitive functions in the
postoperative period. When age was related to cognitive function, only the Digit Span
test, which assesses visual motor coordination speed, found different scores,
represented by a smaller one in Group 2<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this study, some results of cognitive impairment in patients undergoing CABG with CPB
differed from those reported in the medical literature. Most of the neurocognitive tests
performed showed increased or slightly decreased scores between the preoperative period
and hospital discharge in Group 2, which underwent much more intense and frequent
physiotherapy sessions.</p><p>Evaluation of selective attention and ability for alternating sequence, assessed by
using Trail Making Test, part A, in both groups showed a slight score increase between
the preoperative period and hospital discharge. However, in part B of the same test,
Group 2, unlike Group 1, increased its score between the preoperative period and
hospital discharge, suggesting that greater stimuli improved cognitive function. Similar
behavior occurred when the short-term memory and verbal immediate recall were evaluated
by using Digit Symbol Test: Group 1 showed a score decrease, while Group 2 showed a
score increase. When the speed of visual motor coordination and visual memory (Coding
and Benton Visual Tests) were analyzed, a decline in both groups was observed, being
bigger in Group 1 (p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>The medical literature has reported that mild neurocognitive abnormalities may occur
following cardiac surgery<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.
Surprisingly, some tests showed an increase in the scores of the group treated with
physiotherapy three times a day. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the
influence of physiotherapy on cognitive function. In our clinical practice, we have
observed that patients undergoing cardiac surgery evolve better in relation to both
pulmonary physiology and neurocognitive function when treated with more frequent
physiotherapy sessions, highlighting the dynamic interaction between body and mind. This
led us to plan this project in an attempt to verify whether this effect would actually
occur.</p><p>Sample size is the most important study limitation. But even with a not very large
number of patients and relatively simple physiotherapy protocol<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, our results confirm the hypothesis that
patients undergoing more physiotherapy sessions have a better cognitive restoration
until hospital discharge.</p><p>We suggest that the greater amount of physiotherapy during hospitalization would
increase the number of synapses in the cortical afferent system and improve neuronal
communication, resulting in the minimization or mitigation of neurocognitive disorders
caused by cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As shown in this study, CABG with CPB leads to alterations of pulmonary and
neurocognitive functions in the postoperative period that may hinder the patient&#x02019;s
clinical outcome. Respiratory therapy is a way to minimize the damage to lung function
in this population.</p><p>Surprisingly, neurocognitive functions showed increased scores in the group undergoing
more respiratory physiotherapy sessions per day, with enhanced perioperative levels,
suggesting that when patients are more stimulated, they have greater neurocognitive
development.</p><p>Studies correlating respiratory physiotherapy with neurocognitive function in the
postoperative period of cardiac surgery lack. Our results encourage further studies on
this theme. This new approach opens a new avenue of exploration, not only to the
possibility of decreasing the potential damage related to the neuropsychological sphere
secondary to cardiac surgery with CPB, but perhaps as a simple and practical strategy to
prevent or minimize such changes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and design of the research: Cavalcante ES, Conforti CA, Carvalho ACC,
