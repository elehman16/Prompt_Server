After a 2&#x02013;4 week run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using web-based randomly permuted blocks of four, to receive insulin via the day-and-night hybrid closed-loop system or usual pump therapy for 4 weeks, followed by a 2&#x02013;4 week washout period and then the other intervention for 4 weeks. Treatment interventions were unsupervised and done under free-living conditions. During the closed-loop period, a model-predictive control algorithm directed insulin delivery, and prandial insulin delivery was calculated with a standard bolus wizard. The primary outcome was the proportion of time when sensor glucose concentration was in target range (3&#x000b7;9&#x02013;10&#x000b7;0 mmol/L) over the 4 week study period. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Compared with usual pump therapy, closed-loop delivery also reduced the proportion of time spent in hypoglycaemia: the proportion of time with glucose concentration below 3&#x000b7;5 mmol/L was reduced by 65% (53&#x02013;74, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and below 2&#x000b7;8 mmol/L by 76% (59&#x02013;86, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).

In two randomised home studies in participants with mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> above 7&#x000b7;5% (58 mmol/mol), long-term (&#x0003e;4 week) use of closed-loop insulin delivery led to a significant decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and improvement in mean glucose and proportion of time spent within, below, and above the glucose target range (3&#x000b7;9&#x02013;10&#x000b7;0 mmol/L).

Beneficial effects on glycaemic outcomes included increased time with glucose concentration in target range, reduced time with glucose concentration below and above target range, and decreased mean glucose concentration and glycaemic variability. The findings of increased time in target range and reduced overall hypoglycaemia risks and sensor glucose variability were similarly observed and consistent during night-time and daytime periods of closed-loop use. These outcomes were achieved without change in total insulin delivered. Closed-loop application thereby provides a novel therapeutic approach to optimise glycaemic control in hypoglycaemia-prone adults with HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5%.

Compliance assessment after the run-in period was based on at least 10 days of CGM use in the past 2 weeks.</p><p>Participants then received insulin via the day-and-night closed-loop system (closed-loop period) for 4 weeks and via usual pump therapy with blinded CGM (control period) for 4 weeks, in the order assigned at randomisation, with a 2&#x02013;4 week washout period in between. During the washout period, participants returned to their usual care and did not use the study CGM device. Identical study insulin pumps and CGM devices were used during the two treatment periods. Participants used rapid-acting insulin analogue normally applied in their usual clinical care. The built-in bolus wizard of the study insulin pump was used by participants during both treatment periods to calculate insulin boluses at mealtimes and when administering correction boluses. The study was done under free-living conditions without direct or remote supervision by clinical investigators. Participants were not restricted in their dietary intake or daily activities. Support was available at all times to assist participants in case of clinical or technical issues that arose during the study. Standard local hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia treatment guidelines were followed.</p><p>The FlorenceD2A closed-loop system (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) comprised a model-predictive control algorithm on a smartphone (Galaxy S4, Samsung, South Korea), which communicated wirelessly with a purpose-made translator unit (Triteq, Hungerford, UK) and the study pump (DANA-R Diabecare, Sooil, Seoul, South Korea) through a Bluetooth communication protocol (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The CGM receiver (FreeStyle Navigator II, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA) was inserted into the translator, which translated a serial USB protocol into a Bluetooth communication protocol. The calculations used a compartment model of glucose kinetics<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> describing the effect of rapid-acting insulin and the carbohydrate content of meals on glucose levels. We applied a hybrid closed-loop approach in which participants were required to count carbohydrates and use a standard bolus calculator for pre-meal boluses according to usual practice. The bolus calculations provided by the study pump's built-in bolus calculator took into account carbohydrate content of meals, insulin on board, and entered capillary blood glucose readings. The algorithm was initialised by pre-programmed basal insulin rates downloaded from the study pump. Participants' bodyweight and total daily insulin dose were entered at set-up. During closed-loop operation, the algorithm adapted itself to a particular participant. The treat-to-target control algorithm aimed to achieve glucose concentrations of 5&#x000b7;8&#x02013;7&#x000b7;3 mmol/L, and adjusted the actual concentration depending on fasting versus postprandial status and the accuracy of model-based glucose predictions. Control Algorithm version 0.3.46 was used (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) which, compared with that used in our previous study,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> included enhanced adaptation of insulin needs based on analysis of past performance and identification of the time of day when insulin needs are consistently lower or higher. Participants were trained to perform a calibration check before breakfast and evening meal. If sensor glucose was above capillary glucose by more than 3 mmol/L, participants were advised to recalibrate the CGM device. These instructions resulted from in-silico assessment of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia risks using the validated Cambridge simulator.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Safety rules limited maximum insulin infusion and suspended insulin delivery at sensor glucose at or less than 4&#x000b7;3 mmol/L, or when sensor glucose was rapidly decreasing.</p><p>During the control period, the display of the study CGM device was masked. Participants were allowed to use their own glucose monitoring devices (CGM or flash glucose monitoring<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>) if they were part of their pre-study usual care. The control intervention was chosen according to existing clinical practice and participants' preferences.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The rationale for the control period was to reflect usual clinical practice and national reimbursement policies, and to compare the incremental benefits gained by closed-loop insulin delivery with the therapeutic modality followed by the participants in a pragmatic study design.</p><p>At the start of the closed-loop period, participants were admitted to the local clinical research facility for a training session, which covered starting and stopping of the closed-loop system and troubleshooting of technical issues. If sensor glucose readings became unavailable, or in case of other system failures, participants were alerted by an audible alarm and the system restarted the participant's usual insulin delivery rate within 30&#x02013;60 min to mitigate the risk of insulin under-delivery and over-delivery.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Participants were instructed to have the low-glucose alarm audible at all times. The sensor glucose alarm threshold for hypoglycaemia was initially set at 3&#x000b7;5 mmol/L, but these settings could be later modified by the participants. A user feedback questionnaire was completed by participants at the end of the closed-loop period.</p><p>Blood samples for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and C-peptide measurements were taken after enrolment. Plasma C-peptide was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassays (Diasorin Liaison XL [Deutschland GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany] used in Cambridge; ADVIA Centaur [Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, USA] used in Graz).

Two participants withdrew during the run-in period because of issues associated with use of the study pump. 29 eligible participants (17 from Cambridge and 12 from Graz) were randomly assigned. One participant dropped out during the first closed-loop period because of dissatisfaction with study devices and glycaemic control.

Compared with the control period, day-and-night closed-loop insulin delivery reduced the proportion of time with glucose concentration below 3&#x000b7;9 mmol/L by 50% (37&#x02013;59, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), below 3&#x000b7;5 mmol/L by 65% (53&#x02013;74, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), below 3&#x000b7;3 mmol/L by 70% (57&#x02013;78, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), and below 2&#x000b7;8 mmol/L by 76% (59&#x02013;86, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), as well as the burden of hypoglycaemia (ie, area under the curve when sensor glucose concentration was less than 3&#x000b7;5 mmol/L) by 73% (59&#x02013;82, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Closed-loop insulin delivery also reduced the number of nights when glucose concentration was below 3&#x000b7;5 mmol/L for at least 20 min as well as the mean duration of such periods (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Compared with usual pump therapy, closed-loop insulin delivery reduced the proportion of time with glucose concentration above the target range (ie, &#x0003e;10 mmol/L) by 6&#x000b7;9 percentage points (3&#x000b7;5&#x02013;10&#x000b7;2, p=0&#x000b7;0003), above 13&#x000b7;9 mmol/L by 3&#x000b7;0 percentage points (1&#x000b7;6&#x02013;4&#x000b7;4, p=0&#x000b7;0002) and above 16&#x000b7;7 mmol/L by 1&#x000b7;2 percentage points (0&#x000b7;6&#x02013;1&#x000b7;9, p=0&#x000b7;0009; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).

Night-time use of closed-loop insulin delivery significantly increased the proportion of time with glucose concentration in target range by 17&#x000b7;2 percentage points (95% CI 12&#x000b7;0&#x02013;22&#x000b7;4, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), reduced mean glucose concentration by 0&#x000b7;4 mmol/L (0&#x000b7;1&#x02013;0&#x000b7;8, p=0&#x000b7;0211), and decreased the burden of hypoglycaemia by 89% (80&#x02013;94, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) compared with the control period. SD and between-night coefficient of variation of sensor glucose were significantly reduced by closed-loop insulin delivery (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Daytime use of closed-loop insulin delivery increased time spent with glucose concentration in the target range by 8&#x000b7;1 percentage points (95% CI 5&#x000b7;3&#x02013;11&#x000b7;0, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and reduced the burden of hypoglycaemia by 61% (14&#x02013;75, p=0&#x000b7;0001). Closed-loop insulin delivery significantly reduced the SD and between-day coefficient of variation of sensor glucose (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>), in line with measured outcomes of night-time glycaemic variability.</p><p>Overall mean absolute relative deviation of sensor glucose, using capillary glucose as the reference, was 15&#x000b7;3% (SD 18&#x000b7;2) and median absolute relative deviation was 10&#x000b7;1% (IQR 4&#x000b7;7&#x02013;19&#x000b7;3), on the basis of 8447 paired capillary-CGM values.

Day-and-night closed-loop delivery was used for 90% (95% CI 78&#x02013;89) of the closed-loop period. The user feedback questionnaire was fully completed by 26 participants, and four of the six questions were answered by all participants (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 27 (93%) of 29 participants were happy to have their glucose levels automatically controlled by the closed-loop system. 20 (69%) participants stated that they spent less time managing their diabetes while using the closed-loop system, but seven (24%) disagreed with this statement. 18 (62%) expressed fewer concerns about their glycaemic control while using the closed-loop system. 14 (48%) participants reported improved sleep during the closed-loop period. 23 (88%) of 26 participants reported feeling safe while using the closed-loop system, and 26 (96%) of 27 would recommend it to others.</p><p>No serious adverse events, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, or episodes of hyperglycaemia with ketosis were reported. Skin irritations related to sensor use occurred in four participants. Two participants had mild respiratory tract infections (one during the run-in period and one during the control period). One participant had cystitis during the closed-loop period and one reported allergic rhinoconjunctivitis during the control period.

Beneficial effects on glycaemic outcomes included increased time spent with glucose concentration in target range (3&#x000b7;9&#x02013;10&#x000b7;0 mmol/L), reduced time with glucose concentration above and below the target range, and decreased mean glucose concentration and glycaemic variability. The findings of increased time spent in the glucose concentration target range, reduced hypoglycaemia, and decreased glycaemic variability were similarly observed during night-time and daytime periods. These outcomes were achieved without change in total insulin delivery.</p><p>Hypoglycaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> A reduction of at least 30% in risk of hypoglycaemia, as observed in our study, is considered clinically relevant.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Threshold and predictive low-glucose suspend insulin delivery systems<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> cannot step-up insulin delivery and thus do not address the issue of hyperglycaemia. The advantage of a closed-loop system such as ours is the responsive, graduated modulation of insulin delivery, both below and above the pre-set pump regimen. This notion is supported by findings from our study, which showed that reduction in mean glucose concentration was accompanied by significant reduction in all the measured hypoglycaemia parameters. The multiplicity of beneficial outcomes&#x02014;including increased time with optimum glucose control (in target range) and reduced time below and above target range, which were consistently observed during both night-time and daytime periods&#x02014;suggests that the benefits of the closed-loop system can be accrued irrespective of the time of day in adults with HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5%. The control algorithm used in our study had enhanced adaptive features and coped safely with variations in insulin requirements, trading variability in insulin delivery for consistency in glucose concentrations. Several studies have shown that increased glycaemic variability is associated with the burden of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Glycaemic variability<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and hypoglycaemia<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> have both been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We hypothesise that the significant reductions in glucose variability and hypoglycaemia by closed-loop insulin delivery in our study might have implications for clinical outcomes, although this hypothesis will need confirmation by longer and larger studies.</p><p>Compared with previous unsupervised home-based studies,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> our study revealed new findings, specifically in relation to the improvements of CGM-derived hypoglycaemia parameters. Compared with Thabit and colleagues' study of closed-loop insulin delivery versus sensor-augmented pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes and HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 7&#x000b7;5% and 10&#x000b7;0% (58&#x02013;86 mmol/mol),<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> our study had more pronounced relative reductions in the proportion of time with glucose concentration below 3&#x000b7;9 mmol/L (19% <italic>vs</italic> 50%) and hypoglycaemia burden (39% <italic>vs</italic> 73%). These differences might have been attributable to the use of an enhanced adaptive control algorithm and tight glycaemic control at baseline in the present study (mean screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6&#x000b7;9% <italic>vs</italic> 8&#x000b7;5% in Thabit and colleagues' study<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>), as well as differences in the control therapies between the two studies. The proportion of time spent with glucose concentration below the target range (ie, 3&#x000b7;9 mmol/L) during usual pump therapy (5&#x000b7;3%, IQR 3&#x000b7;5&#x02013;10&#x000b7;0) was notably higher in our study than that in Thabit and colleagues' study (3&#x000b7;0%, 1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;6&#x000b7;1)<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> but still lower than that in a study in adults with a mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 6&#x000b7;7% (mean proportion of time spent with sensor glucose below target range 14% [SD 11]).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Another study<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> assessed the use of closed-loop insulin delivery during night time in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, using a control algorithm with a lower glucose setpoint to accommodate lower glucose targets (3&#x000b7;5&#x02013;7&#x000b7;8 mmol/L) for this group of patients. In this study,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> use of the closed-loop system increased the primary endpoint (time in target range overnight) by 15 percentage points compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. The difference between this study<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and ours is the overnight-only use of closed-loop in the former, and the difference in the comparator between the two studies (sensor-augmented pump therapy <italic>vs</italic> usual pump therapy). Comparability between both studies is also challenging because this specific group of women with type 1 diabetes is highly motivated, albeit over a short time period (ie, during pregnancy), and received intensive dietetic, education, and clinical support.</p><p>The additional benefit of closed-loop insulin delivery in individuals with well controlled type 1 diabetes (ie, HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7&#x000b7;5%) is the reduction of the residual risk of complications, hypoglycaemia, and glycaemic variability, as well as the burden of self-management. Reduction of hypoglycaemic burden has benefits such as improved quality of life and reduced societal cost.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Existing reimbursement criteria in several countries for CGM are still predominantly focused on HbA<sub>1c</sub> and might exclude patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5% because of the dearth of evidence showing efficacy. However, results from our study show efficacy in terms of both improved glycaemic control and reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. Thus, reimbursement of closed-loop technology in patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5% could be considered justifiable.</p><p>The reduction in hypoglycaemic burden in our study was almost identical to that in Russell and colleagues' study,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> which compared 5 day use of a bihormonal (insulin and glucagon) closed-loop system with usual pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants in Russell and colleagues' study had a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7&#x000b7;1% (SD 0&#x000b7;8), and lower mean glucose concentration and risk of hypoglycaemia during the closed-loop period than during usual pump therapy. The study was done under direct supervision during the closed-loop period but not during the control period. The incremental reduction in hypoglycaemia achieved by bihormonal versus single-hormone closed-loop systems needs to be further assessed in longer, unsupervised, head-to-head, randomised studies to justify the increased complexity and cost. A single-hormone hybrid closed-loop system was approved in September, 2016, by the US Food and Drug Administration on the basis of results from a 3 month study<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> in adolescents and adults with mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7&#x000b7;4% (SD 0&#x000b7;9) at screening. However, this study was non-randomised and did not have a control group, and the length of study periods was not matched (2 week run-in phase, which was used as baseline comparator for a 3 month intervention).</p><p>Results from participants' feedback indicate a high level of trust in the closed-loop system autonomously modulating their glucose concentrations, with the majority agreeing that the time spent on management of diabetes was reduced during the closed-loop period. However, seven (24%) of 29 participants disagreed with this statement, reflecting that user input is still needed for a hybrid closed-loop system. CGM alarms and connectivity issues, especially at night, might have negatively affected participants' experience of the closed-loop system. One participant withdrew from the study because of recurrent technical issues related to the closed-loop system. However, an overall positive endorsement of the closed-loop system was observed, since most participants were willing to recommend the closed-loop system to others.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the randomised, two-centre, two-country, crossover design. So far, none of the home-based studies of closed-loop insulin delivery have focused specifically on patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5% who might be early adopters of closed-loop technologies striving to further improve control of their diabetes. We did not use remote monitoring or direct supervision, so as to adhere to real-world conditions. Additionally, we did not restrict the participants' dietary habits, activity level, and geographical movements. However, we acknowledge that our study has several limitations. The relatively short study duration might have been insufficient to assess long-term compliance. We excluded participants with hypoglycaemia unawareness, therefore restricting assessment of the closed-loop system in those who might benefit greatly. The prototype nature of the closed-loop system and the number of devices might have increased the participants' device burden and negatively affected some aspects of user feedback. The heterogeneity of sensor use in the control period might have confounded the reported glycaemic outcomes. However, the individualised therapy approaches used in the control period reflect present clinical strategies adopted by this population to achieve their baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and do not diminish the incremental effects of closed-loop use.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>To conclude, day-and-night closed-loop insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes and HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7&#x000b7;5% significantly improved glycaemic control while reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Thus, in adults who are actively engaged with self-management, closed-loop insulin delivery might provide additional benefits, justifying its use in this particular population. The overall positive feedback from participants reflected the acceptance of closed-loop technology during daily diabetes management, albeit with some limitations to its use, which might affect user adherence and experience. Larger and longer studies are needed to validate our findings.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
