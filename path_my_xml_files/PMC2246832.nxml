Pre-menopausal patients received ovarian irradiation (O) and post-menopausal tamoxifen 10 mg bd (T). Patients were randomised to receive either no additional treatment or prednisolone 5 mg bd (P). Similar results were observed in each menstrual subgroup. In 194 evaluable patients, the response to PET + P was 49% and to PET alone 30% (P less than 0.01). P increased the median duration of response from 9 to 14 months (P less than 0.002) and the median time to disease progression from 5 to 9 months (P less than 0.001). Response to P after O or T alone occurred in only 2/62 (3%). Median survival in patients randomised to receive P at the outset of PET was prolonged by 4 months (P less than 0.05). The addition of P significantly improves the response to O or T in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00133-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="626" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00133-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="627" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00133-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="628" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00133-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="629" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00133-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="630" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
