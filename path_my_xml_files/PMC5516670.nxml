Patients having or suspected of having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were included in this study. The exclusion criterion was severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate, &#x0003c;30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). No patients were excluded from this study. There were 2 patients who were scanned with both the bolus-tracking method and the test-bolus method.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI Protocol</title><p>All patients underwent dynamic, ultrafast, T1-weighted, 3-dimensional (3D) turbo-gradient-echo (GRE) sequence with fat suppression (mDixon-3D-GRE sequence) on a 3-T scanner (Ingenia; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) and were injected with 0.025 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg) of Gd-EOB-DTPA at a rate of 2 mL/s, followed by injection of 20 mL saline at 2 mL/s using a power injector. The patients held their breath in end expiration. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> describes the sequences and parameters of mDixon-3D-GRE sequence with the bolus-tracking and test-bolus protocols.

First, real-time bolus monitoring was concurrent with contrast administration. Second, the radiology technologist stopped bolus tracking when contrast was visualized in the abdominal aorta at the level of the celiac axis (diaphragm). Third, patients held their breath. Fourth, breath-hold 3D-GRE sequence was acquired. Real-time bolus-track imaging was implemented using a 2-dimensional GRE sequence, with acquisitions every 0.939 second and on-the-fly image reconstruction (FOV, 500 &#x000d7; 500 mm; matrix, 256 &#x000d7; 128; TR/TE/flip angle, 7.3/3.1 milliseconds/40 degrees; slice thickness, 80 mm). The sequence was oriented in the coronal plane, along the abdominal aorta, and initiated at the same time as contrast administration. Real-time images were displayed on the console using an inline viewer. A manual pause of 6 to 7 seconds was implemented after cessation of the bolus-tracking sequence, during which breath-holding instructions were given to the patient before initiating 3D-GRE sequence. The duration of the pause was optimized based on the results of perfusion data acquired in this study and the approximate center of the k-space within the 3D-GRE technique. Arterial-phase images were obtained using a 3D-GRE imaging sequence with a segmented k-space acquisition. The estimated time to the center of k-space was 4.6 seconds, ensuring the initial part of the scan effectively coincides with the collection of the desired image contrast. Both protocols acquired k-space data linearly over many segments.</p><p>The test-bolus consisted of 0.125 mmol (0.5 mL) Gd-EOB-DTPA followed by the injection of 50 mL saline at 2 mL/s. Images were acquired in the transverse plane, with a TR/TE ratio of 3.50/TE1, 1.26; TE2, 2.20. The flip angle was 15 degrees, the number of acquisitions was 1, the FOV was 350 &#x000d7; 278 mm, and the matrix was 232 &#x000d7; 139.

Operator-defined regions of interest were measured on the HAP. The mean signal intensity of the normal hepatic parenchyma of the left and right lobes at the level of the root of the celiac trunk was obtained from 2 circular areas of diameter approximately 20 mm, avoiding tumors, large vessels, dilated biliary ducts, and prominent artifacts. If a patient had previously undergone a lobectomy of the liver, the mean signal intensity was measured by 2 circular areas of the remaining liver. The mean signal intensity of the spleen of the upper and lower poles was obtained from 2 circular areas of diameter approximately 10 mm avoiding large vessels and prominent artifacts. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the liver and spleen were calculated by dividing image noise. Image noise was measured in the SD of air outside the patient&#x02019;s body avoiding phase artifacts.</p><p>We also performed post hoc power (1 &#x02212; &#x003b2;) analysis between the groups using standardized mean differences and sample size and &#x003b1; (1-tailed) level of 0.05 with G*Power software (version 3.1.3; Faul and Erdfelder, University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) in quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative Analysis</title><p>Scan timing and image quality, including the degree of artifacts, were evaluated qualitatively by 2 independent readers, who had 5 and 8 years of experience, respectively, with abdominal MRI.

Images with scores of 3 and 4 were defined as optimal, and the frequency of optimal HAP images was compared for the 2 protocols. Second, the degree of ringing and motion artifacts on HAP images were evaluated using a 4-point scale (excellent, good, poor, and nondiagnostic) to grade image quality. On this scale, 4 (excellent) was defined as absence of artifacts, 3 (good) as a slight ringing or motion artifact that did not interfere with the diagnosis, 2 (poor) as an artifact interfering with the diagnosis, and 1 (nondiagnostic) as an obvious artifact rendering image assessment almost impossible. By definition, ringing artifacts are centered on the vessels and confined to the abdomen, whereas respiratory motion artifacts are centered on the abdominal wall and can extend outside it.</p><p>Examples of these artifacts are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Hepatic arterial phase images obtained with the bolus-tracking protocol tend to be suboptimal, because breath hold and scanning were started manually only after abdominal aortic enhancement was ascertained. As the delays in breath hold and peak contrast enhancement of the liver vary, scanning at optimal HAP time may not be possible. The bolus-tracking method is simpler and faster to perform than the test-bolus method.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the delay in optimal HAP scan timing may be critical for dynamic MRI; because the total amount of Gd-EOB is much smaller than that of Gd. The smaller amount of contrast medium reduces the peak contrast enhancement by Gd-EOB-DTPA, as well as the time to peak contrast enhancement, resulting in more accurate peak contrast enhancement timing than with Gd-DTPA. Thus, in this study, the test-bolus protocol was more suited for dynamic MRI than the bolus-tracking protocol.</p><p>Our study also suggested that the test-bolus method can yield higher SNR images compared with bolus-tracking method. The reason might be that test-bolus method can scan at more optimal timing at HAP compared with bolus-tracking method. At optimal timing, HAP and high-concentration gadolinium chelates produced a significantly increased maximum signal change and resulted in an improved SNR.</p><p>In addition, our study suggested that the test-bolus technique reduces the degree of ringing and motion artifacts during imaging compared with the bolus-tracking method. Preserving the homogeneity of k-space data acquisition and reducing truncation and ringing artifacts are critical for dynamic MRI.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Ringing artifacts are derived truncation artifacts in a narrow sense and include phase ghosts from organs and blood vessels. The center of k-space contains the low spatial frequencies and contrast information of each image. A marked alteration in gadolinium concentration around the center of k-space during acquisition in arterial phase produces ringing artifacts.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These phenomena are dependent on scan timing and the injection method.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The lower number of artifacts observed using the test-bolus protocol may be due to the ability of this protocol to provide a more exact time of peak enhancement than the bolus-tracking protocol.</p><p>Moreover, we supposed that the respiratory motion artifact in test-bolus protocol might be less than that in bolus-tracking protocol. The radiology technologist can expect the starting breath-holding time is more accurate in test-bolus protocol than that in bolus-tracking protocol. Therefore, breath-holding time might be less in test-bolus protocol than that in bolus-tracking protocol. The shortening of breath-holding time is important to scan optimal HAP image without breath motion artifact. The reason was that the radiology technologist can get the time density curve by test contrast injection. Therefore, the motion artifact in test-bolus protocol was less than that in bolus-tracking protocol in this study. Indeed, previous report suggested that the use of single-breath-hold, multiple-arterial-phase acquisition technique can yield inconspicuous motion artifact HAP images by shortening acquisition time and breath-holding time during single acquisition time.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>This study had several limitations. First, this study with an insufficient sample size did not have sufficient statistical power to verify our end points. Although confirmation requires evaluation of more patients, this is offset by our results showing that patients benefit from the test-bolus protocol. Second, between-group differences in some factors, such as cardiovascular function, body habitus, and body fat and the presence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension or fatty liver, may have influenced the study results.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Third, we did not compare these 2 methods in the diagnosis of HCC, indicating the need for additional studies to determine which, if any, technique is superior in the diagnosis of HCC. Fourth, although respiratory motions have been reported to be more responsible for the truncation artifacts in arterial phase in Gd-EOB-DTPA&#x02013;enhanced MRI than in Gd-DTPA&#x02013;enhanced MRI,<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> this study did not evaluate the effects of respiratory motion artifacts in the arterial phase. Lastly, we did not use the lower injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA technique (1 mL/s). Previous study suggested that the lower injection technique was better to scan optimal HAP timing compared with the conventional injection technique (2 mL/s). In addition, we did not compare with multiphase imaging in this study. Previous report suggested that triple arterial acquisition method can yield optimal HAP timing images more frequently than fixed time method.<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Therefore, we would compare test-bolus protocol, bolus-tracking protocol, fixed time method, and multiphase imaging method in artifact and frequency of optimal timing of HAP using lower injection technique in a future study. Lastly, the small amount of contrast in test bolus might affect the image quality. However, the contrast of test bolus is too small to affect the image quality in the arterial phase, because the test bolus has been greatly diluted in the extracellular fluid volume.</p><p>In conclusion, compared with the bolus-tracking protocol, the test-bolus protocol in Gd-EOB-DTPA&#x02013;enhanced 3-T MRI can yield better qualitative image quality and more optimal timing of HAP, as well as reducing the degree of artifacts.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Earls</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Rofsky</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name><name><surname>DeCorato</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
