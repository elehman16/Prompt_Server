The primary outcome was daily vegetables servings, measured by an adapted Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 8 weeks post-randomization. Daily vegetable servings from 24-hour dietary recalls, administered by trained, certified, and blinded interviewers 5 weeks post-randomization, was included as a secondary outcome.

It has been suggested that these protective effects are greater for vegetables than for fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and follow a dose-response relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with benefits seen in up to 7+ servings daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, despite current United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommendations to consume 5&#x02013;6 servings of vegetables per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], United States (U.S.) adults consume an average of just 1.7 (SE&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) servings of vegetables (excluding fried potatoes) each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Behavioral interventions to increase vegetable and fruit consumption have led to modest increases in daily intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but typical face-to-face approaches often cannot be realistically implemented at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], particularly given the high cost of most current strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (e.g., time demands, the need for trained staff, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Mobile applications (apps) present a promising means for delivering scalable behavioral interventions due to their increasing ubiquity, ability to reach individuals at nearly any time or place, and potential to deliver timely feedback, personalization, and interactivity to maximize intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The availability of health-promoting mobile apps has dramatically increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, most mobile health apps have yet to undergo evaluation in randomized trials or incorporate theory-based strategies known to drive changes in health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Among published mobile app trials, most are feasibility and pilot studies with small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Only one published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] sought to assess the efficacy of a stand-alone mobile app for increasing vegetable consumption, in which real-time goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback were tested among low-income racial/ethnic-minority girls; this pilot study showed non-significant small to moderate effects and called for larger-scale testing of similar programs. Thus, the existing evidence has yet to establish whether a mobile app can increase vegetable consumption. More broadly, investigators have called for both theory-informed development and rigorous evaluation of mobile-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] using larger sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">A recent pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] we conducted demonstrated preliminary evidence of the efficacy of Vegethon, a stand-alone, theory-based mobile app, in increasing vegetable consumption among overweight adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While many public health interventions focus on anticipated long-term health benefits (e.g., reduced risk of cardiovascular disease) to motivate behavior change, Vegethon focuses on making the process of behavior change itself (e.g., increasing vegetable consumption) intrinsically rewarding, through the use of <italic>process motivators</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] such as fun, surprise, choice, control, and competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This approach has been introduced as a more effective strategy for designing public health interventions to motivate behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The present study aimed to rigorously assess the efficacy of the Vegethon mobile app among a larger sample of overweight adults attempting weight loss maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par14">A randomized controlled study design was used, with a 1:1 allocation ratio of intervention to wait-listed control (8-week delay). The study was conducted at a single research site in Stanford, California.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study sample</title><p id="Par15">Participants were overweight adults, recruited in two cohorts from an ongoing 12-month weight-loss trial based at Stanford University (parent trial), in which individuals were 18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years of age, had baseline body mass index (BMI) of 28&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were non-diabetic and non-hypertensive, had no cancer or heart, renal, or liver disease, and lived in the geographic area surrounding Stanford. We chose to design and test Vegethon among participants in a weight loss trial because they had already demonstrated motivation to alter their eating behaviors and because the parent trial provided a resource-efficient way of testing an innovative mobile intervention in the setting of a weight loss program. The added eligibility criterion for cohort 1 was ownership of an iPhone and for cohort 2 was ownership of an iPhone or Android phone (as the app became available on Android during the course of the study). This study was implemented during months 5&#x02013;7 (i.e., the weight loss maintenance phase) of the 12-month parent trial. Parent trial participants were randomized to either a low-fat or a low-carbohydrate diet for 12&#x000a0;months and attended 22 evening classes led by a health educator, in which they were taught how to adhere to their assigned diets. Both parent trial treatment groups were encouraged to eat whole, unprocessed foods and to increase their vegetable intakes in their daily diets. Parent trial participants who chose to concurrently participate in the present study were newly randomized to receive the mobile app or to be placed on a wait-listed control condition. As a result, any potential effects of the parent trial interventions on vegetable consumption were randomly distributed across both intervention and control conditions in the present Vegethon study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par16">Randomization was performed by a researcher who had no contact with participants and used a random, computer-generated allocation sequence to assign participants prospectively to each condition. The allocation sequence was designed to ensure balance across mobile intervention assignment groups as well as cohorts, diet group, and health educator within the parent trial. Because the randomized parent trial was underway at the time of the present study, cohort, diet group, and health educator were treated as existing strata, within which participants were assigned to a mobile intervention through a balanced, randomized procedure, using blocks of size 4. This assignment procedure was preferable to simple randomization because it ensured balance in mobile intervention, cohort, diet group, and health educator at any given sample size of this trial. The allocation sequence was stored electronically and concealed from participants, staff, and researchers who had contact with participants. Enrollment and communication with participants was performed by a research assistant who did not play a role in randomization or data analysis. Study staff and researchers who performed data collection (i.e., dietary recall assessors) and analysis were blinded to condition assignment. While participants could not be blinded, they were not told their condition assignment (i.e., &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;control&#x0201d;) and were instead informed they would be assigned to use the app at parent trial month 5 or 7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedures</title><p id="Par17">During a pre-randomization orientation session, participants were instructed that the mobile app was intended to support them in increasing their vegetable consumption, and that it was ideally to be used for at least 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;min per day. Participants completing a baseline questionnaire were randomized. Those allocated to the intervention condition completed a short online tutorial that described the mobile app and its use. To prevent contamination among conditions, the app was not freely accessible via the App Store or Google Play and was made available to intervention participants through the distribution of single-use registration codes.</p><p id="Par18">The user-centered, theory-based development and final version of Vegethon were shaped by extensive formative research and the Vegethon pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Vegethon was a stand-alone mobile app that enabled goal-setting and self-monitoring of vegetable consumption. Participants set goals for daily quantity (i.e., servings) and variety (i.e., types) of their vegetable consumption and used the central app feature, <italic>Select Veggies</italic>, to tap on any of 30 different vegetable icons (e.g., spinach, beets) to swiftly record the types and servings of vegetables they consumed each day. Non-starchy vegetables with low energy density and high nutrient density were targeted to facilitate weight loss and weight maintenance while maximizing diet quality and nutrient adequacy in the context of the parent trial. Seven ongoing challenges were included that ranged from easy to difficult to perform (e.g., <italic>Breakfast Champ: Eat any vegetable before 11&#x000a0;am</italic>). A leaderboard engaged users in competition against &#x0201c;other Vegethoners&#x0201d; who were &#x0201c;most similar&#x0201d; to them. Just-in-time prompts to log vegetables before going to sleep were delivered most evenings at 9&#x000a0;p.m. through push notifications.</p><p id="Par19">Overall, the app focused on making the <italic>process</italic> of behavior change rewarding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (e.g., the fun of receiving a surprise vegetable challenge; the pride in surpassing a peer&#x02019;s vegetable score). This process motivation strategy stands in contrast to strategies focusing on the eventual outcomes of behavior change (e.g., avoidance of a heart attack) that are often too far in the future to motivate and sustain day-to-day behavior changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As Robinson has described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], this process motivation approach is grounded in Bandura&#x02019;s Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which specifies that behaviors are driven by the reciprocal interactions between personal, behavioral, and environmental influences. Vegethon was therefore designed to influence users&#x02019; thoughts and beliefs about eating vegetables, provide opportunities for feedback on their behaviors, and create a social environmental that promoted increasing vegetable intake. Vegethon aimed to maximize the four key processes identified by Social Cognitive Theory: attentional, retention (memory), production, and motivational. For example, attention was maximized through prompts, reminders, and a colorful, playful, interactive user interface; retention was promoted through reminders, repetition, memorable graphics and content; production (promoting the transition of thoughts into action) was supported through instructions and tips and by prompting cognitive and behavioral rehearsal with feedback; and motivation for change was maximized through internal and social comparisons, goals, and feedback.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par20">The pre-specified primary outcome measure was average daily servings of vegetable consumption, assessed at baseline and 8&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization using an adapted version of the validated semi-quantitative Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The FFQ was selected as the primary outcome due to its: a) specificity to the intervention (i.e., probing each of the vegetables targeted by the intervention vs. holistic probing of all food intake); b) minimal participant burden leading to a reduced amount of missing data; c) high test-retest reliability in the target population; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] d) evidence of sensitivity to change in the Vegethon pilot study; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and e) demonstrated comparable validity to 24-h recalls in measuring vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Commonly used portion sizes for each vegetable (e.g., &#x000bd; cup of string beans) were specified, and participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, during the past week, they had consumed each type and amount of food. Eight response categories were possible, ranging from 0 to &#x02265;6 times per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. All 28 questions on vegetable consumption were included from the Harvard FFQ, supplemented by 12 further questions on the consumption of additional vegetables targeted by the intervention. Daily vegetable intake was calculated for each participant following an established method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in which the daily frequency of consumption for each vegetable item was multiplied by the number of servings represented by the specified portion size and subsequently combined to yield total daily vegetable servings. Vegetable subgroups were defined <italic>a priori</italic> based on established criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and included green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, dark yellow vegetables, tomatoes, other vegetables, and beans. All subgroups excluding beans were combined to yield overall vegetable consumption (primary outcome), and assessed individually as secondary outcomes. Beans, not targeted by the intervention, was included as a comparison measure to detect possible global vegetable reporting bias.</p><p id="Par21">Secondary measures of vegetable consumption were also derived from 24-h dietary recalls at baseline and 5&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization, administered by trained, certified, and blinded interviewers using Nutrition Data System for Research (University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Three unannounced 24-h recalls were attempted on nonconsecutive days (2 weekdays, 1 weekend) over 2&#x000a0;weeks at each of two time points, for a total of 6 recalls per participant. Average daily servings of four subgroups (dark green vegetables, deep yellow vegetables, tomato, and other vegetables) were combined to yield overall vegetable consumption. Beans was a comparison measure.</p><p id="Par22">App usage was measured using inbuilt software. App usability and satisfaction were assessed using a 21-item questionnaire, administered 8&#x000a0;weeks post randomization to the intervention condition only, and adapted from similar surveys used by King et al. to assess user acceptability of mobile health (mHealth) interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par23">
<italic>A priori</italic> sample size estimation determined that a sample size of <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;128, or 64 per group, would provide at least 80% power to detect a medium effect size of Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.5 (one-half standard deviation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Each analysis used a two-sided alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 threshold for statistical significance. To assess the effect of app assignment on participants&#x02019; all-vegetable consumption as measured by FFQ (primary outcome), we fit a linear mixed-effects model to which each subject contributed two observations (at baseline and 8&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization) over the study period. The model contained main effects of app intervention status (an indicator of whether an individual was assigned to the app at the time of observation), time (baseline or 8&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization), sex, parent trial diet group assignment (low-carbohydrate or low-fat), parent trial health educator (4 categories), and parent trial cohort group (2 categories). The main effect of app was the primary effect of interest. To account for correlated observations within subjects, the model also included random intercepts by subject, as well as random slopes over time by subject. We assumed normally distributed error terms. An analysis following intention-to-treat principles was used with multiple imputation for missing data. Five imputed datasets were created using the chained equations method and pooled estimates using Barnard-Rubin adjusted degrees of freedom.</p><p id="Par24">We conducted several pre-specified secondary analyses. We refit the primary analysis model, using alternative secondary outcome measures: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] all-vegetable consumption as measured by 24-h recalls; [2] each of 5 vegetable subgroups as measured by FFQ; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] each of 4 vegetable subgroups as measured by 24-h recalls. We also performed pre-specified analyses of four potential moderators of treatment effects, baseline vegetable consumption, sex, diet group, and health educator, by adding app by possible moderator interaction terms to the model. When a statistically significant interaction was identified, it indicated a possible effect moderator, and the main effect coefficient in the model was re-examined after centering the variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To investigate the possibility of a dose-response relationship between the amount of app usage and changes in vegetable consumption, we used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient that does not assume normal distributions. Data were collected in 2014&#x02013;2015 and analyzed in 2015&#x02013;2016. All primary and secondary analyses followed intention-to-treat principles. Stata (v14.1, StataCorp LP, Texas) and SPSS Statistics software (v22, IBM, New York) were used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p id="Par25">Between Nov 3, 2014 and Jan 30, 2016, 135 participants were randomized and analyzed (intervention: 68; control: 67) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Participants randomized to receive the Vegethon app reported consuming an average of two more servings per day than controls, measured with the FFQ after 8&#x000a0;weeks. Participants randomized to receive the Vegethon app also reported consuming an average of one more serving per day than controls when measured with 24-h dietary recalls after 5&#x000a0;weeks, a secondary measure of vegetable consumption. The consistency of these results using two different measures of daily vegetable consumption assessed at two time points during the study lends further credibility to the study&#x02019;s findings. Differences were not observed between groups in reported consumption of beans, a vegetable type not targeted by the intervention. This finding suggests the observed effects are unlikely to be explained by a differential social desirability bias leading to an over-reporting of all vegetables by participants who received the intervention. This stand-alone mobile app was evaluated in the context of an intensive weight loss trial in which consumption of high quality whole foods and vegetables was emphasized. The efficacy of the app beyond the effect of the parent weight loss intervention may suggest a potentially high degree of potency of the mobile app intervention or a synergistic effect between the two. These effects may be due to the advantages inherent to mobile-based interventions, including timely feedback, personalization, and daily interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as the theory-based nature of the intervention. This is the first study to demonstrate in a rigorous randomized controlled trial the efficacy of a stand-alone mobile app in increasing vegetable consumption.</p><p id="Par31">Baseline vegetable consumption was a significant moderator of intervention effects, in which the effect of the mobile app on vegetable consumption was greatest among those who reported greater consumption of vegetables at baseline. This finding can inform future studies of Vegethon, and possible other interventions to increase vegetable intake, to test this observation directly by stratifying randomization on baseline vegetable consumption or by designing and testing different interventions for different groups defined by their prior vegetable consumption. Examination of the patterns of change over the course of the study suggests that, overall, the mobile app increased and maintained higher vegetable consumption in the intervention condition, compared to a reduction in vegetable consumption in the control condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This pattern may be explained because participants received the mobile app 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;months into a weight control program in which they had already made changes to their diets, including their vegetable intakes. It also highlights the importance of using a randomized controlled design to evaluate the efficacy of behavior change interventions, as an observational study of the mobile app may have been misleading, missing the large effect. After finding that baseline vegetable consumption moderated the impact of the intervention, an exploratory analysis including the baseline vegetable consumption by app interaction in the model showed even larger effects sizes, with significant increases in consumption of all vegetables, including green vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, dark yellow vegetables, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Future studies can be designed to account for the effect moderation of baseline vegetable intake. Given the improved health outcomes associated with greater vegetable consumption, we believe the observed effect sizes would be of clinical significance.</p><p id="Par32">The intervention achieved reasonably high rates of engagement and was found to be easy and enjoyable to use. App usage showed a weak dose-response relationship with overall treatment effect but was more strongly associated with changes in vegetable consumption among the subgroup of participants who reported consuming more vegetables at baseline. This finding suggests that the effect of the mobile app is tied not only to frequency of use but also to individual participant characteristics.</p><p id="Par33">The results of this study indicating the efficacy of the Vegethon intervention confirm those of the earlier Vegethon pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], in which increases in daily vegetable consumption among overweight adults were similarly observed. Effect sizes were substantial but smaller than those observed in the initial pilot study, as is typical when larger, more definitive trials follow small pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, they compare favorably with the only other known randomized study of a mobile app targeting vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The theory-driven nature of the app, including goal-setting and self-monitoring behavior widely acknowledged to be critical components of behavioral mHealth interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], may have led to greater behavioral changes than observed previously. These increases in vegetable consumption were observed among participants who already had a relatively high baseline vegetable consumption compared to the U.S. national average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], due in part to their concurrent participation in a weight loss trial emphasizing healthier eating including vegetable consumption. Further studies are indicated to examine the effect of Vegethon and similar technologies among populations with lower vegetable consumption who are not concurrently enrolled in a weight loss trial. Overall, these findings align with those found in other investigations of mobile apps to change health behaviors, in which acceptability and initial efficacy has been similarly demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">These results warrant further research, as increases in vegetable consumption may lead to changes in overall diet composition and weight loss, even in the absence of specific guidance to decrease consumption of other foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, in a study among overweight adults by Norman et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] a short message service (SMS) intervention that increased vegetable consumption led to weight loss. Such interventions that focus on the inherent benefits of the target behavior itself (e.g., increasing vegetable consumption) may lead to more sustained behavior changes than those focusing on longer-term goals (e.g., weight loss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Given the high and growing prevalence of overweight in the United States, and the fact that people in higher weight categories are more likely to develop chronic diseases associated with excess weight, strategies to reduce modifiable risk factors including diet among overweight adults are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This study demonstrating the efficacy of a mobile app to increase vegetable consumption among motivated overweight adults presents one such possible strategy that warrants further investigation. Further trials of theory-driven mobile technologies to more effectively produce health behavior changes are called for.</p><p id="Par35">Among the strengths of this research were the theory-based development of the app, the rigorous methods and randomized controlled study design, the use of state-of-the-art FFQ and 24-h dietary recall outcome measures, high retention rates for the primary outcome measure, and substantial sample size in comparison to most mHealth studies. This study used multiple methods of assessing vegetable consumption, which has been recommended to inform a more complete understanding of true intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Participants enrolled in the evaluation of this mobile intervention were concurrently enrolled in a weight loss trial. Generalizability of these findings to other samples that are not enrolled in a weight loss trial and/or motivated to use a mobile app to increase their vegetable consumption is unknown. Although comparable to many nutrition intervention studies, the 8-week study duration provides an assessment only of relatively short-term intervention effects. A longer trial is warranted to determine whether the observed effects increase, decrease, or are sustained over time, and whether there are effects on weight and other associated health benefits. As with all dietary assessment methods, there are inherent limitations to the adapted Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire and 24-h recall measures including reliance on self-report. However, our finding that the differences in vegetable consumption between groups did not generalize to beans, a vegetable group not targeted by the intervention, lends support to&#x000a0;the validity of the findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">These data show that a theory-based mobile app increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults attempting weight loss maintenance.
