Poor communication has also been cited as a possible barrier to recruitment. A qualitative patient interview study was included within the feasibility stage of a phase III non-inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (SPARE, CRUK/07/011) in muscle invasive bladder cancer. The aim was to illuminate problems in the context of randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The qualitative study used a &#x02018;Framework Analysis&#x02019; that included &#x02018;constant comparison&#x02019; in which semi-structured interviews are transcribed, analyzed, compared and contrasted both between and within transcripts.

There was little indication that confusion directly impacted on decisions to enter the SPARE trial. However, confusion did appear to impact on ethical considerations surrounding &#x02018;informed consent&#x02019;, as well as cause a sense of alienation between patients and health personnel.</p><p>Sub-optimal communication in many guises accounted for the confusion, together with the logistical elements of a trial that involved treatment options delivered in a number of geographical locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data highlight the difficulty of providing balanced and clear trial information within the UK health system, despite best intentions. Involvement of multiple professionals can impact on communication processes with patients who are considering participation in RCTs. Our results led us to question the &#x02018;deficit&#x02019; model of patient behavior. It is suggested that health professionals might consider facilitating a context in which patients feel fully included in the trial enterprise and potentially consider alternatives to randomization where complex interventions are being tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN61126465</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Patient interviews</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>Equipoise</kwd><kwd>Bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>Complex interventions</kwd><kwd>Qualitative methodology</kwd><kwd>Communication</kwd><kwd>Confusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) has long represented the gold standard for clinical scientific investigation, requiring objectivity, validity and fully informed consent.

Embedded within the feasibility stage was a qualitative patient interview study. The trial was designed in consultation with patient representatives and approved by the South-East Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.</p><p>Target accrual for the two-year feasibility stage was 110 patients. The main phase III trial would aim to recruit up to 1,015 patients, with an endpoint of overall survival. Patients aged 18 and over with histologically confirmed T2/T3 N0 M0 after transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder receiving neo-adjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy, with satisfactory hematological profile and liver function tests and who were fit for both trial treatments were eligible.</p><p>Patients were centrally randomized between radical surgery (cystectomy) following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and selective bladder preservation (SBP) where definitive treatment (radiotherapy or cystectomy) was decided based on response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The choice of topics was informed by clinical concerns and previous research in this area of investigation. Topics were covered in a flexible manner; patients were probed if they did not arise spontaneously in the interview. Analysis was an iterative process, allowing for the follow-up of emergent findings. Items were systematically coded, initially depending on their face value, followed by conceptual coding leading to over-arching themes and deviant accounts. The method of constant comparison was used, where interpretations are made by checking patients&#x02019; perceptions within and across verbatim transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interpretation relied on patient context, literature and field notes. The researchers met regularly to compare coding and interpretation to ensure reliability. Disagreements (such as they were) were resolved and at times, points of discussion were taken to relevant experts to verify findings. In these cases, the coding framework was refined and where applicable, reapplied to the data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>SPARE opened in June 2007.

While it was not always possible to make obvious links between trial procedures and patient participation, qualitative data have shown how sub-optimal communication in all its guises leads to confusing messages, alienation of patients and groundless decision-making, potentially compromising trial validity and ethical conduct.</p><p>Despite every effort to conduct a high quality trial, there was an inherent difficulty in managing a &#x02018;high stake&#x02019; randomized trial such as SPARE where surgery was compared with radical radiotherapy. Such a study did not lend itself to explaining &#x02018;equipoise&#x02019; and &#x02018;random allocation&#x02019;, the former being particularly difficult for clinicians to explain and patients to accept. Physicians&#x02019; preferences and the difficulties of &#x02018;equipoise&#x02019; have been shown to undermine confidence and optimal recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and challenge the traditional roles of doctor and patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, an integration of what have been perceived as contrasting and competing roles of researcher and physician is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>This study suggests that a debate as to whether RCTs are appropriate in the evaluation of complex interventions may be fruitful. Alternative strategies that take account of physician and patient preferences may help to provide a means of assessing the efficacy of complex treatments.</p><p>An aim of SPARE was to assess recruitment rates in a multi-center context. This took place in the absence of dedicated trial specific resources at the centers involved. Thus, as with most non-commercially funded RCTs in the UK, there was little leverage with which to influence the trial behavior of the many health professionals working with SPARE, although problems and suggested solutions were disseminated regularly. Our data reflected problems reported in previous studies. This raises questions about how research into trial recruitment is disseminated within modern health services and how trialists can be informed of and deliver best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Structural issues and logistical problems inherent in the NHS are likely to have impacted on patient and physician trial behavior. The complicated treatment pathway in the SPARE trial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) seems to have prohibited personnel from giving comprehensive explanations and consistent support regarding concepts and trial procedures. This helps to explain patients&#x02019; observed confusion and potentially uninformed consent, not withstanding that SPARE had to involve non-trial staff in the recruitment process who may have been unwilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and/or less skilled at approaching patients and explaining trial concepts, such as equipoise.</p><p>Our findings are replicated in a further SPARE qualitative study that was conducted in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Paramasivan <italic>et al.</italic> revealed that trialists had difficulty in articulating the complex trial design, leading to a palpable breakdown in communication. Information was given in complicated and erroneous terms, reflecting physicians&#x02019; preferences. We propose that attention be focused on training trialists who are involved in recruitment to complicated trials, both in terms of communication processes and on the assimilation of complex trial pathways experienced as a consequence of the current structures of the NHS. The ProtecT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has demonstrated how this can be achieved in a similarly complex RCT involving surgery.</p><p>Participants in SPARE seemed to lack comprehension of trial procedures but this was not premised on a deficit model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Study participants indicated that their understanding of randomization and equipoise were not necessarily verified. Both concepts are highly complex and require thought about how their meaning is communicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, simple provision of clear factual information is often not sufficient to ensure &#x02018;informed consent&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Patients in this study and others are known to interpret particular terms differently from what is actually said by clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], highlighting the importance of verification to achieve valid informed consent. As our data show, even if patients understand the scientific perspective, they may not accept its validity or the offer to participate in trials. They can rely instead on other factors, such as their own preferences associated with their everyday lives, both perspectives being rational and reasonable in their own terms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Research that investigates individual encounters between patients and their doctors remains essential.</p><p>Sub-optimal communication, including interpersonal interaction between trialists and patients, may have been a major factor in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], sometimes leading to invalid consent. It should be borne in mind that patients enter trials with an innocence and fear that may be difficult for &#x02018;expert&#x02019; trialists to comprehend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This and the perceived inequality of levels of status, knowledge and power in the doctor/patient relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] may obstruct a close alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and the means to clarify trial procedures. Our data show that patients felt undermined and separated from the medical enterprise. We suggest that patients may wish for a mode of caring that goes beyond &#x02018;empathic information giving&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This raises questions as how best to formulate this interaction. We suggest it would involve physicians facilitating a context in which patients have closer contact and a &#x02018;relationship&#x02019; with health personnel that includes trust and respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], together with a recognition that ill people experience vulnerability, and a need to feel &#x02018;attached&#x02019; and included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We have observed that the most engaged patients professed the most personal interaction with trial and other staff, leading to an enhanced patient experience. These factors are pertinent in the context of all RCTs, where ethical considerations incorporate the need for obtaining valid, informed and unbiased consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and where the connectedness we speak of may help to restore autonomy and enhance recruitment.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the qualitative study</title><p>Our data apply to patients who are largely men of white ethnicity who have been invited to consent to a complex intervention trial which gave rise to problems that may not be encountered in straightforward RCTs. Our findings rely on patients&#x02019; perceptions and not the ongoing reality of a trial. We did not systematically investigate factors such as training levels or work overload of research staff, all of which may have impacted on our findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Qualitative studies that examine the ways trialists interact with potential participants in &#x02018;real time&#x02019; may produce valuable insights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

We suggest that not only is training made available to potential trialists but that consideration might be given to possible alternatives to randomization where complex interventions are being tested. Involvement of multiple professionals can impact on patient support, including communication processes with patients who are considering participation in RCTs, leading us to question the &#x02018;deficit&#x02019; model of patients&#x02019; understanding and behavior. It is suggested that health professionals consider facilitating a context in which patients feel fully included in the trial enterprise.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CT: Chemotherapy; EUA: Examination under anaesthetic; Gem-cis: Gemcitabine &#x02013; cisplatin chemotherapy; GP: General Practitioners; ICR: CTSU &#x02013; Institute of Cancer Research &#x02013; Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit; IQR: Interquartile range; NCRN: National Cancer Research Network; NHS: National Health Service; NIHR: National Institute for Health Research; PS: Performance Status; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; SBP: Selective Bladder Preservation; SPARE: A randomised trial of Selective bladder Preservation Against Radical Excision (cystectomy) in muscle invasive T2/T3 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder; TCC: Transitional Cell Carcinoma; TMG: Trial Management Group; TUR: Transurethral Resection.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no competing interests to declare.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CM is the primary author of this paper, designed the study in collaboration with AB, RH and EH, and was primarily responsible for data collection and analysis.
