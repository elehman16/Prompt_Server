Common antibacterial agents in the market like triclosan and aluminum salts, in spite of their suitable antibacterial effects, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, breast and prostate cancers or induce contact dermatitis. Therefore, plant extracts possessing antibacterial effects are of interest. The aim of the present study was to verify the <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial effects of different sage extracts against two major bacteria responsible for axillary odor, and to evaluate the deodorant effect of a silicon-based stick containing sage extracts in different densities in humans.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Different fractions of methanolic extract of <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> (sage) were evaluated on a culture of armpit skin surface of volunteers through agar microdilution antimicrobial assay. Then, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with the best antibacterial fraction was conducted on 45 female healthy volunteers. Participants were treated with a single dose in four groups, each containing 15 individuals: Group 1 (200 &#x003bc;g/mL), 2 (400 &#x003bc;g/mL), 3 (600 &#x003bc;g/mL) of dichloromethane sage extract, and placebo (without extract). A standard sensory evaluation method for the evaluation of deodorant efficacy was used before, and two hours, four hours, and eight hours after single application of a deodorant or placebo (ASTM method E 1207-87 Standard Practice for the Sensory Evaluation of Axillary Deodorancy).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The data were analyzed with two factors relating to densities and time. In 45 participants with a mean [&#x000b1; standard deviation (SD)] age of 61.5&#x000b1;11.8 years, statistically significant within-group differences were observed before and two, four, and eight hours after deodorant treatment for groups 1, 2, and 3. Groups 1, 2, and 3 had a significantly smaller odor score than placebo after two, four, and eight hours (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In a comparison of different deodorant densities, the interaction effect was not significant between deodorant 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g/mL, but was significant between 200 and 600 and between 400 and 600 &#x003bc;g/mL sage extract sticks (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

In this study, the impact of sage extract on sweat-decomposing bacteria was evaluated through agar well diffusion method. It showed that 1% CO<sub>2</sub> sage extract has a significant inhibiting effect on <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> strains and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of sensory evaluation of axillary deodorancy of dichloromethane sage extract in a silicone-based stick formulation in humans to verify the <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial effects of different sage extracts against two major bacteria responsible for axillary odor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Aerial parts of <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> (sage) were collected in July 2012 from the Isfahan province (Iran). The plant material was identified by the Pharmacognosy Department,department, Pharmacy Faculty, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, and a voucher specimen was deposited. Shade-dried plant material (200 g) was macerated with aqueous ethanol (4:6) at room temperature for five days. Filtration and under vacuum concentration of total hydroalcoholic extract resulted in a green gum which was partitioned between aqueous methanol and hexane. The defatted methanolic extract was concentrated, dissolved in water, and extracted sequentially with dichloromethane and <italic>n</italic>-butanol.

The combined extract containing rosmarinic acid material was filtered to 3 mL. The sample was spotted in the form of 1 &#x003bc;L spot width on a prewashed silica gel TLC aluminium foil 60 (20&#x000d7;10 cm with 0.2 mm thickness; E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a Camag nanomat (CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland). A constant application rate of 150 nL/s was employed, slit dimension was kept at 4&#x000d7;0.1 mm, and 20 mm/s scanning speed was employed. The mobile phase consisted of toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (5-4-1). Determination was done at 329 nm using a TLC Scanner 3 (CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland). A standard calibration curve in the range of 50 to 400 &#x003bc;g/mL for quantitative analysis was prepared using different concentrations of rosmarinic acid (Sigma Aldrich, USA) as standard material (50, 100, 200, and 400 &#x003bc;g/mL). The relationship between the concentration and peak height was measured using the minimum square method (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value). Validation of the HPTLC method was calculated as the percent recovery of spiked extract sample with standard rosmarinic acid at 100 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined by using the formula based on the signal-to-noise ratio. LOD and LOQ were calculated by using equations, LOD=3 &#x000d7; S/N&#x02019; and LOQ=10 &#x000d7; S/N&#x02019;, where S = signal height, and N&#x02019;= noise height.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Bacteria preparation</title><p>The sage extract was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> on the cultures of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> PTCC 1114 (Industrial Bacteria and Fungi Collection, Iran) and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> strain isolated from the armpit skin surface of a volunteer to confirm that the extract was able to reduce the population of axillary bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Agar microdilution antimicrobial assay</title><p>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> strains and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> were determined using agar microdilution assay.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The culture of both bacteria was diluted with sterile tryptic soy broth (TSB) to match a McFarland 0.5 turbidity standard, and then further diluted to give a concentration of approximately 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cfu/mL.

The subjects were screened for axillary irritation prior to acceptance in the study by an expert in cosmetic pharmacology. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Healthy subjects who were able to generate a moderate axillary odor (odor intensity score &#x02265;4.0 and &#x02264;8 with right-left odor difference &#x02264;1.0) with no medical history of allergy to deodorants and/or antiperspirants, no axillary irritation, no disease, and no medication use prior to and following the intervention were included in the study. None of the subjects showed signs of axillary irritation during the test period, and all of the enrolled subjects completed the study. The participants were treated with a single dose of three sticks with different dosages of 600, 400, and 200 &#x003bc;g/mL dichloromethane sage extract in a silicone-based stick containing propylene glycol and cyclopentasiloxane or placebo (silicone-based stick containing propylene glycol and cyclopentasiloxane without sage extract; Pharmacy School, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran). Forty-five subjects were randomized using permuted block randomization to one of the three groups, each containing 15 individuals, for deodorant or placebo treatment on the right or left axilla. The deodorant or placebo application was done on the right or left hand but assignment to the right or left remained the same during the study. The subjects and judges were not aware of the treatment assignment so as to blind the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. During the study, the subjects agreed to avoid the use of antiperspirant products for a period of three weeks and deodorant products for two weeks prior to the start of the study and continue this for the entire test duration. They shaved their underarms 24 hours prior to the start of the test and abstained from any underarm shaving during the entire test period. They used only one type of soap without flavor for 14 days before the test and abstained from chewing gum, or using sprays or any odorous materials which might have interfered with the assessment.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Collection and handling of samples</title><p>Cotton sterile pads were placed in the volunteers&#x02019; armpits, displaced after two minutes, and then put away in small capped boxes with the subject's name and right or left armpit marked on them.

Finally, they were instructed to use the deodorant sticks and placebo on their armpits. Randomly, half of the subjects used the sticks on the right side and others on the left, although none could identify the deodorant or the placebo. After two minutes, odorless cotton sterile pads were placed in the underarms and were held by antiallergic tapes.

In comparison with the literature, the results observed with deodorant 600 were more consistent with regular deodorants in the market.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The results were also comparable with a similar study with hops extract in trials on humans, in which malodor scores dropped from 6.28 to 1.80 after eight hours of deodorant application.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>On comparing the safety of market deodorants and sage extract, aluminum-containing deodorants were reported to induce contact dermatitis due to denaturing epidermal keratin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Hydroxyisohexyl-3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (HICC) known as Lyral used in more than 50% of the marketed deodorants is also a frequent allergen, but the sage stick deodorant in all densities was well tolerated without any irritation report.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In one study on 14 patients using HICC-containing deodorants, all of them developed unilateral eczema, whereas controls were all negative.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Moreover, permeability of armpit membranes to deodorants containing aluminum ions causes reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of ROS promote cerebral accumulation of extracellular amyloid &#x000df;-plaques. Amyloid &#x000df; in the brain plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and mediated neurodegeneration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] A preliminary study on the dermal absorption of aluminium from deodorants showed that a small quantity of the applied aluminium was absorbed through the armpit skin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Even though this amount is not significant in a single application, there is an increasing risk of Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer following the absorption of aluminium ions after the extended use of aluminium-containing deodorants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] There are also reports of ventricular fibrillation or fatal reports following inhalation of deodorant sprays.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] So, replacement by herbal extracts with acceptable antibacterial effects like sage extract could reduce the risk of side effects or toxicities due to the extended use of marketed deodorants.</p><p>In summary, there are few clinical trials on natural deodorants to support their efficacy; so, they are probably considered as inefficacious. This is also the first report with sage extract used as deodorant in a stick formulation. Therefore, evaluation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of the sage extract and the evaluation of its odor-reducing capacity by a sensory evaluation panel on human subjects was employed to verify its deodorant performance.</p><p>The limitation of this study was the sample size. Although the data had normal distribution, a larger number of participants will increase the statistical precision and reduce the standard errors.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NS carried out the design and co-ordinated the study and participated in most of the experiments and in manuscript preparation.
