It is an established fact that balanced anesthesia has four components: Analgesia (antinociceptive), amnesia (hypnotic), muscle relaxation, and abolition of autonomic reflexes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Imbalance in any one of the components leads to stress response (autonomic, endocrine, metabolic, and immunological responses) to a noxious stimulus[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which delays wound healing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In susceptible patients, it may lead to organ dysfunction such as myocardial ischemia and infarction.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] To surmount the stress response, it is not feasible to maintain deeper plane of anesthesia with volatile agents alone throughout the procedure as this results in hemodynamic instability and also does not ensure adequate analgesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In balanced anesthesia, hypnotic and antinociceptive components are interconnected. A strong antinociceptive component reduces hypnotic requirement and vice versa.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] To have intense analgesia, multimodal analgesia (MMA) is the scientific approach to treat acute pain with least side effects. The concept of MMA was introduced in 1990s to fast track recovery; later, it was considered for better postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It targets all four elements of pain processing: (1) Transduction, (2) transmission, (3) modulation, and (4) perception.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] whereas in the conventional regime, only one or two elements are targeted.</p><p>The present study was designed to assess the intensity of analgesia with the bolus doses of preemptive MMA drugs compared with conventional analgesic regime, for a series of noxious stimuli, with varied intensity such as endotracheal intubation, prone position, and skin incision (action points). They are the most intense stimuli which precede stress response during the surgical procedure in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. In the study, preemptive analgesia was considered to prevent nervous system sensitization.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The study tested the hypothesis that preemptive MMA modulates the cardiovascular response to action points in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery and is the first of its kind.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized, prospective double-blind clinical study was carried out in a tertiary care center after obtaining the Institutional Review Board approval and informed written consent from the patients. Forty-two patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery between 20 and 65 years, of both sex, with body mass index of 18&#x02013;30 belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I and II were included in the study. Pregnant women, patients with bronchial asthma, and known drug allergy were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 21), Group A and Group B by allocation sequence generated by computer-generated random number table.</p><p>Confirming the preanesthetic evaluation and consent, the following monitors were connected in the induction room: Electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, O<sub>2</sub> saturation of hemoglobin, bispectral index (BIS), and train of four (TOF, neuromuscular monitor) for monitoring throughout the surgery. For drug and fluid administration intravenous access was secured. Patients were oxygenated during the study drug administration by O<sub>2</sub> mask. All patients received midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, ondansetron 4 mg, and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously. The study drugs were prepared by assigned postgraduate students who were not participating in the study. Analgesic drugs were administered preemptively before induction providing sufficient time for the onset of action. Group A: (study group/MMA group) Received diclofenac sodium, paracetamol and clonidine intravenously, and local skin infiltration (bupivacaine with adrenaline). Group B: (control group/conventional regime group) Received paracetamol and local skin infiltration (saline with adrenaline). Following the study drug administration, patients were preoxygenated with 100% O<sub>2</sub>5 L/min for 3 min. Fentanyl 3 &#x003bc;g/kg was given to all patients 2 min before induction with propofol, followed by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 60% N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>, atracurium, and morphine. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were maintained within &#x000b1; 10% of the baseline values intraoperatively. End tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and end-tidal isoflurane concentration were continuously monitored using an infrared gas analyzer. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane was titrated to achieve BIS of 50&#x02013;55 throughout the surgery. At the conclusion of surgery, all patients were allowed to recover spontaneously to TOF of T<sub>2</sub>. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with glycopyrrolate 10 &#x003bc;g/kg and neostigmine 50 &#x003bc;g/kg administered intravenously. Tracheal extubation was done when the following criteria were met: BIS: 85&#x02013;88 and TOF T<sub>4</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> ratio &#x02265;0.9. For statistical analysis, HR, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) just before action points and 1 min, and 2 min following action points were considered.</p><p>Adverse effects of analgesic drugs such as intraoperative bradycardia (opioid, clonidine) bronchospasm, gastritis (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), postoperative nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression (opioid) were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>This study was nested within a study whose objective was to assess &#x0201c;the effect of multimodal perioperative analgesia on stress response to surgery and on postoperative pain score&#x0201d; in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery.

In the present study, a series of stressors were considered because with inadequate analgesia repetitive noxious stimulus has adverse effect on all organ system.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In clinical anesthesia, as there is no specific indicator for nociceptive-antinociceptive balance, anesthesiologists use isolated nonspecific autonomic responses (HR and BP) as the end points in anesthetizing surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are an integral part of general anesthesia to secure the airway, whereas change of position (prone position) and skin incision are the requirements for surgical access.</p><p>Channaiah <italic>et al</italic>. studied the efficacy of fentanyl on intubation response. They found 15% reduction in the HR compared to control group which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the present study, fentanyl was included because of its rapid onset of action, high potency, and hemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Arora <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found HR of 83.77 &#x000b1; 16.31 beats per min (bpm) at 1 min following intubation in patients who received clonidine with fentanyl; whereas in patients who received only fentanyl, the HR was 96.97 &#x000b1; 11.47 bpm. They concluded that clonidine with fentanyl is better than fentanyl alone because clonidine is a powerful sedative and analgesic and also inhibits the release of catecholamines.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In accordance with their findings, in the present study, HR was significantly low in the MMA group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002<sup>b</sup> and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01<sup>b</sup> respectively, [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]). At 1 min following intubation, HR was 100.62 &#x000b1; 24.55 bpm in the control group where as in the study group, it was 86.71 &#x000b1; 11.136 bpm. This shows that clonidine with fentanyl is a good combination in suppressing hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation. Channaiah <italic>et al</italic>. found significant attenuation of SBP, DBP, and MAP (12.4%, 9.4%, and 11.3%, respectively) with fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, Arora <italic>et al</italic>. found increase in SBP by 13.23%, DBP by 9.42%, and MAP by 12.78% from baseline value with only fentanyl as compared to fentanyl with clonidine.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study, at 1 min following intubation, in the MMA group, SBP, DBP, and MAP were significantly low (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001<sup>b</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.023<sup>b</sup>, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001<sup>b</sup> respectively). This shows that a combination of drugs inhibits conduction in the pain pathway at various levels and attenuates hemodynamic response to intubation better than a single drug.</p><p>Wadsworth <italic>et al</italic>. did a study on four different types of prone positioning on cardiovascular parameters in healthy unanesthetized volunteers and have concluded that prone position itself may not alter HR and MAP. They have stated that exaggerated hemodynamic response may occur in anesthetized state.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In literature, there are studies in prone patients on cardio dynamics where the focus was on pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation to predict fluid responsiveness.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Whereas in the present study, hemodynamic response immediately after turning the patients prone was assessed with MMA drugs, which is the first of its kind.</p><p>Channabasappa and Shankarnarayan in their study on hemodynamic changes between the prone and supine extubation in patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery found a significant rise in the HR and MAP in patients&#x02019; extubated in the supine position. The maximum increase in HR was 7.4 &#x000b1; 2.7 bpm in patients extubated prone and 32 &#x000b1; 3.7 bpm in patients extubated supine. Similarly, rise in MAP was 7.8 &#x000b1; 2.2 mmHg in patients extubated prone and 15.2 &#x000b1; 2.3 mmHg in patients extubated supine.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study, hemodynamic response following prone positioning was significantly low in the study groups compared to control group [HR - <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, SBP - <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, DBP - <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, and MAP - <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Rise in HR was 4.33 &#x000b1; 7.255 bpm and MAP was 8.67 &#x000b1; 13.533 mmHg in the study group, whereas it was 12.19 &#x000b1; 10.838 bpm and 18.86 &#x000b1; 21.69 mmHg, respectively in the control group, at 2 min following prone positioning. The only difference between the studies was, in the present study hemodynamic changes following positioning the patients prone for the surgery was assessed, whereas in Channabasappa's study hemodynamic changes at the conclusion of the surgery following turning the patients supine till extuation was considered. The inference was that ETT <italic>in situ</italic> causes reflex hemodynamic response at the time of change of position. In the present study, hemodynamic response after turning the patients, prone was minimal in the MMA group due to intense analgesia; whereas in Channabasappa's study, it was due to least handling of the airway, where even suctioning was not done at the time of extubation in prone position.</p><p>Elimination of somatic and autonomic response to skin incision are the clinical end-points for assessing the depth of anesthesia which is a well-known fact.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] To attenuate the hemodynamic response to skin incision, different modalities have been used. Katoh <italic>et al</italic>. found sevoflurane as a sole agent did not prevent cardiovascular responses to skin incision at clinical concentrations (1&#x02013;2 MAC) and was associated with the risk of excessive hypotension. In addition, they found marked reduction in MAC and MAC-BAR of sevoflurane with low concentration of fentanyl (1 and 3 ng/mL) and N<sub>2</sub>O; whereas with increasing concentration of fentanyl (6 ng/mL), they observed ceiling effect.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The inference is that sevoflurane would be safer and more effective when used with a combination of drugs. Johansen <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of esmolol on propofol requirement for skin incision. They found no significant change in propofol requirement in low-dose infusion group compared to control group. In high-dose infusion group, it was reduced by 26% which was supposed to be 50% reduction based on computer-assisted continuous infusion target.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This clarifies that escalating the dose of a drug will not exponentially increase its clinical efficacy. Rantanen <italic>et al</italic>. based on clinical signs, intensity of the stimulus and serum level of analgesic drugs, derived a tool, the clinical signs-stimulus-antinoception score to estimate nociception at the time of skin incision. They recorded physiological response to skin incision at 3 different target control infusion (TCI) levels of remifentanil (1, 3 and 5 ng/mL), and they derived an indicator of nociception: Response index of nociception. They concluded that the hemodynamic response to a large incision with lower TCI of remifentanil 1 ng/mL was more marked than to a small incision with TCI of remifentanil 3 or 5 ng/mL.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This reveals that intense analgesia is a must for major surgeries which can be achieved with MMA. Johansen <italic>et al</italic>. found a significant increase in the HR and MAP after endotracheal intubation but not after skin incision.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Accordingly, in the present study, following skin incision, hemodynamic parameters between the groups were not statistically significant. This shows that intubation and change of position need deeper plane of anesthesia (Stage III, Plane III and IV) compared to skin incision (Stage III, Plane II and III) which can be accomplished only by MMA.</p><p>The end results of the above-mentioned studies states that higher doses of drug may end up with ceiling effect or may not be clinically effective as a sole agent to completely inhibit stress response to noxious stimuli. With small doses of study drugs, the clinical effect may not be statistically significant when compared with the control group. In brief, MMA drugs interact synergistically and provide intense analgesia. It also improves hemodynamic stability before and after noxious stimuli during the course of surgery. Further studies are necessary with MMA to motivate the clinicians with evidence-based literature and to improve the quality of perioperative pain management which is still far from satisfactory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Under general anesthesia, a nociceptive-antinociceptive balance is established which is enhanced by MMA for a given noxious stimulus because of additive analgesic effects. It is more robust as compared to conventional analgesic regime in anesthetized, paralyzed patients during the course of the surgery. This shows that balanced anesthesia with MMA can be recommended to suppress the hemodynamic response to varied intensity of surgical stimuli.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Erikssion</surname><given-names>LI</given-names></name><name><surname>Fleisher</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiener-Kronish</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Opioid analgesics</article-title><source>Miller's Anesthesia</source><year>2015</year><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Saunders</publisher-name><fpage>864</fpage><lpage>914</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Evers</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Crowder</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Barash</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoelting</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Stock</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanisms of anaesthesia and consciousness</article-title><source>Clinical Anaesthesia</source><year>2009</year><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams and Wilkins</publisher-name><fpage>95</fpage><lpage>114</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stress response and anaesthesia.
