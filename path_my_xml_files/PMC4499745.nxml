Prespecified subgroup analyses included whether or not patients developed treatment-related rash within the first 28&#x02005;days (first-cycle rash), gender and histology. HRQoL using EuroQoL EQ-5D-3L (EQ-5D) was assessed monthly. Randomised patients who took study medication were included in this analysis.

Rash is a common side effect of erlotinib. In this analysis we included patients with all rash grades, regardless of expected relationship with study treatment.

The main comparison of interest in this CE analysis is the subgroup ER (n=178) versus placebo (n=278), since overall there were no differences between erlotinib and placebo; 178/302 (59%) developed rash in the first cycle (ER group) and 124/302 (41%) took erlotinib and did not develop rash in the first cycle (Erlotinib non-rash (ENR) group); 5/313 (2%) on placebo had rash. Patients with ENR were included in a sensitivity analysis. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006733TB1">table 1</xref>). Although there appeared to be a difference for smoking status (except never-smokers), a multivariate analysis<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed that overall survival was similar between ex-smokers and never-smokers (HR 0.98). Also, the efficacy of erlotinib may be reduced in patients who currently smoke, but the absolute difference of 24% versus 37% (p=0.003) does not materially impact the estimate of the QALY and ICER;

First, the TOPICAL trial was designed to prospectively record health economic data (eg, collecting resource use and utility data). Second, &#x0003e;99% of patients died, therefore, the uncertainty in modelling future health benefits is largely absent. Third, utility data were collected until progression/death for all patients, thereby providing reliable mean postprogression utility estimates. Moreover, the EQ-5D utility data had good completion rates. Despite short survival times, costs and benefits were adequately captured.</p><p>A strength of this research is the low rate of EGFR mutation-positive tumours in our population. Currently, NICE recommended EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLCs are treated with TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib) regardless of their performance status. It is possible that if ER patients were to be compared with a similar TKI, the ICER may be higher due to smaller differences between groups. Several other CE analyses exist that compared TKIs against placebo and were approved by NICE.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It is also acknowledged that the analysis associated with rash was not based on a randomised comparison, so there may be some unknown confounders. We excluded deaths prior to the first cycle, but there were only 32 (9%) versus 35 (11%), which was not statistically significant, so unlikely to impact the results (because the survival time was &#x0003c;1&#x02005;month in both treatment groups, the mean OS and PFS would be very similar). In addition, despite being statistically significant differences of 37% versus 24% in smoking status (p=0.003) with median OS improvement of 2&#x02005;months (erlotinib vs placebo) for ex-smokers and 1.4&#x02005;months for current smokers, this did not translate to a meaningful QALY difference. The mean QALY was 0.11 and 0.15 (p=0.1580) for current and ex-smokers, respectively. This suggests that the observed differences in smoking status did not appear to result in meaningful differences in the ICER: about &#x000a3;47&#x02005;000 (ex-smoker) to &#x000a3;64&#x02005;000 (current smoker) assuming the same incremental costs. These values of the ICER are within the range of the sensitivity analyses for the overall ICER.</p><p>The low EGFR mutation rate (5%) was insufficient to establish the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib for poor performance patients whose tumours are EGFR mutation +ve. In any case, the target population in this trial may not require the (expense of) testing for EGFR mutation status and patients could stop taking erlotinib after the first cycle of rash. In this trial 124/302 (40%) patients without rash continued to receive erlotinib. With the proposed treatment strategy, 40% of patients who took erlotinib would fall into this category and reduce the costs of erlotinib. Therefore, the cost saving could be much higher. Interestingly, all patients who tested positive for EGFR mutation developed rash.</p><p>Using the findings from our trial, we estimate that of 100 patients needing to be treated with erlotinib, 60 develop treatment-related rash, who are likely to benefit. The inclusion of the ENR costs for the first cycle (28&#x02005;days) is justified because it represents a health resource consumed, although these patients are unlikely to improve. The ICER was &#x000a3;56&#x02005;770/QALY excluding the cost of treating the 40% of non-rash patients for one cycle, and &#x000a3;68&#x02005;906/QALY including this cost. Both are within the range (&#x000a3;30&#x02005;000 to &#x000a3;154&#x02005;000/QALY) of other estimates for gefitinib and afatinib as first-line therapy for EGFR-mutation-positive patients with NSCLC. Although the mean cost from 28&#x02005;days of erlotinib use in patients with ENR has been included (when calculating the ICER of &#x000a3;68&#x02005;906), the ICER does not reflect the negative effects and poorer QoL (dis-utility) from erlotinib use in the patients with ENR group after first cycle of treatment. Therefore, the higher ICER of &#x000a3;68&#x02005;906, while reflecting total erlotinib usage, may not reflect the efficiency of erlotinib for the target population.</p><p>In conclusion, erlotinib offers a potentially cost-effective treatment option for the subgroup of predominantly poor performance patients with NSCLC with EGFR wild-type tumours who develop first-cycle rash and who are considered unfit by clinicians to be treated with first-line chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are most grateful to all the participating patients, clinicians and local research staff for their helpful advice and comments throughout the trial.
