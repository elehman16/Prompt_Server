has revolutionized the treatment of male infertility, its safety is still debatable. During ICSI, motile
sperm with normal morphology are visually selected for insemination of an oocyte (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A study by
Avenda&#x000f1;o and Oehninger in 2011 has shown that
the percentage of sperm with normal morphology, presenting DNA fragmentation increases
in individuals with severe male infertility (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). </p><p>Because the ICSI procedure bypasses natural sperm selection barriers and increases the
chance of insemination of a defective or DNA
damaged sperm in severe male infertility cases,
it is believed that insemination of these sperm
should be avoided. The consequences of insemination of damaged sperm not only result in
reduced ICSI outcomes in terms of fertilization,
blastocyst formation, implantation, pregnancy
and live birth rates, however there may be other
consequences such as an increased cancer rate
after birth that have yet to be determined (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>To avoid insemination of defective sperm, researchers in the field of sperm biology have focused on novel sperm selection procedures (for
more detail see Nasr-Esfahani et al. and Said
and Land) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Among these novel approaches is the ability of sperm to respond to hypoosmotic stress. The hypo-osmotic swelling test
(HOST) is considered to have this potential (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>HOST was initially introduced as a functional
assay for infertility diagnosis by Jeyendran et
al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In some spermatozoa the plasma membrane may be physically intact (live sperm),
but functionally inactive. Therefore HOST provides supplementary information about sperm
function. Rossato et al. have demonstrated that
sperm exposure to hypo-osmotic conditions
leads to water influx into the cytoplasm, an
expanding sperm volume which stretches the
sperm membrane, resulting in opening osmosensitive calcium channels and calcium influx
within the sperm&#x02019;s cytoplasm following induction of an acrosome reaction (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Expansion of sperm volume leads to different tail
swelling patterns which are classified by WHO
as a-sperm to g-sperm (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Pattern a or a-sperm have no expansion and are
considered nonviable and nonfunctional. In patterns b-sperm to g-sperm, volume expansion indicates different degrees of integrity and functionality of the sperm&#x02019;s membrane.</p><p>Recently, Stanger et al. have assessed DNA
integrity of different sperm patterns and showed
that d-, e-, and f-sperm are associated with minimal DNA damage (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Further detailed evaluation by Bassiri et al. have also revealed that b-,
c-, and d-sperm are associated with a minimal
percentage and frequency of DNA damage, protamine deficiency, abnormal morphology and
apoptosis. The best sperm are considered to be
from the c- and d-sperm (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). According to both
studies, a- and g-sperm are associated with the
most anomalies, especially DNA damage. Thus
insemination of g-sperm as well as nonviable
a-sperm should be avoided during ICSI. These
results possibly show that the degree of sperm
volume expansion may be related to quality
and particularly sperm functionality. The best
sperm are d-sperm that have moderate expand-
ing capacity, which is in accordance with the
observed results in both studies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). According to this hypothesis, the next best sperm are c-
and e-sperm according to Bassiri et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) who
chose c-sperm, whereas Stanger et al. chose esperm as the next best sperm (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Analysis of
correlation between sperm DNA fragmentation
in sperm with different HOST patterns also support the above hypothesis.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate, for the
first time, the potential of HOST in a clinical
setting. In the treatment group we divided sibling oocytes into two subgroups, i. oocytes inseminated by routine ICSI procedure following
density gradient centrifugation (DGC group)
and ii. oocytes inseminated by sperm chosen according to their HOST pattern following DGC
processing (HOST group). The control group
consisted of couples undergoing routine ICSI.
The clinical outcomes of this group (control)
following embryo transfer were compared with
the clinical outcomes of couples who received
embryo transfer solely from the HOST group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this preliminary prospective clinical trial
study, semen samples were obtained from 102
infertile individuals who referred to the Isfahan
Fertility and Infertility Center for ICSI procedures from 2011 to 2012. All couples were informed about the study and consent forms were
signed by all participants. Semen samples were
collected by individuals through the process of
masturbation, after three or four days of abstinence, on the day of oocyte retrieval. Routine
semen analysis was carried out by light microscopy according to World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This study approved by Ethical Committee of Royan Institute.</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>
Infertile couples were informed about the
study and grouped according to their preference
for inclusion in either the treatment or control
groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). In the treatment group, half of
the oocytes were inseminated by sperm selected
following DGC (DGC group) whereas the remaining oocytes were inseminated by sperm selected according to the HOST pattern following
DGC processing (HOST group). In the HOST
group, sperm were initially selected according
to their viability and morphology, after which
they were exposed to hypotonic conditions.
Subsequently, individual sperm were selected
according to the HOST pattern. Once chosen
by the HOST pattern (c, d and e) sperm were
washed and transferred to ICSI-100 drops before insemination. In this study, sperm with a or
g patterns were not inseminated. In the control
group all oocytes were inseminated by sperm
selected based on viability and morphology following DGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p>We recruited couples into the study until the
treatment group reached 39 couples based on a
sample size formula constructed according to a
95% confidence coefficient and 80% power of
study.</p><p>Couples with primary male infertility included in this study had at least two abnormal semen parameters according to the WHO-2010.
Those with less than six normal appearing,
mature metaphase II oocytes were excluded.
We excluded couples over the age of 40 years
from the study.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p> Study design.

We performed sperm processing, super ovulation, the ICSI procedure and embryo culture
according to our previous study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The fertilization rate was assessed around 16-18 hours
post-ICSI according to the presence of two pronuclei. Percentage of fertilization for each case was
calculated by taking into consideration the ratio of
fertilized oocytes to the total number of survived
injected metaphase II (MII) oocytes, which was
then multiplied by 100.</p><p>We assessed embryo quality three days post-oocyte retrieval according to Nasr-Esfahani et al. using
a three-point scoring system and taking into consideration the following parameters: absence of fragmentation and/or fragmentation rate less than 25%
of the embryonic surface; equality of blastomere
size and shape; and the number of cells (greater or
less than eight). We compared the chemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, implantation and abortion
rates between treatment and control groups (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Embryologists who divided the oocytes into two
groups, scored the embryos and followed the cycle
outcomes were blinded to treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous assessment of DNA fragmentation
and sperm morphology </title><p>In order to evaluate the correlation between DNA
fragmentation and fertilization in sibling oocytes
(DGC vs. HOST group), we evaluated DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in the
treatment semen samples according to Tavalaee et al.
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Of note, following sperm assessment under UV,
the sperm were additionally observed with light microscopy. To the best of the technician&#x02019;s ability sperm
normality was assessed and the percentage of TUNEL
negative sperm with normal morphology was deter-
mined. The aim of this procedure was to assess the
correlation between fertilization rate and percentage
of TUNEL negative sperm with normal morphology
in oocytes inseminated in the DGC or HOST groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
The mean, range of variables, Pearson&#x02019;s corre-

remains at the forefront of sperm biology research. </p><p>Spermolemma, the sperm&#x02019;s outer layer, can become damaged when exposed to non physiological conditions, toxicants such as reactive oxygen
species (ROS) or by internal factors that induce
apoptosis. Under these circumstances the genome
integrity is also affected. Therefore, integrity of
the sperm&#x02019;s membrane may be taken as an index
for cellular integrity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and sperm selection according to membrane integrity may provide a solution for choosing suitable sperm for ICSI. Currently, there are few methods that detect live sperm
that have an intact membrane, including i. HOST
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), ii. sperm tail flexibility (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and iii. single
laser shot tests (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Among these, HOST not only
assesses viability but it also reflects the functionality of the sperm membrane. Based on previous
study, it has been proposed that sperm with c, d
and e HOST patterns have higher integrity than gpattern sperm. Therefore, it has been proposed that
g-pattern sperm should not be used for ICSI (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we divided the oocytes from each
couple into two subgroups, where one-half were
inseminated by a routine sperm selection procedure and the other half underwent insemination
using the HOST procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). The results
revealed no significant differences for fertilization rates between the sibling oocytes. In addition, the fertilization rates in sibling oocytes were
similar to the control group. The percentage of
good quality embryos was significantly higher in
the HOST group compared to the sibling oocytes
(DGC group). Thus, it appeared that embryos derived from sperm selected by HOST had higher
developmental potential compared to embryos derived when conventional ICSI was implemented.
This effect might be attributed to the quality of
selected sperm. However, the percentage of good
quality embryos (31.4%) in the control group was
insignificantly lower than the HOST group (42%),
despite similar semen parameters in both groups.
There was a significant difference in percentages
of chemical pregnancies between the HOST (48%)
and control (22.4%) groups.</p><p>Implantation rates percentages also significantly
differed between the HOST (21.7%) and control
(9.3%) groups. The implantation rate in the control
group was lower than the rates commonly reported
in the literature and obtained in our center. This
was likely due to the type of patients (severe male
infertility) chosen for this study. Clinical pregnancies were also higher in the HOST (34.7%) compared to the control (21%) group, but this difference was insignificant.</p><p>Recently, Avenda&#x000f1;o et al. have demonstrated
that ICSI outcomes did not show a significant relationship with DNA fragmentation in whole semen samples, rather a significant correlation was
observed when the degree of DNA fragmentation
was evaluated in sperm that had normal morphology in each sample. Therefore, they have concluded that "the evaluation of DNA integrity in
morphologically normal spermatozoa after sperm
selection is a better approach to examine sperm
DNA fragmentation and any potential impact on
ICSI procedure" (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, we assessed the percentage of DNA fragmentation in the normal and
abnormal sperm populations of each sample. We
observed a significant correlation between the percentage of sperm with normal morphology that
were TUNEL negative with fertilization in sibling
oocytes, this correlation was not observed in the
HOST group. Because sibling oocytes were used,
the reasons for the absence of correlation between
fertilization rate with percentage of normal morphology that were TUNEL negative in the HOST
group could be attributed to the sperm selection
procedure. DNA fragmentation in sperm could result in failure to mature, particularly incomplete
chromatin packaging that caused sperm to be more
prone to DNA fragmentation induced by ROS or
other possible sources (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>- <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, selection of healthy sperm in this procedure might account for improved embryo quality. These results
have agreed with the previous study that evaluated
the potential for HOST to select healthy sperm in
terms of intact chromatin and apoptosis.</p><p>Based on the results of previous and current studies, sperm selection based on HOST patterns has
been shown to improve sperm quality including
chromatin integrity, a low level of apoptosis, and
sperm morphology (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The significantly improved
implantation and chemical pregnancy rates, and
insignificantly improved clinical pregnancy rate
were most likely to be due to the quality of sperm
selected by the HOST procedure. Of note, previous literature on IVF couples has also observed
significant correlations between the percentage of
HOST positive sperm with fertilization, implantation and pregnancy rates (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p> Although the basis of these observations, according to the literature, have been mainly attributed to sperm motility and viability, today we know
these observations could be attributed to sperm
functionality or quality. Therefore the HOST pattern selects sperm based on functionality rather
than sperm viability. In our previous study we have
shown that the percentage of d-sperm or d-HOST
pattern sperm had a significant positive correlation
with sperm concentration and a negative correlation with sperm DNA fragmentation. A retrospective look at our previous data has revealed that
with a higher percentage of HOST positive sperm
in a sample, there would be a lower percentage of
g-pattern sperm with higher DNA fragmentation.
By contrast, in this type of sample, the percentage of d-pattern sperm which shows lower rates of
DNA fragmentation is higher (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By taking into consideration the limitation of this
study, which was patient preference, therefore the
results of this preliminary study and previous study
suggested that selection of sperm according to the
HOST pattern might potentially improve ICSI outcomes. Despite the improvement in this study and
due to the limitations (blinded and randomization)
and shortcomings (slightly higher female age in
the control group and longer duration of infertility), we have proposed that additional clinical trials are necessary to verify these outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their gratitude to Royan
