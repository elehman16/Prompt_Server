This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study to examine the immunogenicity and safety of IIV4 in children 3&#x02013;8 y of age (EudraCT no. 2011-005374-33). Participants were randomized 5:1:1 to receive the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere formulation of IIV4, an investigational trivalent comparator (IIV3) containing the B/Victoria lineage strain, or the licensed Northern Hemisphere IIV3 containing the B/Yamagata lineage strain. Participants who had not previously received a full influenza vaccination schedule received 2 doses of vaccine 28 d apart; all others received a single dose. 1242 children were included. For all 4 strains, IIV4 induced geometric mean haemagglutination inhibition titres non-inferior to those induced by the IIV3 comparators. For both B strains, geometric mean antibody titres induced by IIV4 were superior to those induced by the IIV3 with the alternative lineage strain. Similar proportions of participants vaccinated with IIV4 and IIV3 reported solicited injection-site reactions, solicited systemic reactions, and vaccine-related adverse events. A single vaccine-related serious adverse event, thrombocytopenia, was reported 9 d after vaccination with IIV4 and resolved without sequelae. In conclusion, in children aged 3&#x02013;8 y who received one dose or 2 doses 28 d apart, IIV4 had an acceptable safety profile, was as immunogenic as IIV3 for the shared strains, and had superior immunogenicity for the additional B strain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>haemagglutination inhibition</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>phase III clinical trial</kwd><kwd>quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="10"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current trivalent influenza vaccines contain a single B strain, but since the 1980s, 2 distinct genetic lineages of influenza B virus, Victoria and Yamagata, have been co-circulating worldwide, both of which are responsible for influenza illnesses.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> In the US, in half of the Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons between 1999/2000 and 2011/2012, the B lineage included in the trivalent vaccine was not the same as the dominant circulating B lineage.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing both B lineages are becoming available and should help solve the problem of B strain selection.

The included children were randomized to IIV4 (n = 887), an IIV3 containing the B/Victoria lineage strain (IIV3-1) (n = 181), or and an IIV3 containing the B/Yamagata lineage strain (IIV3-2) (n = 174) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). All but 4 participants were vaccinated. Of the 1238 vaccinated participants, 1208 completed the study. The main reason for not completing the study was voluntary withdrawal not related to an adverse event (AE). One participant discontinued due to a vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE) (thrombocytopenia).

IIV3-1 contained both A strains and the B Victoria lineage strain. IIV3-2 contained both A strains and the B Yamagata lineage strain. All participants received one vaccination at day 0.

Nearly equal numbers of boys and girls were included in the IIV4 and IIV3-2 groups, but the ratio of boys to girls was 1.7 in the IIV3-1 group. Approximately 45% of participants in all groups were primed (i.e. had received a full schedule of seasonal influenza vaccine during a previous influenza season).

</p><p>Overall, there were no major differences in the rates, types, or severity of solicited reactions between the IIV4 and pooled IIV3 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>). In almost all cases, solicited reactions started within 3 d after injection lasted 3 d or less, and were grade 1 (Figure&#x000a0;S1 and data not shown). Less than 6% of participants in the IIV4 and pooled IIV3 groups had grade 3 (severe) injection-site reactions (5.7% for IIV4, 4.2% for IIV3) and less than 5% had grade 3 systemic reactions (4.2% for IIV4, 3.4% for IIV3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0004">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). Rates of solicited reactions were comparable in participants who received a single dose of vaccine and after the second dose in participants who received 2 doses of vaccine (Figure&#x000a0;S1).</p></sec><sec id="s0002-0003-0002"><title>Unsolicited AEs</title><p>Unsolicited AEs were reported by 41.5% of participants in the IIV4 group and 35.6% in the pooled IIV3 group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0004">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were nasopharyngitis (7.1% for IIV4, 6.2% for IIV3) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.8% for IIV4, 4.2% for IIV3). Grade 3 non-serious AEs were reported by 2.0% in the IIV4 group and 2.5% in the pooled IIV3 group.</p><p>One 3-year-old participant in the IIV4 group experienced severe thrombocytopenia, an adverse event of special interest (AESI), 9&#x000a0;days after a first vaccination. The event resolved after 38 d but led to study discontinuation. On long-term follow-up, the platelet level increased and remained stable within normal ranges, indicating that it was a transient event. However, based on the temporal relationship with the vaccination, the event was considered by the investigator to be related to the vaccination. No other unexpected unsolicited AEs were reported.</p><p>Four participants had grade 3 unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be treatment-related. In the IIV4 group, one participant experienced severe vomiting and one experienced severe fatigue, and in the pooled IIV3 group, one participant experienced severe oropharyngeal pain and one experienced severe fever.</p><p>A participant in the IIV4 group experienced several immediate unsolicited AEs (mild cold sweat, dizziness, and pallor) following vaccination. These events, which were considered as related to the vaccination, resolved on the same day and did not recur after the participant received a second vaccination 28 d later.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study showed that in children aged 3 to 8&#x000a0;years, antibody responses induced by IIV4 were non-inferior to those induced by the licensed IIV3 for all matched strains. In addition, IIV4 provided superior immunogenicity against influenza B of both lineages when compared to an IIV3 containing the alternate B strain lineage.</p><p>Despite the relatively high seroprotection rates at baseline, vaccination with IIV4 increased GMTs by at least 6-fold for all 4 vaccine strains. Seroconversion/significant increase rates were 80&#x02013;90% for B strains and 60&#x02013;70% for A strains. Although post-vaccination HAI antibody responses were somewhat lower in primed than unprimed participants, post-vaccination seroprotection rates were always &#x0003e;98% for both IIV3 and IIV4. Also, within the primed and unprimed groups, immunogenicity measures for each strain were similar between IIV4 and the IIV3 containing the strain. Thus, non-inferiority was maintained regardless of priming status.</p><p>The vaccine groups were balanced for all baseline characteristics except that the ratio of boys to girls was higher in the group vaccinated with IIV3-1 than in the other groups. Several studies suggest that females develop stronger antibody responses than males.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, between subjects vaccinated with IIV3-1 and IIV3-2, we did not find any differences in HAI antibody responses against the shared A strains, indicating that this imbalance should not have influenced our findings.</p><p>The high baseline titres observed in this study are not unusual. Even higher baseline titres were found in a phase III study of children and adolescents 9&#x02013;17 y of age examining the immunogenicity and safety of the same (2013/2014) formulation of IIV4. In that study, seroconversion/significant increase rates 21 d after vaccination were only 24.0% for A(H1N1), 20.0% for A(H3N2), 39.0% for B Yamagata lineage (B/Massachusetts), and 48.0% for B Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane) (Lu et&#x000a0;al., unpublished observations). The seroconversion rates in the current study were closer to those in another phase III trial, which reported rates of 62&#x02013;85% in children and adolescents 9&#x02013;17 y of age.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The moderately high baseline titres in the current study were probably mostly due to natural exposure to the same or similar strains in the 2013/2014 formulation of IIV4.</p><p>IIV4 and the IIV3s had similar safety profiles. The overall frequencies of solicited reactions and of unsolicited AEs were similar between the vaccine groups, and few unsolicited AEs were considered vaccine-related. A single SAE of transient severe thrombocytopenia occurred 9 d after the first vaccination with IIV4 in a 3-year-old participant. Due to the temporal relationship with the vaccination, the event was considered to be vaccine-related, although etiology was not established. Only a few other cases of symptomatic thrombocytopenia following influenza vaccination have been reported, most of which have been in adults.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The most frequent explanation for thrombocytopenia in children is infection.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Other possible causes include myelodysplastic syndrome and autoimmune disease.</p><p>Data collected in Finland between 1999 and 2012 showed that an estimated 41.7% of all influenza B infections were caused by B viruses of the lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In Hong Kong between 2000 and 2010, influenza B accounted for the highest rate of infections (41.9%) in children and young adolescents.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Using a conservative estimate that 15% of all influenza illnesses in children were caused by lineage-mismatched B viruses, coupled with 70% vaccine efficacy against all circulating strains and 30% vaccine-induced cross-protection between B strains, the authors of the Hong Kong study estimated that for every 1000 cases of influenza, 60 could be prevented by replacing a trivalent influenza vaccine with a quadrivalent vaccine containing B strains from both lineages.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Thus, young children should benefit from the addition of a second B strain lineage to the inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine. As shown in this study, IIV4 may provide this added coverage without affecting vaccine tolerability and without diminishing the immunogenicity of the 3 other strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Study design and objectives</title><p>This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study performed at 4 centers in Poland, 11 in Finland, 4 in Mexico, and 3 in Taiwan during the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (EudraCT no. 2011-005374-33). The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate, for each strain, non-inferiority of specific antibody responses induced by IIV4 compared with IIV3-1 and IIV3-2. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety profile of each vaccine during the 28 d following each vaccination, to collect SAEs, including AESIs throughout the study; to assess humoral immune response induced by IIV4; and, for the B lineage strains, to demonstrate superiority of antibody responses induced by IIV4 compared to the antibody responses induced by the IIV3 containing the alternate B strain lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0002"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board of each center and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

They were excluded from the study if they had received any vaccine during the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned to receive any vaccination up to 4 weeks after the last trial vaccination; were vaccinated with the current influenza seasonal vaccine formulation in the previous 6 months; had received immune globulins, blood, or blood-derived products in the past 3 months; had known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; had received immunosuppressive therapy within the preceding 6 months; had received long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months); had a known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances; had known or suspected thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion that contraindicated intramuscular vaccination; had chronic illness that could have interfered with trial conduct or completion; or had moderate or severe acute illness or febrile illness (temperature &#x02265; 38.0&#x000b0;C) on the day of vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0004"><title>Vaccination</title><p>IIV4 contained the 4 Northern Hemisphere 2013/2014 influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization and the European Union: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B Victoria lineage), and B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (B Yamagata lineage). IIV3-1 was the 2013/2014 formulation of the licensed IIV3 (Vaxigrip&#x000ae;, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) and contained both A strains and the B Victoria lineage strain. IIV3-2 was an investigational formulation of IIV3 containing both A strains and the B Yamagata lineage strain. All study vaccines were presented in 0.5-ml prefilled syringes. Each 0.5-ml dose contained 15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of hemagglutinin per strain.</p><p>Participants were randomized 5:1:1 to receive IIV4, IIV3-1, or IIV3-2. Randomization was performed with the permuted block method with stratification by site and influenza vaccination status at enrolment (primed or unprimed). Vaccine assignment was via an interactive web or voice response system so that investigators and participants were blinded to the vaccine administered. All participants received one vaccination at day 0. Participants who had not received 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine during a previous season (unprimed participants) received a second dose of vaccine on day 28. Participants were kept under observation for 30&#x000a0;min after each vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0005"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>HAI titres were measured at baseline (day 0) and 28 d after the last vaccination as described previously.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The lower limit of quantitation was set at the reciprocal of the lowest dilution used in the assay (10) and the upper limit of quantitation as the highest dilution used in the assay (10,240).

Severity of solicited reactions were graded 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, and 3 for severe (Table&#x000a0;S4). Investigators recorded safety according to the ICH E2A Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting. Parents or guardians of children participating in the study received a final telephone call 6 months after the last vaccination for the collection of SAEs, including AESIs (anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, encephalitis/myelitis, neuritis, febrile and non-febrile convulsions, thrombocytopenia, and vasculitis).</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0007"><title>Sample size</title><p>A total of 1225 subjects were planned (875 for the IIV4 group and 175 for each IIV3 group).

The primary analysis (non-inferiority) was performed in the per-protocol analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who completed the vaccination schedule, had a post-last vaccination blood sample drawn, and completed the study according to protocol. For each strain, non-inferiority was demonstrated if the 2-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the GMT between IIV4 and that of the comparator IIV3, calculated using a normal approximation of log-transformed titres, was &#x0003e; 2/3. Secondary immunogenicity analysis (superiority) was performed in the full analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and had a post-last vaccination blood sample drawn. For each B strain, superiority was demonstrated if the 2-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the GMT between IIV4 and that of the comparator IIV3, calculated using a normal approximation of log-transformed titres, was &#x0003e; 1. For sensitivity analysis of non-inferiority and superiority, the stratified 2-sided 95% CI of the post-vaccination GMTs ratio between the IIV4 and IIV3 group(s) was calculated using an analysis of variance model (type II) of log<sub>10</sub>-transformed titres, with the vaccination status (primed or unprimed) as the stratifying factor. Descriptive analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the other immunogenicity analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who received the study vaccine and who had available HAI titres at both day 0 and 28 d after the last vaccination, with analysis according to the vaccine actually received. Safety endpoints were assessed in the safety analysis set, defined as all participants who received IIV4 or IIV3 (pooled), with analysis according to the treatment received.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM9756"><caption><title>KHVI_A_1212143_Supplement.zip</title></caption><media xlink:href="khvi-12-12-1212143-s001.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" orientation="portrait" id="d37e373" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>
