Migraine can be ameliorated in some patients by life-style advice, and when troublesome, requires treatment of both attacks and strategies to reduce attack frequency with preventives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While much has been determined about the biology of migraine in recent times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the future is promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], much needs to be done for the burden on patients and society that migraine brings. A particular issue in migraine is that of side effects, such as weight gain with many preventives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], or vascular issues with acute attack therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], or both, are driving a need for new effective and well tolerated treatments.</p><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was first described in 1985 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and followed seminal work by Merton, Morton and Marsden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] who had used electrical stimulation of the cortex to dissect questions around the cortical influence on motor reflexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and had found the stimulus painful to subjects. sTMS is a non-invasive, safe and painless method of activating the human motor cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. TMS is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. A pulse of current passes through a coil located within the device and when the device is placed over a person&#x02019;s head for a very short duration, it aims to depolarise neurons rapidly within a target area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given early suggestions of an effect of sTMS in migraine with aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], single pulse TMS was studied in cortical spreading depression (CSD) in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as CSD in rat is considered an excellent model of human aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. sTMS inhibits CSD in rat and cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has no effect on nociceptive trigeminocervical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], while it certainly inhibits nociceptive trigeminothalamic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>sTMS has been shown to be effective in acute migraine treatment in patients with migraine with aura in a sham-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, it is well accepted to be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The device is CE-marked in Europe, so it can be used in clinical practice. The SpringTMS device was introduced to open clinical practice through the post-market pilot program in the UK and migraine patients, both with and without aura, were selected for this treatment. The aim of this program was to assess the impact of sTMS on migraine symptoms and treatment during an initial 3&#x000a0;month treatment period: assessing the effect on pain severity, associated migraine symptoms, attack duration and acute medication use. Patients prescribed treatment from December 2012, were also asked to provide data on disability (HIT-6). We report on the treatment outcomes over a 3&#x000a0;year period, having presented interim outcomes previously in an abbreviated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty specialist headache clinics in the UK participated in the post market pilot program, which commenced in June 2011 following receipt of the CE mark for the SpringTMS device.

The open label data extends the treatment experience to patients with migraine without aura and chronic migraine, doing so based on preclinical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and interestingly the results seem broadly comparable. The data suggest there is a cumulative effect, in that patients do better the longer they are treated, that attacks are shortened, typically by about 1&#x000a0;day and that acute medication use is reduced. From a functional viewpoint, disability scores as recorded with HIT-6 are reduced. Importantly there were no serious or unanticipated adverse events, in keeping with the generally excellent tolerability of the sTMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Taken together the data support the use of sTMS in migraine.</p><p>During the majority of this pilot programme, patients selected were typically those who could not use established acute migraine medications due to intolerable side effects, lack of efficacy or inadequate efficacy or they had medical contraindications to the medicines. Therefore, it was not an aim to look at the impact of sTMS on their medication use and reliance on acute treatments. However, as the programme evolved, patients were prescribed sTMS who also used acute medications regularly. This enabled an additional outcome where many patients reported a reduction in use of acute medicines. This may reflect a combination of factors such as shorter attack duration, reduced number of migraine days and effective pain relief from sTMS. This is a potential significant advantage for sTMS and requires further exploration.</p><p>Over time, it also became important to measure the impact of the benefit to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An important goal of any treatment is to improve the quality of life for the sufferer. The impact of sTMS on alleviating migraine symptoms also had a significant impact on levels of disability. Reduced attack duration resulted in fewer headache days, less suffering and reduced migraine disability as reflected in HIT-6 scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; HIT-6 is known to be sensitive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Adherence to use is another surrogate for effect, since patients tend in general to abandon ineffective therapies. Patients responding to sTMS maintained use, which likely reflects its utility.</p><p>There are few safe medication treatments for patients during pregnancy and sTMS may be an option to consider for this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The three patients who treated during pregnancy demonstrated safety and efficacy and derived adequate benefit, and may prove to be an additional treatment option for this patient group. We could not generalise these numbers to a blanket recommendation; suffice to say medical treatment of pregnant, disabled migraine sufferers is very challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and any new, apparently safe approach needs very serious consideration. In this vein it probably worth considering the TMS load that is offered in the treatment of depression with repetitive TMS (rTMS). A recent meta-analysis lists a range of stimuli from 1 to 2&#x000a0;Hz for 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;s with anywhere from 30 to 2,500 pulses per session for between 4 and 20 sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which is compared in sTMS to at most eight pulses in a day. Taken together with the estimated field strength at the apex of the fundus at term, which is about the same as three exposures to a microwave oven, and is shorter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], sTMS is worth clinicians&#x02019; consideration.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study is an open-label patient experience without randomisation or allocation by protocol based on the licensed safety of the device and the data that exist. We sought to evaluate the device in practice. There will be a component of the placebo effect which for acute treatment would be between 10 and 25&#x000a0;%, depending on whether there was moderate/severe or mild pain at baseline. For a preventive treatment the placebo effect is assumed to be more substantial, although recent data suggests that may not be the case. The fact that the effect built up may be either a regression to the mean or a true evolution of the treatment effect. The botulinum toxin experience suggests that placebo can be seen over many weeks. Data are certainly missing, as one would expect from clinical practice, and this may have inflated the outcomes. It was a major issue that a substantial group could not be evaluated for logistic reasons of participation, although since this was limited to one site, the impact seems mitigated. Despite all the limitations, the outcomes are generally positive and the therapy very well tolerated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The sTMS device has demonstrated safety, efficacy and very good tolerability as an acute migraine treatment in open clinic settings. Our recent analysis suggests there may be a cost advantage to sTMS in the preventive setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and such factors need to be considered as healthcare decisions are made going forward. It thus provided an effective treatment option for patients who could not treat, or treat adequately, with existing treatments. Further clinical use is warranted and careful follow-up will help determine its place in modern therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>RB (rbhola@eneura.com) was employed part-time by eNeura Inc.</p><p>EK (ekinsella@eneura.com) was employed part-time by eNeura Inc.</p><p>NG (Nicola.Giffin@nhs.net) has nothing to declare.</p><p>SL (suelipscombe1@ntlworld.com) has nothing to declare.</p><p>FA (Fayyaz.Ahmed@hey.nhs.uk) is on advisory Boards for Allergan, Electrocore and Eneura.
