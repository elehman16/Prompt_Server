leg strength, postural balance and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older
adults. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-two older adults were randomly allocated either to
the experimental group (EG, n = 16; mean age, 63.62 &#x000b1; 1.02&#x02005;years), which performed two
sessions of Pilates per week for 12 weeks, or to the control group (CG, n = 16; mean age,
64.21 &#x000b1; 0.80), which performed two sessions of static stretching per week for 12 weeks.
The following evaluations were performed before and after the interventions: isokinetic
torque of knee extensors and flexors at 300&#x000b0;/s, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Berg
Balance Scale, and the Health Survey assessment (SF-36). [Results] In the intra-group
analysis, the EG demonstrated significant improvement in all variables. In the inter-group
analysis, the EG demonstrated significant improvement in most variables. [Conclusion]
Pilates exercises led to significant improvement in isokinetic torque of the knee
extensors and flexors, postural balance and aspects of the health-related quality of life
of older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Age</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength dynamometer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The proportion of older adults has been growing throughout the world. In Brazil, where the
classification of older adult begins at the age of sixty years, 12.6% of the population is
currently in this phase of life that elderly and this figure is expected to rise to 26.7% by
the year 2060<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase in the older
population and the frailty individuals can experience have led to growing concerns among
healthcare professionals, who are seeking strategies that can diminish the occurrence of
events that place the health of older adults at risk<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sarcopenia and the consequent loss of muscle strength and endurance that can occur in older
adults potentiates the risk of falls, as postural balance and functional mobility are also
affected<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. To attenuate these aspects, physical exercise is used to build
muscle mass, strength and endurance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
thereby improving postural balance, which reduces the risk of falls<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and improves quality of life<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, some forms of physical exercise that provide progressive
resistance training have been under-investigated, such as Pilates. This method was developed
during World War I by the German, Joseph Hubertus Pilates, and involves resistance provided
by the subject&#x02019;s own body weight in exercises conducted on the floor or the resistance of
springs attached to equipment employed while practicing the method<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pilates has recently gained in popularity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and seems to be an efficient manner of strengthening the muscles of
the trunk (core training)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, postural
balance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and aspects of quality of
life<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, little is known
regarding the effects of Pilates when the focus is on the lower limb muscles. We
hypothesized that a Pilates exercise protocol with equipment that prioritizes strengthening
the lower legs could have a positive effect on the muscle strength, postural balance and
quality of life of older adults. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the
isokinetic torque of the knee extensors and flexors, static and dynamic balance, functional
mobility and quality of life of community-dwelling older adults who performed a Pilates
exercise protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical norms established in the
Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised in 1983) and received approval from the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Norte do Paran&#x000e1; (Brazil) under process number
513.001. All volunteers signed a statement of informed consent. A randomized, controlled,
clinical trial was conducted involving community-dwelling older adults in the city of
Jacarezinho, State of Paran&#x000e1;, Brazil. The sample size was calculated using the peak
isokinetic torque reported in a previous study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering a 20% error rate and &#x003b1; value of 0.05, it was
determined that 16 participants would be required for each group to give the results
sufficient statistical power.</p><p>The following were the inclusion criteria: age 60 to 65&#x02005;years; female gender; the ability
to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living without assistance; a body mass
index (BMI) within the ideal range for the age group (22 to 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; a statement from a physician indicating
sufficient fitness for the practice of physical exercises; not having practiced any type of
physical exercise in the previous six months; and agreement not to participate in any other
type of physical exercise during the study. The following were the exclusion criteria:
cognitive deficit (score &#x0003c; 19 on Mini Mental Health Examination)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>; functional walking limitations or use of a
gait-assistance device (cane, walker or crutches); an affirmative answer to any item on a
questionnaire for the identification of severe visual impairment, osteoarthosis of the knee
or hip; and a history of orthopedic surgery of the hips, knees or ankles. Among the
volunteers who met the eligibility criteria, 32 were included in the study and all were duly
informed about its objectives and procedures.</p><p>The volunteers were submitted to an initial evaluation of the isokinetic strength of the
knee extensors and flexors at 300 degrees per second (300&#x000b0;/s), as well as balance and
functional mobility tests. The volunteers also answered a quality of life questionnaire.
Randomization was then performed using a random numbers table generated by a computer, which
allocated the individuals to the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG), each
comprising 16 participants. The EG performed Pilates exercises and the CG performed static
stretching exercises. For both groups, 20 exercises were selected to encompass the main body
segments (lower limbs, upper limbs, trunk flexors and extensors) in 60-minute sessions held
twice a week for 12 weeks, with a minimum of two days between sessions. After the
interventions, the volunteers were evaluated again by the same rater and submitted to the
same evaluations performed prior to the interventions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing the progression of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-871-g001"/></fig> illustrates the sequence of events.</p><p>An isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4.0, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) was
calibrated following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and used to determine the muscle
strength of the knee extensors and flexors before and after the exercise protocols. Prior to
exercise, the participants warmed up on a stationary bike with a light load (25 watts) at a
comfortable speed (40 rotations per minute) for five minutes. The rater then explained the
procedures in detail and positioned the volunteer on the seat of the equipment with the
chair angled at 120 degrees.</p><p>The rotation axis of the arm of the dynamometer was aligned with the lateral epicondyle of
the right femur. The site of the application of force was positioned approximately two
centimeters above the medial malleolus. Straps were attached to the trunk, pelvis and thigh
to avoid compensatory movements<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Following brief familiarization with the equipment and range of motion, the subjects
performed extension and flexion of the knee (concentric/concentric) at an angular velocity
of 300&#x000b0;/s beginning with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The subjects were instructed to
perform maximum voluntary contraction of the knee extensors, followed immediately by maximum
voluntary contraction of the knee flexors in a continuous fashion. The rater gave verbal
encouragement (&#x0201c;more force&#x0201d;). Three sets of five repetitions were performed with a 30-second
rest interval between sets<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The same
procedure was then performed with the left leg. Peak torque (expressed as Newtons per meter)
and total work (expressed as Joules) was recorded.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> was employed to
evaluate static and dynamic balance. This ordinal scale is based on 14 tasks of daily
living, such as reaching for an object, turning around, transfers, standing up, standing
with feet together, etc., and is an efficient tool for detecting the likelihood of falls.
Each task has five response options scored from 0 to 4 points. The maximum score is 56
points and indicates a low likelihood of falls, whereas scores &#x02264; 45 points indicate a high
likelihood of falls. The test takes 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The following equipment is
necessary for the test: a stopwatch or clock, bed, footstool, two chairs (one with arm rests
and one without) and a ruler.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go (TUG)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> test was
used to evaluate functional mobility and the risk of falls. Upon the command &#x0201c;go&#x0201d;, the
subjects stood up from a chair with arm rests, walked three meters to a mark placed on the
floor, turned around, walked back to the chair, and sat down again. The stopwatch was
started with the command &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; and stopped when the volunteer had sat down again, and the
time was recorded. Less than 10 seconds to complete the task is considered indicative of a
low risk of falls; 10 to 20 seconds is considered indicative of a moderate risk of falls and
more than 20 seconds is considered indicative of a high risk of falls. The test was
performed three times and the best time was used in the analysis.</p><p>The Brazilian version of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> was used for the assessment of health-related quality of
life. This questionnaire has 36 items distributed among eight subscales: physical
functioning (10 items), physical role functioning (four items), bodily pain (two items),
general health state (five items), vitality (four items), social role functioning (two
items), emotional role functioning (three items) and mental health (five items). The score
ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores denoting a better quality of life.</p><p>The EG performed 60-minute sessions of Pilates held twice a week for 12 weeks (total of 24
sessions). The first session was used to familiarize the subjects with Pilates, explain the
correct execution of each movement, and to provide a greater understanding of the principles
of the method. The following equipment was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.

(Institute of Orthopedics and Physical Therapy, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). Twenty strengthening and
stretching exercises were used for the main body segments (lower limbs, upper limbs, trunk
flexors and extensors). The exercise sequence, equipment and traditional names of each
exercise were as follows:</p><p>a) Initial stretching on the Cadillac trapeze table (<italic>Spine Stretch, Mermaid,

Pumping One Leg, Pump One Leg Front, Achilles Stretch</italic>) and the Cadillac trapeze
table (<italic>Leg Series Supine Lowers, Leg Series Supine Circles</italic>);</p><p>c) Strengthening of trunk flexors and extensors on the Cadillac trapeze table (<italic>Sit
Up, Sit Up One Leg, The Hundred, Trunk Up, Body Extension</italic>);</p><p>d) Strengthening of the lower limbs on the universal reformer (<italic>Arms Pulling, Arms
Biceps, Arms Triceps</italic>);</p><p>e) Final stretches on the universal reformer (<italic>Front Splits, Stretching the
Posterior Chain</italic>) and ladder barrel (<italic>Stretch Back and
Forward</italic>).</p><p>All exercises were performed with one set of ten repetitions. The spring intensity was
changed based on the progress of each volunteer while maintaining the same number of
repetitions. The Borg CR10 scale<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> was
used to determine the level of effort and load progression: Borg &#x02264; 2 = light load; Borg &#x0003e;
2 to &#x0003c; 5 = moderate load; Borg &#x02265; 5 to &#x0003c; 7 = heavy load; Borg &#x02265; 7 = close to maximum
load. The level of effort maintained during the sessions was moderate (Borg 3 and 4).
Whenever the exercise intensity was changed, the new load was recorded on individual
charts.</p><p>The exercises were selected to improve overall muscle strength, as traditionally employed
with Pilates<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, but greater emphasis was
given to strengthening the lower limbs to meet the objectives of the present study. The
volunteers received clarifications regarding the principles of the method (centering,
control, concentration, flow, precision and respiration) that need to be respected during
the execution of each exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
sessions were supervised by a professional with a Pilates certificate and ample experience
of supervising the method.</p><p>The CG performed static stretching exercises (no strengthening exercises) in 60-minute
sessions for 12 weeks (total of 24 sessions). Twenty exercises were used for the following
regions of the body: neck and upper limbs (superior trapezius, scalene muscles,
sternocleidomastoid muscles, flexors and extensors of the wrists and fingers, deltoid,
triceps and pectoral muscles), lateral chain stretches and lower limbs (oblique muscles,
quadratus lumborum, hamstrings, adductors, gluteal muscles, abductors and triceps surae).
The exercises were performed actively, with three sets of one repetition maintained for 30
seconds and a one-minute rest interval between sets. Mats made of ethylene vinyl acetate
were used. The subjects remained seated, lying in the supine position or standing, depending
on the stretching exercise being performed. All sessions were supervised by a trained
professional.</p><p>Descriptive analysis was performed and the data were expressed as the mean and standard
deviation. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine differences between groups in
baseline characteristics (age, weight, height and BMI). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to
determine the normality of the data. For data with a normal distribution, two-way
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test was used to
determine the significance of differences in both the intra-group and inter-group analyses.
The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for non
parametric variables. The level of confidence was chosen as 95% (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The SPSS 20.0
program (SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No statistically significant differences between the groups were found in the physical

the effects of such methods on variables of interest. The literature states that Pilates can
contribute to the improvement of postural balance, consequently reducing the risk of
falls<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, through muscle strengthening
of the muscles responsible for lumbopelvic stabilization, such as the flexors and extensors
of the trunk<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
demonstrated that the practice of Pilates also resulting in improvements in quality of life
among community-dwelling older adults<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As few studies have addressed Pilates as a form of progressive resistance exercise, the aim
of the present investigation was to determine the isokinetic torque of the knee extensors
and flexors achieved by this form of exercise as well as its effects on static/dynamic
balance and functional mobility. Quality of life was also measured to determine whether
older adults performing this method would show changes in the different domains addressed by
the SF-36 questionnaire.</p><p>In the EG, peak isokinetic torque improved significantly after the intervention in both
legs with regard to both extension and flexion of the knee at 300&#x000b0;/s. Although isokinetic
torque is a reliable variable for the evaluation of muscle strength, no previous studies
addressing the effects of Pilates have analyzed this variable. However, investigations have
found that progressive resistance exercises with the use of weights are effective for gains
in isokinetic torque of the knee extensors and flexors in older adults<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Carvalho et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> compared training
involving strengthening, flexibility, balance and aerobic exercises with and without
resistance exercises for older adults in two weekly sessions for 24 weeks. The group
performing the combined protocol with resistance exercises demonstrated a significantly
greater improvement in knee extensors and flexors (60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s) for the majority of
variables tested. Romero-Arenas et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>
compared high resistance training to traditional strength training performed in two weekly
sessions for 12 weeks and found that both protocols led to significant improvement in
isokinetic force of the knee extensors and flexors (90&#x000b0;/s and 270&#x000b0;/s) in older adults. Van
Roie et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> found that both low and
high resistance training with weights led to significant improvements in isokinetic force of
the knee extensors and flexors at 180&#x000b0;/s after three weekly sessions for 12 weeks, whereas
no significant difference was found at 60&#x000b0;/s.</p><p>Among the studies cited above, Romero-Arenas et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> used a protocol similar to that employed in the present
investigation with regard to frequency and duration (two weekly sessions for 12 weeks), and
one of the angular velocities (270&#x000b0;/s) was similar to that employed herein. The other two
studies used either a different frequency (three times a week)<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> or duration (24 weeks)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as lower angular velocities (60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s) for the
evaluation of isokinetic torque. The use of different angular velocities (60&#x000b0;/s, 180&#x000b0;/s and
270&#x000b0;/s) hinders the comparison of the findings reported in the present study, in which
300&#x000b0;/s was used. However, it was demonstrated that Pilates contributes significantly to
isokinetic torque and is an effective form of progressive resistance training for older
adults eliciting gains in muscle strength when performed at a similar frequency and duration
to the exercises employed in studies involving traditional training with the use of
weights.</p><p>In the present study, Pilates led to significant improvements in postural balance and
functional mobility, as demonstrated by the 1.81-point improvement on the Berg Balance Scale
(p = 0.0081) and the 1.95-second improvement in the TUG test (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in the EG.
However, few studies addressing the use of Pilates for older adults have employed these
measures. Hyun, Hwangbo and Lee<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> found a
4.47-second improvement in the TUG test (p &#x0003c; 0.05) among older adults after 12 weeks of a
Pilates protocol with three weekly sessions. Bird, Hill and Fell<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> found a 0.90-second improvement in the TUG test (p &#x0003c;
0.05) among older adults after five weeks of a Pilates protocol with two weekly
sessions.</p><p>Other studies employing forms of progressive resistance training other than Pilates for
older adults have demonstrated the effects of exercise protocols using the Berg Balance
Scale and TUG test<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yu, An and Kang<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed the effects of an elastic exercise band protocol for older
adults which was performed three times a week for five weeks, but found no significant
changes in the Berg or TUG scores. Yoo, Chung and Byoung<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed a protocol involving muscle strengthening exercises
combined with balance training developed specifically to improve the balance of older adults
and compared the results with those achieved using virtual reality/enhanced reality
training. Both protocols were performed three times a week for 12 weeks and both led to
significant improvements on the Berg Balance Scale from 48.91 to 52.45 points and from 47.60
to 53.70 points, respectively. Beebe et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> found that two weekly sessions of progressive isokinetic force
training combined with balance training and dance for 12 weeks led to an improvement in the
Berg Balance Scale score from 45 to 52 points and a 5.4-second improvement in the time
needed to complete the TUG test among older adults with a history of falls. Avelar et
al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> compared lower limb muscle
strengthening exercises for older adults performed in and out of an aquatic medium twice a
week for six weeks and found that both protocols led to a significant increase in the Berg
score from 51 to 54.5 points and from 50.5 to 54 points, respectively.</p><p>Studies have used other measures (Tinetti test and force plate) for the determination of
the postural balance of older adults practicing Pilates and they too have reported
significant results (p &#x0003c; 0.05) when exercise sessions were held twice a week for eight
weeks<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, or three times a week for 12
weeks<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the
decision was made to hold sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, and this was sufficient to
achieve significant improvements in postural balance and functional mobility, as measured on
the Berg Balance Scale and in the TUG test. In previous studies that employed the same
measures<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, a large portion of the investigations that reported significant
results also used a 12-week protocol with two or three weekly sessions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, some studies have reported significant results
with shorter protocols, i.e. two weekly sessions for five or six weeks<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the EG demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life (p
&#x0003c; 0.05) on all subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire, whereas the CG only demonstrated an
improvement in social role functioning. In a previous study on the effects of Pilates on the
quality of life of healthy older adults, significant improvements were found on three of the
six subscales of the WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire after two weekly sessions held for eight
weeks<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies employing the SF-36 to
assess healthy older adults performed progressive resistance training with weights have
reported divergent results. After 12 weeks of training in two weekly sessions, Mariano et
al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> found significant differences in
physical functioning, general health state, vitality and mental health subscales of the
SF-36. In contrast, Kimura et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> found
a significant difference only on the mental health subscale after 12 weeks of training with
two weekly sessions. In the present study, significant differences were found on all SF-36
subscales using the same training frequency and duration. Quality of life is a subjective
variable that has been under-investigated in studies involving older adults performing
physical exercise protocols. However, the present findings suggest that a short period of
Pilates can effectively improve all eight domains of quality of life assessed by the SF-36
questionnaire. It is possible that protocols lasting more than 12 weeks may achieve even
better results. Indeed, Vieira et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>
found significantly higher scores on the SF-36 subscales of individuals practicing Pilates
for more than a year in comparison to ex-practitioners and those who practiced the method
for only three months.</p><p>The present study provides important information that can be used as a basis for future
investigations. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of Pilates for older
adults. Few data are available in the literature on the isokinetic torque of the knee
extensors and flexors, static and dynamic balance, functional mobility and quality of life
of older adults performing Pilates.</p><p>Based on the present findings, Pilates performed with equipment elicits improvements in
lower limb muscle strength, static and dynamic postural balance, functional mobility and
quality of life of older adults when performed in two weekly sessions for 12 weeks. Thus,
Pilates is an efficient form of progressive resistance training for the variables analyzed
herein.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">IBGE: Instituto Brasileiro de
