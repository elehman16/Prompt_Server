Motor disturbances due to Parkinson's disease can be relieved by medications containing levodopa or dopaminergic agonists, and the majority of patients are treated with these drugs over a long period of time. Motor complications, such as dyskinesias and motor fluctuations, are often observed in long-term treated patients. Deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamus is an efficacious treatment for dyskinesias and motor fluctuations; however, this surgical procedure is invasive and indications are limited <xref rid="pone.0015298-Benabid1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Motor complications such as dyskinesias impair quality of life and are difficult to control <xref rid="pone.0015298-Chapuis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; de-escalation of levodopa reduces dyskinesias, but is often associated with worsened motor symptoms.</p><p>Studies have suggested that dyskinesias are due to over-release of dopamine <xref rid="pone.0015298-Carta1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, hypersensitivity of striatal dopamine receptors <xref rid="pone.0015298-Corvol1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, or both. Animal dyskinesia experimental models have revealed that the NR2B subunit of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor is redistributed from synaptic sites to extra-synaptic sites in the striatum <xref rid="pone.0015298-Hallett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The altered discharge pattern of striatal medium spiny neurons plays an important role in dyskinesias <xref rid="pone.0015298-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and depolarization of these neurons requires glutamatergic inputs <xref rid="pone.0015298-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015298-Plenz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Severity of dyskinesias was not considered as an eligibility criterion. Subjects were excluded due to the following: (1) treatment with amantadine hydrochloride in the previous two weeks; (2) psychiatric symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations or delusions (patients with a past history of visual hallucination were included); (3) estimated creatinine clearance &#x0003c;75 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, according to the Cockcroft-Gault formulation; (4) significant liver damage; (5) pregnancy or possible pregnancy; or (6) history of epilepsy.
