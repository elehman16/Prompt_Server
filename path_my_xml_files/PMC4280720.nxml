The patients in the inhalation aromatherapy group inhaled two drops of 2% lavender essential oil and those in the control group inhaled two drops of distilled water as placebo for 20 min on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> days after surgery. The level of anxiety was evaluated by Spielberger's State Anxiety questionnaire before and after intervention and the vital signs were documented as well.

Aromatherapy is a natural treatment method that utilizes the chemical structure and effects of essential oils. It can be applied in various forms such as massage, inhalation, compress, and baths with herbal and mineral substances. Use of aromatherapy has grown substantially in recent years compared to other medical approaches.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Inhalation aromatherapy is a technique in which essential oils are used in inhalation,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which can decrease pain, anxiety, depression, and improve the vital signs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Lavender is one such plant that is widely used in aromatherapy, with aromatic leaves and attractive bracts at the top of flowers. Some of its effects are sedative, antidepressant, antispasmodic, antibacterial, and local anesthetic. It also can be used in relieving migraines and insomnia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Studies about the benefits of lavender's aroma showed that linalool and linalyl acetate present in this plant can stimulate parasympathetic system.

The intensive care nurses have an important role in assessment of anxiety and changes in vital signs, implementation of appropriate measures, and evaluation of therapeutic effects. Accordingly, this study was carried out with an aim to investigate the effects of inhalation aromatherapy using lavender oil to reduce anxiety in patients after CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>A double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients who had undergone CABG in Ekbatan Therapeutic and Educational Center, Hamadan city, Iran.

In order to avoid inductive effect of the medication, both patients and interviewers were unaware of the treatment each patient had received. For this purpose, the medications were given to the patients by one researcher and the effect of treatments was evaluated by another researcher independently.</p><p>The inclusion criteria included the absence of (a) chronic respiratory disease, (b) addiction to alcohol or narcotic substances, (c) history of head trauma or convulsion, (d) impaired sense of smell, (e) using anti-anxiety drugs, and (f) acute mental illness according to physician diagnosis and obtaining a score of less than 20 with Spielberger's questionnaire.

The data collection tool included a questionnaire with two parts and a checklist of items. The first part of the questionnaire contained demographic information such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), educational level, and marital status. Additional information obtained included history of hospitalization or open heart surgery in the family, as well as the duration of operation and admission in the ICU. For assessing the scientific validity of this part of the questionnaire, content validity was used.</p><p>The second part of the questionnaire consisted of the standard questionnaire of Spielberger. It included 20 questions related to the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The least score of 20 that could be obtained indicated no anxiety and the maximum score of 80 illustrated the highest level of anxiety. A score of 21-39 indicated mild anxiety. A score of 40-59 indicated moderate anxiety, and a score of 60-80 indicated severe anxiety.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This questionnaire enjoys universal validity and reliability.

In Conrad <italic>et al.</italic>'s study, 15-min sessions as 2 times per week for 4 consecutive weeks were used, whereas 20-min sessions for two consecutive days were used in the present study.

These results could be influenced by the relationship between specific smell and stressful experience in coronary artery bypass surgery. Applying inhalation aromatherapy with lavender essential oil can be considered by nurses, physicians, and other members of the treatment team based on the results of this study and also since using complementary methods reduces the side effects of medications. Further studies about the long-term effects of usage of this method for reducing anxiety are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>We offer our best thanks and gratitude to the authorities of Hamadan Nursing and Midwifery School, Deputy of Research and Technology of the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, authority and staffs of Ekbatan Hospital of Hamadan city, and dear CABG patients who participated in this research.
