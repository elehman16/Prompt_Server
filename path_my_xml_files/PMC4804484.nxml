The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of photoplethysmography on the incidence of postoperative complications compared with the conventional hemodynamic algorithm, which uses mean arterial pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The hemodynamic optimization using photoplethysmography (PANEX3) trial is a monocentric, randomized, single-blind, controlled, two parallel arm, superiority trial, randomizing 160 patients with an intermediate risk of postoperative complications after colorectal surgery. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The hemodynamic optimization is conducted using a specified hemodynamic algorithm either with photoplethysmography (the photoplethysmography group) or with conventional mean arterial pressure (the control group). The anesthesiologist performed a 1:1 randomization the day before surgery using a scratch card, which is available 24/7. The randomization sequence is generated using permutated blocks. Both the patients and surgeons are blinded to the allocation group. The primary outcome is the incidence of at least one postoperative complication during the 30&#x000a0;days following surgery. Two independent experts, who were blinded to the group allocations, validate the complication for each patient using an a priori classification. The secondary outcomes are to study the total number of postoperative complications, the real length of hospital stays, and the postoperative mortality between each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PANEX3 trial is the first randomized controlled study conducted to investigate whether perioperative hemodynamic optimization using photoplethysmography during colorectal surgery could decrease the incidence of patients having at least one postoperative complication.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02343601?term=NCT02343601&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02343601</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anesthesiology</kwd><kwd>Hemodynamic</kwd><kwd>Abdominal surgery</kwd><kwd>Plethysmography</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Although more than 320 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], recent data show that the perioperative morbidity and mortality remain significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The concept of perioperative hemodynamic optimization is important to decrease the morbidity and length of the hospital stay after noncardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, expert guidelines recommend a maximization of stroke volume using titrated fluid loading with cardiac output monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, although such a strategy has been shown to be beneficial for patients, it is rarely used at the bedside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The invasiveness of cardiac output monitoring, lack of knowledge, and time constraints could partially explain these disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Noninvasive and plug-and-play cardiac output monitoring could increase the adherence to the guidelines. Using a simple finger sensor, the plethysmography displays continuous blood pressure and beat-to-beat cardiac output measurements. Previous studies reported encouraging results with this technology during the perioperative period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, no phase III study has been conducted to assess the clinical utility of photoplethysmography to decrease the perioperative morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a benefit remains to be established.</p><p>The PANEX3 study aims to compare in patients with an intermediate risk of postoperative complications after colorectal surgery the effects of photoplethysmography using a perioperative hemodynamic optimization algorithm with a conventional hemodynamic algorithm that uses mean arterial pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics and study design</title><p>The perioperative hemodynamic optimization using photoplethysmography in colorectal surgery (PANEX3) study is a randomized, controlled, two-arm trial.

For the per-protocol analysis (sensitivity analysis), the handling of missing data (surgery cancelled, failure of photoplethysmography monitoring, or serious undesirable event during the surgery) will be anticipated, with five supplemental patients being included for each group. Nevertheless, all randomized patients will be analyzed in the allocated group for the main intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, to comply with the intent-to-treat analysis, missing data for the primary outcome will handled by multiple imputations (PROC MI in SAS) and analyzed in sensitivity analyses using PROC MIANALYZE in SAS V9.4 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical plan</title><p>Categorical variables will be described as percentages, and continuous variables will be described as mean (Standard Deviation) or median (interquartile range), as appropriate.

The PANEX3 trial is the first randomized controlled study powered to investigate the photoplethysmography as a noninvasive hemodynamic tool in patients scheduled for colorectal surgery compared with the conventional hemodynamic algorithm using mean arterial pressure.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the trial is the incidence of at least one postoperative complication. Two independent experts validate the presence of the complication using an a priori classification in accordance with recent guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These experts are not involved in the study and do not work at the same university hospital. They are also blinded to the group allocation. These procedures reinforce the internal validity of the present study. The objective to show a decrease of 50&#x000a0;% in the main goal could be challenging, but this result is in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and can be considered clinically relevant. If the photoplethysmography algorithm is easy, safe, and effective to use, then this technology could be integrated to the concept of perioperative surgical home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, another study was designed alongside the PANEX3 trial, and it is investigating the medico-economic aspect of photoplethysmography.</p><p>The present study propose a hemodynamic algorithm with photoplethysmography using both stroke volume maximization and continuous mean arterial pressure monitoring compared with a control algorithm using only intermittent mean arterial pressure measurements. Recently, a large retrospective study has described the possible relation between value and duration of arterial hypotension during anesthesia and poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An algorithm with continuous monitoring of arterial pressure could decrease the duration of hypotension in comparison with conventional intermittent arterial pressure measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but no outcome study is available with a hemodynamic algorithm using continuous arterial pressure monitoring. The PANEX3 study, which uses a complete and continuous hemodynamic algorithm (mean arterial pressure and stroke volume), is designed to evaluate this strategy.</p><p>The limitations of the study require some comment. First, the study population was restricted to colorectal surgery in patients with an intermediate surgical risk. However, the length of surgery and postsurgical recovery time can be long, explaining a possible key role of hemodynamic optimization during this period. Further studies could be developed in other type of surgeries with intermediate surgical risk. Second, the study population was not selected as high-risk surgery because the photoplethysmography hemodynamic monitoring is considered of benefit for the intermediate surgical risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this population of patients is the more frequently encountered population in practice. Inclusion criteria were large for the study population, reinforcing the external validity of the study.</p><p>In conclusion, PANEX3 is a controlled randomized trial powered to test the hypothesis that perioperative hemodynamic optimization using photoplethysmography could decrease the incidence of at least one postoperative complication. The PANEX3 trial also evaluates the impact of a hemodynamic algorithm using photoplethysmography on the total number of postoperative complications, the real length of the hospital stay, and the postoperative mortality.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing and actively enrolling.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>eCRF</term><def><p>electronic case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>institutional review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IWRS</term><def><p>interactive web response system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>mean arterial pressure</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MOF participated in the design of the study and wrote the manuscript.
