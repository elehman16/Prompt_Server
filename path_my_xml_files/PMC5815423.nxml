They have been available in the US market since 1992, and have good evidence in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and safety (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr5-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The triptans are available in several formulations: Oral tablet, orally disintegrating tablet, nasal spray, nasal powder, rectal suppository, and subcutaneous delivery with or without needle. The latter three formulations are available for sumatriptan only, and the suppository is only available outside the US.</p><p>Migraine attacks are not only associated with gastric symptoms (most notably nausea), but also with gastric dysfunction (gastroparesis), resulting in delayed absorption of enterically-absorbed medications (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The delayed absorption particularly affects the time to maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) and negatively affects efficacy (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Delayed absorption is not only relevant for oral tablets and orally disintegrating tablets, it also pertains to nasal spray formulations as up to 86% of intranasally-administered sumatriptan (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and 70% of intranasally-administered zolmitriptan (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) is absorbed through the gut.</p><p>Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray (ADAM) is a new drug delivery system for intracutaneous self-administration. It consists of a 3&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> disposable array of drug-coated titanium microprojections on an adhesive backing. It is applied using a low-cost, reusable, handheld applicator. The applicator is designed to ensure that the same energy is applied across multiple uses and is user-independent. The microprojections penetrate the stratum corneum, where the drug coating is rapidly reconstituted by interstitial fluid in the skin, making it available for absorption. The shallow depth of penetration and the minuteness of the microprojections limit the likelihood of stimulating sensory nerve endings. The ADAM adhesive is removed manually after 30 minutes and discarded without the need for &#x0201c;sharps&#x0201d; disposal (<xref rid="bibr10-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Zolmitriptan has been formulated for delivery using ADAM as an investigational product for acute migraine treatment. In a Phase 1 study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan delivered with ADAM, the median time to maximum serum concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) was less than 20 minutes, which was comparable to subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in the same study. Absorption was considerably faster than for oral zolmitriptan, with higher exposure in the first two hours (<xref rid="bibr10-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These data suggested that ADAM zolmitriptan may provide a promising new option for providing rapid migraine relief while circumventing some of the limitations of other routes of administration.</p><p>Here we describe a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating ascending doses of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine headache and associated symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-0333102417737765"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2b/3 study conducted at 36 sites in the US. The protocol was approved by the Quorum Review Institutional Review Board (Seattle, WA). Patients 18&#x02013;65 years old with a greater than 1-year history of episodic migraine with and/or without aura and with an onset prior to 50 years of age were eligible to participate. All participants gave written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed. During the 6 months prior to the run-in period, they must have had at least two and no more than eight migraine headaches per month, with no more than 10 headache days per month. At least five attacks must have met the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine.</p><p>During a 28- to 56-day run-in period to determine eligibility, patients recorded daily headache and migraine symptoms using an e-diary. On the first day of the run-in period, patients declared their most bothersome migraine symptom (MBS) other than pain (nausea [with or without vomiting], photophobia, or phonophobia, which is most bothersome most of the time with their migraine headaches). Eligible patients had experienced two to eight migraine headaches per 28-day period and were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:2:1 ratio to receive one 1&#x02009;mg ADAM zolmitriptan, one 1.9&#x02009;mg ADAM zolmitriptan, one ADAM placebo, two 1.9&#x02009;mg ADAM zolmitriptan (3.8&#x02009;mg total), or two ADAM placebo, to treat a single qualifying migraine headache (pain of moderate or severe intensity and presence of MBS). Uncoated titanium microprojections were used in the placebo. A central, permuted block randomization scheme stratified by MBS was generated by an independent statistician.</p><p>Patients self-administered ADAM zolmitriptan or placebo to the upper arm, in an outpatient setting. They used an e-diary to record symptom scores (scale: none, mild, moderate, or severe) at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-dosing. The application site was scored for redness, swelling, and bruising at 30 minutes, and 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-dose. A follow-up visit occurred 2&#x02013;7 days after the 48-hour time point.</p><p>The co-primary endpoints of the study were the proportion of patients reporting pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose and the proportion reporting freedom from their MBS at 2 hours post-dose. Pain freedom was defined as a score of &#x0201c;none&#x0201d; at 2 hours without the use of rescue medication during the 2-hour post-dose period. Similarly, MBS freedom was defined as the absence of the symptom without the use of rescue medication during the 2-hour post-dose period.</p><p>The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved pain relief (defined as improvement to mild or none) at 15 and 30 minutes, as well as 3, and 4 hours post-dose; pain freedom at 30 minutes, and 24 and 48 hours post-dose; freedom at 2 hours post-dose from photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea (irrespective of MBS); and the proportion of patients who required rescue medication during the 2-hour post-dose period.</p><p>Sample size (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;360) was determined by estimating that 15% of patients receiving placebo and 35% of those receiving active treatment would achieve freedom from pain or MBS at 2 hours post-dose, and allowing for 15% dropouts. A stratified chi-square test was used to estimate the number used to detect a treatment difference with 80% statistical power and 5% 2-sided significance level.</p><p>The primary analysis method was a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for the randomization stratification by MBS. Each individual active treatment group was compared to the pooled placebo group in a pairwise manner. Pooling of the placebo groups was planned <italic>a priori</italic> for statistical simplicity. Post&#x000a0;hoc analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes in the 1- or 2-patch placebo groups, supporting the decision to pool these groups. In addition, the Breslow-Day test was performed to assess the homogeneity of the odds ratios across MBS. A fixed sequential testing methodology was applied to control the overall type 1 error. A test was considered statistically significant only if the corresponding CMH test had a <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and all previous tests had a <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

Among the 224 who were not randomized, 77 had screening failures, 130 failed to meet the run-in criteria, and data were missing for 17. The most common reasons for screen failures were: 16 (17%) clinically-relevant abnormal findings in the physical exam, vital signs, or laboratory tests; 15 (16%) history or current abuse or dependence on alcohol or drugs; 14 (15%) reason to believe that compliance with study requirements and completion of evaluations would not be possible. The most common reasons for run-in failures were: 64 (50%) had more than 10 headache days in past 28 days; 45 (35%) were not able to use the e-diary; 44 (34%) did not have an average of at least two qualifying migraines per 28-day period, and 17 (18%) did not have confirmation of good general health. Note that a patient could have more than one reason for screening or run-in failures. Of those who applied the study treatment, 321 had at least one post-dose assessment (modified intent to treat [mITT] population). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102417737765">Table 1</xref> presents the disposition of patients in each group and overall.

Nearly 42% of patients treated with ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8&#x02009;mg were pain-free 2 hours after treatment and nearly 70% were free from their most bothersome headache-associated migraine symptom. Efficacy was dose dependent, with the 3.8&#x02009;mg dose providing a better response than the 1.9&#x02009;mg and 1&#x02009;mg doses.</p><p>Due to the statistical approach in this study (fixed sequential testing), no formal statistical significance could be assigned for the secondary endpoints. However, the proportion of patients treated with ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8&#x02009;mg who were free from photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea was higher than for placebo, with nominal significance achieved for photophobia and nausea.</p><p>Sustained pain freedom is considered the ideal migraine treatment response (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It is notable that in a post-hoc analysis efficacy was sustained, with many patients remaining pain-free out to 48 hours. The percentage of patients who had sustained pain freedom in the first 24 hours was 31.7% for ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8&#x02009;mg, which compares favorably with the 15&#x02013;25% historically seen in controlled trials of triptans in migraine treatment (<xref rid="bibr12-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Onset of pain freedom and pain relief was apparent much earlier than 2 hours, with nominally-significant differences between ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8&#x02009;mg and placebo beginning at 45 minutes and 1 hour, respectively.</p><p>For some parameters, such as pain relief, a higher than expected placebo response was observed. The fact that the drug-device combination is new and innovative, and that there is some sensation when the device is applied, may have led some participants to believe they were receiving the active agent. Additionally, because three different doses of zolmitriptan were investigated, patients had a 75% probability of receiving active therapy, a fact of which they were aware. The odds in favor of receiving a drug that is known to be effective may have also elevated the placebo response (<xref rid="bibr13-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Nonetheless, a clear separation was observed between active treatment and placebo for pain relief.</p><p>As noted for the efficacy endpoints, a dose-response effect was also observed for the occurrence of TEAEs, which were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events reported were those related to the application site, and they generally resolved within 48 hours. None occurred in more than 10% of patients. Additional adverse events were consistent with those commonly seen in previous trials with triptans (<xref rid="bibr12-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The design of this study was in accordance with the 2014 Guidance for Industry in the design of trials for the acute treatment of migraine (<xref rid="bibr14-0333102417737765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Importantly, the four co-primary endpoints of pain, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia have been replaced with the two co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from MBS, both at 2 hours. At the time of writing, we believe this may be the first completed pivotal trial reported using MBS as a co-primary efficacy endpoint. It is important to recognize these key differences in interpreting the current data in the context of prior clinical studies in migraine.</p></sec><sec id="sec9-0333102417737765"><title>Key findings</title><p>
