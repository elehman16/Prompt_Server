Despite good evidence that antibiotics are not effective for improving the symptoms of uncomplicated LRTI, they are widely prescribed, contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Many of the symptoms observed in LRTI are mediated by inflammatory processes also observed in exacerbations of asthma, for which there is strong evidence of corticosteroid effectiveness. The primary aim of the OSAC (Oral Steroids for Acute Cough) Trial is to determine whether oral prednisolone (40&#x000a0;mg daily for 5&#x000a0;days) can reduce the duration of moderately bad (or worse) cough and the severity of all its associated symptoms on days 2 to 4 post-randomisation (day 1 is trial entry) by at least 20% in adults &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with acute LRTI presenting to primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>OSAC is a two-arm, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised superiority trial. The target sample size is 436 patients, which allows for a 20% dropout rate. Patients will be recruited from primary care sites (General Practitioner surgeries) across England and followed up until symptom resolution. The two primary clinical outcomes are the duration of moderately bad (or worse) cough, and the severity of all its associated symptoms on days 2 to 4 post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include: antibiotic consumption; symptom burden; adverse events; participant satisfaction with treatment and intention to consult for future similar illnesses. A parallel economic evaluation will investigate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results from the OSAC trial will increase knowledge regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroids for LRTI, and will establish the potential of a new treatment option that could substantially improve patient health. We have chosen a relatively high &#x02018;efficacy dose&#x02019; as this will enable us to decide on the potential for further research into lower dose oral and/or inhaled corticosteroids. This trial will also contribute to a growing body of research investigating the natural course of this very common illness, as well as the effects of steroids on the undesirable inflammatory symptoms associated with infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN57309858">ISRCTN57309858</ext-link> (31 January 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0569-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute cough</kwd><kwd>Lower respiratory tract infection</kwd><kwd>Oral steroids</kwd><kwd>Corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>Prednisolone</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Efficacy</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Epidemiology, costs and current management of lower respiratory tract infection</title><p>Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), defined as an acute cough with at least one of sputum, chest pain, shortness of breath and/or wheeze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care in the UK and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over 75% of patients presenting to primary care for this condition are prescribed antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and have a 20% likelihood of re-consulting within the same illness episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Acute cough is estimated to cost the UK National Health Service (NHS) at least &#x000a3;20 million annually in prescription costs and &#x000a3;170 million in consultation costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patient costs have been shown to be in excess of &#x000a3;15 per episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and respiratory tract infection is one of the most common reasons for work absenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Despite good evidence that antibiotics do not reduce the duration or severity of LRTI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], they continue to be widely prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is adding to the significant rise in antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which is an increasing and serious threat to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Novel therapeutic measures are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and so far evidence of efficacy for alternative treatments has not been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale for testing the effectiveness of corticosteroids in lower respiratory tract infection</title><p>Symptoms of LRTI include cough, wheeze and shortness of breath, which are similar to the symptoms of exacerbated asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the worst symptoms may last up to 1&#x000a0;week, while complete symptom resolution may take 3&#x000a0;weeks or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Prolonged symptoms are thought to be due to a transient bronchial hyper-responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and experimental evidence suggests similar changes to bronchial epithelium in people with and without asthma during a respiratory tract infection. Both groups have been shown to have significant reductions in Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV), as well as airways inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Oral and inhaled corticosteroids are widely prescribed for the treatment of acute and chronic asthma, respectively, and work by exerting an array of anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is increasing interest in the potential role of corticosteroids in modifying the undesirable effects of infection-associated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Benefits have already been demonstrated for children with acute croup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and community-acquired pneumonia (if also given &#x003b2; agonists) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], adults hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], adults with post-infectious persistent cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and adults with acute tonsillitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>At the time of writing there have been no published studies of oral corticosteroid therapy for acute cough following respiratory tract infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however, a number of trials of inhaled corticosteroids have been conducted, of which one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] is relevant to the Oral Steroids for Acute Cough (OSAC) trial. This tested the effects of high-dose fluticasone, 1&#x000a0;mg twice daily, (equivalent to 2&#x000a0;mg twice daily of beclometasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or 8.5&#x000a0;mg of oral prednisolone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) for 2&#x000a0;weeks in non-asthmatic adults presenting to Dutch primary care with a cough (LRTI) lasting more than 2&#x000a0;weeks. The inhaled corticosteroids were effective in reducing the mean cough frequency score among non-smokers, but the clinical importance of the reduced cough score is uncertain and there was no economic evaluation.</p><p>We are aware of two other ongoing trials currently registered on the International Controlled Trials Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] to investigate the value of corticosteroids for other infectious illnesses in primary care: the TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial (ISRCTN17435450); and the OSTRICH (Oral STeroids for Resolution of otitis media with effusion In CHildren) trial (ISRCTN49798431).</p><p>Research and anecdotal evidence suggests that European clinicians have started prescribing corticosteroids for LRTI (in the absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], even though there is limited evidence to support their use for this condition.</p><p>Long-term steroid use is known to be associated with an array of unwanted systemic side effects such as adrenal suppression, impaired skin collagen synthesis and metabolic disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, in the absence of specific contraindications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a short (up to 1&#x000a0;week) course of high-dose corticosteroids is considered to be safe and associated with few side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The rationale for testing the effectiveness of corticosteroids in LRTI can be summarised as follows: (i) there is good evidence of oral steroid effectiveness for acute asthma; (ii) the symptoms of LRTI overlap with those of acute asthma; (iii) prednisolone (tablets at a dose of 40&#x000a0;mg daily for 5 to 7&#x000a0;days) is the most commonly used oral steroid for acute asthma; (iv) there is pharmacokinetic evidence to suggest that a minimum dose of 20&#x000a0;mg daily is required for non-asthmatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; and (v) it is important that the first trial of its kind uses an adequate dose to detect any potential effects as a proof of concept.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for the trial design</title><p>This double-blind randomised controlled trial will provide high quality evidence to determine whether steroids are effective in the symptomatic treatment of acute LRTI, for which, to date, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and inhaled corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have been shown to be ineffective. A double-blinded, maximum dose design has been chosen since: (i) the primary outcomes are subjective (in that cough severity is reported by the participant); and (ii) treatment with this agent for this clinical problem is novel, making a trial demonstrating effectiveness under optimal conditions important.</p><p>&#x02018;Duration of moderately bad or worse cough&#x02019; and &#x02018;mean severity of all LRTI symptoms on days 2 to 4 post-randomisation&#x02019; have been selected as the primary outcomes for this trial, in order to test the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids will relieve both the duration and severity of the unwanted bronchospasm and other inflammatory side-effects of infection. In another study, participants reported symptoms between days 2 and 4 as being the worst problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which provides the rationale for the timing for the second primary outcome in this trial.</p><p>We recognise the undesirability of further medicalisation of common and self-limiting infections in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and if this trial demonstrates a clinically important treatment effect, we do not think it will be appropriate to promote the routine use of high-dose corticosteroids for acute LRTI (though we recognise that the prescription of corticosteroids to alleviate the most acute symptoms of chest infections remains a clinical decision). Rather, we think the implication will be that further trials of lower-dose oral or inhaled corticosteroids should be conducted. If no treatment effect is found, it is unlikely that further, lower-dose steroid research would be warranted for acute LRTI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Research questions</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary research question</title><p>Can the use of oral prednisolone reduce the duration of moderately bad or worse cough and/or the severity of all its associated symptoms on days 2 to 4 post-randomisation by at least 20% when compared to placebo treatment in adults 18&#x000a0;years and over presenting to primary care with acute LRTI?</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary research questions</title><p>We will also: 1) assess the effects on antibiotic consumption; 2) estimate the cost-effectiveness from the perspectives of the NHS, patients, and society; 3) compare the burden, severity and duration of abnormal peak flow and LRTI symptoms; 4) compare adverse events including any new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms, re-consultations for a documented deterioration in illness and serious adverse events; 5) investigate if participants&#x02019; subjective or objective response to oral steroids is associated with a clinical diagnosis of asthma or COPD; and 6) assess participants&#x02019; satisfaction with treatment and intention to consult for future similar illnesses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a placebo-controlled, individually randomised, superiority trial in UK general practice.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Eligibility</title><p>We wish to test the effects of corticosteroids in adults presenting to primary care with acute LRTI, in whom there is no evidence of pneumonia or other reason to require an immediate antibiotic or hospitalisation, and in whom there is no reason to consider the use of oral prednisolone 40&#x000a0;mg daily for 5&#x000a0;days unsafe.

The mean (SD) symptom severity score between days 2 and 4 taken from the same trial was estimated as 2.3 (1.1). Using standard formulae for the mean and standard deviation of a log-normal distribution, this corresponds to 1.555 (SD 0.637) log days (or geometric mean of 4.74&#x000a0;days) for the cough duration outcome and 0.73 (SD 0.454) on the log scale (or geometric mean of 2.08) for the symptom severity outcome.</p><p>To account for testing multiple primary outcomes a lower alpha was specified for the symptom severity outcome to ensure that the overall alpha for the two primary outcomes remains close to 5%. Moderately bad or worse cough has been shown to resolve within 7&#x000a0;days for 50% of patients, 14&#x000a0;days for 75% and 4&#x000a0;weeks for 90% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, since duration of cough lasts significantly longer than the period during which severity of symptoms are measured (days 2 to 4) and is capturing an element of the illness severity, duration of moderately bad or worse cough might be viewed as the slightly more clinically important outcome. For this reason alpha remained at 5% for duration of cough and was reduced to 0.1% for symptom severity.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on a 20% reduction in the duration of cough, corresponding to a geometric mean in the active treatment group of 3.79&#x000a0;days (mean 1.333 log days). Allowing (conservatively) for 20% attrition, 218 participants will need to be randomised per arm to retain 174 at follow-up and achieve 90% power with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Hence a total sample size of 436 is required.</p><p>For the symptom severity outcome, a final achieved sample size of 174 participants in each arm will provide 89% power to detect a reduction in symptom severity score between days 2 and 4 of 20%, corresponding to a geometric mean of 1.66 units in the active group (mean 0.51 log units) with a two-sided alpha of 0.001.</p><p>The trial team will make all efforts to recruit the 436 participants. If recruitment is slower than anticipated, recruitment will be extended until at least 163 have been recruited to each arm (326 in total). Assuming 20% attrition, this would provide the study with 80% power for both primary outcomes. All attempts will be made to ensure that attrition remains below 20% but if this is not feasible recruitment will be extended further if possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial medicines</title><p>The Investigational Medicinal Product for this trial will be Prednisolone 20&#x000a0;mg oral tablets (&#x000d7;10), procured from GALEN Pharma GmbH (Kiel, Germany).

If the patient is willing, the clinician will screen the patient for eligibility. This process includes a detailed check of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a routine clinical examination, of which the results and the clinician&#x02019;s diagnosis will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The routine clinical management of the patient will be completed as normal. This may include giving the patient a discretionary delayed antibiotic prescription (to be used if the patient&#x02019;s condition deteriorates after 48&#x000a0;hours or if failing to improve after 7&#x000a0;days) and the discretionary use of a &#x003b2;-agonist (for example, salbutamol). A requirement for immediate antibiotic treatment renders the patient ineligible.</p><p>Once the patient&#x02019;s eligibility is confirmed, the trial prescription will be authorised (by a GCP-trained GP) for redemption (by the Recruiting Clinician, not the patient) against a trial Patient Pack. The patient is then referred to a further interview for full recruitment and trial entry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial entry (the recruitment interview)</title><p>The recruitment interview must take place on the same, or next, day as the routine consultation. Same-day recruitment will be more efficient for many patients who may not wish to return to the GP practice again the following day. Same-day recruitment will also help ensure that participants take the first dose of their trial medication prior to collecting any delayed antibiotic that may have been prescribed for them by their GP, thereby ensuring the validity of antibiotic consumption as one of the secondary outcome measures. Some patients may wish to start taking a treatment on the same day that they visit the GP practice, and in the absence of a trial treatment those patients may be more likely to take antibiotics obtained from a delayed prescription or visited another healthcare provider while waiting for the next day to enter the trial.</p><p>However, if the site or patient do not have time for the recruitment interview on the same day, the patient can be recruited on the following working day, if the following conditions are met: the recruitment interview is not deferred to the Monday following a weekend, to reduce the possibility of recruiting patients whose clinical condition has deteriorated significantly since the eligibility assessment was performed; and any delayed antibiotic prescription is post-dated by at least 24&#x000a0;hours after the recruitment interview, to ensure that the patient has the opportunity to take the first dose of their trial medication prior to collecting their delayed antibiotic prescription.</p><p>The Recruiting Clinician will take formal written consent, collect the remaining CRF data (including symptoms, signs and respiratory history), issue the patient with the trial medicines and explain how to take them. The patient will also receive a symptom diary, peak flow meter and other materials to fully equip them for the follow-up, and training in how to measure peak expiratory flow and complete the diary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Participant follow-up</title><p>All follow-up will be managed by the trial team, who will give participants individual support throughout their follow-up period. Participants will complete the symptom diary online or on paper every day for up to 28&#x000a0;days or until symptoms have been completely resolved for two consecutive days (whichever is soonest). As well as recording the severity of their symptoms, completing the symptom diary includes recording peak flow measurements and whether or not any antibiotics have been taken. The patient will also record how many of the trial tablets they took on days 1 to 5, and any adverse effects during the first 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>All participants will be telephoned within the first 2&#x000a0;days of trial entry, and then each week for 4&#x000a0;weeks to support symptom diary completion, collect the daily data they have recorded during the preceding week (to safeguard against potential loss of data if paper diaries are not returned to the trial centre or there are problems with the post), and to collect the weekly data on resource use and quality of life measures. These methods are similar to those successfully used (with &#x0003c;20% attrition) in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Should the patient&#x02019;s cough persist beyond 28&#x000a0;days, their permission will be sought to continue with the weekly calls, up to a maximum of 56&#x000a0;days, in order to establish the day on which the patient last scores their cough as &#x0201c;moderately bad&#x0201d;, and the date on which their cough is completely resolved. The 56&#x000a0;day cut-off point has been chosen as a pragmatic cut-off point, in order to establish the date of cough resolution for the majority of participants while taking account of the participant&#x02019;s research burden, and of the trial resources.

Benefit will be described as (i) reduced cough duration, defined as the percentage of participants in each group with a duration at least 20% lower than the mean duration of participants in the control group or (if 20% reduction in mean duration in the control group is less than 1&#x000a0;day) the percentage of participants in each group whose duration is at least 1&#x000a0;day less than the mean of those in the control group; and (ii) quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain (QALY estimates will be based on responses to the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L).</p><p>Sensitivity analyses will be used to test the robustness of the results against assumptions made and bootstrapping will be used to estimate the level of uncertainty around the estimates of cost per QALY.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes a placebo-controlled, randomised multi-centre superiority trial that will establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of a commonly used treatment (corticosteroids) for an entirely novel indication and one of the commonest clinical problems managed in primary care: acute LRTI. The trial will recruit between 326 and 436 non-asthmatic adult patients presenting to primary care with an acute cough of less than 28&#x000a0;days duration and at least one other lower respiratory tract symptom or physical examination finding. Eligible, consented patients will be randomised to receive a 5-day course of either the active treatment (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;mg prednisolone daily) or matched placebo, and asked to complete a symptom diary for at least 7 and up to 28&#x000a0;days, depending on the duration of their illness. Participants will be telephoned weekly for 4&#x000a0;weeks, or until their cough resolves, up to a maximum of 8&#x000a0;weeks from recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>The OSAC trial completed recruitment on 27 October 2014.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_569_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
