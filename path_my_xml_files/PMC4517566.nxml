Back pain is a significant public health issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], costing the UK NHS an estimated &#x000a3;480 million per annum. Research estimates costs to the UK economy due to back pain vary between &#x000a3;3 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and &#x000a3;12.3 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a variability that reflects the differences in definition of the disorder as well as what counts as costs. In the USA that figure is as high $100 billion in health care compensation and litigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], whilst in Australia a figure of $15 billion is quoted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The process behind how general (and non-persistent) back pain becomes chronic is identified in the psychology of pain literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For most people (80-90&#x000a0;%) the pain diminish in a few days or weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but for some the pain becomes more long-term and distressing, and &#x0201c;multiple and overlapping problems&#x0201d; such as depression and anxiety are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Research highlights how disability and chronicity can develop through kinesophobia (fear avoidance of movement and pain), catastrophising and low self-efficacy of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, it is difficult to &#x02018;cure&#x02019; chronic back pain and conventional medicine has been ineffective in many ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], contributing to a high level of patient dissatisfaction with medical care, hence treatments often aim at helping patients manage pain and reducing its effect on their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, with no long-term effective medical treatment there is a considerable emphasis on self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], including use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).</p><p>CAM use for chronic back pain is particularly prevalent in comparison to other long-term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; approximately 30&#x000a0;% of back pain sufferers use CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. CAM encompasses a variety of treatments that exist outside of conventional (frequently biomedical) care, and for back pain most commonly used therapies include chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, and yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Alexander Technique (AT) is often perceived as a CAM modality, sitting as it does outside of conventional medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Alexander technique</title><p>Alexander Technique (AT) has been used extensively in diverse fields of performance such as acting and music [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and is a primarily educational approach to managing posture and movement: &#x0201c;AT teachers combine hands-on guidance and verbal explanation to show individuals how to diminish self-damaging postural and movement habits, and to modify habitual responses to stimuli, which can include pain and stress.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Because AT is educational, practitioners are called &#x02018;teachers&#x02019; and those who receive instruction are called &#x02018;students&#x02019; (or pupils).</p><p>The Society of Teachers of Alexander Technique (STAT: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stat.org.uk/">www.stat.org.uk</ext-link>) recommends one-to-one Alexander lessons to discover if a &#x02018;student&#x02019; has some postural issue or movement or other habit or misunderstanding that is causing or aggravating their problem, such as chronic pain. Opportunities are provided for self-observation and practice during closely monitored activities with constructive feedback provided by the teacher. Frequent hand contact from teachers is used to observe and interpret subtle changes in muscle tone and co-ordination and also to convey non-verbal information to the student. Students are encouraged to spend time each day (15-20 min) lying semi-supine while practising the Alexander mental &#x02018;directions&#x02019;, and incorporate what they have learned in their everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evidence</title><p>An evidence base is emerging about the effectiveness of CAM for chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but significant gaps exist. In 2007 a short article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reviewed the state of the art of CAM therapies for back pain and concluded that despite the weight of evidence increasing and the direction of travel of research being towards the positive, that more research into effectiveness was required, with AT mentioned as being particularly welcome due to its relatively low cost and associated low risk.</p><p>Previous studies have explored the effectiveness of AT lessons for chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A well-conducted factorial randomised controlled trial (ATEAM) suggested that AT lessons were clinically and cost effective for patients with chronic or recurrent back pain and could lead to a significant reduction in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A comparison of six versus 24 AT lessons as adjuncts to massage therapy, and advice from a doctor to take exercise with nurse delivered counselling, found that six one-to-one AT lessons followed by an exercise prescription had long-term benefits, with a significant reduction in days in pain and disability. Although 24 one-to-one AT lessons led to better results, the economic analysis found that the best-value intervention was 6 lessons in AT with exercise prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, a systematic review of the evidence of effectiveness and safety of AT in health related conditions more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found that there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of AT lessons for chronic back pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim of this evaluation</title><p>Given the robust controlled trial evidence about the clinical and cost effectiveness of AT lessons, the next step was to study AT in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019;. The aim of this mixed methods service evaluation therefore was to explore the role and perceived impact of AT lessons at a hospital out-patient Pain Management Clinic in the UK, including clinicians&#x02019; perspective and service users&#x02019; (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) experiences of the lessons and their perceptions of benefits. For the purposes of this paper, where AT was delivered in a healthcare setting, we have chosen the term &#x02018;service user&#x02019; as opposed to &#x02018;student&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a mixed methods evaluation with a before-and-after study design. The study took place at the Pain Clinic at St. Michael&#x02019;s Hospital, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust from June 2010 to May 2011. The majority of the quantitative data collection preceded the qualitative. Qualitative research was undertaken to explore both service users&#x02019; and professionals&#x02019; experiences in-depth and help explain the quantitative results. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of the West of England Faculty ethics committee and from the University Hospitals Bristol R&#x00026;D Trust as NRES approval is not required for service evaluation studies.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Referral route</title><p>At the time of the study, patients were referred to the Pain Clinic by their GP, where they saw one of four consultants who assessed the patient to see what treatment was suitable, such as medication, injections, psychological therapy, TENS, physiotherapy or acupuncture (as well as possible referral for a surgical opinion). The options also include a pain management programme for patients who have come to the end of the line in terms of treatment options. Using clear criteria for referral, the consultant referred patients with chronic or recurrent back pain who were not getting better, were not responding to conventional treatment and expressed an interest in AT lessons. All referred AT patients accepted an invitation to be part of the evaluation and were therefore included in the study.</p><p>Once referred, the service user received six one-to-one AT lessons with a qualified and experienced STAT registered AT teacher, over a period of six consecutive weeks. The lessons took place in one of the treatment rooms at the Pain Clinic. Each AT session lasted on average 40-45 min in duration, although the first lesson lasted longer as a first consultation. At the first AT lesson service users were asked by the AT teachers to sign a consent form agreeing to the evaluation study. Consent was re-established by an independent researcher at the last follow up time point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Quantitative data</title><p>Three questionnaires were administered at baseline, six weeks and three months. Service users completed the questionnaires at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;weeks in the pain clinic, just before starting their Alexander Technique lesson. SM, an independent researcher, administered the questionnaires at the 3&#x000a0;month time-point initially through the post. Postal non-respondents were followed up with telephone calls to administer the last set of questionnaire data. The data for all questionnaires were entered into an Excel spreadsheet by an administrator.</p><p>With regard to health status, the outcome tools were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP). The Brief Pain Inventory was selected for assessing pain as it was the standard tool used in the hospital pain clinic and the data collected could be comparable to other pain clinic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Primarily applied to assess cancer-related pain, the BPI has been tested for reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The BPI questionnaire consists of two parts: 1) pain severity, and 2) pain interference with seven domains of functioning (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships, sleep and enjoyment of life) on a scale of 0-10. For patient identified health outcomes we used MYMOP, which has been tested for reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This questionnaire was selected to investigate how well the lessons met service users&#x02019; objectives. Respondents write down two symptoms that bother them the most (symptom 1 and 2), an activity is limited by their primary symptom, and score how bad each symptom is on a 7-point Likert scale. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/resources/mymop/index.html">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/resources/mymop/index.html</ext-link>). The same symptoms and activity are measured in follow up administrations of MYMOP.</p><p>To understand resource use, we selected the Client Service Resource Inventory. Widely used in economic evaluations, respondents record their NHS and personal costs. We calculated costs at a standard weekly rate (in &#x000a3;) and then compared across the three time points. The data for total costs included personal and NHS costs; the data for condition, non-condition and intervention costs were based on NHS costs only.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Two independent statisticians analysed the data: one analysed resource data from the Client Service Resource Inventory, and the other analysed the health outcome tools. Analysis was performed using Stata Version 11.2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> For the health outcome tools, after checking for normality, the data for the BPI and MYMOP were analysed separately. For each dataset, we were interested in changes: between baseline and 6&#x000a0;weeks, baseline and three months, and between 6&#x000a0;weeks and three months.</p><p>For each outcome measure, we calculated mean values at each time point and also the mean change between each pair of time points (baseline and 6&#x000a0;weeks, baseline and 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;weeks and 3&#x000a0;months). For all mean values we calculated the associated 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI), by using the means standard error x 1.96. These confidence intervals were used to compare the differences of the means in the groups. Additional analyses were conducted with MYMOP. The symptoms and activities identified by patients were classified, grouped and totalled. Data on length of time with condition was grouped according to the MYMOP questionnaire categories: short term (less than one year), medium term (1-5 years) and long term (more than five years).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>Qualitative data was collected from a sample of service users (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) in telephone interviews, and from professionals (three clinicians and all four AT teachers) in face-to-face interviews.</p><p>SM interviewed service users at the three month time point, using a purposive sampling strategy of maximum variation. This included service users who completed the majority or all six lessons and fell into one of three groups: 1) showed little or no improvement in pain, 2) showed minimal improvement at six weeks or three months, and 3) showed great improvement at six weeks and at three months. The sampling strategy aimed at some demographic variation, taking into account age and gender, as well as length of time that they had experienced pain. The sample did not include those who were referred and did not attend (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) or those who dropped out after one AT lesson (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), as the numbers were insignificant. Service users were asked about the benefits and drawbacks of the lessons, referral route, experiences of the lessons and whether they had maintained the exercises after stopping lessons.</p><p>In gathering professionals&#x02019; views, SM conducted face-to-face interviews at the pain clinic with AT teachers on their views of the benefits and drawbacks of an AT service in an NHS pain clinic, and with clinicians (two consultants and a specialist nurse), about their views on the service, re-referrals to the pain management clinic, as well as potential improvements and recommendations.</p><p>Interviews lasted between twenty one and thirty eight minutes, and were audio-recorded with the permission of the interviewee.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Qualitative data was analysed using a thematic content analysis approach, coded to identify themes and categories, using constant comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to look for similarities and differences across the accounts to identify patterns and search for &#x02018;deviant cases&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Initial open coding of individual transcripts generated a coding framework (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which was amended as new data were gathered. Codes were gradually superseded by broader analytical categories, and through comparison across transcripts themes were identified. The analysis, data coding and organisation was aided by the software NVivo 9.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Coding Framework</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2015_966_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Quantitative results</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Characteristics of the sample</title><p>A total of 43 service users (female: n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) returned questionnaires at baseline, 41 (95&#x000a0;%) at 6&#x000a0;weeks and 39 (91&#x000a0;%) at 3&#x000a0;months. In total 41 (95&#x000a0;%) completed the AT lessons of whom 39 (91&#x000a0;%) completed the questionnaires at 3&#x000a0;months. The overall mean age was 53 (range 24 to 81; sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.0086); data on age is not known for 12 respondents.

(Teacher 3)</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A key finding of this study is that, while quantifiable changes in pain severity and interference scores were reported, more striking was how service users said they modified their ways of managing the sensations of pain, because of the AT lessons. As such, some service users reported no difference in levels of pain but did report reduction in pain medication and resource use, and consequentially in costs. According to at least one consultant, this signified &#x02018;success&#x02019; as generally, service users do not eliminate their pain through the treatments offered by the pain clinic, but instead sufferers find alternative, more effective ways of self-managing symptoms.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Comparison with original trial evidence</title><p>The findings of a major randomised controlled trial of Alexander Technique for chronic back pain found that 6 lessons plus exercise was almost as effective as 24 AT lessons and more effective than exercise alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the trial researchers noted that the benefits on chronic pain were still in effect up to 12&#x000a0;months after the lessons were delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our study in the naturalistic setting, where 6 lessons of AT were delivered <italic>without</italic> exercise, users reported a modest reduction in pain. However similarly, their scores were maintained after treatment delivery stopped. This suggests that although diluted within the naturalistic setting (possibly because of the lack of an exercise component), some chronic back pain sufferers may perceive that 6 AT lessons on their own offer useful benefits. This finding might support RCT findings that AT lessons without exercise are less effective, though some patients perceived improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Alexander technique and self-management of symptoms</title><p>Qualitative results suggest that service users were encouraged to be self-reliant and develop breathing and postural techniques for self-managing pain. Service users improved self-efficacy, becoming more effective over time at managing their pain. For example, AT teachers encouraged a more active &#x02018;listening&#x02019; to the body and awareness of the embodied signs of pain and distress, and users developed techniques to manage that. This also led to some behavioural changes and changes in awareness and self-knowledge, with service users more actively involved in their health condition. Such findings contribute to a range of debates, not only about the value and impact of self-management techniques for pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but also the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of self-management initiatives. Our study highlights the importance of self-management as a &#x0201c;dynamic process&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] combining personal &#x02018;subjective&#x02019; experience of pain with professional education (AT).</p><p>This study also shows that AT lessons may have similar impact to other educational and psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], helping to reduce the escalation of pain (through self-monitoring), fear avoidance, and the effect of pain catastrophising (cognitive-affective response to anticipated or actual pain) as well as managing self-perception of pain, thereby reducing reliance on pain medication. More research is clearly needed to explore some of the mechanisms behind how self-management techniques work in dealing with chronic conditions, as well as the people who are most likely to benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Implications</title><p>We also suggest that clinicians could consider the potential for an AT teaching service within some (but not all) pain clinics. Pain clinics that utilise a more medical model of pain are less likely to find a role for AT, but pain clinics working within a more psychosocial framework within a multi-disciplinary and multi-professional team might be more sympathetic to AT. An Alexander Technique service could add another dimension to the range of clinical, psychological and educational interventions that play a part in psychosocially-oriented pain clinics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of this study is its mixed methods design in combining quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate a healthcare service. Not only did we capture quantifiable changes in reported health status, medications and service utilisation, but through qualitative data we were also able to explain how those changes may have come about. This increased our confidence in putting forward explanations for the quantitative scores. Collecting either quantitative or qualitative data in isolation would have been less powerful. Moreover, the trend is often to publish each component separately, but as this paper shows the combination of datasets can lead to deeper understanding. We would recommend that future evaluations of health services include both qualitative and quantitative components and that these are reported together.</p><p>However, the perceived changes in outcomes cannot be attributed to the intervention due to the non-randomised, uncontrolled nature of the design. While the sample size for the study was relatively small and there was no control group to investigate whether changes would have occurred over time anyway, this before and after design is more common in service evaluations. In addition, service users were aware of the lessons they were receiving and this may have an impact on the reliability of self-reported results. However, a high quality RCT did report similarly positive results in health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We did not carry out any sub-analyses on any groups within the study population, as the numbers of participants would be too small to construct reliable estimates and draw any meaningful conclusions. Further, the AT teachers administered the baseline and six week questionnaires, which could introduce another bias, although changes were sustained at three months, when the questionnaires were self-administered or administered by an independent researcher.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the results of this study we found that participants in AT lessons in a multi-disciplinary pain clinic reported modest improvements in health outcomes (pain severity and pain interference), and condition costs related to pain fell. Differences were found in how service users managed their pain, for example more than half stopped or reduced their medication. The qualitative data suggests that what had changed was the service users&#x02019; relationship to the pain and their pain management, and some individuals were more committed to maintaining their AT practice than others.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>StataCorp. 2009. <italic>Stata Statistical Software: Release 11</italic>.
