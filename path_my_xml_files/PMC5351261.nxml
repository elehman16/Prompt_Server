An initial statistical analysis of efficacy comparisons between KLH and MM based on log-rank test performed for each center (hospital) showed 6 hospitals out of 18 hospitals a <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 and remaining 12 hospitals showed a <italic>p</italic>-values of &#x0003e;0.05.

Since the toxicity of BCG is a limitation in some patients, other alternative intravesical chemotherapeutic agents have been developed. One such cytostatic agent is mitomycin C (MM). IMMUCOTHEL&#x000ae; (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) Immunotherapy drug product, biosyn, Fellbach, Germany) is an approved drug product for the prevention of bladder carcinoma recurrence after TURBT and after failure of other established therapies, like BCG and MM.</p><p>A randomized phase III trial based on 553 patients (283 patients under KLH and 270 patients under MM), with intermediate- and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) without carcinoma in situ has been performed and the study details are published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The multicenter trial spanned over 18 clinical centers (hospitals). In the phase III trial study patients were randomized into the KLH arm or the MM arm after TURBT.

The authors concluded that KLH has a different safety profile and is inferior to MM in preventing non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</p><p>This retrospective analysis of the same clinical data focused on evaluating center effects on product efficacy. From the statistical analysis of the individual centers, we identified two sets of hospital groups based on the <italic>p</italic> values (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). The results indicate that the majority of the hospitals showed no statistical difference between KLH and MM with respect to median RFS. This suggests the presence of center effects in this clinical trial as evidenced by statistical comparison of the same drug product (KLH or MM) between the two hospital groups. The conclusion of this data would be that the same drug product is superior to itself between the two centers. As this is an illogical conclusion; among other possible determining factors, the TURBT procedure is suspected to be the main contributing factor. The patient data summary in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> suggests that there is no selection bias arising due to clinical and demographic patient characteristics. Such selection bias would normally be a prime determining factor but is not present in this well-designed clinical trial. Similar suspicions have been raised by other reports as it relates to variable observed recurrence rates between institutions. This report specifically expands on that concept to show that it has an effect on the efficacy determination of drug products.</p><p>This suggests that when performing new drug efficacy evaluation studies involving surgery as a prerequisite step, as is the case with bladder cancer, the operative experience of the surgeon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] is an additional important factor for consideration in designing future clinical studies.</p><p>In view of such differences in the efficacy of the same product used on patients in two groups of hospitals, proper care and procedures need to be taken in generalizing product efficacies. As suggested by Richsterstetter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Brausi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suitable statistical procedures need to be utilized to account for interaction effect between product efficacy and multicenter effects before generalizing results of the clinical study. This additional confounding effect has to be taken into consideration when designing clinical trials with new drug products involving surgery as a prerequisite treatment step.</p><p>Once a product is approved, surgeons optimize surgical technique for a given drug product to provide improved clinical outcomes for their patients. Such modifications may be done unintentionally. As a result, when surgeons perform clinical studies using new product candidates, there may be an inherent bias in their surgical techniques toward their preferred choice of drug product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec9"><p>
