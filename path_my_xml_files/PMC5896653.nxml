Generics are generally permitted to enter the market only when the patent for the originator has lapsed.<xref rid="b5-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The global regulatory requirement for equivalent bioavailability, or the so-called bioequivalence, of generic medicinal products has become crucial in medicine and pharmaceutical development over the past three decades. Bioavailability is defined as the rate and extent to which the pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available in the systemic circulation. The extent of absorption is indicated by the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), and the rate of absorption is reflected by the time to reach the peak concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), while both the extent and the rate of absorption together are represented by the peak concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>).<xref rid="b6-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Two pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives are regarded bioequivalent or pharmacokinetically equivalent when both are administered at the same molar dose under standardized conditions in an appropriately designed study and show no significant difference in the rate and extent of their absorption, thus providing similar levels of the active ingredient or active moiety that is available at the site of drug action. In brief, the two medicinal products show a similar or equivalent bioavailability.<xref rid="b8-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Based on that understanding, two formulations that are bioequivalent may consequently be claimed to have essentially the same therapeutic qualities; or, in other words, they are therapeutically equivalent. This means that both formulations possess beneficial and adverse effects that are essentially the same, and hence, they are interchangeable.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Etoricoxib (Chemical Abstracts Service [CAS] 202409-33-4) is described chemically as 5-chloro-6&#x02032;-methyl-3-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2,3&#x02032;-bipyridine. The empirical formula is C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ClN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S. The molecular weight is 358.84. Etoricoxib is a white-to-off-white powder that is practically insoluble in water<xref rid="b10-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and has the structural formula shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cpaa-10-043">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Etoricoxib is classified as a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, a relatively new class of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Medical examination of the study subjects was performed within 14 days prior to their first dosing day. The assessment included the following: physical examination; recording of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment on routine hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count, as well as platelet and leukocyte count); determination of liver function (serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin) and renal function (serum creatinine and urea); blood glucose estimation; immunological tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies; and routine urinalysis (determination of pH, glucose level, protein level, and urine sediments). Pregnancy test (for women) was also performed at screening and before introducing the drug in each period.</p><p>A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were required and followed to ensure that the recruited study subjects were free of accompanying diseases interfering with the conduct and scientific evaluation of the study.

After the overnight fast, a predose pharmacokinetic blood sample was taken on the morning of the dosing day (Day 1). Subsequently, one single dose of the study drug (either the test or the reference drug) was given to be swallowed with 200 mL of water, without chewing. The date and time of study drug administration were recorded in the case report form. The subjects were provided with standardized lunch and dinner at 4 and 10 hours after study drug administration, respectively. Moreover, the amount of food intake and the physical activity for each individual subject were also standardized during the sampling days. Fruit juices and xanthine-containing food or beverages were not allowed for 24 hours before and during the entire sampling days.</p><p>Venous blood samples were drawn immediately before dosing with the drug (at baseline; 10 mL) and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes as well as 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours (5 mL each) after drug administration. After a 14-day washout period, the same procedure was repeated with the alternate drug. The blood samples collected at each time point from all subjects were centrifuged at 1538&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> (radius of rotor =86 mm) for 15 minutes to separate the plasma, and then the plasma was transferred to a clean tube. Plasma samples were stored in a freezer at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;C at the clinical site until they were transferred to the analytical site for measurement of the drug concentrations.</p><p>The following procedures were applied for the extraction of samples from the subjects, calibration of quality control standards, and comparisons. After thawing, the plasma sample was dispensed in an appropriate tube, and then tert-butyl methyl ether was added as the solvent. The content of the tube was vortexed and centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a vial and injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with ultraviolet (UV) detector (HPLC-UV) (Water Alliance 2695; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) under the following conditions: Sunfire 5 &#x003bc;m C18 column of dimensions 4.6&#x000d7;150 mm; Phenomenex C18 as guard column, with UV detector at a wavelength of 284 nm; an injection volume of 50 &#x003bc;L; a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min; and a mobile phase of acetonitrile:water (42:58). Calibration standards, controls, and samples were processed in batches.</p><p>All chromatograms in the same batch were processed automatically with the help of software using the same processing parameters, such as integration, peak-to-peak amplitude, and peak detection. Manual integration was performed only when necessary.</p><p>The etoricoxib concentrations in plasma samples were assayed using a fully validated HPLC&#x02013;UV method, in terms of adequate sensitivity, specificity, linearity, accuracy, and precision (both within and between days). The stability of the samples under frozen conditions, at room temperature, and during freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles was also determined. The validation data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cpaa-10-043">Table 1</xref> were taken from our validation report.

The internal standard used was valdecoxib. The concentration of etoricoxib in the plasma sample was determined by entering the peak area ratio of etoricoxib to internal standard into the regression equation of the standard calibration curve. If a sample had a predicted concentration below the limit of quantitation, its value was not extrapolated and was reported as below quantitation limit, even if the analyte was detectable. Likewise, estimation of the concentration in a sample by extrapolation of the standard curve above the upper limit was not allowed. Instead, the sample was diluted using blank human plasma, then the diluted sample was assayed, and the corresponding value was calculated and reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic parameters</title><p>The standard noncompartmental method was used for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters.

In order to obtain the answer, a bioequivalence study based on pharmacokinetic end points was preferable to a pharmacodynamic or clinical end point study. This is particularly relevant because the extent of absorption of etoricoxib film-coated tablet is sufficient for direct measurement of the drug concentration in plasma, and its plasma concentration has a good correlation with the therapeutic effect of the drug.<xref rid="b9-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b17-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Such a bioequivalence study is critically required by the regulatory or health authorities in most countries for abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submission of a generic product. A generic medicinal product demonstrating its bioequivalence to the reference product indicates its therapeutic equivalence as well; thus, any comparative clinical safety and efficacy studies are no more required for that particular generic. In this regard, selection of the reference product becomes critically important. The safety and efficacy of reference products should have been established through a series of preclinical and clinical trials.<xref rid="b18-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In addition, the results of the bioequivalence study of a particular generic are not applicable to other pharmaceutical equivalents (other generic medicinal products with identical active substance, same dosage form, as well as same route of administration and strength). This underlined the necessity of the present study despite the availability of bioequivalence studies on previously available generic etoricoxib products.<xref rid="b20-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Further, a reliable bioequivalence study should be performed in order to ensure that a generic medicine possesses similar quality as its reference, which is usually the innovator&#x02019;s (originator) product, in terms of safety and efficacy. Therefore, a generic medicinal product should be produced at more economical costs, but without compromising the quality. Providing generic medicinal products supports pharmacoeconomics, which benefits both patients and health care professionals, since they have options to select quality medications at affordable price.<xref rid="b22-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>This was a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study under fasting condition, which included 26 healthy adult male and female subjects and which aimed to compare the bioavailability of a generic, etoricoxib 120 mg film-coated tablet, relative to the reference drug. All the 26 study subjects were compliant with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and completed the study. Unless it is against ethical principles, inclusion of healthy subjects is scientifically required for conducting a bioequivalence study. This is mainly intended to minimize pharmacokinetic variability associated with any concomitant illnesses and medications taken by the study subjects.</p><p>Following the general recommendation in many regulatory guidelines for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, the test and reference drugs in this study were given as a single dose because it is generally more sensitive than a multiple-dose administration in assessing the release of the active substance from the drug product.<xref rid="b6-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The etoricoxib film-coated tablets can be administered orally without regard to food intake;<xref rid="b11-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> thus, this study was recommended to be conducted under fasting condition as this is the most sensitive condition to detect a potential difference between formulations.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>For comparison of the extent of drug exposure, the final sampling was done at 72 hours, which is &#x0003e;3 times the half-life of etoricoxib (~22 hours). With a sampling period of &#x0003e;3 half-lives of the drug, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;72h</sub> covered &#x0003e;87.5% of the AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>. This met the EMA guideline that requires the AUC<sub>0&#x02212;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> to cover at least 80% of the AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The AUC<sub>0&#x02013;72h</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of etoricoxib were defined as the main parameters in order to assess the possible bioequivalence between both preparations. The present study demonstrated that the 90% CIs of the test/reference geometric mean ratios for AUC<sub>0&#x02212;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>, as well as the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, of etoricoxib were within the acceptable range of bioequivalence (80.00%&#x02013;125.00%).</p><p>This study also reported the comparisons of other pharmacokinetic parameters: <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>. The median (range) values of the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) of etoricoxib were 1.00 (0.50&#x02013;4.00) hour and 1.00 (0.75&#x02013;4.00) hour for the test and reference drugs, respectively. Using Wilcoxon matched-pairs test on the original data, the difference in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> values between the two drugs (test and reference drugs) was statistically significant. Clinically, however, the difference was not meaningful since both the test and reference drugs reached the maximum concentration at ~1 hour after administration to the fasted adult subjects, which also aligned with the value reported in the summary of product characteristics of etoricoxib.<xref rid="b11-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition, there is no known evidence reporting the clinical importance of <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> in relation to the activity (such as onset of action) of etoricoxib immediate-release (IR) formulations. Finally, for IR products, the difference in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> values (between the generic and reference products) is not taken into consideration while determining bioequivalence. The pharmacokinetic parameters determining bioequivalence according to the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence consist of the AUC<sub>0&#x02212;t</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> only.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The mean (SD) elimination half-lives (<italic>t</italic>&#x000bd;) of etoricoxib were 20.95 (10.91) hours and 20.69 (8.40) hours for the test drug and the reference drug, respectively. Utilizing Student&#x02019;s paired <italic>t</italic>-test, the half-life values of the test and reference drugs were not significantly different, demonstrating a comparable rate of drug elimination from the body.</p><p>In order to perform the two one-sided <italic>t</italic>-test procedures for bioequivalence for the ln-transformed etoricoxib plasma concentration data within the bioequivalence limits of 0.8 and 1.25, with a value of &#x003b1;=0.05 and power =80%, the number of subjects needed for the bioequivalence study with crossover design was based on calculation and the table provided in a previous publication.<xref rid="b25-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the present study, the intrasubject coefficient of variance (% CV) obtained from the ANOVA for the etoricoxib AUC<sub>0&#x02013;72h</sub> was 9.83%, and hence, the number of subjects in this study (26 subjects) was sufficient to ensure an adequate statistical power required for a valid and reliable study conclusion.<xref rid="b25-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-cpaa-10-043" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Neither minor nor major adverse event was observed during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study concluded that the evaluated generic etoricoxib 120 mg film-coated tablets were bioequivalent to the reference drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Dexa Medica.
