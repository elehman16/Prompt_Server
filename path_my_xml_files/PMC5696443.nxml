</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Ixekizumab (IXE) is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)-17A and is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The approved dose for patients with psoriasis is 160&#x000a0;mg [two subcutaneous (SC) 80-mg injections] at week 0, followed by 80&#x000a0;mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80&#x000a0;mg every 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par8">Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the skin that may require long-term treatment. As most people will receive or require vaccinations during their lifetime, it is important to understand if vaccines can be safely and efficaciously administered alongside long-term treatments for chronic diseases. In addition, treatment of psoriasis or other immune-mediated diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel disease) with agents that may suppress the immune system has been associated with increased risk of infections that may be prevented by vaccinations, including but not limited to tetanus, pertussis, and influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; therefore, vaccination rates in the psoriasis patient population would be expected to be at least as high as the general population. However, although non-live vaccinations for patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as psoriasis, are recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the percentage of vaccinated patients is unexpectedly low compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Only 9 and 45% of IMID patients have received pneumococcal or tetanus vaccinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], respectively, compared with 20.3 and 62.2% of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The low rates of vaccination in adults with IMIDs may be attributed to a lack of knowledge in vaccine recipients and concerns from healthcare providers that a vaccine could induce disease flares or potentially even trigger the onset of an autoimmune disease. Further, there is insufficient data on whether IMID patients treated with immunomodulatory therapies would have a response to vaccination that provides sufficient protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The humoral response to non-live vaccinations has been previously studied with a variety of monoclonal antibodies that target T- and B-cell cytokines. In some cases, biologic therapies have been shown to alter the immunologic response to vaccines in patients with IMIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most notably, rituximab showed a measureable decrease in vaccine antibody production to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccinations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast to the rituximab data, multiple biologic therapies have been shown not to affect vaccine antibody production, for instance, abatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator (using tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (using influenza and pneumococcal vaccines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) inhibitor golimumab (using pneumococcal vaccine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the IL-12/IL-23 antagonist ustekinumab (using tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the IL-17A antagonist, secukinumab (using influenza and meningococcal vaccines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further, the vaccines chosen for these studies demonstrate T-cell-dependent (tetanus or influenza) and T-cell-independent (pneumococcal or meningococcal) humoral antibody responses following vaccine administration, since both are important components of the humoral immune response to non-live vaccines.</p><p id="Par10">As with these other IMID chronic therapies, it is important to evaluate the potential for IXE to impact the ability to produce adequate antibody production to non-live vaccines. This study evaluated the immune response to two routinely recommended non-live vaccines, tetanus (Boostrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Belgium) and pneumococcus (Pneumovax 23<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merck &#x00026; Co, NJ, USA), for which clinical laboratory assays for antibody response are available in clinical practice. Immune response (antibody levels) to these vaccines was studied in the presence or absence of IXE in healthy subjects. Tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IXE were also evaluated. Live vaccines were not studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par11">Healthy males or females, 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years&#x000a0;old, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x02013;32&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were included in the study. Subjects were excluded if they had a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any biologic therapy or vaccine; had a compromised immune system or had other comorbidities (such as having an active infectious disease, a history of Guillain&#x02013;Barre Syndrome or lymphoma, leukemia, or any malignancy within the past 5&#x000a0;years); had received IXE or IL-17 antagonists; had a live vaccination within 1&#x000a0;year prior to screening; had received a tetanus toxoid&#x02013;containing vaccine within the last 5&#x000a0;years; or had been immunized with the pneumococcal vaccine. Since the study was conducted in the USA, the baseline assumption was the tetanus vaccine would likely be a &#x0201c;booster&#x0201d; vaccine rather than the subjects&#x02019; first tetanus vaccination. While a tetanus booster is recommended at least once every 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the restriction of a subject having no booster within the last 5&#x000a0;years was selected based on dose and schedule information in the Boostrix label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design and Treatment</title><p id="Par12">In this phase I, multicenter (three study centers in the USA), open-label, parallel-group study (NCT02543918) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), healthy subjects were randomized to IXE (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41) or control (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43).

The primary vaccine response endpoint measurement was at week 6 (4&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination) and was based on the performing laboratory&#x02019;s validated assay protocols for both vaccines.

Immune response to vaccinations, specifically antibody production to the tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines, was measured using validated quantitative multiplex bead-based immunoassays performed for routine clinical testing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory (ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The serotypes for analysis of the pneumococcal vaccine were as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F.</p><p id="Par15">Additional exploratory endpoints were assessed based on various published criteria and post hoc assessments in response to a regulatory request to further understand the impact of IXE on the ability to produce an adequate antibody response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Serum samples for IXE PK analysis were obtained during the study at the following times: prior to administration of the 160-mg IXE dose on day 1 (week 0), on days 3, 5, 8, and 11 following the 160-mg IXE dose, and prior to administration of the 80-mg IXE dose on day 15 (week 2) and then at weeks 4, 6, and 12.

The lower limit of quantification was 7.5&#x000a0;ng/mL, and the upper limit of quantification was 300.0&#x000a0;ng/mL. A 1:5 minimum required dilution was applied to all samples. Samples above the limit of quantification were diluted to yield results within the calibrated range.

Noninferiority of the IXE group to the control group for each vaccine was established if the lower limit of the 90% CI of the difference between the two groups (IXE minus control) in the proportion of responders to each vaccine at 4&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination was greater than 40%. This noninferiority margin has been used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. No multiplicity adjustment was used.

This method was also used to compare the proportions of patients between the two groups for post hoc analyses. A mixed-effect model was used to analyze the differences from baseline in natural log-transformed serotype levels with treatment arm (IXE or control), visit, and visit-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for each serotype level to the baseline at 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination (week 4 and week 6, respectively) with their 95% CI were reported for both the IXE and control groups.

IXE was noninferior to the control group based on the difference in the proportion of responders to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines 4&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination. A similar proportion of healthy subjects treated with IXE and control subjects were able to mount an adequate immune response in antibody levels to both vaccines. Our results were consistent with findings with other systemic biologic agents for psoriasis with varying mechanisms of action, such as TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors etanercept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], infliximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], or adalimumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the IL-17A antagonist secukinumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor ustekinumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which showed no clinically important effect on humoral responses to non-live vaccines.</p><p id="Par33">A protective immune response to the pneumococcal vaccine was also evident 4&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination. A protective immune response to the pneumococcal vaccine was achieved for 93 and 90% of the subjects (29 subjects in each group) with non-protective levels at baseline in the IXE and control groups, respectively. For the tetanus vaccine, even though all patients with non-protective levels achieved protective levels, there were only five subjects for IXE (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) and control (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) groups that had non-protective levels at baseline.</p><p id="Par34">The conclusion of noninferiority in the immune response to non-live vaccines in healthy subjects administered IXE compared to control subjects was further supported by exploratory and post-hoc analyses. With tetanus, for example, an increase in antibody level of at least 4-fold in response to a booster vaccination has been used as a primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or from observations by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although other endpoints have included a 2-fold increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This analysis was conducted and showed that a comparable percentage of subjects in the control group (approximately 29%) and in the IXE group (approximately 42%) had at least a 4-fold increase in antibody levels in response to the booster vaccine.</p><p id="Par35">For pneumococcal vaccine response, a review of published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] revealed variability in the serotypes that were evaluated. Nonetheless, the endpoint used in those studies was the same as the primary endpoint in this study, that is, a &#x02265;&#x000a0;2-fold increase in antibody levels in 50% of the serotypes assessed. Published data also indicated that increased antibody levels for 50&#x02013;70% of the serotypes are thought to represent a normal humoral response to the pneumococcal vaccine; therefore, an exploratory analysis was done relative to a 70% response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although the conclusion of Daly and Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] indicates the endpoint of a &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2-fold increase in antibody levels is generally the appropriate measure for evaluating the immune response to the pneumococcal vaccine, a post hoc analysis with a &#x02265;&#x000a0;4-fold criterion was also evaluated by request. The results of all the additional analyses for pneumococcus were consistent with the primary endpoint that the response to vaccination in the IXE group compared to the control group was similar across both groups. The percentage of subjects with a &#x02265;&#x000a0;2-fold increase in at least 70% of serotypes for the pneumococcal vaccine, as well as those with a&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;4-fold increase for at least 50 and 70% of serotypes for the pneumococcal vaccine, was similar. Thus, the results of this study support the conclusion of Daly and Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] that the 2-fold increase criterion used to test the primary objective for the pneumococcal vaccine represents a definition of adequate antibody production to vaccination. Finally, while other studies, to evaluate whether a medicinal product could affect the response to the pneumococcal vaccine, typically prespecified only six to 12 of the 23 vaccine serotypes for evaluation of the response, all 23 serotypes were assessed in this study. By evaluating a subset of serotypes, it could be argued that the data can be analyzed using the most prevalent serotypes, accounting for disease in the population of interest. If this study had evaluated only these subgroups of serotypes, the conclusion of noninferiority of IXE to control would also have been achieved.</p><p id="Par36">All AEs were mild in severity. The most commonly reported AEs in subjects in the study were headache, injection site erythema, and fatigue.

In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, adverse reactions that occurred in the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in &#x02265;&#x000a0;1% of patients and more frequently than those in the placebo group also included injection-site reactions, as well as upper respiratory infections (includes nasopharyngitis and rhinovirus), tinea infections, and nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Neutropenia observed in healthy subjects treated with IXE was not associated with infection, and the low-grade transient neutrophil changes were consistent with observations from previous clinical studies with IXE in patients with psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as well as other anti-IL-17 biologics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The PK parameters in healthy subjects were within the range observed in patients with psoriasis. Thus, clinically relevant concentrations of IXE were achieved in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">While patients with chronic diseases, such as psoriasis, are likely to need vaccinations while on therapy, it is preferable, but not always practical, to vaccinate prior to initiating therapy. Routine vaccinations for patients with psoriasis are recommended prior to treatment with biologics; however, concurrent vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to assess the immunization status of their patients as part of their initial consultation in order to optimize their treatment plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par39">Although this study included both T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent vaccines commonly used by healthcare providers, these are only two of the routine non-live vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Due to the prevalence of use of the tetanus vaccine in the US population, the majority of subjects at baseline in both the IXE and control groups had protective levels of anti-tetanus antibodies, despite the exclusion criterion that precluded subjects who had received a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine within the previous 5&#x000a0;years. However, this potential limitation was mitigated by using the change from baseline for the primary analysis. While the multiplex immunoassay format has been associated with more interlaboratory variability and higher antibody levels when compared to ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], these subject samples were all assayed at the same laboratory. Additionally, these differences do not adversely impact interpretation of the protective result of vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Lastly, this evaluation was performed in healthy subjects, and vaccine response was not studied in patients who had immune-modulated disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">IXE does not suppress the humoral immune response to non-live, T-cell-dependent or T-cell-independent vaccines as assessed using tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines in healthy subjects.
