The rationale of pit and fissure sealants is that, when they are applied into the caries prone fissures, they penetrate and seal them from the oral environment. This study aims to correlate the relationship between the viscosity of the sealant, resin tag length and microleakage.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>30 third molars were selected for study. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group E: Embrace wetbond, H: Helioseal, G: Guardian seal. Teeth were cleaned with pumice prophylaxis and pretreated with acid etching and bonding agent. The respective pit and fissure sealants were applied. Teeth were placed in 1% methylene blue dye and sectioned mesio-distally into two halves. These were used to assess the microleakage using stereomicroscope and resin tag length using SEM. Viscosity was assessed using Brooke's field viscometer.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Viscosity was lowest for Embrace wetbond and highest for Guardian seal. Microleakage scores were highest with Guardian seal and lowest with Embrace wetbond. Resin tag lengths were longer with Embrace wetbond as compared to other groups. There is a definite negative correlation between viscosity, resin tag length and microleakage. Lower the viscosity, the longer were the resin tags and the microleakage decreased. Embrace wetbond pit and fissure sealant had lowest viscosity, longest resin tag length and lowest microleakage scores.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Embrace wetbond appears to be compatible with residual moisture and ideal for use in children, where isolation is a problem.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dental caries</kwd><kwd>pit and fissure sealant</kwd><kwd>resin tag length</kwd><kwd>viscosity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x0201c;Intellectuals solve problems; geniuses prevent them!!&#x0201d;</p><p>Caries occur five times more frequently in occlusal fissures, than on smooth surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Sealant not only prevents tooth decay before it starts, but also halts the progress.

Retention is provided by resin tags that form an effective mechanical interlock between resin material and enamel surface. Viscosity of sealant enhances penetration, thus helping in retention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However it still remains to be evaluated as to how exactly do the factors, such as, resin tag length, microleakage and viscosity affect the clinical efficacy of these sealants.

Occlusal pits and fissures vary in shape, but are generally narrow (~ 0.1 mm wide) and tortuous, and are considered to be an ideal site for the retention of bacterial and food remnants. This is because the morphology renders the mechanical means of debridement inaccessible[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] as an average tooth brush bristle (0.2 mm) is too large to penetrate most of the fissures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Other factors such as lack of salivary access to the fissures, the close proximity of fissure base to the dentino-enamel junction and remnants of debris and pellicle in the fissures increase caries susceptibility of fissures by many folds. Therefore, to prevent initiation of caries in these fissures, the concept of pit and fissure sealants evolved.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The cariostatic properties of sealants are attributed to the physical obstruction of the pit and fissures. This prevents colonization of the pits and fissures with new bacteria and also prevents the penetration of fermentable carbohydrates to any bacteria remaining in the pits and fissures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Various studies show strong correlation between the sealant and absence of caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p><italic>Requisites of an efficient sealant include:</italic> A viscosity allowing penetration into deep and narrow fissures even in maxillary teeth, adequate working time, rapid cure, good and prolonged adhesion to enamel, low sorption and solubility, resistance to wear, minimum irritation to tissues, and cariostatic action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The third molars extracted for therapeutic purpose, which were free of caries, developmental defects, enamel micro-fractures and discoloration were included in this study, as previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] have revealed that any preexisting alteration of surface morphology of the tooth directly influenced the caries progression. As compared to the formaldehyde, thymol has no effect on the protein structure and neither does it alter the enamel structure. Hence in this study, 0.01% thymol solution was used as a storage solution and disinfectant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Some studies show that pumice prophylaxis does not completely and consistently remove the pellicle and debris, especially in the depth of the fissure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Studies by Blackwood JA <italic>et al</italic>. showed that between enameloplasty, air abrasion and pumice prophylaxis, the least microleakage was seen with the conventional pumice prophylaxis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In the present study, despite of all the controversies, conventional pumice method was used for cleaning prior to etching.</p><p>Timing of the sealant placement is critical. The teeth that have newly erupted are the ones that are most susceptible to caries and hence need protection from pit and fissures. But isolating them is the most difficult. Until now the only moisture tolerant sealants were glass ionomers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Their mechanism of adhesion is ionic bonding, not micromechanical retention to an acid etched enamel surface. Paradi and co workers reported low sealant retention rates with glass ionomer cement (GIC).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Recently, resin-based sealant technology has introduced a moisture-tolerant chemistry. While traditional sealants are hydrophobic, Embrace<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Wetbond<sup>&#x02122;</sup> is hydrophilic. On light-curing, this sealant has physical properties similar to other commercially available sealants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Embrace Wetbond incorporates di-, tri- and multifunctional acrylate monomers into an advanced acid-integrating chemistry that is activated by moisture. When placed in the presence of moisture, the sealant spreads over the enamel surface. Because of its unique chemistry, Embrace Wetbond is miscible with water and flows into moisture-containing etched enamel and combines with it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Additionally, a longitudinal study done <italic>in vivo</italic> with embrace wetbond has shown a retention rate of 90%. Only 32 teeth out of the 334 teeth in the study required replacement of the sealant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Early in the development of sealants, it was recognized that the addition of fluoride to a sealant could have the potential benefits of additional caries protection. The fluoride release achieved high levels initially, with salivary fluoride concentration being high within 30 minutes after sealant placement; however, returned to baseline levels within 1-2 days after the sealant placement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Evaluation of the combined use of fluoride and dental sealants has showed retention of 92% after 4 years. This suggests that pit and fissure sealants confer additional caries preventive benefits beyond those of fluoride therapy alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>A sealant is effective in preventing caries, only when it is retained in the fissures. Hence the retention becomes a major factor, influencing the efficacy of the sealant. The retention in resin based pit and fissure sealant is through micromechanical interlocking between the resin and the enamel. Mechanical retention of sealant is the direct result of resin penetration into the porous enamel forming tags. This occurs by capillary action. Monomer in the material polymerizes and the material becomes interlocked with the enamel surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In the present study the mean length of tags obtained was in the range of 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m to 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Other studies by Gomez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and Karina Tonini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] have also concurred with the measurements obtained. It was seen in our study that the pit and fissure sealant with the longer resin tags had lesser microleakage. Thus, it can be postulated that, the longer resin tags formed, lesser will be microleakage. Other than surface tension, the viscosity of the sealant also influences the penetration of sealants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow. This resistance of the fluid to flow is controlled by internal frictional forces within the liquid. A highly viscous fluid flows slowly. The viscosity is measured in units of MPa (Mega pascal) per second or cP (centipoise). Higher viscosity may cause poorer adaptation and incomplete penetration to the bottom of the pit and fissures resulting in decreased retention. With low viscosity sealants, there is a greater potential of the sealant to flow, spread more rapidly over the surface and penetrate. At times the size of the filler particles may be larger than the porosities of enamel. Faster penetration rates are found with larger holes, less dense liquids and those with high surface tension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] On the contrary, the study by DM Barnes, P kihn, A Elsabach and JA von Fraunhofer has shown that the viscosity and flow properties of the fissure sealants do not affect their sealing ability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Hence, we tried to analyze the nature of relationship between viscosity and the other factors of pit and fissure sealants.</p><p>The viscosity of sealants can be assessed in centipoise units using ultrasonic vibratile viscometer or by conventional capillary tube method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] The ultrasonic vibratile viscometer is a more accurate method as compared to the capillary tube method, as it gives a digital read out. The viscometer rotates the spindle in the liquid to overcome the viscous resistance to the induced movement, and thus a reading is obtained.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] In this study, the Brookfield viscometer was used. All Brookfield laboratory viscometers are accurate within the range of +/- 1%, and have a reproducibility within the range of +/- 0.2%, thus allowing the test results to be duplicated anywhere in the world when the same model instrument is used. In the present study, the viscometer utilized required a minimum volume of 10 ml sample. To achieve this, 1ml of each sealant was first diluted in 9 ml of the diluent, methlymethacrylate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Hence, the relative viscosities of the three sealants were obtained.</p><p>In the present study, the sealant with fluoride i.e. Guardian seal showed highest viscosity. It has been shown that sealant containing fluoride tends to be thicker than those without fluoride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] The least viscous was the Embrace wetbond. Urethane monomer based sealant may confer more elasticity and adhesiveness to the resin than does Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate (Bis-GMA).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] In this study, two of the sealants Helioseal and Guardian seal contained Bis-GMA, where as the Embrace wet bond contained di, tri and multiacrylate monomers. That may be the reason why the viscosity of Embrace wetbond was lower as compared to the other groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Another factor thought to be central to the clinical success of sealants is microleakage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Microleakage is defined as the passage of bacteria and their toxins between restorative margins and the tooth preparation walls. Clinically microleakage is important when one considers that pulpal inflammation is more likely caused by bacteria than by chemical toxicity of restorative material. Microleakage may support the caries process beneath the sealant, hence the ability of the sealant to adequately seal the pits and fissures and prevent microleakage is important. If restoration is hermatically sealed, then the bacteria cannot survive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>Microleakage assessment may be qualitative or quantitative with different systems, including both simple and computer based methods. Dye penetration has been used in several studies, to assess the presence of marginal leakage around the sealant&#x02013;enamel surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] In the present study, a qualitative technique of dye penetration was used. Penetration of dye can indicate the lack of a perfect seal. The presence of a dye in the under penetration zone of the etched enamel can indicate a susceptible microleakage pathway. Clinically, this may imply that the remaining etched area could be a factor for development of caries by microleakage, if the sealant was partially or completely lost.</p><p>All the sealants used in this study showed some degree of microleakage and these factors agreed with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] The least microleakage was seen with the Embrace wetbond sealant, followed by Helioseal and Guardian seal. Complete penetration of sealant into complex fissure systems is difficult due to the phenomenon of closed end capillaries or isolated capillaries. Some lateral fissures arising from the main fissures also fail to be filled with sealant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Hence, further research on the effect of fissure morphology on sealant microleakage and penetration are necessary. Stereomicroscope is the gold standard in microleakage studies and hence was used here. The SEM was used to measure the length of the resin tags as the SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, and reveal details about less than 1 to 5 nm in size. Due to the very narrow electron beam, SEM micrographs have a large depth of field yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>]</p><p>It should be noted that the results of the present study are valid for <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Depending on the environment, all pit and fissure sealants may act differently due to other variables like type of fissures, preparation of fissures, enamel etching and conditioning, application of bonding agent and contamination of prepared surfaces of fissures. Appropriate method of application of sealants and viscosity of the sealant, are also a factors influencing the microleakage, and if a proper application method is followed, it can increase the length of resin tag and thus improve the efficiency of the sealant in preventing caries.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study clearly indicated that, there does exists a relationship between the resin tag length and microleakage, and the longer the resin tags formed, the lesser is the microleakage, and the better will the cariostatic action of the pit and fissure sealant be. The viscosity too plays a role in the formation of these all important resin tags. The lower viscosity sealants are better. Also, with the newly developed hydrophilic sealant Embrace wetbond, it is now possibly to go ahead and seal the newly erupted teeth that were previously left unprotected due to moisture control problems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Sadashiva Shetty, Principal of Bapuji Dental College; for his support in making this study a success, the Indian
