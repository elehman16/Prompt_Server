Although these drugs are effective in reducing the risks associated with thrombotic disease, they are associated with various limitations [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. VKAs are currently the most widely used oral anticoagulants. However, management of VKA therapy is complicated due to the narrow therapeutic index of VKAs, slow onset and offset of therapeutic effect and numerous dietary and drug interactions [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As such, frequent monitoring and dose adjustment are required to manage patients on VKA therapy. Like VKAs, unfractionated heparin also requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. The need for parenteral administration of heparin and heparin derivatives is an additional considerable obstacle to the long term use of these agents. Therefore, there is a need for new anticoagulants that can be administered orally and with sufficiently predictable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics such that they would not require regular monitoring or dosage adjustment during routine clinical use.</p><p>To address the unmet medical need, oral agents targeted to inhibit thrombin or factor Xa have been developed [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Factor Xa, a trypsin-like serine protease, converts prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for fibrin clot formation. Evidence from preclinical animal models suggests that direct factor Xa inhibitors exhibit excellent antithrombotic efficacy with minimal bleeding risk when compared with direct thrombin inhibitors. This has been attributed to the attenuation of thrombin generation, but not the activity of thrombin, by factor Xa inhibitors, thereby preserving haemostatic function [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Results of clinical studies with direct factor Xa inhibitors have supported the preclinical findings that factor Xa inhibitors are effective antithrombotic agents with a minimal bleeding risk [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Apixaban (BMS-562247) is a highly selective (&#x0003e;30 000-fold selectivity over other coagulation proteases), potent (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.08 n<sc>m</sc>) and orally bioavailable (&#x0223c;50% bioavailability) [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] inhibitor of both free and prothrombinase-bound factor Xa [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a rabbit model of venous thrombosis, apixaban exhibited potent antithrombotic effects at doses that preserved haemostasis [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apixaban was superior to enoxaparin 40 mg daily for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients who had received total knee or hip replacement surgery [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and a favourable benefit&#x02013;risk relationship in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>This report describes the first in-human evaluation of apixaban safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects. Results of a second study, conducted to assess the effect of a high fat, high calorie meal on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban, are also presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Participants in these studies had to be healthy, non-smoking, non-obese (body mass index: 18&#x02013;30 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) male or female subjects (female subjects were required to be non-nursing, non-pregnant and not of childbearing potential) aged 18&#x02013;45 years. Subjects were excluded for significant, acute or chronic medical conditions (including relevant trauma), any significant head injury within the last 2 years, current or recent (within 3 months) gastrointestinal disease, any recent surgery (within 4 weeks) or planned surgery within 2 weeks of study completion, history of abnormal bleeding or coagulation disorder, history of gastrointestinal conditions that could impact on drug absorption, history of significant drug allergy, recent exposure to over the counter, prescription or investigational medication or a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents was prohibited. Eligible subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The protocol for the single ascending-dose study was approved by the New England Investigational Review Board (Wellesley, Massachusetts, USA) and the protocol for the food effect study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, Washington, USA). Both protocols complied with local regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.</p><sec><title>Single ascending-dose study</title><p>This was a first-in-human, single centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending-dose study conducted from 4 December 2002 to 2 February 2003. Subjects participated in one of seven dose panels. Within each panel, subjects were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio to receive a single dose of apixaban (<italic>n =</italic> 6) or matching placebo (<italic>n =</italic> 2) according to a computer-generated randomization scheme prepared and provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). The pharmacist responsible for dispensing the blinded study drug was unblinded with respect to study drug identification, but was not involved in any other aspect of study conduct. All subjects, in addition to the medical staff, were blinded to treatment assignment.</p><p>Apixaban was administered as a 0.25 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> oral solution for doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 mg (with solution for placebo doses matched by volume) and as 5 mg oral tablets or matching placebo for doses of 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg. All doses were administered under fasted conditions. Subjects were admitted to the clinical facility (BMS Clinical Research Center, Hamilton, New Jersey, USA) 2 days (day &#x02212;2) prior to study drug administration for baseline procedures and remained in the facility until discharge (day 5). Escalation to the next dose panel occurred only if safety data through day 3 for six subjects in the ongoing dose panel were considered acceptable by the investigator and sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Food effect study</title><p>This was an open label, randomized, two period, two treatment, crossover study carried out between 20 November 2003 and 20 December 2003. Subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 24) were admitted to the clinical facility (ProMedica Clinical Research Center, Boston, MA, USA) and randomized to receive a single oral dose of 10 mg apixaban (2 &#x000d7; 5 mg tablets) after a 10 h fast or 5 min after consumption of a standard high fat, high calorie breakfast. The apixaban dose of 10 mg was chosen as it represented the likely clinical dose range. The alternate treatment was administered after a minimum 5 day washout period. Meal composition was based on a standard high fat, high calorie breakfast and consisted of: two fried eggs (&#x0223c;184 kcal), one tablespoon butter (&#x0223c;102 kcal), three strips of bacon (&#x0223c;109 kcal), two slices of white bread toast (&#x0223c;134 kcal), one tablespoon jelly (54 kcal), 4 oz hash brown potatoes (&#x0223c;252 kcal) and 8 oz (237 ml) whole milk (&#x0223c;150 kcal) [<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Meals were consumed within 30 min. At the time of dosing, 240 ml water was administered to subjects in both treatment periods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>All available data from subjects who received any study drug (apixaban or placebo) were included in the summaries of safety data. For both studies, safety assessments were performed on admission to the clinical facility, prior to study drug administration and at scheduled intervals thereafter. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). The single ascending-dose study also included assessment of template bleeding time (Simplate&#x000ae;-II R device, Organon Teknika, Durham, North Carolina, USA), measured at screening, before and 3.5 h after dosing, and faecal occult blood. In addition, assessment of arachidonic acid platelet aggregation was performed pre-dose at each treatment period of the food effect study to ensure exclusion of those subjects who had used aspirin within 1 week of enrolment or during the furlough period. Data on AEs were obtained from information volunteered by or solicited from the subjects and by the investigators&#x02019; review of their vital signs, ECG and laboratory test results.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><p>In both studies, blood samples (4.5 ml) for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected from an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture. In the single ascending- dose study, serial blood samples were collected prior to administration (<italic>t</italic> = 0) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after apixaban administration. Samples in the food effect study were collected prior to administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 and 60 h post-dose. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (range 1 to 1000 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was used to determine apixaban plasma concentration. The methods were validated based upon 2001 FDA method validation guidance. In the single ascending-dose study, the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) using a 1/x<sup>2</sup> weighted quadratic fit. The inter- and intra-precision runs were &#x02264;9.4% and &#x02264;3.7 %CV, respectively with an accuracy of &#x000b1;10.2. In the food effect study, the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed by Alta Analytical (El Dorado Hills, CA, USA) using a 1/x<sup>2</sup> weighted linear fit. The inter- and intra-precision runs were &#x02264;0.8% and &#x02264;5.9 %CV, respectively with an accuracy of &#x000b1;2.3.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), the corresponding time to maximum concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve to infinity and to the last observed concentration (AUC(0,&#x0221e;) and AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>), respectively) and apparent terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>)) were determined using established non-compartmental methods using Kinetica (Version 4.02) software (Thermo Electron Corporation, Philadelphia, PA, USA) [<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Apixaban <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> were determined from experimental observations. The slope (&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>) of the terminal phase of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profile was determined with a weighting factor of 1 by the method of least squares (log-linear regression of at least three data points). The <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was estimated as ln2/&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>. The AUC(0,&#x0221e;) was determined by summing the areas from zero to the time of last measured concentration, calculated by using conventional trapezoidal and log-trapezoidal methods and the extrapolated area. The extrapolated area was determined by dividing the last measured concentration by the slope of the terminal log-linear phase [<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamic assessments</title><p>In both studies, blood samples (4.5 ml) at baseline (<italic>t</italic> = 0) and 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after administration of study medication were collected in 3.2% citrated tubes for measurement of the pharmacodynamic effects. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were determined by the BMS Clinical Laboratory (Hamilton, New Jersey, USA). The INR in both studies and prothrombin time (PT) for the food effect study were measured using a Diagnostica Stago STA-Compact&#x000ae; coagulation analyzer (Parsippany, New Jersey, USA) with Stago Neoplastin CI and aPTT was measured using a Diagnostica Stago Compact analyser with PTT Automate 5. Additionally, in the single ascending-dose study, modified prothrombin time (mPT) was measured in apixaban-treated subjects. The assay was performed by Covance Laboratory (Chantilly, Virginia, USA) using a modified thromboplastin reagent on an MLA-1800 coagulation analyzer (Medical Laboratory Automation Inc., Mount Vernon, New York, USA). The thromboplastin reagent (Thromboplastin C + , Dade Behring, Newark, Delaware, USA) was modified by diluting 1 : 2.25 with 100 n<sc>m</sc> calcium chloride, which slows the clotting reaction and provides a broader dynamic range for measuring the effect of factor Xa inhibitors [<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacodynamic parameters determined as part of the single ascending-dose study included area under the response&#x02013;time curve from the time of dose (0 h) to 24 h post-dose (INR AUC(0,24 h), aPTT AUC(0,24 h) and mPT AUC(0,24 h)), area under the response&#x02013;time curve to the last sample collected (INR AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>)<sub>,</sub> aPTT AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>) and mPT AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>)), as well as maximum (INR<sub>max</sub>, aPTT<sub>max</sub> and mPT<sub>max</sub>) and minimum (INR<sub>min</sub>, aPTT<sub>min</sub> and mPT<sub>min</sub>) values observed within the 0&#x02013;24 h post-dose interval.

There was no evidence of a dose-related trend in AEs. The majority of AEs were of mild to moderate intensity and were considered possibly related to study drug. None required treatment. There were two severe AEs (abdominal pain with 10 mg apixaban and musculoskeletal pain with 50 mg apixaban) considered possibly related to study drug. Both subjects completed the study. Three subjects had bleeding-related AEs (one subject with haematochezia who received 25 mg apixaban and two subjects with haematuria who received 50 mg apixaban), all mild in intensity. On follow-up, internal haemorrhoids were subsequently diagnosed in the subject with haematochezia.

Five AEs were reported by three subjects, who discontinued because of these events.

No other relevant laboratory abnormalities or AEs were reported for this subject. While an effect of study drug cannot be ruled out in this study it is not uncommon to observe sporadic elevation of liver function tests in phase I studies even after administration of placebo [<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two subjects who reported concurrent upper respiratory tract infections were discontinued due to decreased arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation that was considered mild in intensity. These AEs were observed following the return of these subjects from furlough prior to dose administration for the second period. Although not confirmed, it is possible that these subjects consumed aspirin or an aspirin-containing cold medication while on furlough.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><sec><title>Single ascending-dose study</title><p>All subjects who received apixaban were included in the pharmacokinetic assessments.

Apixaban in single oral doses of up to 50 mg appeared to be safe and generally well tolerated in this study population. No dose-limiting AEs were observed and, consequently, a maximum tolerated single dose for apixaban was not determined. Based on the limited number of bleeding-related AEs and no evident effect on template bleeding time, a single dose of apixaban appeared to prolong clotting time in healthy subjects without excessively impairing haemostatic function. Similarly, administration of 10 mg apixaban with or without food was well tolerated, with few AEs observed.</p><p>Apixaban is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with maximum concentrations appearing 1.5&#x02013;3.3 h after administration. Although <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> was reached slightly earlier following administration of the oral solution (1.5&#x02013;1.8 h) relative to the tablet (2.5&#x02013;3.3 h), these differences were minimal and indicated that the tablet dissolved rapidly. In the single ascending-dose study, apixaban <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> ranged from 7 to 27 h at doses that provided sufficient data to characterize the terminal elimination phase (i.e. 5&#x02013;50 mg; the shorter <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> calculated following oral doses &#x02264;2.5 mg is likely due to the inability to characterize fully the terminal phase with an assay LLOQ of 1 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.) Based on the data obtained from the food effect study, the apixaban <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was approximately 12 h. The pharmacokinetics of apixaban were well characterized and exposures (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC) appeared to increase in a dose-proportional manner across the 0.5&#x02013;50 mg dose range tested.</p><p>Apixaban exposure was not affected by administration of a standard high fat, high calorie meal. The only pharmacokinetic parameter that changed with a high fat meal was an increase of 1 h in median <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>. This increase in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> likely represents the slower gastric emptying observed following consumption of a high fat, high calorie meal [<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and is not clinically relevant as <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, AUC and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> remained unchanged and similar to those seen for the same apixaban dose in the single ascending-dose study.</p><p>The pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban were consistent with selective inhibition of factor Xa. Single doses of apixaban resulted in rapid and dose-related increases in clotting assay parameters (INR, aPTT and mPT). The consumption of a high fat meal did not alter the effect of apixaban on clotting time assessments. The INR and aPTT assays have traditionally been used to measure the effect of anticoagulants such as VKA and heparin, respectively. While modest dose-related increases in these tests were observed following apixaban administration, the magnitude of the increases in INR or aPTT following apixaban administration would be considered minimal relative to the effect observed following administration of therapeutic doses of a VKA or unfractionated heparin, as the results following apixaban administration were within the normal range for the reporting laboratory (0.7&#x02013;1.5 and 24&#x02013;35.9 s, respectively). These results support preclinical evidence that traditional clotting assays, such as INR and aPTT [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] may not be adequately sensitive for reliable evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of direct reversible factor Xa inhibitors. Unlike oral VKAs, changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were evident less than 1 h following a single dose of apixaban. The clotting time prolongation closely followed the apixaban concentration&#x02013;time profile, such that the maximal clotting time occurred near the apixaban <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, and returned to baseline coincident with the apixaban elimination phase.</p><p>The mPT assay provides improved sensitivity over the PT assay, making it suitable for the measurement of anticoagulant activity in individuals receiving factor Xa inhibitors [<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among the clotting assays included in the single ascending-dose study, the mPT test demonstrated the greatest sensitivity to apixaban in human plasma. The mPT assay was a more sensitive assessment of apixaban activity than INR or aPTT. These mPT results indicated that traditional clotting time assays may not be suitable for assessing the effect of direct factor Xa inhibitors without modification and further validation.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of certain oral drugs can be affected by the concomitant administration of food. For example, the presence of food has been shown to alter gastric pH, gastric emptying, gastrointestinal motility, bile secretion and may also affect the biotransformation of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract wall and/or liver [<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A safe, effective oral anticoagulant with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that are not influenced by food would offer the promise of advantages to patients due to increased convenience of drug administration and reduced potential for complications. The effect of food on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin is well established [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Warfarin and other VKAs have several known interactions with food, mostly due to alterations in vitamin K content [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Variability in warfarin exposure in conjunction with its narrow therapeutic index requires close and constant management of consumed foods, and other factors such as antibiotics that alter gut flora, so as to avoid unwanted AEs. Food has been shown to impact on the pharmacokinetics of another factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban. Administration of a single 10 mg dose of rivaroxaban following consumption of a standard high calorie, high fat meal resulted in a 28% and 41% increase in rivaroxaban AUC(0,<bold>&#x0221e;</bold>) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for both), respectively. Administration of a single 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban following a similar meal resulted in a 23% and 74% increase in rivaroxaban AUC(0,<bold>&#x0221e;</bold>) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, respectively. A similar increase in rivaroxaban exposure was observed following administration with a high carbohydrate meal [<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A high calorie, high fat breakfast did not affect the extent of absorption of the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran [<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The lack of an effect of food on exposure and pharmacodynamic activity of apixaban represents a desirable feature for an oral anticoagulant.</p><p>In summary, single doses of apixaban were well tolerated over a wide dose range and resulted in dose-related prolongation of clotting times across the dose range. The pharmacokinetics of apixaban were predictable, dose-proportional and correlated with pharmacodynamic effects. Food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban. Therefore, apixaban can be given without regard to meals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Andrew Shenker, MD, PhD and Zhigang Yu, PhD, for their assistance with analysis and reporting the food effect study.
