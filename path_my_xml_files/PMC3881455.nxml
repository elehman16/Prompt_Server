immediately after surgery on pain and function in patients diagnosed with shoulder
impingement syndrome. [Subjects] The subjects were assigned by random sampling to an
experimental group (n=15) to which stabilization exercise was applied and a control group
(n=15) to which ordinary physical treatment was applied. [Methods] To evaluate the degree
of pain, a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used. The Constant-Murley Scale (CMS)
was used to evaluate the functions of the shoulder joints. To determine the range of
motion, a goniometer was used to measure range of shoulder motion. The simple shoulder

[Results] There were significant differences in all the items of the experimental group.
The results of comparison of the therapeutic effect in the experimental and control groups
revealed significant differences in active abduction, passive abduction, VAS, SST, and the
CMS, except for pain. [Conclusion] The results suggest that shoulder stabilization
exercise positively affects pain alleviation and functional recovery in shoulder

Anatomically, it consists
of a shallow articular fovea, which can easily cause instability between the acromion and
the humeral head. Due to this instability, pain in the shoulder joints is the second most
frequent type of complaint, surpassed only by lumbar pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shoulder impingement syndrome, a shoulder joint disease, has become widely known since it
was first reported by Neer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
underlying pathological mechanism is self-perpetuating aggravation, which results from
repetitive mechanical compression of the rotator cuff muscle.</p><p>Treatment for it divided into conservative treatment and surgical treatment. Conservative
treatment involves rest, medication, exercise, and electrotherapy. In early-stage
impingement syndrome, conservative treatment is effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, it is desirable to perform exercise treatment after the
pain has subsided and the soft tissues have been relaxed by a warming and cooling treatment
and electrotherapy.</p><p>The shoulder joint area is subject to damage because it has the largest range of motion in
the body. As its stability depends on muscular activities, abnormal movement may easily
change its structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization
exercise on a scapular plane does not place excessive force on the shoulder joints.
Therefore, this type of exercise may be used safely by patients with shoulder joint damage
or by patients immediately after surgery. It can be employed to correct abnormal scapular
location and movement function disorders related to abnormal dynamic adjustment and to
stabilize the entire shoulder girdle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on the effects of stabilization exercises on the stability of the scapula in
shoulder impingement syndrome patients immediately after surgery is lacking. Thus, this
study examined the effects of scapular stabilization exercises immediately after surgery on
pain and function in patients diagnosed with shoulder impingement syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 30 patients who visited S orthopedic hospital located in Cheongju

stabilization exercise was applied and a control group (n=15) to which ordinary physical
treatment was applied. The purpose of the study was explained to the subjects, and consent
to participate was obtained prior to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To evaluate the degree of pain prior to and after the treatment, a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue
scale was used.</p><p>The Constant-Murley Scale (CMS), which is a well-known, standardized clinical evaluation
method, was used to evaluate the functions of the shoulder joints. Evaluation items
included the degree of pain, range of motion, activities of daily living, muscle power,
and total score. It is a 100-point scale consisting of subjective elements (35 points) and
objective elements (65 points). The subjective elements were composed of the degree of
pain (15 points) and activities of daily living (20 points), and the objective elements
were comprised of the range of motion (flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal
rotation; a total of 40 points) and muscle power (25 points); the higher each item or
total score was, the better the function was considered. To determine the range of motion,
a goniometer (Jamar, USA) was used to measure the passive flexion, active flexion, and
extension. The simple shoulder test (12 items) was used to determine the condition of the
shoulder joints of the subjects.</p><p>The control group received ordinary physical treatment to reduce pain: heat treatment for
20 minutes, ultrasound therapy for 5 minutes, laser treatment for 15 minutes, and
interferential current therapy for 20 minutes. The experimental group conducted
stabilization exercise after receiving the ordinary physical therapy applied to the
control group.</p><p>In the scapular stabilization exercise, the subjects lay on their sides with the
nonparetic side on a treatment table. The elbow joint and the shoulder joint of the
paretic side were bent at 90&#x000b0;, and the hands were placed on the treatment table. The
therapist placed a slight weight on the upper extremity of the paretic side and directly
applied resistance against elevation, depression, and retraction on the scapula of the
subjects and applied resistance against protraction on the subjects&#x02019; olecranon fossa. The
therapist applied smooth resistance to the subjects.</p><p>In the stabilization exercise for the shoulder joints, the subjects were placed in a
standing position with both hands pressed against the wall and the shoulder joints bent at
90&#x000b0;. At this point, the therapist applied alternative resistance to the shoulder and the
trunk, and the subjects were instructed to maintain their position against such
resistance.</p><p>In all the exercises, the subjects maintained the position for 10 seconds, and they took
a rest for 3 seconds. Ten repetitions was considered one set, and the subjects conducted
three sets. A break of 3 minutes was given between each set. In stabilization of the
scapula and shoulder joint, the therapist alternatively applied resistance in different
directions to the subjects. The treatment was applied three times per week, for four
weeks, for a total of 12 times.</p><p>In the data processing, descriptive statistics were used to detect general
characteristics of the subjects. A paired t-test was employed to examine differences in
pain alleviation and functional improvement of the experimental group and the control
group before and after the treatment. For the data analysis, SPSS (version 12.0) for
Windows was used, and the significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant differences in active flexion, active abduction, and passive

functional recovery of shoulder impingement syndrome patients immediately after surgery.
Shoulder pain is a very common musculoskeletal disease with a high incidence rate (about 7
to 36%). It affects about 20% of the entire adult population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The incidence rate of such shoulder pain is known to increase with
age and is highest in those around 50&#x02005;years old<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Twenty-eight percent of shoulder damage needs medical treatment,
such as orthopedic intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional disorder of the shoulders or shoulder pain greatly affects the performance of
essential activities of daily living, degrades the quality of life, and may lead to severe
disorders, thereby making it impossible to work for extended periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Medical conditions that trigger shoulder pain include adhesive capsulitis, impingement
syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, hemiplegic shoulder pain, glenohumeral instability,
glenohumeral joint arthritis, and biceps tenosynovitis. Among these, shoulder impingement
syndrome has been reported as a very frequent causative factor in shoulder pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Symptoms of shoulder impingement syndrome include pain and edema of the shoulder joints and
restriction in anterior flexion, internal rotation, and abduction. In the early stage of the
disease, patients feel pain in the shoulder joints when raising the hands outward or
forward, and most have difficulty sleeping due to pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the symptoms progress, instability and discomfort of the
shoulder joint occur, and stiffness of the joints increases.</p><p>In terms of treatment, functional motions should be watched from overall appearance, and
separate evaluation of the shoulder joint motions is meaningless. Adjustments of the scapula
and movements of the shoulder joints are interdependent. Therefore, when a person tries to
move the upper extremities and the range of motion is decreased, the joints and soft tissues
are damaged. So the treatment needs to consider the arrangement and movement of the scapula
and the humerus. Moreover, imbalance and pain in the shoulder girdle muscle can trigger
inappropriate postural changes, such as a static fixed posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preventive aspects for problems may occur in the future,
and muscular imbalance should be considered. Stability should be obtained first to ensure
that the scapula and the shoulder joints are equipped with the capabilities to respond
effectively to the movement of the scapula and the shoulder joints. The second step should
focus on external rotation, flexion, and abduction. The third step should address aspects of
adduction, extension, and internal rotation, in that order.</p><p>Magee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> defined stabilization as a
person&#x02019;s ability to consciously and unconsciously adjust large and minute movements of the
joints and noted that the shoulder joints had the largest range of motion in the human body.
As these are unstable, this study also noted that the role of muscles is important in
dynamic stability and that normal movement patterns of the shoulder joints are accompanied
by stabilization rhythms of the scapula.</p><p>Scapular stabilization exercise is used to correct abnormal scapular location and
functional movement disorder and primarily provides stability to the entire scapula<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For stability of the shoulder joints,
balanced development of the shoulder joint complex is important, but stability of the
scapulothoracic joints rather than the glenohumeral joints should be provided first. The
scapulothoracic joint is an imaginary joint consisting of soft tissue mobilization planes
comprising the shoulder joint area. The function of the scapulothoracic joint is essential
for mobility and stability of the upper extremities.</p><p>As stabilization exercise of the scapular plane does not place excessive force on the
shoulder joints, it can be safely applied to patients with shoulder joint damage immediately
after surgery. The current trend in rehabilitation exercise for low back pain patients is to
focus primarily on the internal stability of the lumbar spine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An approach to motor damage of the shoulder joint should be made after the scapula is
normally adjusted by stabilization of the scapula. Any functional disorder in the shoulder
joint should be approached together with treatment by external rotation motions. Both
abduction and flexion motions depend on external rotation. Therefore, if conditions for
precise external rotations (ideal joint arrangement and muscle contraction capabilities) are
not present, it is difficult to expect painless motions. Thus, stability of the scapula in
functional movement disorders of the scapula should be obtained first, and this should be
followed by external rotation, flexion, abduction, adduction, extension, and internal
rotation exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, active flexion, active abduction, passive flexion, and passive
abduction were significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the experimental group. This result is
consistent with the findings of a study by Jung et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who examined the effects of scapular plane stabilization exercise
on upper extremity muscle strength. The significant increase in active flexion and abduction
is attributed to correction by the stabilization exercise of the abnormal location of the
scapula and functional movement disorder related to abnormal dynamic adjustment.</p><p>In the group with shoulder impingement syndrome who participated in stabilization exercise
immediately after surgery, there was a significant difference in pain, activities of daily
living, and muscle strength and an improvement in flexion and abduction, although the latter
was not significant. The primary problem with the scapula is inappropriate scapula movement
and downward rotation. Downward rotation, protraction, abduction, and elevation trigger
shortening of the upper trapezius and the levator scapulae due to their excessive action and
the weakening of the lower trapezius and the serratus anterior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, this triggers approach of the humeral head
to the acromion, and flexion and abduction of the shoulder joints is restricted; this
results in abnormal arm elevation and impingement syndrome. Elevation of the shoulder joint
becomes more difficult due to shortening of the pectoralis major muscle and the pectoralis
minor muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Obviously, external rotation of the shoulder joints is necessary for free movement of the
supraspinatus muscle and tendon when subjects stretch or raise their arms. In particular,
external rotation of the shoulder joints aids vertical displacement in the subacromial
space. Without this motion, the humeral head crushes the mucous cyst and the supraspinatus
muscle tendon within the subacromial space due to a lack of vertical displacement of the
humeral head, triggering chronic pain and leading to functional restriction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the evaluation in the present study using the CMS, there were significant differences in
all items between the experimental group and the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). This result is
consistent with that reported in the study by Jung et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who examined the effects of stabilization exercise on the range of
motion and pain. Their findings were attributed to the scapular stabilization exercise
preventing inappropriate contraction of the muscles, adjusting the movement, and aiding
proper posture. In this study, the use of stabilization exercise to treat shoulder
impingement syndrome in patients reduced their pain and had positive effects on their
functional recovery. However, this study had some limitations, namely, a short study period
and a small number of subjects. More efficient and systematic research to shed light on the
role of stabilization exercise is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>EE</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The shoulder a structure of subtlety</article-title>.
