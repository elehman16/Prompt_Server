Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) enables HIV-infected people to live longer and remain healthier.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Early initiation of ART delays the time to AIDS, serious non-AIDS events, and mortality among HIV-infected adults.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> HIV-infected adults on ART who have achieved virologic suppression are 96% less likely to transmit the virus to sexual partners.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Moreover, results from the Promise Study showed that the risk of mother-to-child transmission drops to 0.5%&#x02013;0.6% in pregnant women on ART.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thanks to the progress spurred by the 2011 UNAIDS Global Plan for the Elimination of New HIV Infection Among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive, and an infusion of PEPFAR funding, substantial progress has been achieved in increasing antiretroviral (ARV) availability in low-resource settings, including lifelong ART for pregnant women living with HIV.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> At the end of 2013, 67% of HIV-infected pregnant women worldwide were receiving ARVs for their own health or for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The WHO 2013 guidelines recommend lifelong ART for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women regardless of CD4 count (Option B+),<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> effectively transforming MCH clinics into ART centers. However, in part because primary health care systems are set up to primarily deliver episodic acute care, high dropout rates along the HIV continuum of care is a critical issue that is currently limiting the long-term impact of PMTCT programs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where 90% of HIV-infected pregnant women live.</p><p>Data from early implementation of Option B+ in Malawi showed that about 1 in 6 pregnant women initiated on ART at antenatal care (ANC) registration did not return to the clinic after their initial visit.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis of women lost to follow-up (LTFU) across the &#x0201c;PMTCT cascade&#x0201d; found that 49% of HIV-infected pregnant women are LTFU between ANC registration and delivery, and 34% of mother-infant pairs are LTFU within 3 months of delivery.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Half of all vertical HIV transmissions are now estimated to occur during the breastfeeding period when most of the lactating women are not receiving ARV treatment.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In addition, less than 40% of HIV-exposed infants are tested for HIV within the first 2 months of life in priority countries.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Without substantial improvements to retention across the PMTCT cascade, the PEPFAR goal of an AIDS-free generation might not be achieved even if all HIV-infected pregnant women were identified and initiated on ART.</p><p>Numerous interventions have been proposed to address the retention challenge across the PMTCT cascade. A simple search of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> for the term PMTCT shows a number of ongoing or completed studies evaluating strategies such as text messaging, peer support, community health workers, conditional cash transfers, and more. We recently completed a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of conditional cash transfers on retention in and uptake of PMTCT services in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Previous results<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> showed that providing HIV-infected women with small and increasing cash transfers, conditional on attending scheduled clinic visits and accepting available PMTCT services, substantially increases the proportion of women who remain in care and receive available PMTCT services through 6 weeks postpartum. However, as recently demonstrated in a large trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis, adherence to scheduled visits and participation in study procedures when there are incentives conditioned on these specific behaviors do not always translate to adherence to prophylactic treatment.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Thus, whether adherence to scheduled PMTCT visits and acceptance of available services translates into better adherence to ART remained to be tested.</p><p>This study assessed whether HIV-infected women who received incentives to remain in care were as adherent to ARV treatment and achieved the same level of viral suppression at 6 weeks postpartum as those who did not receive incentives but also remained in care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Design and Study Population</title><p>Between April 2013 and August 2014, 433 newly diagnosed HIV-infected women, &#x02264;32 weeks pregnant, registering for ANC at 89 clinics in Kinshasa, DRC were recruited and randomized to receive either the standard of care or the standard of care plus small and increasing cash payments. These payments started at $5 and increased by $1 each month, on the condition that the woman attended scheduled clinic visits and, if requested, provided a blood sample for a CD4 count, accepted referral for ART, delivered in a health facility, and provided a blood sample for infant early HIV diagnosis at 6 weeks postpartum.

Adherence was determined by pill counts. On the basis of returned-product [zidovudine (AZT) or ART] counts at each follow-up visit, clinics staff calculated mean adherence as the number of pills not returned divided by the number of days since the previous visit at which products were dispensed. The calculated proportions were recorded in the mother-infant register used by clinics to routinely monitor PMTCT program implementation. At least once per month, study staff visited the clinics and extracted the adherence information from the register into an electronic database. Participants with 100% adherence recorded at all visits were classified as perfectly adherent; those with at least 1 visit with adherence less than 100% were classified as nonadherent.</p><p>For viral load, at the time of enrollment, delivery, and 6-week postpartum visit, clinic staff obtained a blood sample from each participant and prepared a dried blood spot [DBS (5 spots of 50 &#x003bc;L of whole blood)] on Whatman paper, dried at ambient temperature for a minimum of 3 hours, and then placed in a Ziploc bag with desiccant packs. Drivers were sent to pick up DBS samples and transport back to study headquarters, where samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until they were sent to the National AIDS Reference Laboratory in Kinshasa (LNRS), where viral load was quantified using the m2000rt Real-Time HIV-1 assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL), with a limit of detection of 40 copies per milliliter The LNRS laboratory had experience with viral load quantification from DBS and performed regular external quality control.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Baseline Covariates</title><p>Baseline characteristics considered were participant age in years, marital status (married/cohabitating or other), years of education, gestational age at first ANC registration dichotomized as early (&#x0003c;20 weeks) or not, initial PMTCT regimen (AZT or ART), CD4 count (&#x02264;350 or &#x0003e;350 cells/mL), and viral load (undetectable or not) at enrollment.

Similarly, over two-thirds of women retained in care achieved viral suppression at 6 weeks postpartum, but this did not differ between study groups either, providing further evidence that those who were retained in care as a result of receiving the cash incentive were as adherent to those who would have been retained in care without the incentive.</p><p>Incomplete adherence to ART has been found to be associated with a lack of financial support.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Subgroup analysis of the primary aims of the trial reported elsewhere<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> found that women in the lower wealth quintiles were more likely to be retained in care if they received the cash incentives. Our findings that there is no difference in adherence by study group suggest that the association between financial support and adherence is mostly mediated through retention. Conditional cash transfers made directly to vulnerable women might increase their control over financial resources and allow them to overcome barriers to clinic attendance such as transportation costs and opportunity costs of time. Adherence to ARVs was not a conditionality for receiving the cash incentives in this study and the cash incentives intervention did not affect adherent behavior among participants retained in care. Given this, more in-depth examinations, including qualitative analyses of the mechanisms by which cash incentive interventions increase desired PMTCT outcomes (retention in care and uptake of services), are needed to (1) enhance our understanding of how these interventions work and (2) improve our ability to design and scale-up similar interventions for PMTCT and other health and social issues.</p><p>Over 30% of participants were not adherent to their ARVs, data consistent with what has been observed in HIV-infected women elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> About 69% of women had an undetectable viral load at 6 weeks, a proportion that is similar to the 71% reported in a prospective cohort of pregnant women in Benin.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Receiving ART as the initial PMTCT regimen, having an undetectable viral load at baseline, and having started ANC before 20 weeks of gestation were all correlated with viral suppression at 6 weeks postpartum. In late 2014, DRC began rolling out the WHO's Option B+, which will help increase the proportion of pregnant women with an undetectable viral load and lower the risk of mother-to-child transmission. This is a step toward enhanced PMTCT, however, to further optimize PMTCT outcomes, additional efforts are needed to encourage pregnant women to start ANC visits as early as possible. Although 88% of pregnant women in DRC attend at least 1 ANC visit before delivery, only 17% had their first visit within the first trimester and less than half of them (48%) complete the recommended minimum of 4 visits or more.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Implementation science research is needed to further address barriers to timely and optimal utilization of MCH services, including PMTCT in resource poor settings.</p><p>In addition to its randomized design, this study has important strengths. All participants provided a DBS for viral load; however, 6 patients were missing results at 6 weeks because of either sample mishandling or inadequacy. Similarly, adherence data were available for a large proportion of participants (90%) and was collected routinely as part of PMTCT monitoring. However, the study also has several limitations. First, the study population was a subset of those initially randomized. Despite that, baseline characteristics remained balanced between study groups, the exchangeability of potential outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Second, we do not know which participants were retained in care specifically because of the monetary incentives they received. It is possible that adherence or virological suppression among these participants in particular is higher than it would be among other participants from the incentive and control groups who were included in this analysis. However, even if this were true, because we are interested in the total population effect of financial incentives on ART adherence and viral suppression, our strategy of comparing all participants who were retained in care seems more appropriate.</p><p>In conclusion, the provision of cash incentives to HIV-infected pregnant women led to higher retention in care at 6 weeks postpartum without any evidence of lower rates of adherence to ARVs and virologic suppression than those who did not receive the cash incentive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful for the participation and time of the mothers and infants in the study, the time and efforts of the personnel of the participating clinics, the technical support of Drs.
