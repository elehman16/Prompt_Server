Tobacco smoking has numerous effects on thyroid volume, function, and disease and a protective effect on development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid antibodies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Nicotine has anti-inflammatory effects (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) but cannot be recommended because it is addictive (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and toxic (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Anatabine, another <italic>Solanaceae</italic> alkaloid with a similar chemical structure, may have immunomodulatory properties. In a mouse model of thyroiditis, anatabine reduced the incidence and severity of thyroiditis and lowered the levels of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We designed a clinical trial to assess the effects of anatabine dietary supplementation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study sites, patients, and objectives</title><p>This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolling patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all study patients provided signed informed consent. Patients were recruited from 9 endocrinology clinics in the United States between March 2012 and August 2012.</p><p>The primary objective was to collect information on the effects of anatabine supplementation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Patients taking <sc>l</sc>-thyroxine were included, but only if their dose was &#x02264;1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg/d to exclude individuals with thyroid destruction incapable of responding to any intervention.

At visit 1 (screening), demographics, vital signs, medical and medication history, and blood and urine samples were collected, and ultrasonography was scheduled. At visit 2 (randomization), patients were randomly assigned to either the anatabine or placebo group. Thereafter, patients returned monthly for visits 3, 4, and 5 to complete the study procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Anatabine and placebo lozenge</title><p>Anatabine was provided by Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals and formulated into a flavored mannitol granulation lozenge that also contained fractional replacement doses of vitamins A (834 IU) and D<sub>3</sub> (66 IU), in both active and placebo units to reduce the chance that vitamin deficiencies might obscure an anatabine effect on autoimmunity. Anatabine lozenges were administered orally 3 times daily to a target total dose of 0.17 to 0.25 mg/kg/d. To reduce nicotinic type effects (eg, dizziness and nausea), patients started with 9 mg/d and advanced to the target dose during week 2. Patients who took less than 70% of assigned treatment (pill count) were excluded from the efficacy analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study outcomes and assays</title><p>The main experimental outcomes were serum TgAb and thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels. Other measures included serum TSH, free T<sub>4</sub>, free T<sub>3</sub>, and inflammatory biomarker (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-18) levels and ultrasonographic thyroid volume, echogenicity, and vascularity. The North Coast Clinical Laboratory (Sandusky, Ohio) performed the measurements of thyroid function and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Assays for TgAbs and TPOAbs and the 3 interleukins were performed at Johns Hopkins Immunological Disorder Laboratory (Baltimore, Maryland). Thyroid ultrasonography was performed at the 9 sites, and scans were sent to a central radiologist who read them blinded (Supplemental Table 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data set included thyroid-related variables (TgAbs, TPOAbs, TSH, free T<sub>4</sub>, free T<sub>3</sub>, volume, vascularity, and echogenicity), demographic variables (sex, age, race, and ethnicity), body mass index, inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-18), and safety outcomes.

Anatabine is an alkaloid found in plants of the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, including tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplants (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although the mechanism of action of dietary anatabine on thyroid autoimmunity remains to be elucidated, it may produce immunomodulatory effects through activation of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;2 or &#x003b1;7 cholinergic receptors similar to nicotine and other structurally related agonists (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In a mouse model of thyroiditis, anatabine decreases thyroidal IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 levels (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and in other experimental disease models it suppresses the inflammatory transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Multiple epidemiological studies have reported a protective effect of smoking on autoimmune hypothyroidism and thyroid antibodies (Supplemental Table 4). Noteworthy are studies showing selective effects of smoking on TgAbs. Analysis of 4125 randomly selected Danes found a negative association between smoking and the presence of thyroid antibodies; the most pronounced association was found between smoking and TgAbs, irrespective of TPOAb status (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Analysis of a prospective population-based cohort of 9362 pregnant mothers in Finland showed that mothers who smoked before pregnancy had a lower TgAb prevalence than nonsmokers (2.5% vs 4.7%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), whereas prevalences of TPOAb were similar (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Although TPOAbs and TgAbs are typically both measured for diagnostic purposes and often fluctuate in parallel with the disease course, the quantitative correlation between them is rather poor. Carl&#x000e9; et al (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) analyzed 145 patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune hypothyroidism and noted a correlation between TPOAbs and TgAbs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), but a low Pearson <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value (0.11). Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2007 to 2008 showed a similarly low <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.21 in &#x0003e;6200 Americans (unpublished data).</p><p>A retrospective chart review study found that surgical removal or radioiodine ablation of the thyroid leads to gradual reductions in both TgAbs and TPOAbs over several years, with TgAb levels initially declining more rapidly than TPOAb levels (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Based on those findings, it is possible that the differential response of TgAbs and TPOAbs that we observed after 12 weeks of treatment might have become less apparent after several additional months of anatabine supplementation, although that remains to be tested. It is also possible that anatabine specifically and directly affects thyroglobulin secretion resulting in a drop in TgAb production, as has been suggested regarding the effects of smoking on thyroid autoimmunity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Regardless of mechanism, anatabine in the diet reduced TgAbs much like smoking, without nicotine or exposure to toxic smoke constituents.</p><p>Anatabine supplementation was safe and well tolerated. Patients in the anatabine group reported more AEs relative to those in the placebo group during upward dose titration, mostly mild nicotinic effects that resolved with dose adjustment.</p><p>The primary limitation of this study is its short duration. Longer treatment is required to show a clinically meaningful effect on thyroid gland function and structure. In addition, vitamin D is known to affect immune function (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and the addition of this vitamin to both the active and placebo formulations may have obscured a treatment effect because TPOAb levels decreased in both groups. Third, the dose of anatabine may have been too low, although the amount taken per day (0.17&#x02013;0.25 mg/kg) was expected to be safe and effective based on case reports of individuals who experienced positive immunomodulatory effects within this dose range. Fourth, the inclusion of patients who were taking levothyroxine could have influenced the results, because TgAb levels were lower in individuals in the anatabine group who were receiving levothyroxine therapy. Further studies are needed to determine whether anatabine could be an adjunctive therapy to levothyroxine or whether its effects would be more or less robust without the addition of vitamins A and D<sub>3</sub>. Finally, because urinary iodide measurements were not performed, a potential effect of dietary iodine status on anatabine responsiveness could not be assessed.</p><p>This study shows that nutritional supplementation with anatabine significantly reduces circulating TgAb levels in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These results confirm an immunological effect of anatabine in humans as shown previously in a preclinical model of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Collectively, the results of this trial suggest that further studies of anatabine in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and other autoimmune disorders, including studies that monitor changes noted above for longer time periods and elucidate its mechanism of action, are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
