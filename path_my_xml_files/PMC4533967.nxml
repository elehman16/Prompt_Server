Five hours after lens application, one of the following three interventions or a control was performed on each eye: replacing the existing lens with a new lens; removing and reapplying the same lens; performing a &#x02018;scleral swish&#x02019;; and no action (control).

Disappointingly, the number of discontinuations from lens wear approximately equals the number of new fits each year [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Contact lens discomfort (CLD) has been consistently reported as the leading cause of lens drop out [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Wearers experiencing CLD usually experience fewer comfortable wearing hours [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and they may feel compelled to alter their wearing habits in order to relieve discomfort [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This reduced wearing time may lead to temporary periods of lens discontinuation and ultimately to lens drop out [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite the improvements made by manufacturers over many years in the development of new materials and lens designs as well as the increased availability of daily disposable (DD) contact lenses, comfort during lens wear continues to be problematic, especially towards the end of the wearing period [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Although extensive research on CLD has been conducted [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the reasons why comfort decreases over the course of the wearing period are not clearly understood. Contact lenses go through changes during wear e.g. dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], surface modification [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], variation in lens parameters [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and such lens modifications may potentially cause the contact lens to become irritating or uncomfortable. On the other hand, the presence of the contact lens on the eye may cause changes to the ocular tissues that are in direct contact with the lens. Alterations to the ocular surface caused by the lens such as lid parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been associated with symptoms of discomfort. It is also unclear whether or not CLD is driven by an underlying inflammatory response. The contact lens causes disruption of the tear film which is likely to lead to reduced replenishment of the post-lens tear film in soft contact lens wear [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The stagnation of the post-lens tear film may in turn lead to an increased accumulation of debris, inflammatory cells and other tear film components behind the lens [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] resulting in increased adverse inflammatory events [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies have speculated that post-lens debris may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Contact lens wear has been shown to increase the level of certain inflammatory mediators present in the tear film [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although there is still little evidence of the influence of inflammatory mediators on CLD, some of these specific tear components such as cytokines may be involved in the generation of pain [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, the interaction between the lens and the lid margin may create friction, which might trigger an inflammatory response. Morgan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported an increase in potential inflammatory cells at the lid margin after contact lens wear which was greater in subjects wearing high-friction contact lenses.</p><p>It is still unknown whether end-of-day discomfort is primarily mediated by ocular factors or contact lens factors. If changes to the lens itself trigger symptoms of discomfort, replacing the lens with a new, fresh contact lens should improve the comfort. Recent work by Papas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has shown that lens replacement mid-way through a wearing day does not influence end-of-day comfort in hydrogel and silicone hydrogel DD contact lens wearers. The authors have hypothesized that a &#x02018;fatigue-like&#x02019; response in the ocular tissues may be induced by the presence of the contact lens. Since symptomatic contact lens wearers differ from asymptomatic wearers in several aspects such as frequency and intensity of symptoms, number of comfortable wearing hours [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and tear film characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], this investigation set out to investigate whether such findings also occur in symptomatic lens wearers.</p><p>Scleral swish is a procedure performed by some contact lens wearers to replenish the post-lens tear film and to clear debris trapped under the lens. During this procedure the contact lens is slid off of the cornea and onto the temporal conjunctiva. The wearer then blinks a few times and the lens is moved back onto the cornea. Considering that post-lens inflammatory mediators in the tear film could potentially negatively affect comfort, it is of interest to investigate whether performing a scleral swish part way through the wearing day has any impact on end-of-day discomfort.</p><p>Subjective scores for lens wearer comfort have traditionally been collected using rating scales at scheduled visits or by subjects annotating their responses in a diary. Devices such as mobile phones present an alternative method of collecting subjective data in that they allow the collection of instant responses and avoid the use of retrospective data [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous studies have used Short Message Service (SMS) text messages to collect comfort data during contact lens wear [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The use of automated SMS messages allows collection of comfort data at various points throughout the day (e.g. on an hourly basis) and therefore, a more comprehensive monitoring of contact lens comfort throughout a wearing day is possible.</p><p>The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of replacing the lens with the same or with a new lens or performing a scleral swish part way through the wearing day on comfort in symptomatic DD soft contact lens wearers. Assessing the effect of these interventions during the course of a wearing day may allow further insight into what factors (i.e. ocular factors or contact lens factors) mediate end-of-day discomfort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial protocol and CONSORT checklist are available as (see <xref rid="pone.0135323.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135323.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>). Ethical approval for this subject-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was obtained from the University of Manchester Committee on the Ethics of Research on Human Beings. The study was conducted at Eurolens Research, The University of Manchester and all subjects received written information about the study before they signed a written statement of consent to participate. The study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. This clinical trial was registered retrospectively at ISRCTN10419752. The study was not registered before subject enrolment started since this is not a requirement of our ethics committee. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>As no previous data were available for this work, it was not possible to conduct <italic>a priori</italic> power analysis. Thirty symptomatic DD soft contact lens wearers were recruited and a post-hoc analysis of the power of the work was carried out. Recruitment began in August 2013 and was completed in March 2014. Eurolens Research has a database of subjects who have indicated a willingness to participate in contact lens studies. An export of subject details was filtered according to relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were contacted directly by letter or e-mail. Subjects were also recruited through advertisement on The University of Manchester Research Volunteering website.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Experimental protocol</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Screening visit</title><p>At a screening visit details of the ocular history were recorded and an anterior eye examination was undertaken to ensure that all subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were of legal age (18 years) and capacity to volunteer, understand their rights as a research subject, <italic>w</italic>illing and able to sign a statement of informed consent, willing and able to follow the protocol, wear daily disposable soft contact lenses and have worn them for a period of at least six months, be classified as symptomatic according by Young et al. method [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and willing to wear contact lenses for at least 12 hours a day. Exclusion criteria were any systemic or ocular disorder that may affect ocular health, grade 2 or greater of any anterior ocular clinical signs using Efron grading scales [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], use of any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment, previous cataract or corneal refractive surgery, pregnant or lactating and unacceptable contact lens fit (grade -2 or +2 on a -2 to +2 grading scale) [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The parameters of subjects&#x02019; habitual DD contact lenses were also recorded. Ocular symptoms were assessed using the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8) [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Only subjects who were classified as symptomatic according to the criteria set out by Young et al [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] were recruited. Briefly, subjects are classified as symptomatic based on their responses to the CLDEQ-8 questionnaire on frequency of dryness and intensity of end-of-day dryness. Subjective comfort was assessed using an annotated vertical analogue comfort scale where 0 represented &#x02018;causes pain, cannot be tolerated&#x02019; and 100 represented &#x02018;excellent, cannot be felt&#x02019;. Subjects provided comfort scores for their habitual contact lenses for: comfort at the start and at the end of the day, overall lens comfort and comfort during the study visit. Contact lens wear experience, wearing time of DD lenses, hours per day of lens wear, and days per week of lens wear were recorded. High contrast logMAR visual acuity with contact lenses was measured under high illumination conditions. The following aspects of lens fitting were assessed: horizontal and vertical centration, movement (in the primary gaze position after a blink), and corneal coverage [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Deposition, post-lens debris, and lens surface wettability were evaluated using the schema described by Morgan and Efron [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Study intervention days</title><p>Subjects attended the clinic on two further days (there was no wash-out period). On each day, subjects attended the clinic in the morning without any lenses in situ (and not having worn lenses beforehand on the day). A new pair of their habitual DD lenses was applied directly from the packaging solution and worn for at least 12 hours. Comfort scores were recorded before lens application and 6 minutes post-application using the 0 to 100 grading scale. Automated SMS text messages via mobile phone were sent to subjects every hour following lens application requesting a comfort score using the same scale. Five hours after lens application, the investigator performed one of three interventions on each eye together with a control:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Replacing the existing lens with a new lens: the existing lens was removed and a new, fresh contact lens was re-applied directly from the packaging solution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Removing the existing lens and reapplying the same lens: the existing lens was removed and placed in a lens case containing 0.9% sterile saline (Eye Care solutions, Crest Medical Ltd, Warrington, UK) for up to one minute to hydrate the lens and then re-applied.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Performing a &#x02018;scleral swish&#x02019;: the contact lens was slid off the cornea onto the temporal conjunctiva. Subjects were then asked to fully blink five times, and then the lens was slid back onto the cornea.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No action (control): the contact lens was not manipulated in any way.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The interventions were randomly assigned to each eye (i.e. each eye received a different intervention) and subjects were masked to whether the re-applied lens was a new lens or the same lens. The investigator generated the randomization scheme using the web site Randomization.com (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>), which created random permutations of interventions for a situation where subjects were to receive all of the interventions in random order.</p><p>Comfort scores were recorded 6 minutes post-intervention and subjects continued to respond to hourly SMS messages until they removed their lenses. Comfort scores before lens application, 5 hours post-application, and 6 minutes post-intervention were recorded on paper because subjects were at the clinic at these times. Comfort at 6 minutes post-application at the start of the day was recorded via SMS to confirm that subjects were receiving the text messages on their phones without any problems. Only SMS comfort scores received within 30 minutes from the target time were included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using JMP 10 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). In common with previous literature reports of subjective contact lens comfort scores [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], our comfort data were analyzed using parametric methods. Specifically, a linear mixed model was constructed with the factors of interest being time post-application (Time) and type of intervention (Intervention), subject (as a random effect) and the intervention*time interaction term. Any significant differences were investigated post-hoc with a Student&#x02019;s t-test. The least square (LS) means are reported.

The factors that drive this diurnal decrease in comfort are yet to be fully understood. This study reports the effect of replacing the lens with the same or with a new lens or performing a scleral swish part way through the wearing day on comfort in symptomatic DD soft contact lens wearers. The results indicate that the interventions performed had no meaningful impact on end-of-day comfort, which suggest that the decrease in comfort observed in symptomatic DD lens wearers may be driven by ocular factors rather than by lens-related factors.</p><p>It is well known that symptomatic contact lens wearers have a more pronounced decline in comfort and increase in dryness symptoms towards the end of the wearing period compared with asymptomatic subjects [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the present work, the decrease in comfort over a continuous 12-hour wearing period (i.e. no action performed) was approximately 28 units. Differences in the methods used to assess contact lens comfort as well as in the criteria used to classify subjects (i.e. as symptomatic or not) should be born in mind when comparing our results with previous research. However, the reduction in comfort over the day we observed is in agreement with previous studies where symptomatic wearers showed a marked reduction in comfort using visual analogue scales [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In a study conducted by Fonn et al [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the reduction in comfort in symptomatic subjects over a 7-hour wearing period was approximately 22 units. Additionally, in a later study by the same author [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the decrease in comfort in symptomatic lens wearers over a 7-hour wearing period was between 20 and 40 units depending on the lens type. We observed significant variability in our comfort data which is consistent with previous work which have also shown greater variability of comfort ratings in symptomatic lens wearers than in asymptomatic wearers [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Replacing the lens or performing a scleral swish part way through the wearing day had no clinically significant impact on end-of-day comfort. There was a statistically significant difference in comfort score following the intervention between the new lens group and the control group, with comfort being greater for the new lens group. However, we consider that this small difference in comfort (3.6 units) is clinically insignificant, since it is lower than the difference of 7&#x02013;8 units (on a 100-point scale) previously reported as the minimum noticeable difference in ocular comfort that contact lens wearers could detect between the two eyes [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similar results have been reported by Papas et al [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], who reported that end-of-day comfort was not influenced by lens replacement in subjects wearing hydrogel and silicone hydrogel lenses. Papas et al [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported a marked, although not significant, comfort increase immediately following lens replacement that subsequently dissipated toward the end of day in hydrogel lens wearers. In the present study, none of the interventions investigated had any significant effect on comfort either immediately (i.e. 6 minutes post-intervention) or at the end of the wearing period. Papas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] assessed comfort at 2&#x02013;3 minutes after lens replacement, while in the present study comfort was assessed 6 minutes after the intervention had been performed. In addition, the work conducted by Papas consisted of two separate studies: the first study in hydrogel lens wearers (adapted and neophytes) and the second one in silicone hydrogel lens wearers (adapted). In the first study, half of the hydrogel lens wearers replaced their lenses with the same lens and the other half with new lenses, while in the second study all silicone hydrogel wearers were exposed to both scenarios. It is not mentioned in the study whether subjects were symptomatic or asymptomatic. In our study, all subjects were symptomatic adapted lens wearers wearing either hydrogel or silicone hydrogel DD lenses. All subjects were exposed to all the interventions in a contralateral study design. Differences in methodology as well as in subject demographics may explain disparities between studies.</p><p>Comfort gradually decreased over the 12-hour wearing period in a similar fashion in all groups regardless of the type of intervention that had been performed. Reapplying the 5-hour worn lens had the same effect on comfort as applying a new, fresh lens, suggesting that changes to the lens during the early part of lens wear (such as dehydration,[<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] changes to the lens surface [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], changes to lens parameter [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], etc.) do not have a major impact on comfort in DD symptomatic contact lens wearers. Performing a scleral swish, which replenishes the post-lens tear film (and also potentially removes debris and inflammatory mediators from the post-lens tear film) had no significant impact on comfort either. Since this study did not measure inflammatory mediators or post-lens debris directly, it would be erroneous to assume that these factors do not affect contact lens comfort in DD contact lens wearers. Since no data were collected, it can only be hypothesized that the degree of debris or inflammatory mediators developed over short-term wear of DD lenses may not be sufficient to cause the diurnal decrease in contact lens comfort [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the role of inflammation in CLD is still unclear and the fact that adverse symptoms are relieved immediately following removal of the contact lens [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggests that other factors may be involved in end-of-day discomfort.</p><p>Subjects experienced a steady decrease in comfort which becomes more pronounced at the end of the wearing period (i.e. between 8&#x02013;9 hours and 12 hours), as indicated by the increased slope of the decrease in comfort being steeper at the end of the wearing period. This pronounced decline was observed in all groups, including the control group (i.e. no action performed), which shows that changes in comfort may be more critical during the last few hours of lens wear. This finding also lends weight to the hypothesis that the contact lens itself induces a &#x02018;fatigue-like&#x02019; response in the ocular tissues which was put forward by Papas [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some alterations in the ocular environment related to the presence of a contact lens on-eye that have been associated with CLD include: alterations in the bulbar conjunctiva such as LIPCOF [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; alterations in the palpebral conjunctiva such as LWE [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and MGD [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; and alteration in the neuroreceptors of the ocular surface [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The lid margin has recently received special attention given its interaction with the contact lens surface and its potential important role in contact lens comfort. Future research should be conducted in order to ascertain which ocular tissue is primarily responsible for CLD.</p><p>In the present study subjects wore their habitual DD contact lenses, and therefore the blister-pack solution (BPS) could have influenced the results. Packaging solutions incorporate a variety of components such as surfactants and wetting agents in order to improve lens wettability, prevent the lens from sticking to the blister pack and improve initial (or long-term) on-eye comfort [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although the direct effect of the BPS on contact lens comfort has not been investigated in this work, differences in the composition of the BPS between the different lenses [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] could in theory have affected (either positively or negatively) comfort results for the intervention where the existing lens was replaced by a new lens which was applied directly from the blister packaging.</p><p>A contralateral design was used in the present study. The fact that different interventions were performed in different eyes of the same subject may have induced a confounding effect on the comfort responses. Previous studies have shown that there is a physiological contralateral effect, in that the intervention performed in one eye may have an impact on the other eye [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, we believe that this contralateral effect is mitigated to a large extent by the randomization employed in the study design. Additionally, simultaneous exposure of both eyes to different interventions might allow a more direct comparison between interventions.</p><p>The use of electronic devices such as mobile phones has become an alternative method of collecting subjective data in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The use of SMS text messages allows collection of contact lens comfort in real time and avoids the use of retrospective data. In this work using hourly text messages, 90% of messages were received within 30 minutes of the scheduled time point and the mean time response was 5 minutes. These results are consistent with those reported by previous studies where SMS messaging was used [<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The high response rate and the rapid response confirm that the use of SMS via mobile phone is a very successful and efficient method of collecting subjective data that provides a comprehensive understanding of the changes in contact lens comfort over the course of an entire wearing day.</p><p>In summary, comfort showed a continual and significant decline over a 12-hour wearing period in the symptomatic DD contact lens wearers who took part in this work. None of the interventions investigated had any clinically significant impact on end-of-day comfort, which suggests that discomfort in lens wearers may be more heavily influenced by changes to the ocular environment rather than to the lens itself. Future research should be directed towards understanding which ocular tissue(s) is primarily responsible for driving the reduction in comfort typically over the course of a contact lens wearing day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135323.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135323.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135323.s002"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135323.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135323.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
