on joint function recovery and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of patients with total knee
replacement. [Subjects] Forty-six patients with total knee replacement were recruited and
allocated to either low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy (n=15), cryotherapy (n=15), or
a combination of both (n=16). Therapy was administered once a day, 5 times a week for 3
weeks. To determine functional joint recovery and reduction of inflammation, changes in
the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (K-WOMAC), range of
motion (ROM), and CRP were assessed postsurgically and four times over a 3-week period.
Using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), homogeneity tests were performed based on
participants&#x02019; general characteristics. To recognize changes in time-variant K-WOMAC, ROM,
and CRP values between groups, repeated measures ANOVA was performed, and Tukey&#x02019;s test was
used for post-test analysis. Values at &#x003b1;=0.05 were considered significant. [Results] We
found a difference between groups and times, and the group that received the combined
therapies showed greater changes in outcomes than the group that received low-intensity
pulsed ultrasound therapy alone. [Conclusion] Applying both low-intensity pulsed
ultrasound and cryotherapy can relieve inflammation and enhance joint function in patients
who undergo total knee replacement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy</kwd><kwd>Crytherapy</kwd><kwd>C-reactive protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Degenerative arthritis is a frequent disorder, occurring in 65% of senior citizens in
Korea. This disorder infiltrates the skeleton and limbs as a progressive or inflammatory
lesion that causes loss of function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such cases eventually require total knee

that aims to improve daily life and sports activities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, rehabilitation involves pain control and emotional
care as well as mobility, attaining maximum joint range of motion, and reinforcement of
muscle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, deep infections that occur early postoperatively are the main reason for pain and
functional disorder; these complications of decide prognosis after surgery. Treating
patients with these infections increases the cost of postsurgical care because this
treatment extends the length of treatment, which is the main factor that impedes smooth
rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Infection is difficult
to diagnose and can persist for 6 months, even in non-infective group<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, blood tests measuring C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are ordered to trace and determine the
efficacy of treatments and to determine prognosis for fever, pain, erythema, and acute
pyogenic infection<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, physical
therapeutic arbitration for relieving inflammatory symptoms, promoting synostosis or healing
of wounds, and laser therapy are being performed to lower temperature of tissues, and
microcurrent therapy and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy are being widely used<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Saito et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 46 total knee
replacement patients who were divided into cryotherapy and control groups. Creatine kinase
(CK) and CRP levels were measured before and after treatment; they found that the levels
were statistically lower in the cryotherapy group. Hence, lowering tissue temperature can
ease pain and aid in tissue recovery after surgery. Moreover, Chung et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> triggered synovial inflammation by
injecting Freund&#x02019;s of adjuvant and found that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy
produced an anti-inflammatory response. Studies on low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and
cryotherapy are being conducted; however, studies regarding recovery of joint function and
the inflammatory index CRP levels after total knee replacement are lacking. Therefore, our
study investigated the effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and cryotherapy on
recovery of joint function, pain, and CRP levels in patients who underwent total knee
replacement in order to suggest systematic and effective means of managing patients after
surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was authorized by the Institutional Review Board (Number: 2013-01) of Sehan

2013. Female participants who underwent total knee replacement at M hospital were fully
informed about the aim and methods of this study. Participants had no problems in other
musculoskeletal and nervous system lesions other than that at the surgical site.
Participants were randomly allocated to receive low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy
(Group A), cryotherapy (Group B), or both treatments (Group C).</p><p>Participants consisted of 15 members in Group A, 15 Group B, and 16 Group C; the
participants&#x02019; average ages in each group were 66.6, 68.5, and 67.6&#x02005;years, respectively.
Their mean heights were 155.4, 156.2, and 157.1&#x02005;cm, and their weights were 56.6, 69.1, and
58.4&#x02005;kg, respectively. Groups A, B, and C had CRP levels of 3.76, 3.5, 3.88&#x02005;mg/dl,
respectively; and their range of motion (ROM) values were 86.9&#x000b0;, 87.1&#x000b0;, and 88.3&#x000b0;,

four times for three weeks within a week.</p><p>K-WOMAC which was used to assess recovery of joint function, is a self-assessment that
consists of questions that index three items: pain level, ankylosis, and degenerative

of joint (0&#x02013;8 points), and 17 questions for difficulties in daily life (0&#x02013;68 points). Higher
the total points, greater is the severity the knee joints. Joint ROM was measured using a
goniometer with the reference point being the line connecting the lateral femoral condyle,
greater trochanter, and fibular lateral malleolus when lying face down. CRP levels were
tested by collecting 5 cc patient&#x02019;s blood using latex agglutination turbidimetry utilizing
monoclonal antibody A15 (Biosystems, Japan).</p><p>According to general characteristics of participants, the homogeneity test was performed
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To recognize changes in time-variant K-WOMAC,

changes the density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> receptors and promotes phosphorylation of proteins

control group; the results showed that pain and wound recovery rates were higher in the
ultrasound and microcurrent groups than control group. This suggests that pulse ultrasound
directly or indirectly heals tissues. Although physiological effects laser therapies are
unknown, laser therapy is known to reduce blood flow. Reduced blood flow might reduce edema,
inflammation, and hematoma<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> found a reduction for ESR for groups receiving cryotherapy and

cryotherapy after knee arthroscopic surgery could perform weight bearing and had reduced
reliance on analgesic dosage. Furthermore, Morsi<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> found that patients who underwent knee arthroscopic surgery and
received cryotherapy experienced less hemorrhage, reduced reliance on pain medications, and
improved joint range of motion compared to controls, which is similar to the results of this
study. However, the curative effect observed in those who received both therapies was higher
than those who received one therapy alone; therefore, combined treatment after total knee
replacement may have a higher curative value.</p><p>This study is limited in that we did not control activities of patients and their
medication regimens (i.e., anti-inflammatory medications); thus, this variability may
influence joint function or CRP levels. Nonetheless, the combination of low-intensity pulsed
