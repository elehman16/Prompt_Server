Persistent severe pain affecting daily activities is present in 5% of patients <xref rid="pone.0109144-Franneby1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Kalliomaki1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in spite of exploratory surgery including selective neurectomy <xref rid="pone.0109144-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Bischoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, that has been associated with a satisfactory outcome, the invasive nature of the procedure requires availability of medical treatment options for patients reluctant to undergo repeat surgery or not fit for a surgical procedure. The evidence-base for pharmacological treatment of persistent pain following inguinal hernia repair is nearly non-existent and therefore it is of considerable clinical relevance to identify the efficaciousness of drug therapy.</p><p>The capsaicin 8% cutaneous patch is used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain and significant pain-relief for up to 12 weeks has been observed in randomized, controlled trials in post-herpetic neuralgia and HIV-related distal neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0109144-Derry1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109144-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Capsaicin is a selective agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) receptor residing on nociceptive peripheral nerve fibers and keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0109144-Ringkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The effect of capsaicin is assumed to be mediated by a reversible defunctionalization of cutaneous nociceptors thereby inhibiting transmission of nociceptive signals <xref rid="pone.0109144-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Treede1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The long lasting pain relieving effect, up to three months after a single capsaicin 8% patch application, is of particular clinical interest. From a pharmacodynamic view, the localized action of the capsaicin patch confers a reduced risk of systemic side effects and a lessened potential for drug interactions. In an un-controlled prospective study (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1,044) the capsaicin 8% patch relieved pain and improved sleep quality in patients with various peripheral neuropathic pain states <xref rid="pone.0109144-Maihofner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, in this cohort 23% of the patients experienced persistent postsurgical pain of differing etiologies. However, the efficacy of capsaicin 8% patch treatment has never been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in persistent postsurgical pain. Purified capsaicin has been shown to reduce acute postoperative pain following inguinal hernia repair. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial intraoperative wound instillation of purified capsaicin significantly reduced pain scores in the capsaicin group during the first 4 days after inguinal hernia repair <xref rid="pone.0109144-Aasvang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study we tested the hypothesis that capsaicin 8% patch treatment would be associated with a higher analgesic efficacy compared to placebo in patients suffering from severe persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain.</p><p>Since changes in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) have been observed following capsaicin 8% patch application in healthy volunteers <xref rid="pone.0109144-Malmberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we investigated the effect of capsaicin on IENFD and sensory function, assessed by thermal and mechanical thresholds, as secondary outcomes.

The sensory testing area on the pain side included the point of maximum pain and in addition the contralateral inguinal region was used as a control area. The warmth and cool detection thresholds (WDT, CDT) and the heat pain threshold (HPT) were determined using a computer controlled thermode (Somedic AB, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden; contact area 2.5&#x000d7;5.0 cm<sup>2</sup>). The baseline temperature was 32&#x000b0;C and thermal stimuli were delivered with a ramp rate of &#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C/s with cut-off values of 50&#x000b0;C for heat, and 5&#x000b0;C for cold stimuli. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) was assessed at the point of maximum pain using a handheld pressure algometer (Somedic AB, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden; 1 cm<sup>2</sup> felt-tipped probe) applied perpendicularly to the skin, until the pressure was perceived as painful or exceeded the cut-off value of 350 kPa. A heat stimulus (5 s at 47&#x000b0;C, ramp rate 1&#x000b0;C/s) was delivered at the point of maximum pain to evaluate the suprathreshold heat pain perception (STH) rated by the patient (NRS).

Prior to biopsies, the skin areas were anesthetized with 1&#x02013;2 ml of mepivacaine (10 mg/ml, AstraZeneca AB, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden). The IENFD was estimated in agreement with previously described methods <xref rid="pone.0109144-Bischoff3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Torvin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the biopsies were washed in phosphate buffer and then stored in 10% sucrose with 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4&#x000b0;C, until analysis. Sections of 50-&#x000b5;m thickness were immunostained with the pan-neuronal marker PGP-9.5 (1&#x02236;800, Ultraclone, Wellow, UK) and visualized with Cy3-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (1&#x02236;100, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Intraepidermal nerve fiber counting was performed with a light-microscope (Zeiss Axiophot 2, Wetzlar, Germany) and Spot advanced software (Windows Version 4.5, Sterling Heights, MI). The skin biopsies were analyzed blinded in regard to side.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Treatment procedure and blinding method</title><p>The research nurse and the physician responsible for the intervention did only meet the patient on the day of treatment and were not further involved in the study. The research nurse delineated the patch area corresponding to the inguinal pain distribution including the point of maximum pain. Patients were pre-treated with a topical local anesthetic cream (EMLA, lidocaine/prilocaine 25 mg/25 g, AstraZeneca AB, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden) 60 min before patch application. The patch application, patch removal, and skin cleansing were done by a physician. During this procedure the research nurse was not allowed presence in the treatment room since minute quantities of aerosolized capsaicin-particles during patch handling could have led to accidental un-blinding of the research nurse.</p><p>The capsaicin patches (capsaicin 640 &#x000b5;g/cm<sup>2</sup>, 8% w/w; Astellas Pharma Europe B.V., Leiderdorp, The Netherlands) and the inactive placebo patches were identical in appearance and composition (in regard to vehicle substances). An inactive placebo patch was used since an active placebo patch was not obtainable from the manufacturer of the capsaicin patch. The patients were informed that they might experience pain during and after the patch application. The patches were applied in the groin area for 60 min. After patch removal a cleansing gel (Astellas Pharma Europe B.V., Leiderdorp, The Netherlands) was applied in order to remove capsaicin residues. In order to decrease local irritation of the skin cool packs (assistCo AS, Rjukan, Norway) were administered for 45&#x02013;60 minutes after patch removal. Patients were told to use oral acetaminophen 1 g every 6 h and ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 h for up to 3 days as needed after patch application. The patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation throughout the study. At the clinical visit 1 month after patch application patients were asked to report if they had experienced application site skin reactions (erythema, pain, burning sensation) or any other adverse events. To evaluate patient blinding we asked patients at the clinical visit 1 month after patch application to verbally report which treatment they had received.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The pain intensities during the 3 standardized conditions (at rest, during movement and pressure evoked), were evaluated twice daily in the 3 days preceding patch treatment (baseline) and in the 3 days preceding the clinical visit at 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application. The median value of the 3 standardized pain assessments was used to calculate the summed pain intensity (SPI) values (containing 6 median values [pain assessments twice daily for 3 days]) in accordance with a previously described method <xref rid="pone.0109144-Bischoff3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The summed pain intensity differences (SPID) were calculated for 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application, as the difference between the baseline SPI-value and the post-treatment SPI-value. The primary outcome was comparisons of SPIDs between capsaicin and placebo treatments at 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application. No data from previous studies were available and the <italic>a priori</italic> sample size calculation was therefore based on the best estimates for the study cohort. Based on a significance level of 0.01 (&#x003b1;), a power of 0.9 (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1), an estimated standard deviation for the SPI assessments of 3.1 (NRS), and a minimal relevant difference for the six SPI assessments of 4.5 (NRS), the estimated number of patients needed in each group were 24 (48 in total). In order to compensate for dropouts the number of patients was set to 50. Due to uncertainties in the power calculation an interim analysis by an independent statistician was planned <italic>a priori</italic> following completion of the first 32 patients.</p><p>Linear regression analyses for repeated measures (a mixed model method) were used to evaluate the treatment effects over time. The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) was the outcome variable and treatment group (capsaicin or placebo) and time (1, 2 and 3 months after patch application) were explanatory variables. While measurements taken at different time points were expected to correlate, we also assumed that measurements taken at adjacent time points were more correlated than measurements further apart, and therefore we used an unstructured covariance structure (all covariance parameters are freely estimated). We used the PROC MIXED procedure and the repeated statement in SAS software (9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to estimate the model. We included the interaction because we were interested in testing whether potential group differences changed over time. The mixed model is dealing with missing longitudinal measures and the analysis included all patients with at least one SPID-value. For secondary outcomes, including QST variables and questionnaire scores (DSIS, HADS, PCS, S-LANNS), differences (&#x00394;) between post-treatment follow-up and baseline values were used to compare capsaicin and placebo patch treatments. The numbers of patients included in the data analyses vary for different outcome measures and are indicated in the tables for each analysis.</p><p>The normality of data was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visual estimation of relevant residual distribution plots. Comparisons between treatment groups were performed with unpaired t-tests (normally distributed data) and the Mann-Whitney tests (non-normally distributed data). Fischer&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare proportions. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (SPSS 20.0, Chicago, IL) and MedCalc Software (12.3.0.0, Mariakerke, Belgium). The linear regression analyses for repeated measures were performed with SAS software. Due to the three statistical tests performed (comparisons 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application) and the planned interim analysis, thus increasing the probability of a type I error, all results were considered significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 (two-tailed).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 46 patients were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109144-g002">fig. 2</xref>).

The current study, the first to evaluate changes in IENFD following capsaicin patch treatment in patients, failed to show a significant difference in IENFD between treatment groups. A plausible explanation is the low baseline IENFD on the pain side in postherniorrhaphy pain patients compared to healthy volunteers, making it difficult to demonstrate a further reduction in IENFD following capsaicin treatment. The small group size may be another reason why the observed reduction of IENFD in the capsaicin group did not reach significance. However, it should be emphasized that none of the studies investigating IENFD after application of an 8% capsaicin patch in healthy volunteers provide data at 4 weeks after application <xref rid="pone.0109144-Malmberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Knolle1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and it cannot be excluded that partial regeneration of nerve fibers already may have taken place <xref rid="pone.0109144-Rage1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sensory Assessments</title><p>The QST assessment did not demonstrate any differences in cutaneous (thermal) or deep tissue (mechanical) sensory function between capsaicin and placebo treatment. A possible explanation is the previously mentioned lack of a significant reduction in IENFD after capsaicin treatment. In addition, sensory nerve endings not expressing TRPV1 receptors, i.e. A&#x003b2;-fibers, the majority of A&#x003b4;-fibers, and a subgroup of C-fibers, remain intact after capsaicin treatment and are thus still capable of transmitting sensory stimuli <xref rid="pone.0109144-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Accordingly, previous studies in neuropathic pain patients have failed to demonstrate sensory impairment after capsaicin patch treatment. In painful HIV-related neuropathy no differences in thermal and vibration detection thresholds were observed between capsaicin treated patients and controls at 4 and 12 weeks after patch application <xref rid="pone.0109144-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, no differences between treatment groups were found in two studies investigating detection thresholds for brush, punctate stimulation, vibration and warmth in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia at 4 and 12 weeks after patch application <xref rid="pone.0109144-Irving1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Webster2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>A confounding factor for the study is the patient-blinding. The higher incidence of local side effects experienced by patients in the capsaicin group (74%) compared to the placebo group (30%), and the correspondingly high proportion of patients who correctly identified their treatment allocation, indicate an insufficient blinding-technique. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the potential analgesic effect experienced by the capsaicin treatment may in fact represent a placebo effect. The short duration of the potential analgesic effect (i.e. one month) also may connote to a placebo effect. The study thus supports the use of an active placebo (e.g. low-dose of capsaicin) in order to ensure adequate blinding in future studies assessing the effects of topical capsaicin.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Pathophysiological Mechanism</title><p>Pain relief up to 12 weeks after capsaicin patch application has been observed in previous randomized, controlled trials in post-herpetic neuralgia and HIV-related distal neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0109144-Derry1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109144-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The lack of a significant analgesic effect in the present study may be explained by a different pain mechanism in persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain. The S-LANNS findings in the present study and the QST results in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0109144-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109144-Aasvang2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> point towards neuropathic pain components in this patient cohort, which is also underscored by the reduced IENFD on the painful side, specifying a small-fiber neuropathy. However, a number of postherniorrhaphy pain patients demonstrate decreased pain thresholds to pressure algometry indicating increased deep tissue sensitivity and suggesting deep pain components that may be caused by an untoward inflammatory reaction to the implanted mesh <xref rid="pone.0109144-Aasvang2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The negative findings in our study suggest that interruption of cutaneous nerve transmission alone may be insufficient to relieve pain substantially in these patients and seem to indicate that nerve injury, as well as deep tissue inflammation, may contribute to the development and maintenance of persistent postherniorrhaphy pain. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological contributors in persistent postherniorrhaphy pain in order to guide future treatment strategies.</p><p>In conclusion capsaicin patch 8% did not significantly reduce combined static and dynamic pain components compared to placebo in persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain, albeit a trend towards pain relief was observed 1 month after capsaicin patch application.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109144.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
