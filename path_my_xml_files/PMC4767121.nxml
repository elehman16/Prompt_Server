Transoesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion is also recommended by guidelines as an alternative to 3-week pre-procedural anticoagulation; this enables physicians to rule out a left atrial thrombus and thereby expedite cardioversion.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Limitations associated with the use of VKAs can be challenging for the physician and impose restrictions on patients' daily activities. Inadequate pre-procedural anticoagulation-related issues are responsible for &#x0003e;50% of cancellations of planned cardioversions, thereby imposing a cost burden.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, the delay in the time taken to achieve adequate pre-procedural anticoagulation with VKAs may also negatively impact patient convenience and the overall treatment satisfaction.</p><p>Health economic evaluations, such as budget impact analyses, can assist physicians in making informed decisions regarding the cost-effectiveness of a drug. Although the cost of rivaroxaban exceeds that of warfarin, decision-makers are increasingly interested in the overall budget impact.

This model estimates the total costs per treatment of a cardioversion, and components considered are: costs for drug therapy (including extended treatment duration due to postponing), international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring, cardioversion procedure, and rescheduling. These costs were linked to the respective clinical X-VeRT data (a delayed cardioversion strategy in which patients received pre-procedural anticoagulation for &#x02265;3 weeks)<sup><xref rid="EUV294C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> to estimate the total costs.

According to the protocol, at least 63 days of therapy was required in the delayed strategy arm: 21 days prior to and 42 days after the cardioversion. Because of the higher proportion of postponed cardioversions in the warfarin arm, the median time to cardioversion, and thus the treatment duration, was 8 days longer than for rivaroxaban-treated patients (30 vs. 22 days).<sup><xref rid="EUV294C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This additional time was considered in the calculation of the total treatment duration. Another component of the therapy costs is the number of INR monitoring visits, estimated by the numbers of INR values per patient pre- and post-cardioversion in the X-VeRT study (see Results).</p><p>The model also considers the percentage of cardioversions that are postponed on the scheduled day (day of planned cardioversion). From the overall X-VeRT data (delayed cardioversion strategy), 64% of planned cardioversions (<italic>n</italic> = 215) were not conducted in warfarin-treated patients. In 75% of these, the reason was inadequate anticoagulation.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> On the basis of X-VeRT study design, it was assumed that physicians only became aware of the INR values on the scheduled day, i.e. all of these cardioversions were postponed on the scheduled day. In the rivaroxaban group, only 23% of cardioversions were not conducted as planned.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We assumed that 75% of the cardioversions were postponed on the scheduled day in the rivaroxaban group, which is a highly conservative estimate. Overall, of the total planned cardioversion procedures, 48% (64 &#x000d7; 0.75%) and 17% (23 &#x000d7; 0.75%) of cardioversions had to be rescheduled on the scheduled day in warfarin- and rivaroxaban-treated patients, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Unit costs</title><p>The clinical results described above were linked to the respective unit costs for drug therapies, INR monitoring, and cardioversion.

It urges that patients' values and preferences with regard to the treatment strategy should now be considered as an integral part of the shared decision-making process.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The X-VeRT study showed that the number of rescheduled cardioversions (delayed strategy) owing to inadequate anticoagulation is significantly higher with VKA treatment,<sup><xref rid="EUV294C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> thus leading to substantially higher costs. The rescheduling of cardioversions owing to INR levels outside the therapeutic range remains an issue in parts of Europe. For example, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines state that as many as 25% of procedures are postponed for this reason,<sup><xref rid="EUV294C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> although available data suggest that this could be an underestimate.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Reducing reschedule rates on the scheduled day, in addition to removing the need for INR monitoring, could lead to substantial patient benefits, including a reduction in waiting time for cardioversion, time off work, and travel time. As a consequence, a higher number of patients could be treated per year owing to reduced costs and waiting times and a reduced wastage of cardioversion slots.</p><p>A recent non-randomized, single-centre, observational study assessed the potential impact of the use of dabigatran compared with warfarin on the efficiency of an outpatient cardioversion service. A total of 242 cardioversions were performed on 193 patients over a 36-month period. The authors concluded that &#x0223c;30&#x02013;40% of the planned cardioversions were postponed, but that up to 5000 cancellations in the UK could be avoided annually with the use of dabigatran.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>One limitation of the present study was the relatively small study population size; however, the reduction seen in the number of cancelled cardioversions could impact on patient satisfaction and healthcare system efficiency. Moreover, the present analysis was restricted to the UK and Italian settings; therefore, these results cannot be extrapolated to the rest of the world. The TSQM II results indicated that rivaroxaban seems to be associated with a significantly higher treatment satisfaction (Convenience, Effectiveness, and Global satisfaction) compared with VKA therapy. Although the TSQM II is a widely used generic measure of treatment satisfaction, the use of a more specific measure (i.e. the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale) focusing on anticoagulation-specific aspects of treatment satisfaction could potentially lead to a more sensitive evaluation. However, in patients with DVT, the use of rivaroxaban resulted in improved treatment satisfaction compared with enoxaparin/VKA consistently when using both treatment satisfaction measures, TSQM II and the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale.<sup><xref rid="EUV294C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Nevertheless, X-VeRT included a broad patient population, including oral anticoagulant-naive/untreated and -experienced patients, in a breadth of clinical situations in the setting of cardioversion in patients undergoing early or delayed cardioversion strategies, mirroring more accurately the range of patients seen in routine clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of rivaroxaban in the setting of elective cardioversion resulted in greater patient satisfaction and cost savings for the hospital compared with that of VKA, thus offering the opportunity for a simplified treatment that could increase patient compliance and improve efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and Janssen Research and Development, LLC.
