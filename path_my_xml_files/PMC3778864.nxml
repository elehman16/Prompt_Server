Little is known about the effect of baseline metabolome on the overall metabolic responses to berry intake.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> We studied the effects of berries on serum metabolome.</p><p><bold>Design:</bold> Eighty overweight women completed this randomized crossover study. During the interventions of 30 d, subjects consumed dried sea buckthorn berries (SBs), sea buckthorn oil (SBo), sea buckthorn phenolics ethanol extract mixed with maltodextrin (SBe+MD) (1:1), or frozen bilberries. Metabolic profiles were quantified from serum samples by using <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All interventions induced a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001&#x02013;0.003) effect on the overall metabolic profiles. The effect was observed both in participants who had a metabolic profile that reflected higher cardiometabolic risk at baseline (group B: <italic>P</italic> = 0.001&#x02013;0.008) and in participants who had a lower-risk profile (group A: <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001&#x02013;0.009). Although most of the changes in individual metabolites were not statistically significant after correction for multiplicity, clear trends were observed. SB-induced effects were mainly on serum triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its subclasses, which decreased in metabolic group B. SBo induced a decreasing trend in serum total, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and subfractions of IDL and LDL in group B. During the SBe+MD treatment, VLDL fractions and serum triglycerides increased. Bilberries caused beneficial changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins in group B, whereas the opposite was true in group A.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Berry intake has overall metabolic effects, which depend on the cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline.

A dietary supplement that contained a combination of blueberry and sea buckthorn concentrates improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased the amount of C-peptide, and reduced concentrations of glycated hemoglobin in the circulation of type 1 diabetic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Bilberries and sea buckthorn tended to induce a slight decrease in waist circumference, body weight, and serum concentration of VCAM-1 in slightly overweight women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SB, its fractions, and bilberry on concentrations of circulating lipids, lipoproteins, and low-molecular-weight metabolites in women with slightly elevated concentrations of risk markers of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In particular, we aimed to investigate the effect of the baseline metabolic profile on the response to berry intake, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported by using holistic approaches. We used a new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform to get a holistic view of the effects in systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants and design</title><p>A total of 110 overweight or slightly obese women were recruited in this randomized crossover trial. Each participant gave her written informed consent to the study procedures, which were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland. The inclusion criteria were as follows: BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 26&#x02013;34, serum total cholesterol concentration of 4.5&#x02013;8 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol concentration &#x0003e;2.5 mmol/L, triglyceride concentration &#x0003c;4 mmol/L, glucose concentration &#x0003c;6 mmol/L, insulin concentration &#x0003c;25 mU/L, blood pressure &#x0003c;160/99 mm Hg, hemoglobin concentration &#x0003e;120 g/L, thyroid stimulating hormone concentration of 0.3&#x02013;4.2 mU/L, alanine aminotransferase concentration &#x0003c;60 U/L, and creatinine concentration &#x0003c;115 &#x003bc;mol/L. Methods for the analysis of the above-mentioned markers were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy; menopause; regular smoking; previously diagnosed diabetes (other than gestational); thyroid, renal, hematologic, or hepatic dysfunction; previous myocardial infarction; ongoing inflammatory disease; use of cardiovascular medication; treatment with lipid-lowering drugs; or use of any other regular medication with the exception of allergy medication and joint lubricates. The mean age of participants was 44.2 &#x000b1; 6.2 y.</p><p>Study visits and sampling were conducted at the Turku University of Applied Sciences, Turku, Finland, during the period from June 2008 to June 2009. This trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01860547. During intervention periods of 33&#x02013;35 d, participants consumed the following 4 berry diets in a randomized order: dried SBs, sea buckthorn phenolics ethanol extract mixed with maltodextrin (SBe+MD) (1:1), SBo, or frozen bilberries. Each participant was assigned to receive each berry diet once during the study in an independently randomized order. A simple unrestricted random assignment by using a random-number table was carried out. Different persons were in charge of the random assignment and enrollment of participants. Intervention periods were separated by washout periods of 30&#x02013;39 d. Serum samples after a 12-h fast were collected at the beginning and end of each intervention. The main outcome measure of the study was the change in the serum alanine aminotrasferase concentration during berry interventions. Secondary outcome measures were the effects of berry interventions to other indicators of lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammation, several of which were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In this study, an NMR analysis of metabolic profiles of serum samples was performed to investigate the hypothesis that the berry interventions would affect metabolic profiles of participants, and the effect may differ according to baseline metabolic profiles of participants.</p><p>To keep the daily energy intake constant during interventions and washout periods, participants were asked to replace part of their normal diet with berry products provided for them. Otherwise, the diet of participants was free besides the intervention. Nutrient and energy intakes during intervention and washout periods were estimated by using 3-d food records during each period.</p><p>A total of 80 participants completed the study according to the protocol. Analysis results from all sampling points were obtained from 77 participants. Reported reasons for dropouts during the study were difficulties of participants to use the time for the whole duration of several months or other personal reasons. The prestudy sample-size estimation was based on an assumption that a change (&#x000b1;SD) of 0.14 &#x000b1; 0.23 mmol/L in the concentration of LDL cholesterol could take place during a berry intervention. With a sample size of 85 participants, this study would have a power of &#x0223c;80% to detect the change (2-sided test; 0.05 significance level). Participants, prestudy power calculations, and the study protocol were described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Study products</title><p>SBs were air-dried berries of <italic>Hippopha&#x000eb; rhamnoides</italic> ssp. <italic>turkistanica</italic>. The sugar (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) content of the berries was 6.5 g/100 g. Sugars were analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives by using gas chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The SBo was a standardized mixture of oils from soft parts and seeds of sea buckthorn extracted by Aromtech Ltd by using supercritical carbon dioxide. Main fatty acids of the oil were palmitoleic acid (16:1n&#x02212;7; 24%), palmitic acid (16:0; 22%), oleic acid (18:1n&#x02212;9; 20%), linoleic acid (18:2n&#x02212;6; 15%), and &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (18:3n&#x02212;3; 10%). Fatty acids were analyzed as methyl esters by using gas chromatography with a flame-ionization detector (modified from reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). The oil contained 0.09% carotenoids and 0.38% tocopherols, which were analyzed by using spectrophotometric and HPLC-UV/visible methods, respectively. The SBe+MD was prepared by extracting the carbon dioxide&#x02013;extracted sea buckthorn residue with 50% aqueous ethanol. During spray drying of the extract, maltodextrin dextrose equivalent 6 at a ratio of 1:1 was added. The product contained 248 mg flavonols/100 g and 9.4 g sugars/100 g. Flavonols were analyzed as aglycones by using an HPLC-UV/visible method (an in-house method of MTT Agrifood Research Finland). Bilberries were given as frozen berries and thawed before intake. The sugar content of bilberries was 6.2 g/100 g. Daily doses of berry diets were 20 g SBs, 14.6 g (7.3 g sea buckthorn extract + 7.3 g dextrose equivalent 6) SBe+MD, 4 g (8 capsules) SBo, and 100 g frozen bilberries. Each dose corresponded to &#x0223c;100 g fresh berries. More-detailed information concerning the manufacturing of study products has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Serum NMR metabolomics</title><p>We applied <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy to determine the serum metabolome via 3 different molecular windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). These windows provide information on 14 lipoprotein subclasses and lipoprotein-particle concentrations, low-molecular-weight metabolites such as amino acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and creatinine, and detailed molecular information on serum lipids including free and esterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, saturation degree, and n&#x02212;3 fatty acids. The methodology provides information on &#x0003e;100 primary metabolic measures and multiple derived variables with clear biochemical interpretation and significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Data of 14 lipoprotein subclasses and lipoprotein-particle concentrations plus low-molecular-weight metabolites were run from native serum samples in the same experiment, and serum lipid data were run from lipid extracts afterward. The experimental protocol including the sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy are described in detail in Inouye et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). <italic>See</italic> online supplemental material and Supplemental Table 1 under &#x0201c;Supplemental data&#x0201d; in the online issue for a definition of lipoprotein subclasses and complete list of metabolites quantified, respectively. This quantitative platform has recently been applied in various large-scale epidemiologic and genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To analyze the effect of the baseline metabolome on treatment responses, participants were divided into 2 groups (A and B) on the basis of their baseline metabolic profiles. This was done by first examining the baseline metabolic diversity with the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. The SOM is an unsupervised learning algorithm that spreads individuals (samples) on a plane on the basis of similarity in input data (serum metabolome). Samples with similar metabolic profiles end up in nearby coordinates, whereas a pair of samples with great deviation is organized far from each other. Complete baseline metabolic profiles were used as input for the SOM with the exception that, of lipoprotein subclass measures, only total lipid concentrations were included to prevent the overemphasis of the role of lipoproteins in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Input values were ranked, and the ranks were mapped onto a normal distribution before the application of the SOM algorithm. Samples were separated into 2 groups (A and B) by dividing the resulting SOM into 2 metabolically different areas. A clustering algorithm applied to prototype vectors that represented average local properties of map cells was used for the division. Only SOM inputs with a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) separation on the SOM-component plane were used in the clustering.</p><p>Metabolic measures before and after treatment were compared by using Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests. The tests were first performed by including all participants and then separately for baseline metabolic groups A (<italic>n</italic> = 47) and B (<italic>n</italic> = 30). Measures were adjusted for sugar intake before testing. The significance threshold was corrected for multiple testing by dividing the 5% significance-level threshold by the number of principal components, which explained 95% of the variance in metabolite data. The resulting significance threshold was <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0028 (18 components) for the whole data set as well as for group A, whereas for the smaller group B, the threshold was <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0033 (15 components).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the diet intervention would have a measurable overall effect on the metabolic profile, a univariate score that summarized the metabolic changes was created. Moreover, because of the large number of metabolites and small number of participants in the metabolic groups, there was low power to test differences in all individual measures beyond the multiple-testing threshold. In contrast, with the summary measure, only a single test was needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The summary measure was calculated for each diet as a cross-product of a correlation vector and a difference vector. The correlation vector was populated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of each metabolite with the intervention status (1 if the value was measured after the given diet period and 0 otherwise). The difference vector contained median changes in (scaled and centered) concentrations of each metabolite during the given diet. A null distribution with the null hypothesis that no change in metabolism took place during the intervention was generated by calculating the score for 100,000 replicate data sets with treatment statuses randomly permuted. A <italic>P</italic> value for the score was then calculated by using a normal approximation of the null distribution. Before calculating scores, metabolic measures were first adjusted for sugar intake and then centered and scaled to the zero median and unit IQR. <italic>See</italic> Supplemental Figure 1 under &#x0201c;Supplemental data&#x0201d; in the online issue for details on calculating the summary measure. A threshold of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for statistical significance was used.</p><p>Energy and nutrient intakes during interventions were considered by comparing 3-d food records of berry interventions to records of the preceding washout period by using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Thresholds for significance were adjusted for multiple testing by using Bonferroni correction again with the number of principal components that explained 95% of the variance in food-record data. The resulting significance threshold was <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0038 (13 components) for the whole data set as well as for group A, whereas for the smaller group B, the threshold was <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0045 (11 components).</p><p>All analyses were performed by using in-house scripts in the MATLAB R2012a programming environment (Mathworks Inc). An open-source package termed Melikerion for SOM analyses in the Matlab/Octave programming environment is freely available.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Effects of berries between all participants</title><p>All 4 berry diets showed a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001&#x02013;0.003) effect on overall metabolic profiles of participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Although most of changes in individual metabolites were NS after adjustment for multiple analyses, clear trends were observed. SBs induced effects on individual metabolites focused on triglyceride and VLDL subclasses, where a decreasing trend was observed. During the SB period, a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0028; corresponds to 5% level of significance after correction for multiple testing) decrease took place in triglycerides in small HDL particles as well as in serum creatinine and phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>; <italic>see</italic> Supplemental Table 2 under &#x0201c;Supplemental data&#x0201d; in the online issue). The SBo period showed a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0028) decrease in the concentrations of serum-free cholesterol, albumin, and lactate as well as in cholesterol, triglyceride, and particle concentrations in the intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) subclass and triglycerides in small HDL. A nonsignificant decreasing trend was observed in apolipoprotein B, LDL, and total cholesterol; particles and lipids of very small VLDL; and all subclasses of IDL and LDL, including small LDL particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). During the SBe+MD intervention, a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0028) increase in cholesterol esters in large VLDL and decrease in serum acetate took place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, an increasing trend in serum VLDL triglycerides, serum total triglycerides, and in almost all of the VLDL subclasses was observed. The changes during the bilberries diet were less pronounced, and a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0028) change was seen only in triglycerides in small HDL particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Even though most of the changes that occurred in individual metabolites were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing, clear trends accounting for the significant overall effects were observed. Changes induced by berries were different in women who had a baseline metabolic profile that indicated higher cardiometabolic risk than in women who had a baseline profile that reflected lower risk.</p><p>The intake of SBo induced reducing trends on serum total, IDL, and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in participants with the baseline metabolome of higher cardiometabolic risk. A significant effect was observed in IDL and HDL subfractions and free cholesterol in all participants. Previously, beneficial effects of sea buckthorn seed oil on HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, both in rabbits given a normal diet and in rabbits given a cholesterol-rich diet, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In a clinical study, an elevating effect on serum HDL cholesterol took place after an intervention of 4 mo with sea buckthorn pulp oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). No changes in circulating cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations were observed in a shorter intervention with combined sea buckthorn seed and pulp oils given to 12 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Several components of SBo may have contributed to the effect observed in our trial. The lowering of serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other risk factors of cardiovascular disease have been associated with intakes of linoleic acid and &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), palmitoleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), and plant sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p><p>SBs are rich in flavonoids, particularly the glycosides of isorhamnetin (3&#x02032;-methylquercetin) and quercetin flavonols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Quercetin has been shown to induce a hypolipidemic effect in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) and rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) and inhibit fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis in rat liver cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Water extracts of sea buckthorn seeds, containing sea buckthorn flavonoids, induced a hypoglycemic and triglyceride-lowering effect in diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). A recent study indicated beneficial effects of ethanol-soluble fraction of SBs on the postprandial insulin and glucose response in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In our study, the intake of SBe+MD induced a rising trend in VLDL lipids and serum total triglycerides. The daily dose of SBe+MD contained 36 mg sea buckthorn flavonols, which was &#x0003e;6 times the average flavonol intake by Finns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Diets high in sugars, including fructose, and starches having a high glycemic index that may induce increases in fasting and postprandial serum triglycerides and VLDL concentrations in humans. The effect is modified by the dietary context, genetic background, physical activity, and other subject factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). The reasonably high carbohydrate content of the SBe+MD may have contributed to the VLDL elevating effect of the product.</p><p>In whole SBs, potentially all compounds in the soft parts of the berry, including flavonols, carotenoids, fatty acids, tocopherols, tocotrienos, and phytosterols of the pulp oil, were expected to affect the metabolic profile. Because seeds, for the most part, are not degraded in the digestive system if not crushed by teeth, the components of seed oil were not completely available in SBs. The increased intake of sugars and carbohydrates during SB periods may have interfered with the potential effects of the berries. SBs have a strong taste, and it is possible that sugar was added by participants to make the berries taste more pleasant. The effect of sugar as a potential confounder in treatment responses was removed by using a regression model.</p><p>Beneficial effects of whole bilberries on plasma lipids were observed in participants in the higher&#x02013;metabolic risk baseline group B, whereas the opposite was shown in group A. The analysis of individual metabolites revealed an elevating trend in VLDL subclasses and serum triglycerides in participants who were in metabolic baseline group A. In participants in group B, clear reducing trends in VLDL, IDL, and LDL as well as serum triglycerides and cholesterol were observed.</p><p>There was no clear explanation for the observed opposite effects of bilberries on VLDL subgroups in metabolic baseline groups A and B. Results of earlier studies support the observation of beneficial effects of bilberry on metabolic risk factors. Anthocyanins are the main phenolic compounds in bilberries and blueberries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Isolated bilberry anthocyanins have, in several studies, shown beneficial effects on cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Whole blueberries and bilberries have induced desired changes on markers of metabolic syndrome in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Previously, negative effects of bilberry and blueberry intakes on lipid metabolism have rarely been reported. Prior et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>) showed the intake of whole blueberries fortified weight gain and increased body fat in epididymal fat in mice eating a high-fat diet.</p><p>The limitation of multiplicity in the analyses compared with the number of participants in our study was addressed by performing statistical tests on an overall metabolic measure summarizing metabolic changes associated with a given diet. Individual markers were analyzed to explore in more detail the metabolites that caused the observed overall effects. After correction for multiple testing, most of the changes that occurred in individual analytes were not statistically significant. Still, clear trends in changes of metabolites, which differed depending on the baseline metabolome, were seen. Another limitation in our study was the reasonably short duration of interventions, which, nevertheless, induced significant overall changes. The generalizability of our results is restricted by these limitations and because only women with slightly elevated concentrations of factors associated with risk of metabolic syndrome were enrolled. In general, changes in nutrient intakes during interventions were similar in metabolic groups A and B and were, therefore, unlikely to explain the observed differences in treatment responses between groups. The effect of sugar intake was taken into account in the statistical model used.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests significant effects of berry consumption on overall metabolic profiles of overweight women. The effects differ according to the berry or berry fraction and are more evident in individuals who have a baseline profile indicating higher cardiometabolic risk. Changes in individual metabolites in most cases were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing but showed clear trends. Dried SBs induced beneficial effects on serum triglycerides and VLDL subclasses. SBo reduced the serum concentration of total and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. SBe+MD had an elevating effect on serum triglycerides and VLDL. The effects of bilberries were most clearly affected by the baseline. Desirable changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins were observed in the baseline group of higher cardiometabolic risk during the bilberry intervention, whereas the opposite was true for the group with the lower-risk baseline metabolome. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of the overall metabolic profile on the response to berry intake has not been reported previously. The diverse effects of berry fractions according to different baseline metabolome deserve additional studies in larger study populations to allow a more-detailed investigation of baseline-response associations.</p></sec>
