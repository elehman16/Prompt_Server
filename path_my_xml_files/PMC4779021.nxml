The sample size of the study was calculated using a free software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statpages.org/">http://www.statpages.org/#Power</ext-link>) based on a pilot study. Eighty-four of 87 qualified patients (3 patients refused) were enrolled, and randomly assigned into BS (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42, 7 patients were lost because of noncooperation), and BD (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42, 2 patients were lost because of noncooperation) group using computer-generated randomized table (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The BS and BD patients received intravenous saline or DEX infusion, and bupivacaine for local anesthesia, respectively. The infusion syringe pumps were prepared by a different anesthesiologist to make this study a randomized, double-blinded investigation. Patients matching the following criteria were included in this study: between 18 and 65 years old; American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II; weight 55 to 85&#x0200a;kg. Patients were excluded if they had ischemic heart diseases; opioid addiction, long-term alcohol abuse, long-term smoking history, sedative&#x02013;hypnotic drug(s); obesity (BMI&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;30); postoperative nausea and vomiting history; or neuropsychiatric diseases and related treatment history.

Patients from the both groups received 15&#x0200a;mg of 0.5% of bupivacaine for subarachnoid anesthesia, and continuous intravenous infusion of saline or DEX in Ringer solution at a rate of 0.25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/hour. Intravenous infusion started 15&#x0200a;minutes before spinal anesthesia, and were switched to Ringer solution when the patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) from the operation room. The patient and the anesthesiologist were double-blinded to the treatment, and all recordings were performed by an anesthesiologist blinded to group allocation. Sensory blockade was assessed using sterile pin prick method in the mid-axillary line on both sides of chest.

Anesthesia studies indicate that it could prolong the analgesic effects of local anesthetics. For example, DEX potentiates neuraxial local anesthetics, decreases intraoperative anesthetic requirements, and improves postoperative analgesia, regardless of the neuraxial route of administration (eg, epidural, caudal, or spinal).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These evidence suggest that DEX might be a new drug promoting the effect of local anesthesia, and could be used for surgery-induced acute pain control.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Generally, single dose intravenous injection and continuous infusion starting with a loading dose were 2 widely used methods to achieve its effects on anesthesia and analgesia during local or general anesthesia.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> DEX induces hemodynamic changes, such as hypertension, hypotension, and bradycardia, especially after a loading dose. Thus, in the present study, we administered a continuous infusion without a loading dose. Using this continuous infusion, we observed no significant difference in HR or MBP between the 2 groups, but a significant decrease of onset time and increase of durations in sensory and motor blockade. These data indicated that intravenous infusion of DEX without loading dose could successfully shorten the onset time of bupivacaine, and prolonged the lasting duration of its anesthesia property. Our results was consistent with previous studies that described DEX infusion without the administration of the loading dose avoided the undesirable hemodynamic effects.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>DEX has been reported to have morphine-sparing effect following intraoperative use during general anesthesia.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Here, in the present study, we further found that intravenous infusion of DEX without loading dose was successful to prolong the first-request time for analgesics (morphine) and the total consumption of morphine. DEX was first used as a sedative, and we also observed a significant sedation property when we evaluated its sedative effect immediately after surgery. Though the long-lasting proanalgesic effects of DEX was largely unknown, we believe that, beside recently accepted reasons,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the sedative effect might be another contributor.</p><p>This study indicated that the combining administration of intravenous DEX without loading dose with bupivacaine might be useful for spinal anesthesia and postoperative analgesia, and provide useful information for considering the regimens of intravenous DEX with other local anesthetics to achieve elevated anesthesia during, and postoperative analgesia following local anesthesia. One of the limitations in the present study is that the sedation statement was not completely come from the effect of DEX: all the subjects underwent scheduled lower limb surgery, those patient after acute injuries have different waiting time from their injuries to surgeries, injury-induced acute pain and fatigue might induce insomnia which depending very much on the waiting time. When they received local anesthesia, these patients would fall asleep very easily, and shown a deep sedation. It is hard to identify how much DEX contributed to this sedation state.</p><p>Taken together, the present study found that the regimen of intravenous DEX without loading dose and bupivacaine produced a long-lasting sensory and motor blockade during local anesthesia, and promoted the postoperative analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, BMI = body mass index, DEX = dexmedetomidine, HR = heart rate, MBP = mean blood pressure, PACU = postanesthesia care unit, PCA = patient-controlled analgesia.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>HZ and ML contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grosu</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavand&#x02019;homme</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>
