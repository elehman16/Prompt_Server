Breast conserving surgery is currently accepted as the therapy of choice by numerous surgeons and patients. It has been confirmed that breast conserving surgery followed by postoperative breast adjuvant radiotherapy is the normal treatment for proper patients with early breast tumor. However, the cosmetic results and complications that occur after the use of the standard breast-conserving therapy protocol, which consists of lumpectomy and a 6-week adjuvant radiotherapy course [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], pose a major concern[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for a more minimally invasive treatment protocol.</p><p>Compared with traditional surgical therapy, the image-guided ablative therapies, which contain microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryoablation, have distinct advantages that cover superior cosmetic results, less complications and mortality, cooperativity with other cancer treatments, the capacityto complete ablative treatment in an outpatient basis, convenience for simultaneous imaging monitoring, smaller expense of treatment and reproducible[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Compared to the other thermal ablative modalities, percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) has particular advantages, such as preferable heating of cystic masses, bigger tumor ablation range, uniformly higher temperatures inside the tumor, shorter ablation duration, advanced convection profile, capicity to use multiple applicators and minor pain[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At present, PMWA has been extensively used for the treatment of tumors located in the lung, liver, bone, adrenal gland and kidney. Moreover, duo to the special anatomical location of breast where is between ectopectoralis and skin, microwave ablation is more suitable for breast tumor than others solid tumors. We have proved that US-guided PMWA is a promising treatment for solitary breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the standard process that breast conservation therapy has to be followed by intraoperative or postoperative radiotherapy[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the microwave ablation also has to be followed by a postoperative radiotherapy or others ionization therapy. Compared to conventional postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy has the probability to be a hopeful modality for early breast cancer treated using breast conserving therapy, attributable to decrease of the normal tissues exposure to radiation, reduction of the radiotherapy duration and results in a lower local recurrence rate[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Tumor necrosis therapy (TNT) which was first reported by Epstein et al. was that <sup>131</sup>I-labeled monoclonal antibodies to intracellular antigens, which are integral structural components and are retained by degenerating cells, can kill the viable tumor cell around the necrosis tumor tissue[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Thus, an animal model larger than the mouse or rat was required. The VX2 tumor is a highly malignant squamous cell solid tumor which has already been used widely for the study of local treatment for solid tumor, such as breast [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], lung [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], liver [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and kidney [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The VX2 tumor is the only tumor model which is easy to be innoculated in larger animals like rabbit. Therefore, this tumor was selected as the model for use in our study. In addition, the result of this study has the general significance for others solid tumors.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment using PMWA followed by one or two administrations of IIIH at an effective dose resulted in a promising therapeutic effect in rabbits bearingVX2 breast tumors.</p><p>Our results are consistant with the previously reported research in a rodent bearing VX2 liver tumor, in which the residual tumor tissue was eliminated by the IIIH that targeted the necrosis tissue produced by vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A-4 phospate (CA4P)[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Concerning to TNT, relevant clinical trials that a <sup>131</sup>I-radiolabeled monoclonal antibody was used to treat and diagnose solid tumors, such as lung and brain cancer, is currently under way in United States and China[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When compared to macromolecular agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or small organic molecules, small molecules such as hypericin exhibit superior permeability and a lower uptake rate by the reticuloendothelial system[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, hypericin was labeled with <sup>131</sup>I to form <sup>131</sup>I-hypericin, which emits both &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; radiation. <sup>131</sup>I-hypericinhas been used for the treatment of liver rhabdomyosarcomas[<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <sup>131</sup>I is a radioactive isotope with a relevant short half-life of 8 days and a 2mm &#x003b2;-particle penetration depth, which means higher safety and feasibility. Therefore, the use of IIIH followed by PMWA may exert an effect similar to that of intraoperative radiotherapy following dissection in breast cancer patients. And so on, each effective dose can cause a centrifugal inactivated range to residual viable tumor tissue.</p><p>It has been reported that FDG-PET was more sensitive than morphologic imaging in detecting breast residual tumor and recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0120303.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET is more applicable than the other evaluation methods on early assessment of treatmen in sensitivity and accuracy. In our study, the quick and significant decrease of SUV at VX2 tumor sites was observed soon after the effective treatment was implemented, which was shown in PET-CT scanning result.</p><p>The maximum effective safe dose of IIIH was found to be 1 mCi/kg body weight in our study. Routine tests for blood and hepatorenal function, measurement of weight and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of liver tissue were performed to investigate the toxicity of IIIH (data not shown). When the IIIH dose was 1 mCi/kg, the body weight profile and routine tests for blood and hepatorenal function gave results that were in the normal range; abnormal changes in HE staining of liver tissue were not seen (data not shown).</p><p>There were certain limitations to our study. First, the mechanism underlying the affinity of hypericin for necrotic tumor tissue has not been fully elucidated. Second, the power at which PMWA is administered and the duration of treatment requires further optimization to achieve the optimal ablation area covering the entire tumor margin without normal tissue damage. Third, large animal breast tumor models are limited. Whether there is a similar therapeutic effect exists in other animal models remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, in the rabbit VX2 breast solid tumor model, sequential therapy involving PMWA and IIIH decreased tumor growth and improved survival. As such, PMWA followed by IIIH bears great potential to replace traditional surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy as a primary curative therapy or palliative care therapy. Although further investigations are required to optimize the delivery parameters regarding PMWA and the dose of IIIH, this sequential therapy will likely continue to receive considerable attention as a minimally invasive treatment for malignancy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81270952, 81070684, 81071753, 81172505, 81202077 and 81272916), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK2010581, BK2011853 and BK2011855), the Program for Development of Innovative Research Team in the First Affiliated Hospital of NJMU (IRT-008) and a project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu higher Education Institutions (PAPD),the graduate research and innovation projects of colleges and universities in Jiangsu Province (CXZZ12_0581).
