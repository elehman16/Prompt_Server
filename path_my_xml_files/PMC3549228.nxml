This 2.9% (95% CI &#x02212;0.4% to 5.7%) decrease in the infection rate with TW approached but was not statistically or clinically significant.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is the largest trial to validate TW as a safe and effective wound irrigant. It is the only study that was double-blinded and controlled for irrigation technique, pressures and solution volumes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>TW has both economic and environmental advantages over SS as a wound irrigant.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The strengths of the study are its randomised design, control for technique of irrigation and volume of irrigant, successful blinding, relatively large number of subjects and the fact that very few were lost to follow-up. A limitation of the study is that the primary measured outcome of wound infection was determined by subjective indicators of infection, such as erythema or gross exudate. Given the nature of the study, more objective measures such as bacterial counts, wound cultures or wound biopsy were not practical.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A second limitation was the six patients lost to follow-up during the study; five of these patients had wounds irrigated with SS and one had a wound irrigated with TW. This is a small number of patients lost to follow-up, and five out of six were in the SS group. Even if we assume that all these wounds became infected, it would only add further support to our conclusion that TW is a safe and effective alternative to SS as an irrigant solution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although we controlled for the volume of solution and the mechanism of wound cleansing, the temperatures of the solutions were not identical. The difference in temperature of the TW (38&#x000b0;C), as compared with SS (room temperature), may have been a factor. TW did not reach room temperature prior to initiating irrigation.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic wounds are the second most common reason individuals seek medical care, with emergency departments (EDs) treating an estimated 11 million traumatic wounds each year in the USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref> The most common and serious complication of a traumatic wound is infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6 R7">4&#x02013;7</xref> Many factors can increase the risk of wound infection, including the patient's immune status, the age of the wound prior to cleaning and closing, the presence of foreign material in the wound, bacterial inoculum, the presence of devitalised tissue and involvement of deeper structures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Wound irrigation is the most important step in reducing the risk of infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> The function of irrigation is to remove loose, devitalised tissue; particulate matter and bacteria from within the wound.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>Most EDs currently use sterile normal saline (SS) to irrigate wounds prior to closure, even though there is a paucity of scientific evidence to support its use as an irrigation fluid. Further, other studies have demonstrated that more expensive solutions such as antiseptics (1% povidone-iodine, hexaclorophen, isopropylalcohol and cefazolin) and non-ionic detergents (pluronic F-68 and polaremer 188) provide no advantage over SS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Tap water (TW) may be the ideal irrigation fluid because it is readily available and it is less expensive than SS. Several other studies have suggested that TW is a safe and effective alternative to SS in the irrigation of lacerations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15 R16 R17 R18">13&#x02013;18</xref> Fernandez completed a Cochrane Review of these studies and noted serious study limitations including: not controlling for volume and irrigation technique, poorly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, inadequate sample size, lack of true randomisation with allocation concealment, study participants not blinded to the solution used during outcome assessment and unclear objective outcome measurements of wound infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Sasson and Diner subsequently reviewed the literature regarding the appropriate irrigating solution for wound cleansing and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the claim that TW is comparable or superior to SS as a wound irrigant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Thus, further prospective clinical research is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial comparing the wound infection rate in lacerations irrigated with either SS or TW prior to closure in the ED. The study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained before study participation. The trial was registered in CliicalTrials.gov (NCT01564342).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted at the Stanford University Medical Center Emergency Department, a tertiary care facility and Level I trauma centre, with a census of 55&#x02005;000 visits annually.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>The study population consisted of consecutive patients older than 1&#x02005;year of age, who presented to the ED with an uncomplicated soft tissue laceration requiring repair. Patients had to provide a telephone number for follow-up in order to be enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria included any underlying immunocompromising illness (eg, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, asplenism, primary immune disorder, steroid use or chemotherapy), current use of antibiotics, puncture or bite wounds, underlying tendon or bone involvement, or wounds more than 9&#x02005;h old.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>After written informed consent was obtained, enrolled patients were randomly assigned to have their wounds irrigated with SS or TW, using a sequentially numbered plastic-wrapped sterile bowl. A computer randomisation program was used to generate a code that assigned one of the study's fluids to each numbered bowl. After the identifying label was removed, the bowl was filled with the appropriate solution by an ED technician. The patient, the treating physician and the physician checking the wound for infection were all blind regarding solution type.</p><p>SS was obtained from Abbott's Laboratories. The TW was obtained from a single designated faucet in the ED. The water ran for 5&#x02005;s prior to being collected.</p><p>All wounds were treated according to the following protocol: (1) wounds were anaesthetised with 1% lidocaine with or without epinephrine and/or 0.25% bupivicaine; (2) a 35&#x02005;ml syringe equipped with an 18 gauge IV catheter was used to deliver the irrigation solution, which has been shown to produce a hydraulic pressure of approximately 8&#x02005;psi;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> (3) a volume of 500&#x02005;ml of solution was used to irrigate each wound; (4) wound irrigation was performed by emergency medical technicians who were not involved with the wound repair or follow-up assessment and (5) after irrigation, all wounds were repaired by a physician who was not present during the irrigation using standard suturing technique. All patients received a wound care sheet at discharge from the ED and were instructed to return in 2&#x02005;days for a wound check, at which time the wound was evaluated for evidence of infection.</p><p>TW from the designated sink was cultured once per month by a Microbiology Reference Laboratory for pathogens, including Legionella and Pseudomonas.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome for this study was the difference in wound infection rates between the two randomised groups.

If a patient could not be contacted or did not return to the ED within 24&#x02005;h of contact, they were considered lost to follow-up.

It is the only study that was double-blinded and controlled for irrigation technique, pressures and solution volumes. We did not find any important differences in infection rates for wounds irrigated with either SS or TW. TW did have a trend to be superior to SS as a wound irrigant and at worst could result in a 0.4% increased infection rate compared with SS. This worst-case scenario is both statistically unlikely and clinically insignificant. As such, we feel that this adds to the existing literature, suggesting that TW is a safe and effective wound irrigant as compared with SS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>There has been considerable debate regarding the potential advantages and disadvantages of irrigating wounds prior to closure with SS, as compared with TW. SS is most often used as a wound irrigant because it is an isotonic solution that does not interfere with the healing process or further damage tissue. It is available commercially as a sterile product.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> TW has the advantages of being readily available and less expensive.</p><p>Several other smaller trials have compared infection rates in acute soft tissue wounds that were sutured. Pooled results demonstrated a significant reduction in infection rates in wounds cleaned with TW, as compared with normal saline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> A significantly higher infection rate in the saline group was reported by Angeras, but the irrigation technique and solution volumes were not standardised.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Two trials measured infection rates in children and demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the infection rates when wounds were cleansed with either SS or TW.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Dire and Welsh compared infection rates in wounds cleaned with different solutions (including SS) and found no statistical difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>Our study was not designed to identify why TW might be superior to SS as a wound irrigant. The hypotonicity of TW could disturb the osmotic potential of a bacterial cell, leading to cell death. It is also unknown what role chlorination of TW plays in its efficacy and safety as a wound irrigant. Future studies are needed to determine if there is an optimal range of chlorination content, or whether chlorine is required at all in TW used for wound irrigation.</p><p>It may be that the mechanism of cleansing (ie, mechanical irrigation) and the volume of solution used are the most important variables in preventing wound infection, rather than the irrigant solution. Wounds become infected when they contain more than 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria/gram of tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The threshold infective inoculum is reduced to 10<sup>2</sup> in the presence of dirt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> High-pressure irrigation (&#x0003e;8&#x02005;psi) with copious amounts of solution has been shown to be the single most effective method of reducing bacterial counts in wounds.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6 R7 R8">4&#x02013;8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Potable TW in developed countries contains an insufficient number of bacteria to cause wound infections, and the few bacteria isolated from TW are not generally skin pathogens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Antimicrobial irrigating solutions have not shown any benefit over SS in reducing the incidence of wound infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>TW has both economic and environmental advantages over SS as a wound irrigant. TW is much less expensive than SS and is more readily available. At our institution, the cost of a 500&#x02005;ml bottle of SS is $0.75; the patient charge is in excess of $10. With the number of lacerations treated each year, the use of TW could generate annual savings of $7.5 million for the hospitals and $100 million for patients. Irrigating accessible wounds directly under a faucet could result in additional cost savings by eliminating the need for sterile bowls, syringes and catheters. Others have investigated this technique and found equivalent rates of wound infections using TW as compared with SS for irrigation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>From an environmental perspective, the use of TW would yield fewer plastic bottles to discard and has beneficial ramifications in situations where SS is not readily available. When water can be adequately disinfected, this would include disaster and humanitarian relief settings, field operations for the military and medical clinics, and hospitals in developing countries.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strength and limitations of the study</title><p>The strengths of the study are its randomised design, control for technique of irrigation and volume of irrigant, successful blinding, relatively large number of subjects, and the fact that very few were lost to follow-up. A limitation of the study is that the primary measured outcome of wound infection was determined by subjective indicators of infection, such as erythema or gross exudate. Given the nature of the study, more objective measures such as bacterial counts, wound cultures or wound biopsy were not practical.</p><p>A second limitation was the six patients lost to follow-up during the study; five of these patients had wounds irrigated with SS and one had a wound irrigated with TW. This is a small number of patients lost to follow-up, and five out of six were in the SS group. Even if we assume that all these wounds became infected, it would only add further support to our conclusion that TW is a safe and effective alternative to SS as an irrigant solution.</p><p>Although we controlled for the volume of solution and the mechanism of wound cleansing, the temperatures of the solutions were not identical. The difference in temperature of the TW (38&#x000b0;C), as compared with SS (room temperature), may have been a factor. TW did not reach room temperature prior to initiating irrigation.</p><p>Telephone follow-up and self-reporting at the 1-month interval could have led to some misclassification by the patients conveying wound status, but the risk of misclassification should have been similar in both groups, and late complications subsequent to laceration repair are not common.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no difference in the infection rate of wounds irrigated with either TW or SS solution, with a clinical trend towards fewer wound infections in the TW group, making it a safe and cost-effective alternative to SS for wound irrigation.</p><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EW, GO and TF conceived and designed the study protocol.
