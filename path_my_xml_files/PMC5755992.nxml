Thus, many patients might not be able to completely remove plaque on all teeth surfaces. Mechanical plaque control is a time-consuming procedure, and some individuals may lack motivation for maintaining good oral hygiene. In an effort to enhance the efficacy of mechanical tooth-cleaning procedures, antimicrobial agents have been added to dentifrices.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p id="p0020">In recent times, considerable research is being done on mouth rinses and toothpastes based on plant extracts. Parodontax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, United Kingdom) has received great attention in reducing gingival inflammation.

The composition of the two tooth pastes used is almost similar. This makes comparison novel and results credible. The clinical variables assessed were the Plaque index (PI), Gingivalindex (GI) and Salivary pH at the baseline and 30 days. There was a highly significant intragroup reduction in both the plaque index scores and the gingival index scores within both the groups (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.000).There was no statistically significant difference in the salivary pH range in the test and the control group (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.645 and p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.885).

The subjects did complain of unpleasant taste with both the dentifrices in the initial usage period but they did not discontinue the usage. This could be an area of concern when using herbal based dentifrices. But, taste assessment and its influence on the selection of dentifrices were beyond the scope of the study.
