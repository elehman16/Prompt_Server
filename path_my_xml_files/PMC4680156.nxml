<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Owing to the lifelong course of MS, it is important to determine potential baseline or early prognostic factors for long-term outcomes.</p><p>One of the earliest MS therapy pivotal trials was the PRISMS (Prevention of Relapses and Disability by interferon (IFN) &#x003b2;-1a subcutaneously (sc) in MS) study. This 2-year controlled study was the first to establish the efficacy of IFN &#x003b2;-1a, 44 or 22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, administered sc three times weekly (tiw), versus placebo, on clinical and MRI measures in RRMS.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Results from an extension study<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and long-term follow-up at 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> demonstrated benefits of early versus delayed sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a therapy, with these benefits most apparent at the 44&#x02005;&#x000b5;g dose. Exploratory analyses at 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years suggested that higher cumulative exposure to IFN&#x003b2;-1a may be associated with better clinical outcomes,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and that baseline brain volume, early disability status and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) may predict long-term outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Patients were invited to a long-term follow-up visit at 15&#x02005;years from randomisation (PRISMS-15). This offered the opportunity for exploratory analyses of the relationship of cumulative exposure to sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a and other potential prognostic factors with long-term clinical outcomes. The data were collected in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and quality assurance procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The design and conduct of the PRISMS study have been described previously.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> In the initial double-blind phase, patients with RRMS were randomised to receive IFN &#x003b2;-1a 44 or 22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g sc tiw, or placebo, for 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The study was extended for a further 2&#x02005;years (years 3&#x02013;4), during which patients continued the same blinded dose or, if originally randomised to placebo, were re-randomised to one of the two doses of sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> All patients were then given the opportunity to continue on blinded or open-label treatment for the following 2&#x02005;years (years 5&#x02013;6). After withdrawal or completion of 6&#x02005;years on study, patients could continue on any or no treatment as per standard clinical practice. All originally randomised patients were invited to single-visit, long-term follow-up assessments at 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and approximately 15&#x02005;years after initial randomisation.</p><p>The 15-year visit included a neurological evaluation, and retrospective review of medical and treatment history collected since the final visit of the initial 4-year study period or the long-term follow-up assessment at 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Clinical evaluations throughout PRISMS included documentation of relapses and assessments using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). At the 15-year visit, relapse counts were based on data prospectively collected during the first 4&#x02005;years plus retrospective data over subsequent years. EDSS progression at 15&#x02005;years was defined as an increase in EDSS score of &#x02265;1 points (&#x02265;0.5 points if the baseline score was &#x02265;6) that was not associated with a relapse. For confirmation of EDSS progression, the increase had to be maintained for at least 3&#x02005;months; progression at the time of PRISMS-15 was assumed to be confirmed as there was no subsequent follow-up visit. The 15-year visit had to be conducted at least 3&#x02005;months after the onset of the last relapse to avoid EDSS assessment bias. Conversion to SPMS, which was defined as an endpoint and assessed at the long-term follow-up visits only, was defined as progressive worsening of disability for at least 12 months despite best symptomatic management and confirmed EDSS progression, following an initial relapsing&#x02013;remitting disease course.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>PRISMS-15 was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and local regulations. The protocol was approved by health authorities and an independent ethics committee or institutional review board, according to country-specific laws.

Categorisation of cumulative sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a dose exposure has been described;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> briefly, patient data from the three original study arms (IFN &#x003b2;-1a 44 or 22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g sc tiw, or placebo) were pooled and ranked from lowest to highest cumulative dose exposure to sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a over 15&#x02005;years, calculated as (dose of IFN &#x003b2;-1a)&#x000d7;(frequency of application)&#x000d7;(period of application, in weeks). The minimum (lowest quartile, MIN) and maximum (highest quartile, MAX) cumulative dose exposure groups were compared with respect to the following clinical outcomes over 15&#x02005;years: mean annualised relapse rate (ARR); mean number of relapses per patient; proportion of patients free from relapse; time to first relapse during the study; proportion of patients with 0&#x02013;5, 6&#x02013;10 and &#x02265;11 relapses; proportion of patients with EDSS progression; time to first 3-month confirmed EDSS progression; change in EDSS score over 15&#x02005;years; proportions of patients with EDSS score &#x02265;4 or &#x02265;6; proportions of patients with &#x02264;5 relapses and EDSS score &#x0003c;4 or &#x0003c;6; proportion of patients converting to SPMS; and time to conversion to SPMS. SPMS was defined as a progressive deterioration of disability for a minimum of 6 months and an increase of EDSS of &#x0003e;1 point (or &#x0003e;0.5 point for EDSS &#x0003e; 6.0) not associated with an exacerbation). Total time receiving sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a (irrespective of dose) was examined as a continuous variable per 5&#x02005;years of treatment for the clinical outcomes listed above, with the exceptions of mean number of relapses per patient and the proportions of patients remaining relapse free, with EDSS progression, and converting to SPMS.</p><p>Dichotomous variables were analysed using logistic regression. Time to event variables were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model; if no event occurred, then the time was censored at the PRISMS-15 visit date. Change in EDSS score by cumulative time on sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment was estimated using linear regression. ARR, defined as the total number of relapses divided by the length of the time in years, was analysed using Poisson regression. As these were <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analyses, p values were not calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Prognostic factors for clinical outcomes</title><p>The following long-term outcome variables were assessed: change in EDSS score from baseline to 15&#x02005;years (continuous variable), SPMS conversion status (yes/no) and 3-month confirmed EDSS progression over 15&#x02005;years (yes/no). Baseline/prestudy characteristics, indicators of early clinical or MRI activity from baseline to 24&#x02005;months and indicators of treatment exposure, were investigated as candidate prognostic factors for the long-term outcome variables. Baseline/prestudy characteristics were: age (years), female sex, time since MS onset (years), number of prior relapses, EDSS and log (T2 burden of disease (BOD)). Indicators of early clinical or MRI activity from baseline to 24&#x02005;months were: change in EDSS, ARR, change in log (T2 BOD) and number of T2 active lesions (defined as new or enlarging T2 lesions) per scan. Indicators of treatment exposure were: early IFN &#x003b2;-1a (44 or 22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g tiw) treatment and MPR (calculated as 100&#x000d7;time (days) on sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment from baseline to the 15-year visit/time (days) from baseline to the 15-year visit).</p><p>Initially, the prognostic factors were tested in univariate models using linear regression for change in EDSS score from baseline to 15&#x02005;years, and logistic regression for SPMS conversion and 3-month confirmed EDSS progression over 15&#x02005;years. Factors significant in univariate models (p&#x02264;0.10) were entered into forward selection, stepwise multivariate analyses, in which only factors with p&#x02264;0.10 remained in the final models. The final predictive models for each outcome were summarised by parameter estimates per prognostic factor; positive regression coefficients indicate that a positive/increasing value in the prognostic factor leads to an increase in the outcome, while negative regression coefficients indicate that a positive/increasing value in the prognostic factor leads to a decrease in the outcome.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 560 patients originally randomised in the PRISMS study, 291 (52.0%) returned for PRISMS-15.

In patients who had initially been randomised to placebo for 2&#x02005;years, baseline log (T2 BOD) and change in log (T2 BOD) to 24&#x02005;months were identified as predictive factors for SPMS conversion that were not present in the overall analysis (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jnnp.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-310024/-/DC1">supplementary table</ext-link> S3).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main strength of the PRISMS-15 study is the inclusion of a well-characterised group of patients with RRMS who were comprehensively assessed during the core study and reassessed after 15&#x02005;years according to GCP standards. This provided an opportunity to assess long-term clinical outcomes at 15&#x02005;years in patients with varying exposure to sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment. Overall, 61.8% of eligible patients from participating centres returned for the 15-year visit, which compares well with the proportions of patients returning for similar long-term studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Nonetheless, the substantial proportion of patients lost to long-term follow-up remains an important limitation to this type of study. Equal proportions of patients returned from each original randomisation group, suggesting that there was no systematic bias as related to initial randomised treatment. The higher proportion of females and slightly shorter time since MS onset in the original placebo group, compared with the active treatment groups in the PRISMS-15 cohort, reflected the characteristics of the three arms at randomisation in the PRISMS study.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>However, the results of this <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analysis should also be considered in the context of the study limitations. A greater proportion of patients in the MIN versus MAX group switched to other treatments, and disease progression may have been a reason for switching therapy. Moreover, patients with worse outcomes may have been more likely to discontinue treatment. Other issues include different timings and frequencies of assessments, retrospective collection of relapse data that may be affected by recall bias, difficulties confirming EDSS progression (if not from existing medical records), unblinded assessment of patients who may no longer be receiving study medication, and treatment interruptions and conversions to non-study medications.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Differences between returning and non-returning patients may have introduced selection bias. Patients with better disease outcomes may have tended to continue on treatment and/or have been more willing or able to participate, leading to under-representation of patients with worse outcomes. However, the returning and non-returning groups appeared similar in terms of baseline characteristics, with some differences in outcomes at 2&#x02005;years, which suggests that the findings of this study were not driven by selection bias.</p><p>In these exploratory analyses at 15&#x02005;years, higher levels of cumulative dose exposure and longer time on treatment appeared to be associated with better clinical outcomes. This is consistent with findings from similar <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses from the previous long-term follow-up of PRISMS at 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years after initial randomisation,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and data from other IFN &#x003b2; and glatiramer acetate studies supporting long-term disease-modifying drug (DMD) therapy in MS.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> The association of higher exposure to sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment with better relapse-related outcomes was similar in the overall population and the subgroup of patients who had not converted to SPMS over 15&#x02005;years, suggesting that this did not reflect the development of relapse-independent continuous progression. In the MAX cumulative dose group, only 20.8% of patients had converted to SPMS over 15&#x02005;years, compared with 52.1% in the MIN dose group. Although a direct comparison cannot be made, natural history data in patients with RRMS at disease onset who were not exposed to DMDs have indicated a median time to SPMS ranging from approximately 15&#x02013;21&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The use of other DMDs was not controlled for in PRISMS-15; about half of patients in the MIN dose group received other first-line DMDs after discontinuing sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a, but this group had poorer outcomes despite the high proportion of patients switching to other treatments. Less than 3% of patients in the MAX dose group received other first-line DMDs.</p><p>Owing to the methods for calculating cumulative dose and time on treatment, it is not possible to definitively state cut-off points when a certain dose exposure resulted in a particular outcome, but these totals can be considered to provide an indication of adherence to sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment over 15&#x02005;years. The positive association of higher treatment exposure with more favourable outcomes suggests that starting treatment early and maintaining adherence over the long term may be important for optimal clinical outcomes. However, as this was an observational study without a randomised control group, it is impossible to determine whether better clinical outcomes are a consequence or cause of adherence to therapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Identification of prognostic factors that can predict a successful or poor long-term outcome after starting therapy is required to assist therapeutic decision-making in clinical practice. Even after 15&#x02005;years, a greater increase in EDSS score from baseline to 24&#x02005;months appeared to be a strong predictor of worse outcomes in final multivariate models, consistent with results from a similar analysis after 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;years of follow-up.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> An association between higher MPR and a lower increase in EDSS score and risk of SPMS conversion over 15&#x02005;years was also observed, which supports the importance of treatment adherence. In the univariate analysis, female sex, baseline log (T2 BOD), ARR at 24&#x02005;months and the number of T2 active lesions per scan at 24&#x02005;months predicted change in EDSS score over 15&#x02005;years; and age at baseline, number of prior relapses, baseline log (T2 BOD) and ARR at 24&#x02005;months predicted SPMS conversion; however, these variables were not confirmed as independent predictors in the multivariate analysis. Although this indicates that these putative prognostic factors have lower predictive value, the limitations of the statistical approach must be taken into account. The final multivariate models for the prognostic factor analyses were dependent on the particular combination of variables chosen for inclusion in the original candidate set of predictors. Predictors that were only marginally less powerful may have been forced out of the models by slightly more powerful predictors. It should also be noted that, in general, the R<sup>2</sup> values of the predictive models were low.</p><p>Despite the limitations inherent in long-term follow-up studies, the findings of these <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analyses suggest that higher dose exposure to IFN &#x003b2;-1a and longer time on treatment may be associated with better outcomes over many years in patients with RRMS. Change in EDSS score from baseline to 24&#x02005;months and MPR also appeared predictive of long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jnnp-2014-310024-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1381" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Fernando Dangond, MD, FAAN, MBA (Global Research &#x00026; Development, EMD Serono, Rockland, MA, USA) for significant contributions to latter stages of the development of the manuscript and for clinical/medical accountability on behalf of EMD Serono.
