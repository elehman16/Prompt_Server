However, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and symptom severity in people with advanced cancer is unknown. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a community-based walking intervention to enhance QoL in people with recurrent/metastatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>We used a mixed-methods design comprising a 2-centre RCT and nested qualitative interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with advanced breast, prostate, gynaecological or haematological cancers randomised 1:1 between intervention and usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention comprised Macmillan's &#x02018;Move More&#x02019; information, a short motivational interview with a recommendation to walk for at least 30&#x02005;min on alternate days and attend a volunteer-led group walk weekly.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>We assessed feasibility and acceptability of the intervention <italic>and</italic> RCT by evaluating study processes (rates of recruitment, consent, retention, adherence and adverse events), and using end-of-study questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing QoL, activity, fatigue, mood and self-efficacy were completed at baseline and 6, 12 and 24&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 42 (38%) eligible participants. Recruitment was lower than anticipated (goal n=60), the most commonly reported reason being unable to commit to walking groups (n=19). Randomisation procedures worked well with groups evenly matched for age, sex and activity. By week 24, there was a 45% attrition rate. Most PROMs while acceptable were not sensitive to change and did not capture key benefits.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention was acceptable, well tolerated and the study design was judged acceptable and feasible. Results are encouraging and demonstrate that exercise was popular and conveyed benefit to participants. Consequently, an effectiveness RCT is warranted, with some modifications to the intervention to include greater tailoring and more appropriate PROMs selected.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN42072606">ISRCTN42072606</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feasibility studies</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>walking</kwd><kwd>metastatic and recurrent cancer</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised control trial (RCT) of community-based walking for people with recurrent or metastatic breast, gynaecological, haematological or prostate cancers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention made use of freely available walking groups and information, combined with a brief motivational interview and recommendation to walk for at least 30&#x02005;min on alternate days and attend a weekly walking group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A mixed-methods design, including a two-centre RCT with nested qualitative interviews, was used to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and RCT, and test the utility of different patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The recruitment centres were London-based limiting generalisability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Views of participants from Black and ethnic minority patients were under-represented as the majority of participants were Caucasian and English-speaking.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life expectancy of people with recurrent or metastatic cancer is increasing, but this patient group is at considerable risk of experiencing psychological<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and physical health problems.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

Reasons for non-participation and withdrawal were collected, where possible. Participants completed an end-of-study questionnaire (ESQ) assessing acceptability of CanWalk, randomisation process, study methods and outcome measures. Adherence to CanWalk was evaluated over 7 days at each assessment using a self-report measure. We assessed the feasibility of capturing objective data on walking behaviour by randomly allocating 50% of the control and intervention groups to use a pedometer (Omron HJ-321-E). Participants were asked to wear them for seven consecutive days at each time-point and complete a usage log recording their daily step count. Additionally, the intervention group was asked to keep a log of WfH walks they undertook.

Although in general reasons for withdrawal were not provided, two patients were too unwell and two participants died during the study. The only factor associated with withdrawal was higher baseline anxiety (M=6.4, SD=8.1) compared with those who completed the study (M=4.2, SD=3.8) (t (40)=1.16, p=0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>Acceptability of outcome measures</title><p>In interviews, participants reported taking 10&#x02013;40&#x02005;min to complete outcome measures. All were judged appropriate except the Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaire (SPAQ). Eight participants reported it was repetitive and difficult to complete as illustrated below:<disp-quote><p>The SPAQ section&#x02026; a lot of licking my fingers and sticking it in the air, lots of &#x02018;think of a number&#x02019; type thing, it was hard to think. A pre-warning of what was going to be required might have been helpful so you could fill this section in accurately. (3013, male, prostate cancer)</p></disp-quote></p><p>These problems were reflected in data quality, with 45% completing the daily activity data incorrectly or not at all. Further, insufficient numbers of participants returned the pedometer data at all assessments to permit analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3a4"><title>Assessment of methodological components of the trial</title><p>Application of the ADePT framework<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> suggests most components of the trial protocol worked well (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>). The only exception was participants were not recruited from three tumour groups: head and neck, colorectal and skin.</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>Safety and engagement with the intervention</title><p>No adverse outcomes or events were reported. Views about CanWalk were positive from the ESQ and interviews, although interview data suggested engagement with, and adherence to, WfH group walks varied. Most (4/5) interviewees from the intervention group participated in the WfH group walks plus self-initiated walks. One completed self-initiated walks only.</p></sec><sec id="s3a6"><title>Hawthorne effect</title><p>During interview, only one participant in the control group reported receiving information about exercise over the course of the study. Yet on the ESQ, 9 out of 12 said taking part in this study had stimulated them to undertake more physical activity. Interview findings confirmed this effect in three of the five control group members:<disp-quote><p>I found it all quite motivating as after filling in the questionnaire and using the pedometer I found that I was more focused on walking. I even did a long walk with the Ramblers which I haven't done in a while. It prompted me to be more fit. I sit less on the sofa now and try to get myself outside.

Nevertheless, a number of barriers to the intervention were identified at interview. Some participants preferred self-initiated walking, and felt WfH groups, while beneficial for some, did not suit everybody. Reasons included dislike of group activities and accessibility issues. One younger participant who withdrew from the study felt the group walks were more appropriate for older people and decided to continue with self-initiated walks only. Consequently, some interviewees suggested modifying the intervention to offer alternative options to the group walks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Between-group outcomes</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Primary RCT outcome: QoL</title><p>While at baseline, the control group reported lower median FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) QoL scores than the intervention (53 vs 58, respectively), scores were comparable during follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013719TB2">table 2</xref>).

(3022 male, prostate cancer no pedometer)<break/>I have walked ever since at least 3&#x02005;days a week. This study has stimulated me. I drop my daughter off at school then go with the dog for a long walk. I have noticed the difference physically. I am back on chemo now and have noticed differences with side effects compared to last year. Last year I had oedema which I don't this time and I just feel a lot fitter this time round.

Being diagnosed with cancer is a pretty devastating thing and being told its terminal is even more devastating and when I'm on the walks I forget about the cancer, they have helped me enormously by keeping me physically fit and keeping me well but also mentally. I bang on a lot less to those around me about dying than I used to. And that's got to be good for them as well (3022, male prostate cancer)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Social benefits</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I have been doing Nordic walking [WfH] at least once a week&#x02014;it has made a huge difference to me physically and mentally.

It seemed that everyone in the group was quite a bit older than me, and they spent the first 20&#x02005;min of the walking time drinking tea in the cafe. When they moved off they were walking quite slowly. I'm not criticising the validity of these social group walks but I was looking for something a bit more energetic, and with people closer in age to me (8003, male, colorectal cancer)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Well-being and lifestyle benefits, such as weight loss, also motivated participants to increase the amount they walked. They spoke about how it improved their overall QoL and helped them maintain a positive attitude towards their illness. Many participants in the intervention group spoke of the social benefits of participating in the WfH groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013719TB4">table 4</xref> for illustrative quotes).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an RCT of a community-based walking programme in people with recurrent/metastatic cancer. Our results indicate that most self-initiated walks were acceptable, though some reported being unable to commit to the WfH groups regularly, largely due to work commitments. The CanWalk intervention, based on the UK's NICE (National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence) guidance for promoting physical activity,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> includes active components identified as helping individuals change their behaviour,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> such as goal setting, planning and social support. However, it is possible that including more monitoring and tailored feedback could be beneficial and could be offered remotely through the use of apps and/or websites. This is supported by comments from participants from the intervention and support groups, indicating they found that completing the outcome measures stimulated them to increase their physical activity levels.</p><p>Key elements of feasibility testing have been identified by Bowen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and are used (highlighted in bold) here to evaluate whether the CanWalk intervention warrants further investigation. A central focus to our study involved estimating <bold>demand</bold> for the intervention. Forty per cent of those eligible to participate in the study consented. This is comparable to recruitment rates reported in similar studies,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and not unexpected in a population comprising people with advanced cancer. Almost a third withdrew within 6 weeks, which is higher than found in previous research; however, these studies included those with early stage cancer<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> or had shorter follow-ups (4 weeks).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our preliminary evidence indicated an association between withdrawal and higher baseline anxiety. This warrants further exploration and consideration of ways the intervention could be made more appealing and acceptable for people with symptoms of anxiety, perhaps through a buddy system or by enhancing the motivational interview component with &#x02018;booster&#x02019; follow-up sessions.</p><p>This feasibility study also explored the <bold>implementation</bold> of the study and intervention. Importantly, based on the study data, a power calculation was performed for target recruitment for a future trial. However, the proposed recruitment estimate was not feasible within the timeframe; despite extending recruitment and widening the eligibility criteria to include other diagnoses.</p><p>For clinicians to change their practice, they require evidence of the <bold>practicality</bold> of the interventions, ie, that they can be delivered within existing means and resources.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The complementary components of the intervention promoted physical activity. The researchers spent &#x0223c;20&#x02005;min per person delivering CanWalk. This suggests that if the intervention proves effective, it could be sufficiently brief for delivery by HCP in the clinical setting.</p><p><bold>Limited-efficacy testing</bold> gives an indication of the likely impact of the intervention, although not the primary aim of a feasibility study. Results suggest few differences between groups across the outcome measures at any time point. Arguably, this inability to detect change could be attributed to the small sample size, as the pilot study was insufficiently powered to detect subtle differences. Further, similar to other studies,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> contamination may have occurred while assessing activity levels using outcome measures which reportedly stimulated all participants to engage in physical activity. Likewise, participants highlighted that using pedometers with both groups had a similar effect. This suggests an alternative method of assessing walking behaviour is required.</p><p>Detailed descriptive evaluation of the performance of the outcome measures suggests that while being reliable, some of the measures may not be sensitive to change as they demonstrated floor/ceiling effects. Moreover, feedback from the ESQ and interviews suggested social support was a key perceived benefit of participating in the WfH walks, but this was not reflected in the FACT-G social well-being subscale scores. However, this may be because it focuses entirely on support from family and relatives and so would not be sensitive to benefits from making wider social contacts. It will therefore be important to include a brief social support and engagement measure (such as the Duke-Social Support Questionnaire)<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> in future research. Our findings demonstrate the importance of pilot testing questionnaires. Many participants reported the SPAQ was time-consuming and confusing suggesting a need to use other measures of physical activity for both measuring adherence to the intervention and outcomes. Pedometer data were often not returned, thus alternative methods for measuring the intensity, duration and frequency of physical activity in any future study are recommended. While accelerometers have been used in previous studies, they often require expert knowledge to interpret and analyse results, so the use of off-the-shelf wearable technologies may offer an alternative and more cost-effective approach.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Some participants were, from the outset, already active which contributed to difficulty in detecting between-group changes. Thus, it may be preferable to only recruit people who are judged to be inactive. However, this will reduce the number eligible to participate and exclude people who, although active, wish to increase the amount they walk.</p><p>Based on the study findings, a number of <bold>adaptations</bold> are proposed for a future study, including the refinement of the study samples to include different comparison groups, for example, a tailored CanWalk intervention and written information only group. Furthermore, it will be important to ensure that outcome measures used match the benefits reported by participants in the interviews, such as feeling fitter and having more stamina (eg, functional walking/fitness tests such as incremental shuttle walk or 6 min walk test), being less inactive (eg, measure of sedentary behaviour), weight loss (eg, weight, body mass index, hip to waist ratio) and symptom control.</p><p>Several limitations were identified in the study. The recruitment centres were London-based, thus limiting generalisability. Although we were able to collect reasons for non-participation, unfortunately, we were not able to collect data on the demographic or clinical characteristics of those who declined participation. Further, the qualitative sample was small, limiting the extent of indepth analysis of participants' perceptions and experiences. Another limitation is that the views of participants from Black and minority ethnic groups are under-represented as the study recruited primarily Caucasian participants and English speakers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking an RCT of a community-based walking programme to enhance QoL in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer.
