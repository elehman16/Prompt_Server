In fact, consistent with the results of the main trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C3">3</xref></sup> therapy with dronedarone was associated with a decrease in the primary study outcome in patients with NYHA functional class III CHF at baseline. Similarly, in patients with NYHA class II/III CHF and a LVEF &#x02264;0.40, representing the subpopulation with systolic heart failure, event rates were not different in the dronedarone and the placebo groups.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Antiarrhythmic drug therapy in atrial fibrillation patients with congestive heart failure</title><p>Most antiarrhythmic drugs are not recommended for the treatment of AF in the setting of CHF and/or depressed LV function because these patients are particularly prone to ventricular proarrhythmic effects and to negative inotropic action of antiarrhythmic drugs. Current guidelines for the treatment of AF recommend only the use of amiodarone or dofetilide in heart failure patients with AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C6">6</xref></sup> Whereas amiodarone is well tolerated in patients with impaired LV function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C7">7</xref></sup> and has very little proarrhythmic side effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C8">8</xref></sup> its use is hampered by the extracardiac side effects that can be serious and necessitate discontinuation in a significant proportion of patients. Dofetilide, on the other hand, carries a significant proarrhythmic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C9">9</xref></sup> which is why the drug has to be initiated in-hospital with ECG monitoring for at least a few days. For this reason dofetilide is not marketed in all countries. The lack of safe and efficacious pharmacological treatment options for AF in the setting of CHF warrants careful evaluation of new antiarrhythmic compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Dronedarone for therapy of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure</title><p>A previous study in CHF patients using dronedarone, ANDROMEDA, was terminated prematurely due to the observation of increased mortality with dronedarone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C4">4</xref></sup> ANDROMEDA enrolled patients with advanced CHF characterized by LVEF &#x02264; 0.35 and, importantly, a recent hospitalization with new or worsening heart failure. There were 627 patients enrolled and followed for a median of 2 months. Thirteen excess deaths occurred on dronedarone (HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.07&#x02013;2.45, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). The excess mortality was predominantly related to CHF (10 deaths vs. 2). This finding contrasts the results of ATHENA where dronedarone reduced CV mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C3">3</xref></sup> Specifically, ATHENA demonstrated in 4628 patients with AF at moderate to high risk for CV events that dronedarone therapy was not associated with increased mortality due to pump failure (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.41&#x02013;1.85, <italic>P</italic> = 0.89) or with an increase in hospitalizations for CHF (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.67&#x02013;1.10, <italic>P</italic> = 0.22).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C3">3</xref></sup> The present analysis extends these observations and yields results for the population with stable class II/III CHF in the setting of reduced LVEF. All findings are consistent with the overall observations made in ATHENA. Even in these high-risk subsets, there was no sign of harm associated with dronedarone therapy.</p><p>How can we understand the difference between ATHENA and ANDROMEDA? There were 356 NYHA class III patients in ANDROMEDA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C4">4</xref></sup> compared with 200 such patients in ATHENA. On the other hand, ATHENA included 80 times more patient years of exposure to dronedarone than ANDROMEDA. The presence or absence of clinical stability was the primary feature that distinguished patients enrolled in the ANDROMEDA and ATHENA trials. Specifically, the ANDROMEDA trial was conceptualized primarily as a study that sought to enrol clinically unstable patients with advanced heart disease; as such, this trial enrolled patients who might be most likely to demonstrate a proarrhythmic effect of dronedarone (if one existed). In contrast, the ATHENA trial was conceptualized primarily as an efficacy study and sought to enrol patients likely to receive the drug in clinical practice, i.e. those with recent or current AF/AFL. Although most of the patients in the ATHENA trial had structural heart disease, they were clinically stable. Both trials enrolled patients with low ejection fractions or with NYHA class II or III heart failure; however, these patients had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure in the ANDROMEDA trial but were stable outpatients in the ATHENA trial. The observation of a higher mortality rate in ANDROMEDA is in line with a recent analysis of a large heart failure trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C10">10</xref></sup> Solomon <italic>et al</italic>. elucidated the subsequent risk of death associated with a heart failure admission (which all patients enrolled in ANDROMEDA were required to have). They found that the mortality rate was highest early after a heart failure hospitalization and declined thereafter but never reached the relative risk obtained in patients without a heart failure hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C10">10</xref></sup> These data suggest that patients with CHF are most vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of a hospital admission and should therefore not receive dronedarone during this period.</p><p>Both ANDROMEDA and ATHENA observed an increase in serum creatinine in patients receiving dronedarone. It is possible that investigators observing a creatinine increase in ANDROMEDA due to dronedarone inappropriately discontinued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy which might have resulted in worsening of CHF. Therefore, ATHENA investigators were informed that a small rise in creatinine due to a specific partial inhibition of tubular organic cation transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ113C11">11</xref></sup> was expected with dronedarone not indicating a decline in renal function.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Exploratory efficacy analyses comprising relatively small subgroups have inherent limitations that result from the loss of a randomization effect. We also acknowledge the fact that the interaction analyses may be underpowered given the small patient numbers in some of the subgroups. However, the consistency of our analyses suggests that our findings are robust.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>While patients with unstable haemodynamic conditions were excluded from ATHENA, patients with stable CHF at baseline showed results that were consistent with those observed in the overall ATHENA population. In patients with AF and stable CHF, dronedarone did not increase mortality and showed a trend towards the reduction of CV hospitalization or death. There was no increase in CHF hospitalizations in the dronedarone arm. According to the ANDROMEDA study, however, dronedarone is contraindicated in patients with NYHA class IV heart failure or unstable NYHA classes II and III heart failure with a recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or referral to a specialized heart failure clinic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by sanofi-aventis.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> S.H.H reports receiving consulting fees from Sanofi Aventis, Cardiome, ARYx, BMS, research grants from Sanofi Aventis and St. Jude Medical, and lecture fees from Sanofi Aventis, St. Jude Medical, and BMS; H.J.G.M.C., consulting fees from Medacorp, Astra Zeneca, Sanofi Aventis, Cardiome, research grants from Astra Zeneca and St. Jude Medical, and lecture fees from Astra Zeneca, Sanofi Aventis, and Chugai Pharmaceuticals; R.L.P., consulting fees from Sanofi Aventis, Astellas, and Pfizer; C.T.-P., consulting fees from Sanofi Aventis and Cardiome, research grants from Sanofi Aventis, lecture fees from Sanofi Aventis and Cardiome; S.J.C., consulting fees and research grants from Sanofi Aventis.
