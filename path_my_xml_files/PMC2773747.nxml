Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and directly switched from their current antihypertensive therapy to either a valsartan strategy or an amlodipine strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-5-883">Figure 1</xref>).

We found that initiating therapy earlier with valsartan/HCTZ provided superior BP control rates (&#x0003c;140/90 mmHg) compared with titrating amlodipine monotherapy to its maximum dose before adding HCTZ. Significant differences in favor of valsartan &#x000b1; HCTZ were observed at weeks 8, 11, and 14 (end of study). The differences were even greater for patients who at the start of the study were uncontrolled on previous monotherapy. In those patients who were na&#x000ef;ve to antihypertensive therapy similar BP control rates were achieved using either treatment strategy approach. This finding may be explained by the greater number of patients using monotherapy in the treatment-na&#x000ef;ve group compared to those in the previous monotherapy group since both regimens were associated with few titration steps. The higher incidence of peripheral edema with amlodipine &#x000b1; HCTZ led to more frequent treatment discontinuations, resulting in an overall lower therapeutic success.</p><p>Our results support the use of the valsartan &#x000b1; HCTZ strategy for the treatment of hypertension. This is consistent with the well-established role of the RAS in the pathogenesis of hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-5-883">17</xref> Moreover, evidence from large outcomes trials (eg, HOPE, ALLHAT, LIFE, and VALUE) has consistently demonstrated that a RAS-inhibitor-based approach to treatment provides similar or greater cardiovascular and organ protection than regimens lacking this component.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-5-883">18</xref> In contrast, our findings do not support the use of the amlodipine &#x000b1; HCTZ strategy as this regimen was more poorly tolerated and yielded inferior BP control rates and BP reductions at most clinic visits. This is in line with current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance and the ABCD (A = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACE-I] or ARBs, B = beta-blockers, C = CCBs, and D = thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics) treatment algorithm, which suggests that patients starting on a CCB should add a RAS inhibitor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-vhrm-5-883">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-5-883">20</xref> Although the most recent European guidelines advocate the use of a CCB/diuretic combination,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-5-883">2</xref> our results and those of others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-vhrm-5-883">14</xref> suggest that this is a poor recommendation. The combination of an antihypertensive agent that blocks the RAS with one that does not is likely to be a more effective approach than using two agents that both block the RAS (eg, ACE-I+ARB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-vhrm-5-883">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-883">22</xref> or two agents that do not affect the RAS (eg, CCB+diuretic). The effectiveness of amlodipine monotherapy has been demonstrated in some key hypertension outcome studies (eg, TOMHS, VALUE, and ALLHAT), but when patients with hypertension cannot be effectively controlled with amlodipine monotherapy, it would make most sense to use a complementary antihypertensive agent (eg, ACE-I or ARB). Recently, the ASCOT and ACCOMPLISH studies demonstrated the importance of combining amlodipine with an ACE-I as patients had significant reductions in cardiovascular events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-883">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-vhrm-5-883">24</xref></p><p>Several previous randomized controlled studies have compared valsartan &#x000b1; HCTZ and amlodipine &#x000b1; HCTZ strategies in patients with essential hypertension, although none used the dose and titration schedules described herein. The combination of valsartan/HCTZ confers additional BP lowering over monotherapy with these agents,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-vhrm-5-883">8</xref> with low doses of this combination (80&#x02013;160/12.5 mg) providing comparable BP reductions to high-dose amlodipine monotherapy (10 mg).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-vhrm-5-883">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-vhrm-5-883">13</xref> Similar overall antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated when a regimen of valsartan 80 mg o.d. titrated up to valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d. was compared with a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg o.d. titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-5-883">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-vhrm-5-883">26</xref>Lacourci&#x000e8;re and colleagues conducted a 10-week, forced-titration, ambulatory BP monitoring study in which patients with stage 2 hypertension started therapy with valsartan 160 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg o.d.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-vhrm-5-883">14</xref> The valsartan arm was titrated to valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg o.d. at two weeks and valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ 25 mg o.d. at six weeks, while the amlodipine arm was titrated to double-dose at two weeks with the addition of HCTZ 25 mg o.d. at six weeks. At 10 weeks, the reduction from baseline BP was 3.8/2.7 mmHg greater with valsartan/HCTZ than amlodipine/HCTZ (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The VALUE outcomes trial reported better BP control with an amlodipine-based strategy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-vhrm-5-883">27</xref> However, several factors related to the study design may have influenced the results of VALUE. Patients were not randomized to different treatment strategies based on the severity of their hypertension or their prior treatment history or response. Moreover, the addition of HCTZ was not allowed before two months of monotherapy treatment, titration to the high-dose valsartan/HCTZ regimen (320 mg/25 mg o.d.) was not an option, and patients assigned to the valsartan strategy initiated treatment with a suboptimal starting dose (80 mg o.d.).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-883">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-vhrm-5-883">28</xref> The 160-mg dose of valsartan has been shown to be more effective than an 80-mg dose in reducing BP from baseline (14.3/11.1 mmHg vs 11.2/9.0 mmHg) and in providing BP control (39.3% vs 22.7%) after up to 8 weeks of therapy, with both doses having comparable AE and biochemical profiles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-883">4</xref>Numerous ambulatory BP monitoring studies have demonstrated that valsartan 160 mg o.d. provides consistent reductions in BP throughout the 24-hour interval, with a preservation of the BP-lowering effect at the end of the dosing period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-vhrm-5-883">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-vhrm-5-883">30</xref> Further, compared with an 80-mg dose, 160-mg of valsartan resulted in more effective inhibition of the RAS over the 24-hour dosing period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-vhrm-5-883">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-5-883">32</xref></p><p>Both treatments were well tolerated in the current study, with the exception of a relatively high incidence of peripheral edema in the amlodipine &#x000b1; HCTZ group (22.4%) versus the valsartan &#x000b1; HCTZ group (2.2%). Similarly, discontinuations due to this AE were higher in the former group (7.3% vs &#x0003c;1.0%). Other AEs were reported at a low and generally similar incidence with both treatment strategies. Peripheral edema is a known side effect of amlodipine. A pooled analysis of data from 40 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in which 1,775 patients were treated with amlodipine (primarily 5 mg or 10 mg daily) and 1,213 with placebo found that the incidence of &#x0201c;edema&#x0201d; was fourfold greater with amlodipine than with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-vhrm-5-883">33</xref> The rates of peripheral edema and associated discontinuations in our study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-vhrm-5-883">Table 3</xref>) were similar to those in Val-Syst study (4.8% and 0% for valsartan, respectively; 26.8% and 4.2% for amlodipine, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-vhrm-5-883">26</xref> Side effects can have a negative impact on patients&#x02019; persistence with antihypertensive treatment, which in turn may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-vhrm-5-883">34</xref> Patients with hypertension who demonstrate poor persistence have increased morbidity and mortality and higher health care costs. Better tolerated treatment strategies should improve persistence and enable more patients to achieve protection against cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Initiating therapy earlier with valsartan/HCTZ, rather than titrating monotherapy to its maximum dose before adding a second agent, was superior to amlodipine monotherapy or amlodipine &#x000b1; HCTZ for achieving BP control (&#x0003c;140/90 mmHg) while avoiding excessive numbers of treatment adjustments and maintaining tolerability.
