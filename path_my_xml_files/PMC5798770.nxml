Test anxiety is composed of two dimensions: worry and emotionality [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Worry is the cognitive component of test anxiety reflecting debilitating thoughts and concerns, such as comparing self-performance to peers, considering the consequences of failure, low levels of confidence in performance, excessive worry over evaluation, causing sorrow for one&#x02019;s parents, or feeling unprepared for tests [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Emotionality refers to heightened physiological symptoms stemming from arousal of the autonomic nervous system and associated affective responses, such as increased galvanic skin response and heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or feelings of panic [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Excessive test anxiety can affect learning, academic performance, and psychological health [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Test anxiety has been much researched in many countries, suggesting that this is a widespread problem in school, and it occurs among students of all ages [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Test anxiety is pervasive across geographic and cultural boundaries. Levels of test anxiety are reported to vary across cultures [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Research has shown that 45.9% of senior-high-school students in China suffer from severe test anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Scholars have begun to attend more to the development of interventions aiming to reduce test anxiety. Researchers in many countries are seeking an ideal intervention program to help alleviate this problem. Ergene reported 22 existing interventions [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A meta-analysis by Lu et al. examined the effectiveness of certain intervention methods devised in China for test anxiety, such as cognitive therapy, psychoanalytic therapy, behavior therapy, and pharmacotherapy. The effect sizes of these methods were 0.70, 0.87, 2.38, and 1.99, respectively. These methods can reduce levels of test anxiety, however the most effective methods take the longest time or have higher requirements for the services of a psychological counselor [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There are limitations in the extent to which these methods can be generalized to more and more students. Given the drawbacks of these conventional interventions, scholars have begun seeking new approaches. Expressive writing may be one such approach&#x02014;it has been found to significantly reduce levels of test anxiety and is rather easily implemented [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Expressive writing refers to the technique of writing a deep and meaningful piece about a personally significant topic, such as a traumatic or troubling event [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. People&#x02019;s reactions towards their own emotional responses, when experiencing stress, difficulty or failure, are important for their psychological adjustment. Indeed, greater self-reassurance is related to better psychological health [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Studies have shown not only that expressive writing can substantially improve a person&#x02019;s emotional state via reduction of anxiety and depression [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but also improve one&#x02019;s social relationships and increase one&#x02019;s feelings of well-being, happiness [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and self-efficacy, as well as effectively promote one&#x02019;s psychological health [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Expressive writing has been shown to lead to improvements in both physical and psychological health in patients [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Joan attempted to translate the expressive writing intervention into a community-based intervention in the form of a videotaped program for rheumatoid arthritis patients. The results indicated that the videotape program instructing patients through the intervention at home was feasible, but achieving effectiveness in the community is very difficult. [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Expressive writing has been used to reduce levels of test anxiety or improve exam performance. Ramirez and Beilock asked American students in an experimental group to openly express their thoughts and feelings regarding math problems that they were about to perform. They noted a significant improvement in exam scores in the experimental group at a later assessment, and that the use of words related to anxiety, cause, and insight in their writing was positively related to math performance [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, Zhang et al. discovered, in their study on Chinese students, that writing to express negative emotions can increase participants&#x02019; test results in English courses [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, most of the interventions were carried out just before exams or in a laboratory setting [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Some students suffer from chronic anxiety in their everyday lives, and may have a long history of suffering the deleterious effects of test anxiety. An intervention with only a small number of sessions might not be sufficient to have a long-term effect on the reduction of test anxiety. Knowles found that a short-term intervention has no effect in Asian culture [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Some researchers have revealed that a four-week intervention can effectively reduce the anxiety or improve the well-being of Chinese people [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, our study planned to carry out an intervention with 30 daily sessions, considering the school teaching plan, to help students to reduce their test anxiety.</p><p>With the rise of positive psychology over the past few decades, researchers have begun to pay more attention to the possible benefits of expressive writing on positive themes. Indeed, expressing positive emotions in writing can help to guide individuals&#x02019; attention to the positive aspects of a situation, aiding them in discovering the positive meaning of that event, and improving their emotional-regulation ability. This is not only a cost-effective method of treating anxiety and depression [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but also leads to improvements in mental flexibility and the ability to handle stress [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. People In western cultures, prone to use more insight and negative emotion words in expressive writing [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At the same time, in eastern culture, people are more likely to suppress negative emotions than positive emotions [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Expressing negative emotions reveals one&#x02019;s vulnerability, so people in eastern culture tend to prefer to express positive emotions, and prefer indirect and nonverbal modes of communication to explicit disclosure [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hence, allowing Chinese students to write and express their positive emotions is more in accordance with the culture.</p><p>The National Higher Education Entrance Examination (<italic>Gaokao</italic>), a Chinese-specific examination, is considered the most important exam of a student&#x02019;s life; indeed, the results are often considered to have a major impact on a student&#x02019;s future. For that reason, Chinese students tends to experience rather high degrees of test anxiety when facing this examination [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether training in expressive writing of positive emotions would produce changes in test anxiety in senior-high-school students. We therefore hypothesized that expressive writing of positive emotion would reduce the test anxiety levels of senior-high-school students. This will provide some preliminary evidence for an effective intervention for test anxiety in this age group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>The participant recruitment and follow-up was from late April to early June. We randomly selected 200 students in second grade from three senior-high schools in Xinxiang city, and asked them to complete Sarason&#x02019;s Test Anxiety Scale (TAS) in their classrooms. One hundred and eighty-five valid responses were collected (effective response rate 92.5%). A total of 75 students (21 males, 54 females, mean age of 16.84) with severe test anxiety were recruited. These students were divided into two groups by the high school teacher according to random numbers on a computer: the odd numbers were assigned to the expressive writing (EW) group, and the even numbers to the control writing (CW) group. The result revealed no statistically significant difference between the TAS results of the two groups prior to the experiment (<italic>F</italic> (1, 73) = 0.62, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; 0.05). The seventy-five participants&#x02019; demographic information (gender and age groups) is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191779.t001">Table 1</xref>. This research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xinxiang Medical University. Researchers obtained written consent from students, and verbal consent from students&#x02019; parents. As it&#x02019;s not convenient for researchers to meet the scattered-living parents, we informed them about the content by telephone, and recorded the time and each parent&#x02019;s attitude.

We also asked participants to write their evaluations of the intervention at the last time. In the control writing (CW) group, participants were instructed to write, with the same frequency and duration as the EW group, about their daily activities. After the end of the writing, a second TAS was administered to both the EW group and the CW group. The data analyst was blinded to intervention status.</p><p>To reduce the loss of participants to follow-up and to ensure that they completed the activity each day, the researchers informed them of the requirements of this study before the experiment and provided each participant with pay.

The Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of the measurements was 0.84. Participants complete the questionnaire based on their actual situation for each item. A total score of 12 or less is considered to indicate low test anxiety, 12&#x02013;20 is considered moderate anxiety, and 20 or higher indicates severe anxiety. A total score of 15 or higher indicates that the student has a sense of obvious discomfort.</p><p>Qualitative data were obtained from summaries of 38 students&#x02019; (EW group) writing manuscripts that were chosen from the first 10 days and the last 10 days.

This is consistent with previous findings from the literature [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, the message &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t let your children lose in the starting line&#x0201d; has rapidly become widespread in the educational and other fields in Chinese society. Chinese parents compete with others in early education and elementary education on behalf of their children [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Chinese students have to acquire a great deal of knowledge before entering universities. Hence, Chinese students experience much greater learning pressure, and are prone to suffer from test anxiety and weariness [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For example, some participants may sometimes fell into a swoon in their classroom.</p><p>The writing manuscripts indicated that students&#x02019; test performance was related to their parents&#x02019; expectation and pride. This is consistent with the study by Xing et al. [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This may be related to culture. Chinese people exhibit collectivistic tendencies [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For example, the Chinese language does not have an expression comparable to &#x0201c;self-esteem&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and Chinese construal of the self is interdependent, meaning that the self is conceived as being embedded in the context of relationships with significant others [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Chinese students are more likely to sacrifice personal goals, especially for their parents and family, and they reported significantly higher expectations, and greater concern about annoying their parents than American students. Chinese students&#x02019; interests and inner thoughts are restrained, and they tend to experience more conflict and anxiety. Pound found that Asian-American students reported significantly more test anxiety than their European-American peers [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Sansgiry and Sail found that American students indicated low to moderate test anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. American culture exhibits individualistic tendencies [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It was reported that American students had a significantly stronger preoccupation about their capacity to face challenges in life than Chinese students [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Expressive writing of positive emotions has a significant effect on test anxiety</title><p>The results of this study indicated that expressive writing of positive emotions could significantly reduce test anxiety levels among subjects. The qualitative research indicated that participants can reduce test anxiety and anxiety manifestation by increasing insight and positive emotion words. This is not consistent with the previous researches of people in Asian culture. Knowles found that Asian American cannot glean benefit from expressive writing [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. When facing this pressure, Chinese people prefer to express their positive emotions and suppress their negative emotions [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, one participant wrote that &#x0201c;a man does not easily shed tears&#x0201d;. The writing about positive emotion was in accordance with Chinese culture. Participants increased their use of insight and positive emotion words across the long-term intervention, while there was no change of Asian American in short-term intervention [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Perhaps a long-term intervention is more suitable for the Chinese. Individuals spontaneously regulate their emotional experience when put in aversive situations [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In expressive writing, students with severe test anxiety pay increasing attention to their own deep feelings and thoughts by using insight and positive emotion words. During this period, they could have undergone a cognitive reappraisal of test anxiety through emotional expression. Cognitive reappraisal and emotional disclosure constitute a process of self&#x02013;regulation [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. When writing positive psychological content, the positive emotions induced by recalling pleasant experiences could help disperse students&#x02019; negative perceptions and emotions about their examinations, and direct their attention to the positive side of the situation. So the counts of anxiety manifestation decreased across the 30 days. This in turn could help them identify the positive meaning of the event, improving their ability to regulate their emotions, and eventually subtly reduce their anxiety towards tests.</p><p>Moreover, since students usually carried out their expressive writing in the evening, writing about their positive emotions may have helped them end the day on a happy note. This perhaps made it easier for them to feel relaxed and helped improve their sleep quality. A good night&#x02019;s sleep would help them begin their day at school with more positive emotions and experiences. Thus, a virtuous circle might be formed, that over time would help reduce test anxiety and perhaps even improve learning efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>The causes of positive emotion had Chinese characteristics, such as taking exercise and eating delicious food. In middle-school, physical education often gives way to testing, so students will feel very happy if they have a chance to exercise. Meanwhile, because of the limitations of time, students have little chance to eat their favorite foods. They would feel very happy when they eat delicious foods. Learning with certain others is also easy to motivate positive emotion, because the harmony and stability of their social networks has an important impact on people in Asian culture [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>While the use of expressive writing for patients via home-based videotaped instructions may affect the degree to which patients adhere to interventions [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], our psychological counselor instructed students face to face at the beginning of writing. Students reported that expressive writing can be completed anywhere, do not require a psychological counselor each time, and places limited demands on time and energy. Expressive writing is a flexible, inexpensive, and convenient method.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Expressive writing of positive emotions has a significant effect for both male and female students</title><p>Meanwhile, we can draw no conclusions on gender differences regarding the intervention on test anxiety. This means that expressive writing is effective for both females and males. Frattaroli&#x02019;s meta-analysis also revealed no differences in the effect of gender on the expression of written emotion [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Females tend to be more emotionally sensitive and reactive, attentive, and affected by the surrounding environment, and good at expressing deeper feelings; thus, expressive writing might be expected to have a great effect on female subjects. Socialization practices encourage males to suppress their emotions including anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0191779.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191779.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Expressive writing of positive emotion can help males to express positive emotions and suppress negative emotions, and this is in accordance with Chinese traditions. Hence, anxiety in males is also reduced significantly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, Chinese senior-high-school students indicated moderate to high test anxiety. Expressive writing can effectively reduce test anxiety by using insight words and expressing positive emotion. Since the timing of implementing this method is flexible and there are no specific requirements concerning location or the use of a psychological counselor, it can be considered an easy, inexpensive, and convenient method of managing test anxiety for students with severe test anxiety. Additionally, this intervention method can be used simultaneously with more than one student; given this high efficiency, it would be worth promoting in schools.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study used a randomized design with a relatively large sample size, the limitations of this study should be considered. There are limitations in the extent to which the results can be generalized to other types of senior-high school students, as the results were obtained from a sample recruited only from Xinxiang City. Future research could focus on generalizing the results to a wider range of senior high school students. The study measured only the changes in test anxiety among students, and did not measure changes in their performance. This is the weakness of this research.</p><p>This limits our understanding of the students&#x02019; anxiety. The intervention over 30 days might be overly long and some students might be prone to fatigue. If there is no reward and informed consent, students might not persist for the entire intervention period. Future studies could consider reducing the writing frequency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191779.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191779.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191779.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Informed consent for students.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191779.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191779.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Record of informed consent for parents.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191779.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191779.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191779.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Yongjia Cheng and Chunping Yan for their genius help on the analysis of the manuscripts and TAS scores.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0191779.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sarason</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name>. <article-title>The test anxiety questionnaire: scoring norms[J]</article-title>. <source>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</source>. <year>1953</year>;<volume>48</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>447</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13061183</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0191779.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>St&#x000f6;ber</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pekrun</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>Advances in test anxiety research[J]</article-title>. <source>Anxiety, Stress &#x00026; Coping</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>volume 17</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>205</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>11</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0191779.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Liebert</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cognitive and Emotional Components of Anxiety: A Distinction and some Initial Data[J]</article-title>. <source>Psychological Reports</source>. <year>1967</year>;<volume>20</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>975</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975">10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975</ext-link></comment>
