Female Sprague-Dawley rats (60 &#x000b1; 5 g) were randomly assigned to two groups and provided control diets (control group) or isoflavone-supplemented diet (IF group, 57.8 mg isoflavones/100 g diet) for 9 weeks in growing female rats. Measurements of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Bone Mineral Content (BMC) on the experimental animals were executed in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> weeks. In result, there was no significant difference in spine BMD between the isoflavones supplemented group and the control group. But, the IF group tended to have higher BMD than the control group in between 3 and 9 experimental weeks, and the striking difference could be shown in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding. In case of femur BMD, the effects of added isoflavones appeared in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding, and it became intensified in the 9<sup>th</sup> week of feeding to the extent that the BMD in the IF group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). In conclusion, isoflavone supplementation increased spine BMD per weight in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding, and affected the increase of femur BMD in the 9<sup>th</sup> week. The result of the experiment implies that it affects positively the formation of spine and femur BMD of growing female rats. The study also suggests that the effects of isoflavone on the pattern of BMD formation might differ from the parts of bones.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Isoflavones</kwd><kwd>growing female rat</kwd><kwd>bone mineral density (BMD)</kwd><kwd>bone mineral content (BMC)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that the low incidence of osteoporosis and heart diseases caused by estrogen deficiency in Asian women is attributable to their high intake of soy foods, compared with American and Finnish women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Adlercreutz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Brandi, 1997</xref>). It is reported that dietary soybean proteins prevent bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arjmandi et al., 1996</xref>). Possible candidates for the beneficial substances present in soybeans are isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Ishimi et al., 1999</xref>). Isoflavones are estrogen-like substances structurally and functionally similar to 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Knight &#x00026; Eden, 1996</xref>). On the basis of evidence primarily from animal and in vitro studies, isoflavones are thought to exert both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects, depending on the tissue in which they act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Makela et al., 1994</xref>). Isoflavones may exert a weak antagonistic effect on the estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Makela et al., 1994</xref>), thereby having an antiestrogenic effect on uterine and breast tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Santell et al., 1994</xref>), where excess estrogen may stimulate synthesis. Alternatively, isoflavones may combine with the estrogen receptor, albeit with lower affinity than 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Miksicek, 1994</xref>), and stimulate estrogen activity, thus having an estrogenic effect on bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Makela et al., 1994</xref>) and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Schonherr et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Eriksen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Oursler et al., 1991</xref>) have shown that phytoestrogen has a higher binding affinity to estrogen receptor-&#x003b2; than to estrogen receptor-&#x003b1;. It is suggested that the possibility of isoflavones having a tissue-selective effect is high, since isoflavones may function more selectively on such organs as the thyroid gland, bones and blood vessels, where estrogen receptor-&#x003b2; is highly dispersed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kuiper et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Some <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have suggested that isoflavones may have anti-estrogenic effects and estrogenic effects at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jayagopal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Lees &#x00026; Ginn, 1998</xref>). The studies report that isoflavones may not be good for growing and young women, for they would reduce the activation of endogenous estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jayagopal et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>On the contrary, according to some recent studies, isoflavone intake in infancy through soy-based infant formulas may have positive effects in the long term, as it may prevent hormone-dependent diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, etc. that can be developed in the latter part of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Setchel et al., 1998</xref>). Disputes over the theory still remain unsettled, though. There is no concrete result on whether or not the isoflavones found in soy protein cause a decline in bone density, or osteoporosis. There is little evidence of the mechanism, either. Since most previous studies on isoflavones focused on the features and effects of isoflavones that are similar to those of estrogen, the target of the experiments were pre- or post-menopausal women and ovariectomized animals.</p><p>It has been rarely studied if isoflavones have positive or negative effects on growing and young women. Whatever studies have been conducted has shown no significant results yet. The most important risk factor of the occurrence of osteoporosis is low peak bone mass and rapid rates of bone loss. As such, mitigation of the risk of fracture is dependent on an increase in the peak bone mass and thereafter, on minimization of bone loss.</p><p>This study was focused on whether or not isoflavones-supplementation affects the increase in bone mineral density of growing females. To examine the effects of isoflavones, we provided isoflavone which is extracted from soy for 9 weeks to growing female rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals and diets</title><p>Female Sprague-Dawley rats (60 &#x000b1; 5 g) were bought from KLEC (Korea Life Engineering Co., Seoul, Korea).

In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Choi &#x00026; Cho, 2003</xref>), both soy isolate and soy concentrate groups showed significantly lower in FER than casein group. This indicates that there is no difference in FER according to isoflavone intake groups but varies according to protein sources.</p><p>In this study, the spine BMD of control group showed 0.0992 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (3<sup>rd</sup> weeks), 0.1247 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (6<sup>th</sup> weeks), and 0.1469 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (9<sup>th</sup> weeks). The spine BMD in male rats of similar weeks of ages was reported 0.15 g/cm<sup>2</sup> in the study of Chae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2002</xref>). The result is much similar to that of this study, 0.1469 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. This study observed how and how much soy protein which contains high isoflavones and isoflavones itself affected spine BMD and BMC in the growing female rats. One of our findings are that the increased rate of spine BMD in the week of 3 to 6 was much higher than in the week of 6 to 9 after feeding.</p><p>Especially, spine BMD increase of the IF group in the week 3 to 6 (0.0302 g/ cm<sup>2</sup>) was 37.4% more than that in the week 6 to 9 (0.0189 g/cm<sup>2</sup>). In general, SD species white rats ovulate regularly after 8 weeks of age and secrete estrogen stably after 13 weeks of age. In regarding this, since the secretion of estrogen was relatively low in between the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of experiment (8~9 weeks of age) and the 6<sup>th</sup> week of experiment (11~12 weeks of age), the effects of isoflavones can be effective in spine that has more trabecula bone than femur. According to the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Choi &#x00026; Cho, 2003</xref>) that reported the effects of soy protein on the BMD of growing female rats by adding same amounts of isoflavones as in this study, the spine BMD in the isoflavones-supplemented group in the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of experiment was significantly higher than that of casein group. The result of the former group was significantly higher in the 6<sup>th</sup> week as well, but not statistically significant in the 9<sup>th</sup> week.</p><p>The pattern of increasing spine BMD is similar to the previous study that supplemented isoflavones-abundant soy protein, but the extent of the effects on spine BMD increase is not identical. Isoflavones-abundant soy protein affected the increase of spine BMD than extracted isoflavones did, and the difference with the control group was bigger. Considering IF group affects spine BMD relatively weak, the isoflavones effect on spine BMD seems not only by isoflavones itself.</p><p>Compared this study with previous animal studies on the level of BMD, which measured by PIXImus on male rats of similar weeks of ages in this study, the result of femur BMD was 0.23 g/cm<sup>2</sup> and BMC was 0.54 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Chae, 2002</xref>). The level is somewhat higher than those of this study measured on female rats. Femur BMD and BMC measured by DEXA on male rats in 4 weeks of age were reported as 0.25-0.26 g/cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.37-0.49 g, respectively. Griffin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1993</xref>) reported that the femur BMD of the SD species white rats in 2~8 weeks of age was 0.30<sup>~</sup>0.32 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. With regard to those results, BMD of the experimental animals mostly relies on the week of ages of the samples and the kinds of measurements.</p><p>The study observed periodically, classified by diet, the effects of isoflavones-abundant soy protein and isoflavones on femur BMD and BMC in growing age. The femur BMD in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> week had no significant difference between the two groups. In the 9<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding, since the increase rate of femur BMD had become higher, IF group tended to have bigger femur BMD than other groups. However, the increase of BMD in IF group became much higher after 9 weeks of feeding, and the difference from control group becomes significant. between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding.</p><p>The growth patterns of spine BMD and femur BMD in the 9<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding have some differences. While the difference between the two experimental groups in spine BMD was not significant, IF group in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding tended to have higher level, and the gap between the two groups was the biggest in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding. In case of femur BMD, the effects of isoflavones supplementing appeared in the 6<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding, and the effects was intensified in the 9<sup>th</sup> weeks of feeding to the extent that femur BMD in the IF group became significantly higher than that in the control group. As a result, the effects of isoflavones on BMD were different according to bone parts. The diet effects of the extracted isoflavones from soybean tend to come out earlier in spine that has more plentiful of trabecula bone than femur. Compared with cortical bone, trabecula bone has more active metabolism, so easily affected by metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Pruitrt et al., 1992</xref>). Spine has more trabecula bone than cortical bone, while femur contains cortical bone more than 3 times than that of spine. That is why spine that has more trabecula bone is affected earlier than femur by isoflavones diet. Similar result was reported in the previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Choi &#x00026; Cho, 2003</xref>) that provided soy isolate with rich isoflavones for growing female rats as well. It is also similar to the changing patterns in spine and femur between the previous study and this study.</p><p>The effects of soy isoflavones diet are also changed according to the period of diet intake. Previous epidemiological research showed that current diet amount of soy isoflavones affects spine BMD, but does not femoral neck and trochanter. On the other hand, the whole life diet amount of it significantly affects femoral neck, but not significantly affects spine, even though as diet amounts increase as the spine BMD high. However, since the study has reported that it does not affect trochanter, we can imply that same period of diet even its effects vary with regard to the bone parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Rice, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Isoflavones' effect of protecting bone on pre-menopausal women who have enough estrogen varies to authors. Ho et al who has studied Hong Kong-resident Chinese women reported that diets of soybean for pre-menopausal women in the age of 30~40 brought about significant effect on spine BMD. Meanwhile, a massive size of epidemiological research on Chinese females in the age of 18~86 showed contrary results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Mei et al., 2001</xref>). The study reported that isoflavones diet affected BMD for post-menopausal women, but it had little to do with pre-menopausal women. Greendale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2002</xref>) who studied Asian American women presented that genistein diets affected spine and femur BMD for pre-menopausal women, but no relevance to post-menopausal women.</p><p>Comparing with other study results might be difficult, since there are not much previous studies on growing female rats. But there are some relevant studies. Providing growing male rats with soy protein that contains isoflavones increased calcium efficiency on spine and femur BMD to a higher level than casein group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jung, 1995</xref>). It is also reported that supplementing casein diet group of the growing male rats with isoflavones increases spine and femur BMD per weight level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Chae, 2002</xref>). It implies that soy protein or isoflavones should be beneficial to bone. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Choi &#x00026; Cho, 2003</xref>) reported that isoflavones-rich soy protein should be beneficial to the formation of spine and femur BMD on growing female rats.</p><p>In summary, there was no significant difference in spine BMD between the IF group and the control group. But the IF group tended to have higher BMD than the control group in 6<sup>th</sup> week and 9<sup>th</sup> week of feeding and the striking difference could be shown in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding. Spine BMD increase of the IF group in the week 3 to 6 after feeding was 37.4% more than that in the week 6 to 9 after feeding. In femur BMD, the effects of adding isoflavones appeared in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding, and it became intensified in the 9<sup>th</sup> week of feeding to the extent that the BMD in the IF group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, isoflavone supplementation increased spine BMD per weight in the 6<sup>th</sup> week of feeding, and affected the increase of femur BMD in the 9<sup>th</sup> week. The result of the experiment implies that it affects positively the formation of spine and femur BMD of growing female rats. The study also can suggest that the effects of isoflavone on the pattern of BMD formation might differ from the parts of bones.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
