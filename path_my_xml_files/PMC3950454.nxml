It may lead to serious post-operative complications. Ramosetron is a newer 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and has more potent and longer duration of antiemetic effects compared to first generation 5HT3 receptor antagonists. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of Ramosetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting with that of Ondansetron in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind study, 60 patients, 18-60 years of both genders falling under ASA I-II category scheduled for abdominal surgery were included. Group I received I.V ramosetron 0.3 mg while group II received I.V Ondansetron 4 mg at the time of extubation. The standard general anesthetic technique was used throughout. Postoperatively the incidences of nausea, vomiting, and safety assessments were performed at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h during the first 24 h after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There were no differences between groups with respect to patient demographics. The percentage of patients who had complete response (no PONV, and no need for another rescue antiemetic) from 0 to 24 h after anesthesia was 56% with ramosetron and 33% with ondansetron. The corresponding rates at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after anesthesia were 76% and 63%, 76% and 50%, 100 and 83%, 100 and 93%, respectively. Safety profiles of the two drugs were comparable, as no clinically serious adverse effects caused by study drugs were observed in either of the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our study concludes that prophylactic therapy with ramosetron is highly efficacious than ondansetron in preventing PONV in patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>General anesthesia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>ondansetron</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>postoperative nausea</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>post-operative vomiting</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>ramosetron</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most unpleasant and distressing symptom associated with anesthesia and surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The overall incidence of emetic sequelae after a balanced anesthesia remains between 20 and 30%, approaching 70% in patients in certain high risk categories.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] With the change in emphasis from an inpatient to outpatient hospital care there has been increased interest in the &#x0201c;big little problem&#x0201d; of PONV.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] PONV is a continuing concern in surgical patients and the management of this problem is still confusing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Patients often perceive PONV as one of the most bothersome peri-operative complication and may consider it as distressing as the pain associated with the surgical procedure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Development of effective antiemetic therapy has been hampered by the multifactorial nature of PONV.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Of the many different modes of intervention to prevent PONV, antiemetic drugs play an important role in therapy of PONV. Metoclopramide, domperidone, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, anticholinergics, and antihistamines are the commonly used drugs to prevent PONV. Presently, there is no single PONV antiemetic medication or technique that is 100% effective for all patients[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and a search for better drug continues.</p><p>The management of nausea and vomiting has improved greatly in recent years, with the introduction of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) &#x02013; receptor antagonists, which are widely regarded as most efficacious antiemetics available today and are currently recommended as the agents of first choice to control nausea and vomiting in most instances.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Ramosetron is a potent and selective 5-hydroxytryptermine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting, associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and post-operative vomiting.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Ondansetron is also a serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. It reduces the activity of the vagus nerve, which deactivates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata, and also blocks serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The present study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of prophylactic ondansetron and ramosetron on the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing elective/emergency abdominal surgery under general anesthesia and to assess the requirement of rescue anti emetics in the post-operative period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent, the present study was conducted in 60 ASA physical status I and II hospitalized patients in the age group of 18 to 60 years who were scheduled for major abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia during the period January 2011 to June 2012. Patients having gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, such as hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal regurgitation disorder, peptic ulcer disease, and autonomic dysfunction disorder were excluded from the study also excluded were pregnant, lactating women, patients with renal, hepatic, neurological impairment, patients who had received any antiemetic medication within 24 h prior to surgery, patients with history of motion sickness, PONV in previous surgery, history of vomiting, and or Ryle's tube in situ in the last 24 h.</p><p>Subjects were randomized to the two groups by using random number tables. Group I received ramosetron 0.3 mg IV and Group II received ondansetron 4 mg IV before extubation.</p><p>Sample size of 54 was calculated by nMaster software which was estimated to give 80% power to the study with a &#x003b1; error of 5%, <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Considering 10% as the dropout rate, 60 patients were recruited for the study.</p><p>Preoperative visit was conducted one day before surgery. Detailed history of patient's complaints was noted. General and systemic examination of cardiovascular and respiratory systems was done.</p><p>Basic laboratory investigations, hemoglobin level, total count and differential count, urine routine, and screening of chest X-ray, ECG, blood urea, and serum creatinine were evaluated prior to surgery. Patients were advised to remain nil orally for 8 h.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthesia</title><p>All patients were premedicated with ranitidine 50 mg I.V 2 h before the procedure and glycopyrollate 5 mcg/kg. General anesthesia (GA) was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg), intubated with succinyl choline (2 mg/kg), with endotracheal tube of size (7.0/7.5/8.0/8.5). Maintained with fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) and atracurium loading dose of (0.5 mg/kg) and maintenance dose of (0.1 mg/kg), N<sub>2</sub> O:O<sub>2</sub> :5:3 and inhalational agents. At the end of the surgery after thorough oral suctioning, reversal was done with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) glycopyrollate (10 mcg/kg) and before extubating Ramosetron (0.3 mg i.v) was given in group-I and ondansetron (4 mg i.v) in group-II patients and then extubated.</p><p>Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were monitored intraoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h. Postoperative analgesia was provided with diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscularly for mild pain and repeated every 8 h if mild pain persisted; tramadol 100 mg in 100 ml of normal saline by slow i.v infusion for moderate to severe pain and repeated every 8 h if moderate pain persisted.</p><p>Nausea was defined as a subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit. It was graded as 0, 1, 2, 3 indicating none, mild, moderate, and severe, respectively, which was assessed retrospectively by verbal rating scale (VRS).</p><p>An emetic episode was defined as forceful expulsion of GI contents through the mouth. Repeated vomiting within 1 -2 min period was recorded as a single episode. No emesis was taken as complete control, 1 episode as Partial control, &#x0003e;1 episode or receipt of rescue antiemetic as failure of prophylaxis.</p><p>PONV numerical score of Grade 0 indicated no nausea/vomiting, Grade 1 as nausea only, Grade 2 as vomiting once, and Grade 3 as vomiting more than once. Complete response (CR) was defined as no nausea, vomiting, and no need for rescue antiemetic. Ramosetron 0.3 mg i.v. was given as rescue antiemetic in case of vomiting episode more than once and in moderate-severe nausea in both groups. Patients were assessed for incidence of nausea, vomiting, and other side effects at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h postoperatively.</p><p>Simplified risk score from Apfel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was used to predict the risk for PONV.

There was no difference in hemodynamic changes between the two groups as compared to preoperative value, both during intraoperative and postoperative period. The postoperative pain scores and requirement of analgesic were essentially comparable without any significant difference between the groups. The study done by Fujii <italic>et al</italic>. on 120 women undergoing gynaecological surgeries concluded that ramosetron was more effective than ondansetron in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Suh <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that prophylactic therapy with ramosetron is effective and severity of post-operative nausea and vomiting was less compared to ondansetron in early post-operative period.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In our study, grade 0 nausea was observed in 40 and 66% subjects in group I and group II, respectively. Postoperative nausea scores were lower in the ramosetron group than the ondansetron group at all the times till 24 h but the scores did not achieve statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea between the two groups both in early and late postoperative period. When the severity of nausea was compared between the two groups, they were found to be significantly less in ramosetron group than in ondansetron group. When major nausea episodes were considered (Score of 2 or more), significantly less number of patients in group I had major nausea (13% in group I and 40% in group II, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In our study, 88% patients in group I were emesis free while in group II 72% patients experienced no emesis.

This difference was seen to be statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Severity of vomiting was also found to be less in group I than in group II. One patient of group I had more than 1 emetic episode, while four patients of group II had this, which is highly significant statistically. A total of 33% of Group II patients had early emesis and only 10% had late emesis whereas in group I corresponding values were 10 and 0%, respectively.

Incidence of vomiting during first 2 h was significantly high in ondansetron group than in ramosetron group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Incidence of major vomiting (&#x0003e;1 episode) was also significantly high in group II (13%) compared to group I (3%). Use of ramosetron led to better control of both early (&#x0003c;2 hour) and late (2-24 h) nausea. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic changes (heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate), and incidence of side effects between the two groups (except for mild headache, dizziness, drowsiness). No serious adverse events were observed in either of the groups. We conclude that prophylactic therapy with ramosetron is highly efficacious and safe than ondansetron in preventing PONV in patients undergoing abdominal surgery with general anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Support and acknowledgement</bold>: Dr. N.
