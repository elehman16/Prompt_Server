therapeutic exercise program for elite athletes diagnosed as having patellofemoral pain
syndrome (PFPS). [Subjects] The subjects were 34 elite athletes from the Seoul T Center.
They were randomly allocated to three groups: an elastic band exercise group (EBG), a
sling exercise group (SEG), or a control group (CG). [Methods] Therapeutic exercises were
performed 3 times a week for 8 weeks. The visual analogue scale (VAS) hamstring length,
and static and dynamic Q angles were used to test the exercise effect of the exercises, as
well as the onset time of electromyographic activity of vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and
vastus lateralis (VL). [Results] Decrease of the dynamic Q-angle in EBG was significant
and significantly greater than that in CG. The decrease in VAS in SEG was significant and
significantly greater than that in CG. There were significant differences in the VL and
VMO activity onset times in SEG between pre- and post-test, and their differences between
pre- and post-test were also significantly different. [Conclusion] Weight-bearing
therapeutic exercise is hoped that clinicians will use this information for better
implementation of effective exercise methods for elite athletes with PFPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyographic onset time</kwd><kwd>Patellofemoral pain syndrome</kwd><kwd>Q-angle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patellofemoral joint pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the most common pathologic conditions
of the knee in sports medicine<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
well documented that female athletes are more likely than male athletes to suffer with
PFPS<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFPS can be caused by a variety
of factors, including quadriceps weakness, increased Q-angle, loss of lower extremity
function, hypermobile patella, ligamentous laxity, and lateral retinaculum tightness<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Onset of symptoms is usually insidious and
may occur bilaterally. Specific activities, such as prolonged sitting, stair descent and
squatting often aggravate the pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also,
one of the most commonly accepted etiologies of PFPS is abnormal tracking of the patella
within the femoral trochlea<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A cause of
this abnormal tracking may be delayed muscle activity onset time of the vastus medialis
oblique (VMO) relative to the vastus lateralis (VL)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the past, the patellofemoral joint has been regarded as the main problem of PFPS.
However, a recent study demonstrated that poor hip adduction and internal rotation control
during weight-bearing activities were related to PFPS in athletes due to weakness of the hip
abductor and external rotator muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Other studies have reported significant improvements in hip abduction and lateral rotation
strength. These reports suggest that improving pain and hip lateral rotator and abductor
muscle strength improves the function of patients with patellofemoral pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many therapeutic exercises emphasize the importance of the VMO muscle because of its medial
pull on the patella<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
investigated the effect of a rehabilitation program on the activity timing of the VMO
relative to the VL using a McConnell-based rehabilitation program<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, Boling et al. demonstrated effects of a
weight-bearing rehabilitation program on pain, electromyographic activity, and function in
subjects with PFPS<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weight-bearing exercises are more functional than non-weight-bearing exercises because they
need multi-joint movement, facilitate functional movement of muscle recruitment, and
stimulate proprioceptors<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
evidence has been provided that during weight-bearing activities, altered patellofemoral
tracking may be the result of the femur rotating medially beneath the patella, rather than
the patella moving laterally on the femur<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of these advantages, weight-bearing exercises are
recommended for the rehabilitation of PFPS<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the actual study of weight-bearing exercises performed by
elite athletes with PFPS is insufficient. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
investigate the effects of a weight-bearing rehabilitation program for elite athletes with
PFPS through changes in the visual analogue scale, static and dynamic Q-angles, and the
electromyographic onset timing of the VMO and VL muscles. We hypothesized that after 8
weeks, the weight-bearing rehabilitation program groups would demonstrate greater
improvement in static and dynamic Q-angles, and electromyographic onset timing of the VMO
and VL muscles than the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 34 (21 men, 13 women) track and field hockey elite athletes from Seoul T
center. The criteria used for the diagnosis of PFPS were based on those used in other PFPS
studies: diagnosis of PFPS by a medical doctor<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>; and at least two of the following activities exacerbated their
symptoms: prolonged sitting, ascending or descending stairs, squatting, and kneeling.
Exclusion criteria were unregulated neurological impairment, knee surgery in the past
2&#x02005;years, or acquired structural or functional lower limb failures, such as systemic
arthritis ligamentous knee injury. This study used a randomized pre- and post-test, three
group design. Subjects randomly allocated to a sling exercise group (n=11, SEG), elastic
band exercise group (n=13, EBG), or control group (n=10, CG). All 34 elite athletes
completed the intervention. The randomization was generated by a computer using a basic
random number generator. Prior to subjects&#x02019; participation, all the procedures were explained
to them and each subject provided his/her written informed consent to participation. This
study was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>In the training course, the therapeutic exercises of SEG and EBG were performed 3 times a
week (30&#x02005;min) for 8 weeks. Each therapeutic exercise program included a warm-up (stationary
bike, 10&#x02005;min), exercise program (SEG or EBG with weight-bearing, 20&#x02005;min), and cool-down
(hamstring self-stretching, 5&#x02005;min). Therapeutic exercise programs were performed one-on-one
with a physical therapist. The details of both therapeutic exercise programs are described

Korea) was used to measure the body weight and body mass index (BMI). A 10&#x02005;cm visual
analogue scale (10&#x02005;cm &#x02212; VAS) was used pre- and post-test to assess pain and discomfort
during stair-climbing, descending stairs, squatting, and long sitting. The static Q-angle of
the standing position and dynamic Q-angle of coming down the stairs were also measured. All
participants had their anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS), tibial tubercles and midpoint
of their patella marked bilaterally by the same examiner<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static and dynamic Q-angles for the standing position were
measured on digital images of the subjects captured by a digital video camera (SONY,
DCR-SR300, Japan). The camera was positioned on a tripod 2&#x02005;m away from the subjects, with
the camera height set to each individual&#x02019;s patella height. The angles were calculated using
Dartfish software (Prosuit 4.2, Switzerland). The muscle activity onset time of the VMO and
VL muscles while subjects descended stairs was measured by surface EMG (Pocket EMG, BTS,
Italy). The electrode (Norotrode, 20TM Bipolar, USA) for the VMO was placed approximately
4&#x02005;cm superior to and 3&#x02005;cm medial to the superomedial border of the patella and oriented 55&#x000b0;
to the long axis of the femur<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
electrode for VL was placed approximately 10&#x02005;cm superior and 7&#x02005;cm lateral to the superior
border of the patella and oriented 15&#x000b0; to the long axis of the femur<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS ver. 12.0 statistical software was used for all analyses. Descriptive statistics were
used to describe patient characteristics after confirming the data was normally distributed.
Comparisons of all groups&#x02019; general characteristics were performed using the independent
t-test or the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Pre- and post-data were analyzed using the paired t-test
the within to test differences groups and one-way ANOVA to test differences among the
groups. Scheffe&#x02019;s post hoc test was used to test the significance of differences between the
groups.

Q-angle, and altered VL and VMO onset timing differences after the weight-bearing
therapeutic exercise program which lasted for 8 weeks.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that the elite athletes with PFPS had decreased pain in
EBG and SEG. Specifically, SEG showed a significant decrease in VAS compared to CG. A
previous study demonstrated that a weight-bearing rehabilitation program effectively
decreased pain and increased the function of subjects with PFPS<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study showed that when osteoarthritic patients
with tolerable pain perform a weight-bearing training, it might be better to begin with
non-weight-bearing exercise, and progressively shift to partial weight-bearing, followed by
full weight-bearing exercise<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Q-angle is frequently cited as a possible predictor of knee problems and lower limb
injuries. Abnormally high Q-angles (more than 15&#x000b0; for males and 20&#x000b0; for females) are
regarded as an anatomical risk factor in the etiology of overuse injuries of the knee<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stefanyshyn et al. reported that
increased knee abduction impulses should be deemed as risk factors that play a role in the
development of PFPS in track athletes. Similarly, decreased strength of the hip abductors
has been associated with increased knee joint medial displacement, which may be associated
with an increased Q-angle in a unilateral stance<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, weight-bearing exercise with an elastic band
significantly decreased the Q-angle compared to CG. A previous study demonstrated that
exercise with an elastic band was an effective tool for performing weight-bearing exercise
closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Our results suggest that weight-bearing elastic band CKC increased muscle strength, and
improved muscle alignment and motor control of the knee during functional activities.</p><p>In this study, electromyography (EMG) was used to determine the change of muscle activity
onset time of VL and differences of muscle activity onset time between VMO and VL due to the
performance of weight-bearing exercises. The muscle activity onset times of VMO and VL in
EBG and SEG were not significantly different from CG. However, the post-test muscle activity
onset time of VL in SEG was significantly different from its pre-test value (p &#x0003c; 0.01),
and the differences in the muscle activity onset times of VMO and VL in EBG and SEG were
significantly different between pre- and post-test (EBG; p &#x0003c; 0.01, SEG; p &#x0003c; 0.05).
Researchers have stated that VMO should activate earlier than, or at the same time as, the
VL because a delay in VMO activation may laterally move the patella and result in PFPS<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study demonstrated that as
little as a 5&#x02005;ms delay in VMO activation may cause a lateral increase in the compressive
forces on the patella-femoral joint<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
One study conducting a weight-bearing rehabilitation program reported that patients with
PFPS had altered VL and VMO onset timing differences after a McConnell-based rehabilitation
program. Bolling et al. showed that weight-bearing exercises performed by subjects with PFPS
(squatting, descent or ascent phase of the stair-stepping task, elastic band exercise)
resulted in significant differences in VL and VMO onset times<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the present study had some differences from these
previous studies. The results of the present study show that the VL onset time of the elite
athletes was shorter than that of normal adults.</p><p>Despite demonstrating of the effectiveness of weight-bearing therapeutic exercise on the
Q-angle and muscle activity of the elite athletes with PFPS, this study had some
limitations. First, the statistical power was not calculated and only a small number of
subjects were recruited. Second, because participants consisted of only track and field
hockey athletes, the results of this study cannot be generalized to all elite athletes with
PFPS. Therefore, we suggest that further studies include a variety of athletes with
PFPS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cerny</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Vastus medialis oblique/vastus lateralis muscle activity
