Friction has been defined as the resistance to motion that occurs when two objects move tangentially to each other.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Friction, which impedes sliding movements, is determined by multiplying the coefficient of friction of the materials in contact by the normal force, which is the force of ligation in orthodontic appliance. Therefore, friction is directly proportional to the force of ligation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] An ideal ligation system for alleviation of crowding in orthodontic treatment primarily should ensure full bracket engagement of the arch wire and should exhibit low friction between brackets and arch wire.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Currently, two main types of brackets are available for practicing orthodontists-conventional (CL) and self-ligating (SL) brackets. In a conventional tie wing bracket, wire ligatures and elastomeric ligatures have been documented with higher frictional forces, which reach undesirable levels relative to those that are ideal for tooth movement.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] SL brackets are considered a ligature-less bracket system with an inbuilt metal labial face, which provides the combination of low friction and full arch wire engagement. Two types of SL brackets have been developed: Active and Passive.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The claimed advantages of both types of SL bracket systems include increased patient comfort due to the absence of ligatures, improved oral hygiene, less chair time, and shorter overall treatment time.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, there are also certain disadvantages, including difficulty with the full expression of torque, frequent failure of the clips, and brackets that are bulkier and more expensive than conventional brackets.</p><p>To address some deficiencies of SL brackets, novel ligatures such as the Leone slide ligature (LL) have recently been developed. Leone slide ligatures (LL) have been developed with a polyurethane fourth wall, which allows the arch wire to slide freely in the slot while transmitting its full force to the tooth.</p><p>Several retrospective[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and prospective[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies have compared the efficiency of SL and CL brackets during various stages of treatment, reporting no significant differences during initial alignment.

Pre-treatment study models were evaluated by using Little's irregularity index[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to quantify the alignment of 6 mandibular anterior teeth. Mandibular dental casts and lateral cephalograms were taken at appliance placement (T<sub>1</sub>) and on the alignment date (T<sub>2</sub>) when the patient was considered complete after 1 month of working 0.016 &#x000d7; 0.022 stainless steel archwires and upon visual inspection of the correction of proximal contacts.</p><p>The time to alignment (T2 - T1) was calculated for each patient in days. Extraction space (T1) was measured from the closest points on the adjacent teeth before extraction. The mesiodistal widths of the teeth to be extracted were not used because they were often displaced from the arch form; this decreased the extraction space to be closed. Similarly, extraction spaces at (T2) were measured from the closest points on the crowns of the teeth on either side of the extraction space.</p><p>Coded lateral cephalograms were traced, and mandibular incisal inclination was assessed for all patients at T1 and T2 using the angular measurement: Mandibular incisor to mandibular plane. Each patient model was numbered for identification. Wax was applied to cover the bracket on each model before measurement. Therefore, the researcher was blinded to patient's name, the ligation type during data collection to minimize systematic error. The study models were measured with digital calipers (Digimatic NTD 12-6&#x0201d;C, Mitutoyo Corp, Tokyo, Japan). All model and cephalometric measurements were measured by the researcher.</p><p>To assess the intra-examiner reliability, 15 plaster models and 15 cephalometric radiographs were randomly selected from the records. The cephalometric radiographs were retraced, and the measurements of the cephalometric variables were repeated. In the dental casts, the extraction spaces were re-measured.

The results of this study emphasize the clinical relevance of the <italic>in-vitro</italic> assessment of frictional protocols in many studies[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] during the past decade, which has often demonstrated a significant decrease in friction with SL systems compared with CL brackets designs, which is highly desirable during the initial alignment phase. This observation could be attributed to the substantial greater free play of the SL appliances in contrast to the conventional ligatures that act as obstacles because of the stress they exert on the arch wire adjacent to the bracket sides, precluding the free sliding of the wire into the slot walls, thus reducing the rate of tooth movement. Our findings have demonstrated ASL performing better than the PSL system with respect to the treatment time to alignment, but the difference was statistically insignificant. The possible explanation behind this observation could be due to the storage of some of the force in the active clip as well as in the wire with ASL brackets, which means a given wire will have its range of labiolingual action increased and, therefore, produce more alignment than would a passive slide with the same wire. In sufficiently lingually placed tooth with an active spring clip in relation to its neighboring teeth, a higher total force will usually be applied to the tooth in comparison to a passive clip. But, such force is unlikely to be detrimental with modern low modulus wires since several studies[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have shown that only large deflections are likely to enable a superelastic wire to show a plateau of force for a range of deflection, which is unlikely to happen with passive self-ligation.</p><p>LL group was significantly more efficient from the CL group but was comparably inferior to the ASL group in terms of treatment time to alignment. The results are in accordance with an <italic>in-vitro</italic> study[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in the past, which states that SL systems and Leone slide ligatures on conventional brackets produce significantly lower frictional forces compared with conventional ligatures.</p><p>Passive space closure, incisal proclination, and dental arch expansion have been considered as contributing factors for alleviation of crowding during orthodontic arch alignment.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] However, studies have reported intentional development of the arch width, with appliance systems has been found to be highly unpredictable.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Hence, we, in our study, have abstained from evaluating the transverse arch dimensions.</p><p>The present study reflected a significant advantage of SL systems over CL systems with respect to passive space closure with less extraction space to close actively in SL category, which could eventually reduce the overall treatment time. The results demonstrate an identical performance between LL and PSL groups, PSL and ASL groups, while the ASL groups had significantly increased passive space closure in comparison to LL groups. The results concur with a previous study,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which suggested that SL brackets might encourage passive space closure during initial alignment. However, Ong <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in their study found no difference in the amount of passive space closure during initial alignment between the bracket types.</p><p>Mandibular incisal inclination during initial alignment was significantly influenced by the bracket system with SL brackets resulting in significantly lesser incisal proclination. The results suggest that CL appliances resolve crowding more through an incisal proclination while SL brackets relieve crowding by facilitating more passive space closure. This phenomenon with SL brackets would help in preventing the torque loss during the initial alignment, prevent round tripping of the anterior teeth, thus minimizing root resorption and would greatly minimize the net effective anchorage loss during the overall treatment time of an individual.</p><p>To summarize, SL systems (PSL, ASL) had a significant measurable advantage over CL systems (ELL, SSL) with respect to the three variables: (a) reduction in treatment time to alignment, (b) increased passive space closure, and (c) decrease in incisal proclination. LL system was comparatively beneficial over CL systems but inferior to ASL systems and with an insignificant difference from PSL systems. The study showed an insignificant difference in the clinical performance between ELL, SSL in conventional, while ASL performed significantly superior to PSL system in SL groups.</p><p>The results of our study, however, differ with previous studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in the rapidity of alignment, amount of passive space closure, and mandibular incisal inclination. The difference could be explained by the variability of bracket designs utilized in SL and CL appliances with their characteristic prescriptions, variability in arch form, arch wire sequence, and final working arch wires. Certain studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have compared Damon2, Damon3 PSL brackets with a 0.019 &#x000d7; 0.025-inch working stainless steel arch wire to CL systems with MBT prescription (Victory Series, 3M Unitek). A thicker wire of 0.019 &#x000d7; 0.025-inch is likely to completely fill the slot contributing to an increase in friction as well as torque effectiveness, thereby increasing the time to alignment with SL systems when the arch wire sequence is carried on till the 0.019 &#x000d7; 0.025-inch stainless steel working arch wire. In studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that had 0.014 &#x000d7; 0.025-inch copper-nickel-titanium Damon arch form wherein measurements are taken, the lack of significant difference could be attributed to the high torque version of Damon MX that increases the frictional resistance at the bracket slot arch wire interface. In addition, narrower bracket design of Damon 3MX can increase the contact angle and contribute to elastic binding and notching with wires of higher dimension and stiffness. In our study, we have standardized MBT prescription, arch forms, and arch sequence to all the 5 ligation groups with measurements taken at the end of a 0.016 &#x000d7; 0.022-inch stainless steel working arch wire. A 0.016 &#x000d7; 0.022-inch wire would create a slop of 0.005-inch, which reduces the frictional resistance in all the ligation groups and thereby could enhance the alignment efficiency of active spring clip and passive SL systems through a more passive space closure and lesser incisal inclination. For majority of bracket arch wire combinations, the friction values obtained were significantly higher than with only the terminal brackets ligated, confirming that ligation plays an important role in generating friction.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>The strength of the study was standardization of clinical variables such as bracket composition, dimension, prescription, arch wire type, arch wire sequence, inter-appointment intervals, category of dento-alveolar malocclusion and extraction pattern. Consecutive eligible patients were included to minimize confounding variables with method of ligation being the critical difference between treatment groups. Despite the strict inclusion, exclusion criteria, and standardization of the clinical variables, a major limitation with the study is the sampling bias with a low initial sample size recruited into the study although lost to follow up was minimal. The aim of a randomized clinical trial is to provide an unbiased assessment of the effects of a treatment intervention. A small sample size could eventually lead to a random error that can arise when the results of the clinical trial could be different from the truth. In small trials, the probability of reporting a clinically important effect due to chance is relatively higher and the effects of random error on the estimates decreases as the trial becomes larger. Hence, a similar study with a larger sample size is needed in future to minimize the random error that could be associated with the present study. The results of this RCT suggest that clinicians can appreciate the effectiveness of SL systems when used with undersized wires. This situation, however, could be negated as treatment progresses and wires of higher dimension and stiffness are engaged in the brackets. Treatment efficiency is the product of many mechanical and biological factors. Along with individual biological variation, bracket type can significantly influence the treatment efficiency and overall treatment span in orthodontic mechanotherapy.</p></sec><sec
