goats in order to evaluate the properties of gastric emptying. Acetaminophen was
intravenously and orally administered at 30 mg/kg body weight to goats using a crossover
design with a 3-week washout period. The stability of acetaminophen in rumen juice was
also assessed. Acetaminophen concentrations were measured by HPLC. Since acetaminophen was
stable in rumen juice for 24 hr, the extremely low bioavailability (16%) was attributed to
its hepatic extensive first-pass effect. The mean absorption time and absorption half-life
were unexpectedly short (4.93 and 3.35 hr, respectively), indicating its marked absorption
from the forestomach, which may have been due to its smaller molecular weight. Therefore,
acetaminophen was considered to be unsuitable for evaluating gastric emptying in Shiba
goats.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetaminophen</kwd><kwd>gastric emptying</kwd><kwd>goat</kwd><kwd>oral absorption</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Although the entire gastrointestinal tract is capable of drug absorption, the main site of
absorption of orally administered drugs is the proximal part of the gut. Several factors have
been shown to influence the absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, with the
gastric emptying rate being identified as important [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The rate of gastric emptying determines the time taken
to reach the absorption site, and thus, significantly affects the rate and extent of drug
absorption. Delays in the gastric emptying time was previously reported to significantly
decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen (AAP) and aspirin, whereas stimulating the
gastric emptying accelerated the absorption of these drugs [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Gastric emptying in ruminants necessitates drug transit from the rumen through the reticulum,
omasum and abomasum, leading to the long residence of orally administered drugs in the
forestomach. Therefore, the rate of drug absorption in ruminants may be the slowest of all
animals due to the time required for drug particles to pass through the four-chambered stomach
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This finding explains why drugs with a very short
half-life by the intravenous route, such as salicylic acid (1 hr), may nevertheless give
sustained plasma concentrations in ruminants when administered by the oral route [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although the oral route is considered to be inappropriate for ruminants, we previously
demonstrated the effectiveness of this route for diclofenac (DF) and sulphamonomethoxine (SMM)
in Shiba goats [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; the mean absorption time (MAT) of DF
(6.05 hr) was less than half that of SMM (15.1 hr). These findings suggested that the short
MAT of DF was due to its marked absorption from the forestomach while the long MAT of SMM was
due to a long gastric emptying time; however, gastric emptying time needs to be estimated in
order to confirm this.</p><p>AAP is mainly absorbed from the small intestine of humans and most animal species, and not
from the stomach [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The AAP absorption test, which involves measuring plasma AAP concentrations in
short time intervals following its oral administration, is considered a reliable method to
evaluate gastric emptying rates in the stomachs of humans [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as well as ponies and horses [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine
the pharmacokinetics of AAP after oral dosing in order to evaluate the properties of gastric
emptying in Shiba goats.</p><p>AAP was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). AAP was dissolved
in 70% propylene glycol at a high temperature (approximately 70&#x000b0;C) for its intravenous
administration. AAP was dissolved in 90% ethanol, mixed with three hay cubes and then allowed
to dry before its oral administration. These solutions were prepared at a concentration of 200
mg/m<italic>l</italic>. All other reagents and chemicals used in this study were of HPLC or
analytical grade.</p><p>The present study was performed using five clinically healthy male Shiba goats, weighing
21&#x02013;44 kg and aged 2&#x02013;3 years. All goats were maintained in accordance with the recommendations
of the &#x02018;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x02019; approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (approval number
76/25). These goats were housed in pens at an ambient temperature and with good ventilation.
Animals were fed hay cubes (#1A Cubes, Eckenberg Farms Inc., Mattawa, WA, U.S.A.) at 0.8
kg/head twice a day, and water was available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p><p>The oral pharmacokinetics of AAP, its stability in rumen juice and the octanol-buffer (pH
6.5) partition coefficient were investigated in the present study. In the pharmacokinetics
study, AAP was administered into the left jugular vein or orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg body
weight to five male goats using a crossover design with at least a 3-week washout period.
Blood samples (3 m<italic>l</italic>) were collected from the right jugular vein immediately
prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hr following an intravenous injection of AAP, and
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 16 hr after its oral administration. Plasma samples were separated
by the centrifugation of blood at 1,600 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C
until later analyses.</p><p>The stability of AAP in the rumen juice was determined as described previously [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, 40 m<italic>l</italic> of rumen fluid was
collected from two goats using a catheter, pooled and processed for incubation immediately
after its collection. Two hundred microliters of the AAP solution (1 mg/m<italic>l</italic>)
was added to 1.8 m<italic>l</italic> of the rumen juice to give a final concentration of 100
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g per m<italic>l</italic> of the incubation mixture. Five samples were
prepared from this mixture and incubated in a thermostatic shaking water bath at 39&#x000b0;C for 24
hr under anaerobic conditions. The incubated mixture was then centrifuged at 20,000
<italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected.</p><p>The octanol-buffer partition coefficient of AAP was determined by the shake flask method as
recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Before partitioning, the two solvents were mutually
saturated at 25&#x000b0;C for 24 hr. Solutions of AAP (10 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>)
were prepared in octanol-saturated phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.5). These solutions were then
equilibrated at 25&#x000b0;C with an equivalent, double and half volume of buffer-saturated octanol.
Two separating funnels were used in all three runs. After equilibration, the buffer phase was
collected and centrifuged at 1,600 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The concentration of AAP in
the buffer phase was then determined. The concentration of AAP in the octanol phase was
obtained by mass balance. The apparent and intrinsic octanol/buffer partition coefficients
were then determined from these data.</p><p>AAP concentrations in plasma, rumen juice and buffer samples were determined by HPLC with UV
detection, as described previously [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with some
modifications. Briefly, 200 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of perchloric acid (0.15 M) was added to 200
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the plasma or rumen juice samples and stirred. The mixtures were
centrifuged at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatants were obtained and
filtered using a 0.45-<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m HPLC filter (Chromatodisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 4P, Kurabo
Biomedical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Fifty microliters of the filtrate was injected
into the HPLC column.</p><p>The HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) consisted of a pump (LC-10AD), UV
detector (SPD-6A), integrator (Chromatopac C-R7A plus) and loop injector (model 7125). The
mobile phase was a mixture of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v).
Triethylamine 150 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/<italic>l</italic> mobile was added. Analytical
separation was accomplished using a reversed-phase ODS column (TSK-gel ODS-120T<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
4.6 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m &#x000d7; 250 mm, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan). The flow rate was 1
m<italic>l</italic>/min. The wavelength of the detector was 248 nm. Sample preparation and
analysis were conducted at room temperature. AAP was found to be accurately resolved as a
single sharp peak with a retention time of 5&#x02013;6 min. The recovery of AAP from plasma samples
was 100.1 &#x000b1; 2.65% at 1 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> (mean &#x000b1; SD, n=5), while that
from rumen juice samples was 97.0 &#x000b1; 2.03% at 25 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> (mean
&#x000b1; SD, n=5). The inter-day CV values ranged from 2.24 to 3.20% for plasma samples and from 1.44
to 3.05% for rumen juice samples (n=5, 3 times).</p><p>The plasma concentration-time curves of AAP after the intravenous injection fit well with the
two compartment model. Therefore, the curves obtained after the intravenous injection
(<italic>Cp<sub>iv</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>)) and oral administration
(<italic>Cp<sub>po</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>)) were described by Eq. 1 and 2,
respectively.</p><p><disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1331-e001.jpg"/></disp-formula> (Eq. 1)</p><p><disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1331-e002.jpg"/></disp-formula> (Eq. 2)</p><p>Equations 1 and 2 were simultaneously fit to the plasma concentration-time curves of AAP
after it was intravenously and orally administered to the same goats, respectively, in order
to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters by the nonlinear least-squares method using the curve
fitting program, MULTI [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Several pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a non-compartmental analysis. The area
under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal method
(from time zero to the last sampling time) and integration (from the last sampling time to
infinity). Total body clearance (CL<sub>tot</sub>), bioavailability (F), mean residence time
(MRT), MAT and the distribution volume at a steady state (V<sub>dss</sub>) were calculated by
conventional methods.</p><p>The plasma concentrations of AAP rapidly increased and peaked 0.90 &#x000b1; 0.22 hr after being
orally administered, and this was followed by its slow elimination. On the other hand, plasma
concentrations were eliminated rapidly after the intravenous injection with short half-lives
(1.14 &#x000b1; 0.46 hr), as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Plasma concentration time curve of AAP (30 mg/kg body weight) after its single

These results suggested that AAP was absorbed more from the forestomach, similar to DF. The

influenced the absorption of AAP from the forestomach, for example, molecular size, as has
already been suggested by Morishita <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They compared the gastrointestinal absorption of several sulfonamides in rats
and found that sulfanilamide had a fast absorption rate that was unexplainable from its
smaller partition coefficient than other sulfonamides. They concluded that the fast absorption
of sulfanilamide may have been due to its small molecular weight (172.21). Because the
molecular weight of AAP (151.2) is similar to that of sulfanilamide and is markedly smaller
than that of DF (318.1), as listed in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the
faster absorption of AAP may have been due to its smaller molecular weight, similar to
sulfanilamide.</p><p>Fast oral absorption of AAP has been found in dairy cows by Gr&#x000fc;nberg <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In their experiment, peak concentrations of AAP
were observed less than 2 hr after oral administration. This fact may suggest that AAP is
markedly absorbed from forestomach also in daily cows like in Shiba goats.</p><p>The bioavailability of AAP was less than 20%. The recoveries of AAP from rumen juice samples
at 100 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> (n=5) after a 12- and 24-hr incubation at 39&#x000b0;C
were 90.5 &#x000b1; 1.5 and 88.7 &#x000b1; 0.8% (mean &#x000b1; SD), respectively. Since AAP is stable in rumen juice,
its low bioavailability after its oral administration may have been due to its extensive
first-pass effect in the liver. This may also be attributed to the large metabolic capacity of
Shiba goats [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that AAP was markedly absorbed from
the forestomach of Shiba goats, which may have been due to its small molecular weight.
Therefore, AAP was considered unsuitable for evaluating gastric emptying in Shiba goats.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Baggot</surname><given-names>J.
