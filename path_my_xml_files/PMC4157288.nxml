The advent of direct bonding procedure and the light cure resins have given the operator an unlimited working time and ease of work in minimizing errors during bonding. Direct bonding is still more preferred procedure than indirect bonding by most of the operators. However, achieving an accurate and consistent bracket positioning for the posterior continues to pose a problem because of inaccessibility. A significantly superior, efficient and effective indirect bonding methods has been developed, which has improved accuracy and reduced chair side time for both patient and the operator over the last three decades.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In addition to being a highly sensitive technique, indirect bonding has two significant disadvantages. First, the occluso-gingival insertion of the transfer tray causes the adhesive coated brackets to scrape along the tooth surface resulting in uneven distribution, rather than perpendicular placement. Second, when opaque trays were used the putty covering the palatal side prevent the light from entering the palatal and occlusal aspect during curing.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In this study, both the direct and indirect bonding technique were done using split-mouth design to eliminate the bias between right and left side and between upper and lower bonding. Forces from mastication and hygiene maintenance can also be an important factor for bond failure between right and left side.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The &#x0201c;On command&#x0201d; curing advantages of light cured resin over auto polymerization resins, in bond failure rates have been studied by many authors with no significant difference between them.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The bond strength and bond survival rate of Conventional halogen and high speed curing (light-emitting diode, plasma) were compared, to be of little or no significant between them.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The transfer tray used in indirect bonding, in this study is 2 mm soft thermo-plastic sheet. Light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from light source. The dual trays used in the earlier studies, not only increased the distance of the light source from the bracket but may act as a factor to reduce the light intensity for curing.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] If a light cure is used with tray technique, the tray has to be transparent enough to allow light transmission [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Related to transfer tray procedures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-6-85-g006"/></fig><p>Bond failure rate of direct and indirect bonding methods have been compared for many decades. In our study, the overall bond failure rate between direct and indirect bonding was found to be 10.5% and 8.8% respectively with no significant statistical difference between the two. The results of this study were similar to earlier studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with no significant difference between the two methods. In our study, there was proportionate increase in bond failure rate of both the methods when compared to the other mentioned studies, which could be attributed to the dissimilar materials used, population bias and motivation factor. A bond failure rate below 10% is clinically acceptable as suggested by Cal-Neto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, comparing the anterior and posterior brackets, the indirect method showed more bond survival rate than direct, in the anterior than posterior. Though the difference was not statistically significant, the increase in bond failure could be attributed to arch alignment discrepancy at the start of the treatment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bond failure in posterior segment for indirect method, was suggested to be due to difficulty in transfer tray removal and seepage of saliva between the tray and tooth on the etched tooth. Furthermore, variation in adhesive thickness during tray insertion, leading to uneven adhesive distribution could be the possible factor for the bond failure. Adhesive thickness up to 0.5 mm had no significant effect on bond strength.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In individual tooth bond failure rate, the mandibular centrals showed the maximum failure rates. The reason could be attributed to varying trauma from incisive forces.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The bond failure of mandibular and maxillary premolar brackets in indirect method showed more failure rates, due to saliva seepage,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] variation in adhesive thickness, other reasons suggested are aprismatic enamel and increased curvature of buccal surface may affect micro mechanical bond strength of the brackets.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, Bond failures were observed due to various reasons, which were found to be in concurrence with other earlier studies. The bond failure rate was found to be &#x0003c;10% for over-all comparison, anterior &#x02013; posterior comparison, and individual tooth comparison, which was clinically acceptable. Bond failures that resulted from transfer tray removal were due to operator's error. Debonding of brackets was also recorded due to occlusal interference from high masticatory load and tooth brushing as heard from the patients. The operator error could be reduced, and adequate patient motivation could prevent some of these avoidable etiological factors in increasing bond survival rate.</p><p>Hence, concluding this study, that bond survival rate in both the methods, using the transparent thermo-plastic transfer tray of 2 mm thickness, had no significant differences between them. This transfer tray method was time saving, inexpensive and ease of manipulation with-out compromising on the bonding procedure. Both the technique exhibited their advantages and disadvantages in the course of this study. Finally, it will be the operators choice to feel the convenience of procedure to use them to their advantage.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>GV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epoxy adhesives for orthodontic attachments: Progress report</article-title><source>Am J Orthod</source><year>1965</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>901</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5214895</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silverman</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gianelly</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dietz</surname><given-names>VS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A universal direct bonding system for both metal and plastic brackets</article-title><source>Am J Orthod</source><year>1972</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>236</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4559001</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zachrisson</surname><given-names>BU</given-names></name><name><surname>Brobakken</surname><given-names>BO</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical comparison of direct versus indirect bonding with different bracket types and adhesives</article-title><source>Am J Orthod</source><year>1978</year><volume>74</volume><fpage>62</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">356618</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Brien</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A clinical trial of an indirect bonding technique with a visible light-cured adhesive</article-title><source>Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop</source><year>1990</year><volume>98</volume><fpage>259</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2206041</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aguirre</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Waldron</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Assessment of bracket placement and bond strength when comparing direct bonding to indirect bonding techniques</article-title><source>Am J Orthod</source><year>1982</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>269</fpage><lpage>76</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6760721</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gorelick</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bonding/the state of the art.
