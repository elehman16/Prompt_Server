Curve profile should be Lenke type 1 to 3, over 45 degrees of the main curve by the Cobb method. We get written informed consent from patients and parents. Exclusion criteria are patients who cannot understand Japanese, patients who have had previous spinal surgery, patients who are pregnant, patient who have allergy to nickel, chrome, or titanium, etc.</p><p>Randomization to cobalt-chrome rod or titanium rod is performed with a web-based register adjusted by age, the Cobb angle of the main curve in standing, that in active bending, and the Risser grade. We set a total of 80 cases after power calculation by past reports.</p><p>Placement of pedicle screws and techniques of correction maneuver are to be reported. Radiographic parameters by X-ray, CT scan, and MRI at preoperative time, post operative time, and one-year after surgery are to be analyzed. Questionnaires of patient-reported outcome by SRS-22, SF-12, and SJ-27 (AIS-specifc outcome made by Japanese Scoliosis Society) are asked to fill at preoperative time, six-month after surgery, and one-year after surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We designed a practical randomized controlled trial of scoliosis surgery by two different-material rods. The study is now on going.</p></sec></body></article>
