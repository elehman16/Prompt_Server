</p><p>Surgery on Jehovah's witnesses is always a challenge for surgeons, too. This society has
remarkably grown and counts over 7 million followers worldwide today. According to Jehovah's
witnesses' interpretation of the Bible, it is prohibited to ingest blood of any kind. It is
up to the conscious of each individual to accept transfusions of fractionations of the
primary components.<xref rid="JR150190crc-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="JR150190crc-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Especially cardiac surgeries have a higher risk for
blood loss with the need of blood transfusions. This creates a difficult situation for the
patient and for the doctor who is legally bound to provide best medical care to every
patient. Therefore, a minimally invasive LVAD implantation technique was used when a
Jehovah's witness was referred to our clinic with end-stage heart failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We present a 48-year-old patient (175 cm, 75&#x02009;kg, body mass index 24.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who
was admitted to our clinic due to acute decompensation of dilative cardiomyopathy. The
patient presented the signs of hypotonic pressures, dyspnoea, tachycardia, and
acrocyanosis.</p><p>Echocardiography was performed and showed a severe decrease of left ventricular ejection
function (13% [Simpson]) and a reduced right ventricular function as well as a second-degree
mitral valve insufficiency. Laboratory parameters showed decreased liver and renal function.
Due to respiratory insufficiency, noninvasive ventilation became necessary. The history of
the patient showed a possible case of viral myocarditis 18 years ago. Dilated cardiomyopathy
was diagnosed 8 years ago. After multiple attempts to medically stabilize the condition of
the patient, the case was presented to the cardiovascular surgery department (<xref rid="FI150190crc-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In an interdisciplinary discussion, it was decided
to implant a mechanical assist device. The patient was a Jehovah's witness and approved LVAD
implantation but declined the use of any blood products even in emergency situations.</p><fig id="FI150190crc-1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

(HeartWare) was sewed onto the beating heart. The venous line of the heart&#x02013;lung machine was
placed in the femoral vein. The arterial line was placed via ministernotomy to the ascending
aorta. After starting of the heart&#x02013;lung machine, the assist device was placed into the left
ventricle. The outflow graft cannula was tunneled through the pleural cavity and sewed onto
the ascending aorta. The weaning from the heart&#x02013;lung machine was completely uneventful. The
procedure was performed without any use of blood products including thrombocytes, fresh
frozen plasma, or any other coagulation factors (<xref rid="FI150190crc-2" ref-type="fig">Fig.

considered to be prone to high blood loss and high usage of coagulation factors. Even though
tested multiple times before transfusion, blood products still contain risks for allergic
reactions to transfusion of infectious diseases. Furthermore, economic costs for blood
products are one of the major contributors for the high costs of LVAD implantation.
Therefore, the reduction of usage of blood products is one of the keys to lowering the cost
for LVAD programs.</p><p>Minimally invasive LVAD implantation, first described by our group, has already proven
itself to be associated with several positive effects. It has been shown that the total
number of blood transfusion was reduced by implanting an LVAD via a minimally invasive
technique.<xref rid="JR150190crc-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="JR150190crc-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="JR150190crc-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Now, it is proven that it is even possible to implant
an LVAD minimally invasively without the use of any blood products. As devices become
smaller, incision sites should reduce in size as well.</p><p>Despite the excellent result of this procedure, the surgical approach as well as the risk
and consequences of blood loss must be intensively discussed with the patient. In our case,
the patient accepted blood transfusions only in the case of imminent death due to blood
loss. Although a case of heart transplantation in a Jehovah's witness has been
described,<xref rid="JR150190crc-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the therapeutic goal of our patient is
destination therapy with LVAD support. In case of reoperation, our strategy is minimally
invasive LVAD exchange without the use of the heart&#x02013;lung machine.<xref rid="JR150190crc-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It has been proven that minimally invasive LVAD implantation without blood transfusion is
possible. This benefits not only Jehovah's witness patients but also all patients in the
need of a ventricular assist device. Yet, the course of the patients has to be kept in mind,
which may require further interventions with the need of blood transfusion. Therefore, LVAD
implantation in Jehovah's witnesses should be a critically evaluated procedure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="d31e125" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold> The authors have no disclosures.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="JR150190crc-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schmitto</surname><given-names>J D</given-names></name><name><surname>Molitoris</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Haverich</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Strueber</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><article-title>Implantation of a centrifugal pump as a left ventricular assist device through a novel,
