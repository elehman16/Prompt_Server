Hyperbaric bupivacaine has been a popular choice for spinal anaesthesia. The limitations of its use include relatively short duration of the pain relief provided, necessitating early analgesic requirement in the postoperative period; and motor blockade, which may lead to urinary retention causing discomfort and delayed discharge of the patient. Intrathecally opioids act synergistically with local anaesthetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> They improve the quality of intraoperative anaesthesia, permit lower doses of local anesthetics, provide faster onset of surgical block and prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>In the past, intrathecal morphine had been used for postoperative analgesia as it provides excellent and long lasting effect after surgical procedures.

Ninety patients of either sex between 18 to 65 years of age belonging to ASA I and II, undergoing elective, major orthopaedic lower limb surgery were included. Patients with contraindications to subarachanoid block, chronic opioid users, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease {Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 600 ml}, height &#x0003c;150 cms or &#x0003e;180 cms were excluded. A routine pre-anaesthetic assessment was done and the height (cm) and weight (kg) were recorded. During pre-anaesthetic checkup, patients were familiarized with the concept of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain assessment. Pain was scored at regular intervals postoperatively using the VAS scale with VAS - 0 as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain. All patients were kept fasting from 10.00 pm on night before surgery and were premedicated with tablet diazepam 0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in the night and 0.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> on the morning of surgery.</p><p>In the operation theatre, monitoring for heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG, &#x00026; oxygen saturation (SpO2) were initiated. Following i/v cannulation, preloading with 12 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> of intravenous Lactated Ringer solution was done over a period of 10-15 minutes. Using a sealed envelope technique, patients were randomly allocated to one of the three groups (S,F,C) each comprising of 30 patients. Under all aseptic precautions, subarachanoid block was administered with 23G Quincke needle via midline approach in sitting position after local infiltration and intrathecal drug was injected over 10-15 seconds. Patients were placed in supine position after completion of the block. Patients received the drug intrathecally according to the group allocated:</p><p>Group S: Sufentanil 5&#x003bc;g (0.5ml) &#x000b1; 15mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (3.0 ml).</p><p>Group F: Fentanyl 25&#x003bc;g (0.5ml) &#x000b1; 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (3.0 ml).</p><p>Group C: Normal saline (0.5 ml) &#x000b1; 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (3.0 ml).</p><p>A total volume of 3.5ml was injected intrathecally in all patients, irrespective of their height (which ranged from 150-180cms). Normal saline was used to dilute the study drug. Another anesthesiologist involved in the study prepared the test solution.</p><p>All patients received balanced salt solution at the rate of 2 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> as the maintenance fluid. Oxygen, at the rate of 5 l min<sup>-1</sup> was administered by facemask.

It was treated with additional boluses of intravenous fluids. Intravenous increments of 3mg Mephent-ermine were administered if hypotension persisted. Brady-cardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute and was treated with 0.6mg of intravenous atropine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>II.

Various adjuvants have been used along with bupivacaine for prolonging the duration and improving the quality of analgesia. Intrathecal morphine provides pain relief upto 24 hr but its use has been associated with delayed respiratory depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Newer lipophilic opioids like fentanyl and sufentanil are gaining popularity and have been used intrathecally by various workers.</p><p>In the present study 90 patients received either 5&#x003bc;g of sufentanil, 25&#x003bc;g fentanyl or 0.5 ml normal saline with 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. A total volume of 3.5ml was injected, irrespective of height (which ranged from 150-180cms).</p><p>Patients in the three study groups were comparable with respect to demographic profile. The average duration of surgery, anaesthesia and the mean blood loss were also comparable in the three study groups.</p><p>Various dose-response studies on laboring patients have documented the dose of intrathecal fentanyl to be 5 times more than intrathecal sufentanil.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Taking into account these considerations; we administered 25&#x003bc;g fentanyl or 5&#x003bc;g of sufentanil as adjuvants to bupivacaine intrathecally in patients undergoing lower limb surgeries.</p><p>A comparable decrease in the SBP after SAB was observed in all the groups. Decrease in BP is a known occurrence after intrathecal bupivacaine due to a decrease in sympathetic afferent activity and is dose related. No episode of hypotension was observed in any patient despite the maximum block height (by pin prick method) of T4 in 25 patients.

No incidence of respiratory depression was seen in other groups. No episode of oxygen desaturation was observed in any patient. This could have been attributed to our routine practice of administering supplemental oxygen with facemask both in the intraoperative and early postoperative period.
