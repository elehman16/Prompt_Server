Both are key to long-term memory formation, and the present three-study series used multiple methods to examine whether mindfulness would enhance episodic memory, a key form of long-term memory. In Study 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 143), a self-reported state of mindful attention predicted better recognition performance in the Remember-Know (R-K) paradigm. In Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 93), very brief training in a focused attention form of mindfulness also produced better recognition memory performance on the R-K task relative to a randomized, well-matched active control condition. Study 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 57) extended these findings by showing that relative to randomized active and inactive control conditions the effect of very brief mindfulness training generalized to free-recall memory performance. This study also found evidence for mediation of the mindfulness training&#x02014;episodic memory relation by intrinsic motivation.

This <italic>episodic memory</italic>, the remembrance of past episodes from specific times and places, allows humans to guide their present and anticipated future behavior. By influencing what information is placed in working memory, episodic memory allows us to apply knowledge about our past to execute current tasks and to reflect on, plan for, and derive preferences for future situations [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A form of long-term memory, and specifically declarative memory (the other form being semantic memory), episodic memory is subject to both neurological insult and age-related decline. Given its importance, there is considerable demand for interventions to preserve and enhance episodic and other forms of memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The formation of episodic memories depends on encoding, the receipt and registering of sensory information, and is the first step in the creation of representations of experienced events or situations; these representations provide inputs to working memory and then, potentially, long-term memory, to be later retrieved as episodic and other types of memories. Early work in this area [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] demonstrated that controlled processing at encoding supports later retrieval. Convergently, when attentional capacities are taxed during encoding, the ability to recall those memories is hindered [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More recently, Bissig and Lustig [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that the encoding stage could be an effective locus of memory training (see [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for review), Indeed, considerable intervention research has targeted encoding processes, but to date evidence supporting the role of encoding-focused behavioral interventions to improve episodic memory in healthy adults is mixed [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Encoding is dependent on the degree or quality of attention paid to events and situations, and in everyday life can be easily compromised by distraction, mind-wandering, social cognition biases, and other perceptual interferences. The ability to control attention has been regarded as a core cognitive faculty [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and simply put, paying close attention facilitates better memory of the stimuli attended to [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In recent years, interest has grown in the cognitive benefits of a form of attention called <italic>mindfulness</italic>, and incipient research indicates that it can improve attention and working memory. These findings suggest that mindful attention may have &#x0201c;downstream&#x0201d; effects on episodic memory as well [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the present research tested this proposition.</p><p>The concept of mindfulness has multiple meanings [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but classical accounts relate a receptive attentiveness of present events and experiences to memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Usage of the term mindfulness in early Buddhist canonical texts makes explicit the link between mindfulness and episodic memory. Mindfulness is described as a capacity that facilitates the &#x0201c;ability to call to mind things that were done and said long ago&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This aspect of the classical description of mindfulness in early Buddhist sources was the starting point of the present research, which took into account the historical roots in the Buddhist traditions of modern day mindfulness research.</p><p>Training in mindfulness takes two general forms termed &#x0201c;focused attention&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;open monitoring.&#x0201d; Training in focused attention (FA), the primary interest of the present studies, is often the first form that trainees undertake, and involves experiential practice in directing attention to chosen perceptual stimuli. FA training involves several attentional faculties: sustained attention to a target stimulus, disengagement from distracting perceptual stimuli (attention switching), and redirection of attention to the chosen stimulus (selective attention) [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consistent with this, FA training to enhance mindfulness has been associated with better performance on both an attention orienting task [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and sustained attention tasks [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. FA training has also been shown to enhance working memory performance with verbal and non-verbal materials [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Neuroimaging research is consistent with these findings; Tang and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found mindfulness-integrated training-related changes in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connectivity, and in other frontal areas implicated in executive attention and working memory tasks [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such effects are also consistent with our theoretical understanding of mindfulness, in that attention, particularly the sustained attention cultivated in mindfulness training, may make stimulus representations in working memory more stable and less subject to decay [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Given these influences on attention and working memory, mindfulness training may also impact long-term episodic memory. Attention is required to encode items into working memory, and computational memory models [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggest that encoded items sit in a working memory buffer in the process of being encoded into long-term episodic memory. Thus, if items are encoded with more fidelity into working memory, they may also be encoded into episodic memory with more detail (see [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for review). To date very little research has examined the effect of mindfulness training on episodic memory. A recent quasi-experimental study [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that relative to matched controls, mindfulness practitioners showed better verbal free recall of words from a list; but the form of training (FA or OM) was not controlled and the task represents a coarse measure of episodic memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Also suggestive is quasi-experimental neuroimaging research that has linked mindfulness training with increased gray matter density in the hippocampus [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a brain region implicated in episodic memory functioning [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Present research</title><p>The present three-study series was designed to examine the effect of mindfulness on episodic memory, indexed by two task outcomes. Study 1, a correlational study, explored the role of trait and state mindfulness in episodic memory performance in the Remember-Know (R-K) paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The R-K task is designed to dissociate the recognition of objects previously seen (&#x0201c;remember&#x0201d;; episodic memory) relative to felt familiarity of the object (&#x0201c;know&#x0201d;; semantic memory) and to mere guessing. The two forms of memory are related, in that recognition relies on familiarity with the stimulus, an automatic process, to access encoded information, but episodic memory also involves recollection, a conscious retrieval process [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153309.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interest in this study was in remember performance on the R-K task as an index of episodic memory.</p><p>Study 2 examined the effect of mindfulness on episodic memory experimentally, comparing the impact of brief FA mindfulness training on recognition memory in the R-K task relative to a structurally equivalent active control training. Based on prior research on mindfulness and working memory, we hypothesized that trait and/or state mindfulness (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Study 1</xref>) and briefly trained mindfulness (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Study 2</xref>) would conduce to better remembering (episodic memory) on the R-K task.</p><p>Study 3 sought to extend this inquiry in two ways. First, we examined the effect of FA-based mindfulness training relative to active and passive control conditions on a different index of episodic memory, namely free recall, which also involves consciously controlled memory retrieval. The decision to examine a second index of episodic memory was guided by the importance of demonstrating a generalizable beneficial effect of mindfulness. Ranganath et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have argued that the use of multiple tasks assessing the same process but having different rules, stimuli, and response modalities can increase confidence in the generalizability of training effects to novel contexts. In accord with the above-stated hypothesis, we expected that brief mindfulness training would enhance free recall performance relative to that observed in the control conditions.</p><p>The second extension provided by Study 3 was an effort to explain why mindfulness enhances episodic memory. We reasoned that the anticipated memory-enhancement afforded by mindful attention may be due, at least in part, to the association of mindfulness with <italic>intrinsic motivation</italic>&#x02013;an innate tendency toward engagement in interesting and enjoyable activities [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Initial correlational research suggests that mindfulness may promote intrinsically motivated and related forms of autonomous, or self-determined functioning. For example, Brown and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] found that dispositional mindfulness predicted greater reported autonomy in day-to-day activities among college students and working adults, as measured through experience sampling. Because autonomy is an essential basis for intrinsically motivated activity [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] these studies are suggestive of the positive influence mindfulness might have on intrinsically motivated behavior and, perhaps, the salutary consequences of such behavior for memory task performance. Indeed, intrinsic motivation has been shown to enhance episodic (free recall) memory performance [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, we explored whether mindfulness would enhance free recall performance both directly, and through its association with enhanced intrinsic motivation.</p><p>If as hypothesized mindfulness does enhance episodic memory performance, the findings of the present research may have implications for improving educational and occupational performance, both of which rely on capacities to recognize and recall stimuli encoded in the past. Since motivation is a key factor in such settings, this research may also inform about a key process through which mindfulness training can better enhance episodic memory performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Study 1</title><p>A correlational study was first undertaken to test the role of trait and state mindfulness in episodic memory performance. Theorized to represent individual differences in the frequency of day-to-day states of mindfulness, several self-report measures of basic trait mindfulness have been associated with such cognitive features as attention and working memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, participants completed two measures of trait mindfulness emphasizing present-centered attention before completing the R-K task. Because trait mindfulness represents a general tendency to &#x0201c;be present&#x0201d; and so may not inform about quality of attention upon entry into the episodic memory task, self-reported state, or current mindfulness was also assessed immediately prior to the R-K task. In addition, we tested the potential role of trait <italic>attentional control</italic> on episodic memory performance. There is some debate about whether trait measures of mindfulness actually assess this subtle construct rather than related phenomena such as concentration [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In accord with theory and research on mindfulness measures [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] we anticipated that higher trait and/or state mindfulness, but not attentional control, would predict higher remembering relative to familiarity (knowing) and guessing.</p><sec id="sec004" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 144 introductory psychology students at a large mid-Atlantic university who provided written consent to participate and earned research participation course credit.

Using MediaLab 2008 software (Empirisoft, New York, NY), participants first completed self-report trait measures of mindful attention (as well as dispositional tendencies toward memory errors and cognitive failures; data not reported here). Upon individual completion of these measures, the experimenter provided each waiting participant with a paper word search puzzle that served as a filler task until all participants in the session had completed the self-report measures. Once all participants had done so, the experimenter collected the word puzzles and delivered detailed instructions on the learning phase of the R-K task (see <italic>Measures</italic> below), which was followed by a short series of practice trials. They then completed a brief self-report measure of state mindful attention, and immediately began the R-K task. Once finished, each participant completed a demographics survey, was debriefed, and then dismissed.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Measures</title><p>Mindfulness. Two widely used measures tapped individual differences in a basic form of mindfulness, namely the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; sample <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = .82) and the Act with Awareness Subscale of the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-AW [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; sample <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = .90). The 15-item MAAS assesses the day-to-day frequency with which people are receptively attentive to and aware of current, or present moment events and experiences. Responses are made on a 6-point Likert scale (<italic>almost always</italic> to <italic>almost never</italic>) to items such as "I find it difficult to stay focused on what&#x02019;s happening in the present." The 8-item FFMQ-AW similarly assesses individual differences in the tendency to be actively attentive to current stimuli using a 1 (<italic>never or very rarely true</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very true or always true</italic>) Likert scale. Higher scores on the MAAS and FFMQ-AW indicate higher levels of basic trait mindfulness.</p><p>State mindfulness was assessed using the 5-item state variant of the MAAS [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (sample <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = .85), which taps receptive attentiveness to present stimuli at a given point in time. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored at 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>), 3 (<italic>somewhat</italic>) and 6 (<italic>very much</italic>). After reverse scoring each item and averaging the responses, higher scores reflected higher state mindfulness.</p><p>Attentional Control. The 20-item <italic>Attentional Control Scale</italic> (ACS; [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]) measured two major trait components of attention (focusing and shifting) on a 4-point scale (<italic>almost never</italic> to <italic>always</italic>). Higher scores indicate higher attention control (&#x003b1; = .71).</p><p>Recognition Memory Task. To assess the accuracy of recognition memory relative to other, dissociable types of recognition experience, participants completed the <italic>Remember-Know task</italic> (R-K; [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153309.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). The task consists of a learning phase and a test phase. During the learning phase, participants passively viewed a sequence of 60 randomly presented, colored images of easily recognizable everyday objects [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Each image was presented centrally, on a white background, via computer monitor for a duration of 5 sec, and preceded by a black fixation cross presented centrally on the screen for a duration of 1 sec. The interstimulus interval was 1 sec. Participants were instructed to view each image as closely as possible to better remember them, and were informed they would be tested on their memory for all presented objects.</p><p>After the learning phase, instructions on the test (memory) phase of the task were presented on the computer screen as well as given verbally by the experimenter. These instructions included a description of how to appropriately use the &#x0201c;old&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;new&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;remember&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;know&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;guess&#x0201d; response options, as described in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Participants were instructed to respond &#x0201c;O&#x0201d; (old) if they recognized that the object was presented during the learning phase, and to respond &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; (new) if the object was not presented during the learning phase. The O and N response options appeared below each image until a button box response was made. Half of the 120 test phase images were old and half were new; they were presented in random order, preceded by a 1 sec black fixation cross, and presented centrally for 2 sec. When an N response was made, a 1 sec intertrial interval followed. If an &#x0201c;O&#x0201d; response was made, a screen prompt was given to characterize the recognition experience as &#x0201c;remember&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;know&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;guess,&#x0201d; in which &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; (remember) indicated &#x0201c;a vivid recollection of their past experience viewing the picture&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;K&#x0201d; (know) indicated &#x0201c;strong feelings of familiarity without vivid recollection&#x0201d;; and &#x0201c;G) (guess) indicated &#x0201c;guessing the picture was displayed before.&#x0201d; The descriptions of each option were presented verbally by the experimenter at pre-test phase training and were shown again on the computer monitor at the start of the test phase. The R, K, and G prompts appeared below each image until a button box response was made. Before starting the test phase, participants completed 10 practice trials and were given opportunity to ask questions of the experimenter.</p><p>A Signal Detection Theory approach was taken to effectively dissociate memory retention from decision-making processes during R, K, and G recognition judgments. Following the recommendations of Donaldson [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], hit rate and false alarm rate data were used to compute A<italic>&#x02032;</italic> (A-prime) for R, K, and G. A<italic>&#x02032;</italic> is a non-parametric index of discriminability (similar to <italic>d&#x02032;</italic>), that accommodates hit or false alarm rates of 1 or 0.

One limitation of this study concerns the inability to know whether instructional speaker sex had some effect on the R-K outcomes. Since these outcomes were collected after participants listened to both instructional recordings, we cannot determine whether male and female speakers would have similar effects on these outcomes even though, as noted earlier, order of speaker (male or female recording first) had no effect on the outcomes. An additional limitation concerns the fact that content of the two instructional sets in the control condition differed, but did not differ substantially in the mindfulness condition. To examine whether this had some effect on the R-K outcomes, terms representing the instructional (speaker) order &#x000d7; experimental condition interaction, and instructional (speaker) order &#x000d7; experimental condition &#x000d7; recognition performance interaction were added to the main model just reported. This analysis showed that neither interaction was significant (<italic>p</italic>s = .18 and .17, respectively), indicating that instructional content had no apparent effect on R-K task performance.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Study 3</title><p>A third study was undertaken with two purposes in mind. First we sought to examine whether brief FA mindfulness training, relative to both normative and distracted states of mind, would lead to better performance on a different index of episodic memory than the recognition memory tested in Studies 1 and 2 &#x02013;namely free recall of reading material. Of course reading, and the retention of material read, is central to knowledge acquisition through education, and to performance in a wide variety of occupations; thus memory of textual material represents an important outcome. In this study&#x02019;s design, participants listened to one instructional recording only, and the same male speaker-delivered mindfulness training as in Study 2 was tested. Two control conditions were included: a distraction condition, in which the FA instruction was partially masked by white noise, served to model sonic conditions commonly present in modern urban environments. A no-instruction condition served to test that FA training in fact increased memory performance, rather than a control instruction decreasing it. In accord with our primary hypothesis, we predicted that a state of mindful attention, relative to the control condition states, would lead to better free recall memory of the text read.</p><p>The second purpose of this study was to explore whether mindfulness would have at least some of its effect on this memory performance through (that is, mediated by) heightened intrinsic motivation, as measured by greater reading task-specific interest and enjoyment. Intrinsic motivation is theorized to be an important process through which attentional engagement enhances cognitive and other performance [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, given prior linkages between mindfulness and autonomous motivation, including intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and intrinsic motivation and free recall [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], there was reason to believe that intrinsic motivation may mediate the relation between mindful attention and episodic memory.</p><sec id="sec019" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec020"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-seven undergraduates (72% female) at a Northeastern U.S. university provided written consent to participate and earned research participation course credit (due to a procedural error, other demographic data were not collected).

They first completed a measure of current fatigue to permit statistical control of baseline energy level on the study outcomes as needed (see <italic>Measures</italic> below). They then read a 375-word factual text passage on the May Day holiday. After the reading, participants completed a self-report measure of intrinsic motivation (interest, enjoyment) and, to supplement the assessment of task enjoyment, a self-report measure of positive and negative affect (see <italic>Measures</italic> below). The reading, and the measures that followed, served to establish baseline, task-specific motivation and affective state.</p><p>Participants were then individually randomized to the mindfulness condition, a distraction control condition, or a no-task (waiting) control condition (<italic>n</italic> = 19 per experimental condition) and told that the purpose of this phase was to &#x0201c;make sure everyone is in the same mental state.&#x0201d; In the mindfulness condition, participants listened through headphones to an audio cassette-taped version of the male-voice recording used in Study 2 [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>The distraction control condition was identical except that the instructional audiotape included continuous background white noise, consistent with prior distraction research [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], along with brief, random bursts of higher decibel noise during both the speech and silent portions of the instructions (median burst = 3.25 sec; total time = 2 min, 25 sec). This noise combination was designed to mimic common sonic features of modern environments [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], in which there is often continuous background noise (e.g., heating/cooling systems, traffic) punctuated at random by brief bursts of higher decibel noise (e.g., car horns, sirens). The signal-continuous noise difference was 22.6 decibels (db), favoring signal; with noise bursts the difference ranged from 10.3 to 6.9 db, favoring signal. While no noise was introduced into the mindfulness instruction audio, normative background tape noise was measured; the signal-noise difference was 30 db. Shifting of attention from the primary, instruction task to irrelevant noise is a potential concern in this approach, but the likelihood of this was minimized by the non-semantic nature of the noise and by removing any demand to attend to noise or to report on any of its features; instead, interest was in whether the noise would disrupt the processing of task instructions [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. To justify the noise, participants were told that the tape quality was poor. This condition served to control for attention to audio-based instructions. In the wait/no-task control condition, equal in duration to the other conditions, participants were instructed though headphones to wait without engaging in other activities. This condition served to control for passage of time between readings and measures completion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153309.s001">S1 Text</xref> for training instructions).</p><p>Participants then read a second, 372-word biographical text passage on the author Rudyard Kipling (c.f., [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). This passage and the May Day passage used in baseline assessment were rated as moderately interesting, on average, in pilot testing; this allowed for maximal within-person increases or decreases in motivation as a result of the attention manipulations described earlier. After the second reading, participants completed the same measures of motivation and affect as before. Participants were then asked to sit and relax while refraining from other activities until the next part of the study was prepared. This 4-min period of inactivity introduced a time lag between the second text reading and the free recall of it, while also minimizing interference from other activities. The participant was then given a blank page and instructed to &#x0201c;write everything you remember from the second passage you just read, including as much detail as possible. Please write any titles, sentences, ideas, or facts you recall.&#x0201d; After exactly 5 minutes, the experimenter returned and asked the participant to stop writing. A manipulation check followed, in which two questions were asked: &#x0201c;How easy was it for you to follow the instructions on the tape?&#x0201d; (7-point scale; <italic>very difficult</italic> to <italic>very easy</italic>) and &#x0201c;To what extent were you able to concentrate on the instructions on the tape?&#x0201d; (7-point scale; <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>extremely</italic>). We then asked each participant whether anyone had told them about the study before their session; all indicated &#x02018;No.&#x02019; After probes for suspicion and awareness of the study purpose, the participant was debriefed, thanked, and dismissed.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Measures</title><p>Fatigue.

Building upon scholarship on early Buddhist canonical descriptions of mindfulness [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and prior empirical work showing that mindfulness training improves both attentional and working memory processes [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we hypothesized that bringing mindful attention to bear on task stimuli would improve episodic memory. Supporting this hypothesis, a multimethod study series first showed that a self-reported state of mindful attention (but not self-reported trait mindfulness) predicted better recognition performance on the R-K task (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Study 1</xref>). Two experiments then showed that very brief, focused attention-based mindfulness training improved R-K recognition performance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Study 2</xref>) and reading task-based free recall performance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Study 3</xref>). An exploration of mediation in Study 3 also showed that intrinsic motivation partially explained the effect of mindfulness training on free recall success. These findings, particularly in Studies 2 and 3 were associated with moderate effect sizes. Thus, using two operationalizations of mindfulness and two indexes of episodic memory, the study findings present a consistent picture of benefit from mindful attention in episodic memory enhancement.</p><p>More generally, these results support the proposition that training in sensory encoding is a suitable target for long-term memory enhancement [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Established theories of both memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] have indicated that task engagement and task performance are impacted by the quality of attention paid to the task. Since mindfulness training has been shown to enhance key attention capacities, including orienting and alerting [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the increased moment-to-moment attention associated with mindful task engagement may directly contribute to enhanced working memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in turn the better episodic memory performance observed here. However, Study 3 found evidence for an indirect effect, in that mindfulness training led to stronger task engagement (higher intrinsic motivation and, supplementarily, lower negative affect), which partially mediated the training effect on episodic memory. Since it was examined in only one study with a comparatively small sample, this mediation finding requires replication before it can be considered reliable; but it is consistent with research showing trait mindfulness to predict higher day-to-day autonomous (including intrinsic) motivation and lower negative affect [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and with research highlighting the beneficial effect of intrinsic motivation on episodic (free recall) memory [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Research is needed to examine all three steps of the memory process discussed here&#x02014;encoding, working memory, and episodic memory&#x02014;to better understand the role of mindfulness in memory formation and retention, as well as the processes, like intrinsic motivation, that help to explain how mindfulness enhances the success of these memory outcomes.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Like much previous research in this area, these studies were conducted with university student samples, and tests of the generalizability of the results to other populations, such as older adults or less educated samples, are needed. Also, because we did not measure or otherwise control for participant expectancy effects on the outcomes, we cannot definitively conclude that expectancies did not bear some influence on the study results. There are reasons to believe that expectancy is not a likely alternative explanation for the condition differences found, including the fact that participants had no prior knowledge of the study hypotheses or procedures, and the audio instructions bore no resemblance to, nor referred to any elements of the task that followed, nor its outcomes. However, in future selecting active control interventions and outcome measures based on prior, independent assessments of expectations could help to rule out expectancy effects [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>The mindfulness training findings are consistent with the claim that the task condition differences in motivation and memory were due to a mindfulness-related enhancement of experience and performance. Yet Study 2 did not include a no-instruction control condition, and so it is possible on methodological grounds alone that the active control condition training in attention to goals detrimentally impacted memory performance. The results of Study 3 inveigh against this interpretation, as performance in an active control condition (distraction) was nonsignificantly different from a no-instruction control condition. Future research could use active control conditions that provide a stronger test of the effect of mindfulness training on episodic memory, namely empirically validated training in attention to enhance encoding.</p><p>An additional direction for future research is to examine other points in the memory process at which mindful attention may have effects. The present studies focused on memory enhancement at the encoding stage, with downstream effects on retrieval. But mindfulness may play a direct role at the retrieval stage as well. For example, heightened attention during initial retrieval has been shown to enhance the probability of remembering the previously retrieved stimuli again in the future [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Research could help to specify whether mindfulness operates to enhance memory performance most effectively at encoding or at retrieval stages.</p><p>Finally, investigations of longer-term mindfulness training are needed to address the sustainability of its memory-enhancing effects. Relatedly, future research could also test the efficacy of mindfulness interventions to enhance episodic memory performance outcomes in educational and work settings to determine whether the effects observed here translate into <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts. Such contexts, and the computer technologies used in them, do not always provide optimal climates for focused attention and autonomously (including intrinsically) motivated behavior (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0153309.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]), and the present research suggests that mindfulness may be a valuable internal support for day-to-day memory performance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153309.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Training instructions, Studies 2 and 3.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153309.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Charles Couchman for lending his voice for audio-recorded instructions.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153309.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Tulving</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name> (<year>2002</year>). <article-title>Episodic memory: From mind to brain</article-title>. <source><italic>Annual Review of Psychology</italic></source>, <volume>53</volume>(<issue>1</issue>), <fpage>1</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>25</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0153309.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ranganath</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flegal</surname><given-names>K.
