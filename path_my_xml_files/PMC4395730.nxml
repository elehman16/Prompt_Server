feedback had on the gait of patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. [Subjects and Methods]
This study was conducted with 20 patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. The training
consisted of five training sets repeated 10 times and the activity was conducted for 15
minutes each session, three times per week for six weeks immediately after completion of
central nervous system developmental treatment. [Results] A comparison of the results of
before and after the experiment found that the COP displacement training group showed
significant improvements in step length, stride length, gait velocity, and the functional
reach test, while the control group showed significant improvement only in the functional
reach test. In the intergroup comparison, the COP displacement training group showed
significant improvements in paretic side step length, paretic side stride length, gait
velocity, and the functional reach test compared to the control group. [Conclusion] In
conclusion, according to the results of this study, visual feedback training for COP
displacement is more effective at enhancing the gait and balance of hemiplegic patients
due to stroke than only performing feedback training for even weight distribution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Center of pressure</kwd><kwd>Feedback</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability among adults. Most cases of stroke bring
about functional restriction and movement restriction due to motor impairment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these restrictions, gait disturbance
is one of the most serious problems experienced by patients with hemiplegia due to
stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Diverse studies have been
conducted investigating gait problems, and in particular, visual feedback training is
commonly used in clinical settings. In particular, external visual feedback has been
reported to facilitate learning about the spatial location and displacement of the body, and
to be effective in the enhancement of balance control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, different
forms of visual feedback have been investigated in recent studies, including visual feedback
balance control training using a platform<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, gait training with visual signals for patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, gait and balance training
using 3D visual feedback<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and spinal
stabilization exercises using visual feedback<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Training methods that require stroke patients to actually perform
tasks along with visual feedback are quite rare. In particular, training of center of
pressure (COP) displacement has been reported to be effective at enhancing the balance and
gait of hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
although most studies have used COP displacement to evaluate balance ability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, the findings of studies of balance and gait training with visual
feedback using COP displacement of patients with hemiplegia due to stroke are insufficient.
Therefore, this study investigated the effects that COP displacement training using visual
feedback has on the gait of patients with hemiplegia due to stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 20 patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. The subjects were
selected from among patients who received a clear explanation of this study and agreed to
participate in it. All the participants signed an informed consent form (including consent
for publication of the anonymized data) following the Declaration of Helsinki
recommendations for investigations involving human subjects. The subjects of this study were
chronic stroke patients (at least six months) who had no hemi-spatial neglect or
cardiovascular dysfunction, who could walk independently, and who had a Mini-Mental Status
Examination (MMSE-K) score that was not less than 25 points. In this study, dynamic balance
was measured using the functional reach test (FRT), which is a commonly used clinical
evaluation. Moreover, paretic side step length, paretic side stride length, and gait
velocity were measured using a GAITRite walkway to examine the spatiotemporal variables of
the participants&#x02019; gait. Both the experimental group and the control group received central
nervous system developmental treatment 30 minutes per day, five times per week. The gait
training consisted of five sets repeated 10 times and the activity was conducted for 15
minutes each session, three times per week for six weeks immediately after completion of the
central nervous system developmental treatment. For the training, each subject in the
experimental group stood on both feet wearing an F-Scan system and looked at the monitor
while the round pointer displayed on the monitor was displaced from the center of the heel
to the center of the 1st metatarsal bone as real-time feedback. Each subject in the control
group stood on both feet wearing an F-Scan system and looked at the monitor and performed
lateral symmetry training while watching the COP displayed on the monitor in real time. The
data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 12.0. The paired t-tests was used to
investigate the significance of difference between pre- and post-test outcome measures and
independent t-test was used for intergroup comparison. The significance level was chosen as
the 95% confidence level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the participants in this study are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of subjects (n=20)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (F/M)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type (H/I)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.8&#x000b1;6.1<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.4&#x000b1;9.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.8&#x000b1;9.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.9&#x000b1;8.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.8&#x000b1;9.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.2&#x000b1;10.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration (month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.2&#x000b1;1.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7&#x000b1;2.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>*</sup>p&#x0003c;0.05; <sup>a</sup>mean&#x000b1;SD; F: female; M: male; H: hemorrhage; I:

using symmetric pressure for patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. The feedback training
used in this study is a method that has been shown to be useful for improving the motor
learning of healthy people and stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, extrinsic feedback facilitates the correction of
impaired limbs and enables faster learning when physical skills are taught<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the experimental group and the
control group in this study were trained using extrinsic feedback. In particular, COP
displacement is clinically and directly related to balance and gait disturbance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the COP displacement
training group showed improvements in their step length, stride length, gait velocity, and
dynamic balance results after the intervention in comparison to before the intervention,
while the control group showed an improvement only in dynamic balance. In the intergroup
comparison, the COP displacement training group showed significant improvements in step
length, stride length, gait velocity, and dynamic balance in comparison to the control
group. Patients with hemiplegia due to stroke have increased ranges of lateral and
anterior/posterior displacement during standing<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and they more easily fall when COP displacement velocity increases
abnormally<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, in this
study, it was possible to significantly improve the dynamic balance in the COP displacement
of the training group, in comparison to the control group, using visual feedback training.
This enabled the slow COP displacement from the heel to the 1st metatarsal bone so that the
lateral and antero/posterior COP displacement velocities could be adjusted to ensure that
they were not too high. In addition, the COP displacement training group showed significant
increases in step length, stride length, and gait velocity in comparison to the control
group. One study reported that a reason for this finding could be the fact that the ability
to bear weight is significantly related to the strength required for walking<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it has been reported that
when stroke patients walk, the COP displacement distances are shortened on the paretic
side<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we think the
experimental group&#x02019;s gait improved in comparison to the control group because the training
used an ankle strategy to distribute weight evenly between the left and right side and to
displace the COP laterally, and antero/posteriorly increased the COP displacement lengths
that had been shortened. Yang et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that patients with hemiplegia due to stroke showed improvement in their gait index
after gait training using robots. In that study, the patients&#x02019; COP displacement increased a
finding that is similar to the results obtained in the present study. The control group
showed improvement in dynamic balance but not in the gait index. We consider this is because
the control group simply aimed to bear weight evenly, aiming at equal weight distribution.
This study had several limitations that prevent a generalization of its results. First, the
number of subjects was not large enough and the intervention period was short. In future
studies, more subjects should be included and the intervention period should be increased
for more effective COP displacement feedback training. In conclusion, according to the
results of this study, visual feedback training for COP displacement is more effective at
enhancing the gait and balance of hemiplegic patients due to stroke than simply performing
feedback training for even weight distribution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Sunmoon University research grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Langhorne</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Coupar</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollock</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Motor recovery after stroke: a systematic
