Obesity is associated with an increased risk of recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and death. Physical activity after cancer diagnosis has been reported to have positive effects on body composition and quality of life. We present the protocol of the InForma study, a trial testing the efficacy of an intervention on weight loss (&#x02265;5 % of the baseline body weight) in a group of overweight or obese breast cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a four-arm randomized controlled trial. Patients will receive a 6-month intervention and be followed for a further 18 months. Intervention is designed to improve adherence to a healthy diet and/or to increase physical activity, taking advantage of a wrist-based activity monitor. Participants will be recruited among overweight or obese breast cancer patients treated at the European Institute of Oncology, after completion of eventual adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. It is envisaged that 260 patients will be randomized into four arms: Dietary Intervention; Physical Activity Intervention; Physical Activity and Dietary Intervention; and Less Intensive Intervention. Women will be offered individualized counseling consisting of face-to face discussion and phone calls in addition to group meetings. A motivational interviewing approach will be used to encourage health behavior change. All participants will be given a pedometer device to monitor their physical activity. Participants&#x02019; dietary intake will be repeatedly assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Participants&#x02019; quality of life and anxiety will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits to assess lipid and hormone profiles. Body composition will be repeatedly assessed using bioelectrical impedance vector analysis for identifying changes of fat and fat-free mass. Women allocated to the less intensive intervention arm will be considered as the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>While there is a rising concern about the role of obesity in cancer recurrence and survival, this trial with its multi-arm design, motivational approach and use of a pedometer device will provide important insights regarding the most effective approach in promoting weight control in breast cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN53325751">ISRCTN53325751</ext-link> (registration date: 16 October 2015); ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02622711?term=NCT02622711&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02622711</ext-link> (registration date: 2 December 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Breast cancer survivors</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Counseling</kwd><kwd>Pedometer</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Body composition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15963</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million new cases and 521,900 deaths in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to the association of Italian Cancer Registries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], breast cancer is also the most common cancer in women in Italy with 581,373 newly diagnosed cases in 2010. The estimated incidence is stable and mortality is decreasing mainly due to advances in diagnosis and treatment. Consequently survival from breast cancer has improved, and currently about 87 % of breast cancer patients in Italy survive more than 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Modifiable lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption are established risk factors for the development of, and death from, breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is also accepted evidence that, after a diagnosis of breast cancer, being overweight or obese is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer relapse, death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], or second primary contralateral breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis including more than 200,000 patients with breast cancer, Chan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] demonstrated a 41 % increase in overall mortality in obese and 7 % in overweight women and a 35 % increase in breast cancer-specific mortality in obese women and 11 % in overweight women, as compared with patients who had normal weight at diagnosis.</p><p>Most women experience a progressive weight gain during and after treatment for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] due to the changes in hormone levels and body composition associated with treatment. Weight gain usually ranges from 2&#x02013;6 kg in the first year following diagnosis, but greater gains are also common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Chemotherapy is associated with weight gain due to a reduced metabolism and the subsequent induction of menopause increasing the likelihood of weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover treatment-related side effects, duration of treatments and psychological distress may affect diet and physical activity patterns compromising energy balance in ways that promote weight gain.</p><p>High body mass index (BMI) results in an increased production of hormones (estrogens, insulin, leptin), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have, in turn, been associated with breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, estrogenic stimulation promotes breast cancer pathogenesis and tumorgenesis, while insulin and leptin exhibit proliferative, mitogenic, and anti-apoptotic activities in mammary cells, thus promoting tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. High circulating estrogen levels are associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Alongside this, physical inactivity represents a leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Regular physical activity yields a wide range of health benefits, because it is associated with healthier levels of circulating hormones (insulin, leptin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-3, estrogens and androgens) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as well as possibly strengthening the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover physical activity after breast cancer diagnosis has also been reported to have positive effects on body composition, psychological outcomes, and quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The number of trials of weight loss interventions in breast cancer is increasing, but a demonstration of their benefit on breast cancer outcome is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Weight loss resulting from intentional increased physical activity and caloric restriction can improve hormonal status, quality of life, and physical functioning among obese and overweight breast cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Regular physical activity and healthy dietary habits are important factors for reducing the risk of cancer recurrence and mortality, as well as lifestyle-related chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Few intervention trials in breast cancer survivors, integrating physical activity and dietary intervention have been initiated or conducted so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Despite the accumulating evidence of the detrimental effect of physical inactivity and being overweight on breast cancer risk and risk of breast cancer recurrence, weight control and physical activity counseling are not yet current practice. Clinicians typically try to advise patients to change their lifestyle habits using a directing style but this approach is often ineffective. Patients often seem ambivalent or unmotivated in respect to these messages and, in turn, generate resistance or passivity. Motivational interviewing is an alternative approach to discussing behavior change that fosters a constructive specialist-patient relationship and leads to better outcomes for patients. This intervention, aimed at encouraging positive health behavior changes within a medical setting, is promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and it can help individuals to enhance adherence to diet and exercise modification programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The prognostic role of body mass index has been previously assessed on the outcome of a consecutive series of women treated at our institution (the European Institute of Oncology (IEO), Milan, Italy) for an aggressive form [estrogen receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ER-/HER2)-positive] of breast cancer. In these patients, obesity was significantly associated with the risk of developing distant metastases and with worse overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Given the above considerations, our aim is to evaluate the effect of a 6-month intervention on weight loss in a group of overweight or obese women treated for early breast cancer. The intervention is designed to improve adherence to a healthy diet or/and to increase physical activity and decreased sedentary time, taking advantage of a wrist-based activity monitor (pedometer device).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study (InForma) was designed as a mono-institutional randomized controlled four-arm parallel-group trial.

On arrival, they will receive a progressive number from the front desk receptionist. After an information meeting, they will be invited to sign all the study documents (informed consent form, privacy disclosure). Height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and body composition will be measured. Participants who are eligible will receive the study questionnaires to be filled in. They will then be called following their random arrival number and be allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the four intervention arms: Dietary Intervention (DI); Physical Activity Intervention (PAI); Physical Activity and Dietary Intervention (PADI); or Less Intensive Intervention (LII) following a pre-established randomization list (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The randomization list was created using a computer random number generator and securely kept by a study collaborator not involved at the front desk. Randomization is not stratified, but blocks of 20 were created to achieve balance in the allocation of participants to the four treatment arms. The randomization list is not known to the front desk receptionist (administrative staff) who provides the progressive number that will be matched with the randomization number at the end of the information meeting. Randomization will be made by a member of the InForma study team (dietician or physiotherapist). This to ensure that allocation cannot be guessed before registration.

Key strategies will emphasize the reduction of energy density by low-energy dense foods (e.g., water- and fiber-rich vegetables and fruits), limiting the intake of foods and beverages high in fat and added sugar, and limiting portion sizes.</p><p>Each goal will be stated and verified at each contact (reduce the portion size of cheese instead of normal portion size; choose fresh fish, instead of preserved fish, freshly squeezed lemon juice in water, instead of soft drinks). Participants will also be advised not to fall too far below their goal to support nutritional adequacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>PAI arm</title><p>The PAI will be designed on an individualized level, whereby specific activities are planned based on capabilities, lifestyle pattern and preferences so as to increase physical activity and to reduce sedentary time. Realistic and achievable goals will be set working toward short-term and long-term goals. A priority will be placed on regular planned aerobic exercise, since this creates an energy deficit that is much greater per unit of time than strength training. The general exercise prescription planned will be of low to moderate intensity, regular frequency, involving aerobic, resistance or mixed exercise types. The physical activity targets are: to be moderately physically active, equivalent to brisk walking for at least 30 min a day (short-term goal); to do purposeful exercise at a moderate level of intensity at least 60 min/day or &#x02265;30 min of vigorous physical activity every day (long-term goal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Reasonably, the initial goal will be to plan and implement daily purposeful mild to moderate exercise for a minimum of at least 10 min/day with a stepwise increase in time and intensity that will be evaluated and modified at each contact. Women who exercised at a higher level than 10 min/day at baseline will be instructed to aim for an incrementally greater goal of daily exercise and to plan to increase intensity as tolerated. Participants will wear the wrist-based activity monitor and they will be instructed to count the total number of steps to improve their self-monitoring and to reduce sedentary time.</p><p>Personalized goals will be set to increase physical activity. Each goal will be stated and verified at each contact (use public transportation to go to work instead of the car; use the stairs instead of using the elevator, check the wrist-based activity monitor). Safe increased physical activity should be recommended through a program tailored to individual characteristics. Participants will be instructed to report any problem or adverse event immediately to the clinical staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>PADI arm</title><p>The intervention will be focused on weight loss combining a reduced energy intake, an increase of physical activity, and reduction of physical inactivity. Women randomized to this arm will be offered an integrated version of both intervention components of the DI and PAI arms. This integrated approach will be weighted to avoid intervention overload. Individualized goals will be set for all participants to promote individualized diet modification and individualized physical activity based on individual characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>LII arm</title><p>Participants included in the LII arm will be considered as the control group. They will receive general counseling on health to reduce weight, and be provided with materials and guidelines available to the general public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and receive two motivational phone calls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measures</title><p>Weight, and waist and hip circumferences will be measured at baseline, at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up visits. Height will be measured at baseline. A fasting blood sample will be collected at baseline, at 6, and 24 months to measure lipid profile (total, HDL, LDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides) and estradiol, insulin, glucose, and C-reactive protein level (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Body composition will be assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up visits, using bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) (Nutrilab device, AKERN Srl, Pontassieve, Italy). BIVA is a more accurate method for a quick measurement of body compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The direct analysis of the two components of the impedance vector (Z), resistance (R, Ohm), and reactance (Xc, Ohm), allows a semiquantitative evaluation of body composition in terms of body cell mass and hydration status. Data for total body water (TBW), body cell mass (BCM), extracellular water (ECW), fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM) and percentage fat mass (% FM) will be available for all participants and will be used for identifying changes of fat and fat-free mass over the study period.</p><p>Physical activity will be also measured via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline, 6 and 24 months. This questionnaire consists of questions that record the frequency and duration of mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise performed during free time in the previous 7 days measuring physical activity and inactivity. It is a validated self-report measure of exercise that has been reliably used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The total hours per week spent in each activity will be multiplied by the estimated metabolic cost of each activity [metabolic equivalent (MET) value] as determined from the Compendium of Physical Activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Dietary intake will be measured at baseline, 6 and 24 months using the validated and self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Italian section (EPIC) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It records daily intake of foods and nutrients over the previous year. It consists of 15 sections (first course, second course, side dish, fruit, etc.) and contains 254 questions investigating a wide range of food items.</p><p>Quality of life (QoL), health status and anxiety will be measured at baseline, 6-, 12- and 24-month visits using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaires. The FACT-B is a 37-item validated multidimensional self-report questionnaire, subdivided into four primary QoL domains and a disease-specific domain &#x02013; additional concerns for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The subscales measure physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, relationship with the doctor, and breast cancer concerns. The FACT-B has a 5-point Likert-type response scale. It has good psychometric properties, discriminates well between clinically distinct groups, and is responsive to change.</p><p>The STAI is a psychological inventory based two 20-item self-report measures. It assesses how respondents feel &#x0201c;right now, at this moment&#x0201d; and how respondents &#x0201c;generally feel&#x0201d;. In addition, the STAI State and Trait each have been found to contain two factors, which Spielberger labeled anxiety-present and anxiety-absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Respondents are asked to rate themselves on each item on the basis of a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very much so&#x0201d; for the STAI State and from &#x0201c;almost never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;almost always&#x0201d; for the STAI Trait.</p><p>The intervention will propose the use of a pedometer-like device (a wristband) that encourages both increased physical activity and decreased sedentary time. This device is able to record total steps taken, total distance traveled, total time active during the day, and the greatest length of time of consistent movements done during the day. In addition it records light and deep sleeping time. All participants will receive and will have to wear the wrist-based activity monitor during the 6-month study period (days and nights). They could use a smartphone or a computer application to obtain feedback on their activity and sedentary time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Serious adverse events</title><p>We expect a very low risk for participants. We do not foresee any serious adverse events. However, if participants do experience an adverse event, this will be brought immediately to the attention of the clinical staff. All participants will be monitored to prevent any possible deficiency or inadequate nutrient and/or caloric intake by means of an evaluation of their dietary intake (dietary recalls and/or food diaries). Participants will also be monitored for injuries or problems associated with increased physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The present study is designed as a mono-institutional, randomized, controlled four-arm parallel-group trial. The study will be conducted over a 2-year period, during which patients will receive a 6-month intervention, and will be followed until the end of the study period. Study participants will be randomized to one of the four arms: Dietary Intervention (DI); Physical Activity Intervention (PAI); Physical Activity And Dietary Intervention (PADI); or Less Intensive Intervention (LII). The less intensive (or minimal) intervention group will be considered as the control group.</p><p>This design is chosen because it has the advantage of testing single or combined interventions, and of comparing the results with the control group (LII).</p><p>The mono-institutional study design will be characterized by uniform diagnostic procedures, standard treatment protocols and central pathological evaluation of surgical specimens, thereby limiting variations in the determination of major clinical and pathological factors that determine disease outcome. It will also ensure a uniform follow-up of patients for the study-specific endpoint.</p><p>The primary outcome measure will be assessed at the end of the 6-month intervention, by measuring the body weight. We expect a body weight reduction &#x02265;5 % of the baseline body weight in all the intervention arms. The secondary outcome measures will be assessed through the intervention during the follow-up visits: (a) we expect weight control over the study period, measuring the body weight at each follow-up visit; (b) we expect an increase in physical activity levels and reduction in physical inactivity from baseline measured by the pedometer-like devices and from the IPAQ questionnaire. The physical activity target for improving general health is 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity every day (equivalent to 10 MET-hours per week) and reducing inactivity; (c) we expect a change in dietary intake and an increased adherence to healthy diet from baseline using the FFQ; (d) we will evaluate the effect of the intervention on long-term breast cancer recurrence; (e) we expect an improvement in quality of life and in health status from baseline using the FACT-B and STAI; (f) we will evaluate the effect of intervention on the blood lipid profile. We expect an increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol; (g) we will evaluate the effect of intervention on some biomarkers: estradiol, CRP, insulin, and glucose. Statistical analyses will only be carried out after the end of the trial, with no interim analysis planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample size</title><p>During 2012, 756 overweight or obese women (with a BMI comprising between 25 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) underwent surgery for early-stage (non-metastatic) breast cancer at the European Institute of Oncology. Data for these patients were retrieved from our institutional breast cancer patients&#x02019; database. The mean weight of these 756 patients was 75 kg and the standard deviation was 9.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on a superiority design of any single intervention (DI, PAI, or PADI) compared to the control group (LII). A sample group of 65 patients (control group) and similar number in any of the three intervention groups (diet and/or exercise) for a total of 195 patients achieve 80 % power to detect a 5 % weight loss (3.75 kg) between the null hypothesis that both group means are 75 kg and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of any of the intervention group 2 is 71.25 after 6 months, with known group standard deviations of 9.0 and 9.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic> test.

This trial will provide important insights regarding the effect of an intervention carried out in Italy which is designed to improve adherence to a healthy diet and/or to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary time, taking advantage of a pedometer device. Despite the increasing number of trials of weight loss interventions in breast cancer, so far only the DIANA (DIet and ANdrogens) randomized controlled trials have been undertaken on cancer survivors in Italy. They studied the effect of a Mediterranean-macrobiotic lifestyle on breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and found a 10 % reduction of testosterone level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and an improvement of cardiopulmonary functional capacity and vascular endothelial function following a moderate intensity exercise training combined with the macrobiotic diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The most recent extension of the DIANA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] is ongoing. It is a two-arm intervention to promote dietary change and a moderate increase in physical activity aimed at decreasing circulating hormone concentrations, breast cancer recurrences, and improving survival.</p><p>Our study, with its multi-arm design, has the advantage of evaluating the effect on participants by comparing three different approaches to a common control arm or combining the effect of the interventions. It also appears more appealing to patients because it provides an increased probability of receiving an experimental intervention rather than the control treatment. The educational components of our intervention will be based on national [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and international recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], promoting the Mediterranean diet, which includes many dietary features that have been shown to promote health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The scheduled visits and the motivational interviewing approach chosen should ensure a more active role of the patients in lifestyle change to achieve success. Motivational interviewing aims to enhance self-efficacy and personal control for behavior change. It uses an interactive, empathic listening style to increase motivation and confidence, emphasizing the discrepancy between personal goals and health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover our project will take advantage of a pedometer device to quantify ambulatory activity during walking and running, by means of a common and easily understood metric (i.e., steps). This device is appealing since it objectively monitors physical activity and can be an important means for providing behavioral feedback and motivation. Pedometer-based walking interventions have demonstrated their effectiveness in increasing physical activity in adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Objective measuring changes in physical activity in addition to a standard measurement (questionnaire) can add further precision to the physical activity level reached by participants during the intervention.</p><p>Due to the increasing concern on the role of obesity in cancer survival and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], there is the need for evidence regarding the most effective approach in promoting weight control and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle in breast cancer survivors. The results of this innovative project will provide useful information for future interventions and potentially have a large public health impact on breast cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started in November 2015 and is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BCM, body cell mass; BIVA, bioelectrical impedance vector analysis; BMI, body mass index; CRP, C-reactive protein; DI, dietary intervention; ECW, extracellular water; EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition; ER, estrogen receptor; FACT-B, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast; FFM, fat-free mass; FFQ, food frequency questionnaire; FM, fat mass; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; IEO, European Institute of Oncology; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IPAQ, International Physical Activity Questionnaire; kcal, kilocalorie; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LII, less intensive intervention; MET, metabolic equivalent; PADI, physical activity and dietary intervention; PAI, physical activity intervention; QoL, quality of life; R, resistance, Ohm; STAI, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; TBW, total body water; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; Xc, reactance; Z, vector.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge and thank the participants volunteering for taking part; AKERN Srl for providing the disposable electrodes necessary for bioelectrical impedance measures during the trial; Allegramente Walking (ASD) for providing support for physical activity interventions; William Russell-Edu for help with the literature review and for editing the manuscript; and the association &#x0201c;La forza e il sorriso&#x0201d; for allowing us to host our groups in their meeting room (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.laforzaeilsorriso.it/">http://www.laforzaeilsorriso.it/</ext-link>).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The trial is funded by the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) (grant no. 15963).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PM and PG conceived the study and drafted the manuscript; PM is the Principal Investigator and provided statistical support.
