A total of 62 obese patients with PCOS were randomly divided into three groups, 21 of whom were treated with acupoint catgut embedding combined with Chinese medicine, another 21 with catgut embedding therapy, and 20 only with Chinese medicine. We compared the improvement of clinical symptoms and the glucose and lipid levels in the three groups three months after surgery. We found that the effective rate of obesity treatment, body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio of acupuncture-drug group and catgut embedding group were significantly lower than those of the Chinese medicine group (P&#x0003c;0.05). A comparison between the acupuncture-drug group and catgut embedding group was not statistically significant (P&#x0003e;0.05). The triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels of the three groups were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, following treatment, with the total cholesterol (TC) level being decreased significantly only in the acupuncture-drug group (P&#x0003c;0.05), and the LDL level showing no significant difference (P&#x0003e;0.05). The fast insulins, HOMA-IR, TG, TC levels and periodic cancellation rate of the acupuncture-drug group was significantly reduced compared to those of the catgut embedding group and Chinese medicine group after treatment, whereas the HDL levels, periodic ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate were higher (P&#x0003c;0.05). However, a comparison between Chinese medicine group and catgut embedding group was not statistically significant (P&#x0003e;0.05). The incidence rate of luteinized unruptured follicle and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome of the three groups showed no statistical difference (P&#x0003e;0.05). In conclusion, the study has shown that acupoint catgut embedding therapy combined with Chinese medicine for nourishing the kidneys and promoting blood circulation and improving blood glucose and lipid levels as well as the pregnancy rate in obese PCOS patients with infertility is useful.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>polycystic ovarian syndrome</kwd><kwd>acupoin catgut embedding</kwd><kwd>Chinese medicine of nourishing kidney and promoting blood circulation</kwd><kwd>spectrum of glucose and lipid</kwd><kwd>pregnancy rate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a comprehensive syndrome with the characteristics of chronic anovulation and polycystic ovary, and with low menstruation or amenorrhea, obesity, crinosity and infertility as main clinical features (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It not only involves the genital system, but also directly influences the fertility function of women, and is a type of metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and frequent cardiovascular diseases. It involves multi-disciplinary problems in treatment, e.g., menoxenia, fertility issues, intimal hyperplasia and long-term metabolic syndrome. Therefore, with the deepening of research, PCOS has gone beyond the range of gynecology. Its pathomechanism involves multiple systems including heredity, internal secretion, immunity and metabolism, and its physical and mental damage to patients have raised the attention, which has become the difficulty and focus of gynecological field (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Abdominal obesity diagnostic criteria refers to the definition of Asian people abdominal obesity proposed by WHO in 1998: Waistline, men &#x0003e;90 cm or women &#x0003e;80 cm. The measurement of height was done barefoot with accuracy to 1 cm; weight was measured by electronic scale; cross-section diameter was measured by flexible rule standing with accuracy to 1 cm, abdominal girth was obtained by the cross-section diameter of the mid-point between low edge of the 12th rib and pre-iliac spines, and hipline was obtained by the cross-section diameter of the most prominent level of hip.

Its pathophysiological change scope is wide, and it involves unusual changes of nerve, internal secretion, glycometabolism, fat metabolism, protein metabolism and ovarian local regulating factors (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). According to its clinical features, national medicines distribute it to the scope of &#x02018;delayed menstrual cycle&#x02019;, &#x02018;low menstruation&#x02019;, &#x02018;amenorrhea&#x02019;, &#x02018;infertility&#x02019;, &#x02018;abdominal mass&#x02019;. Kidney is fundamental to yin and yang of human bodies, and whether the reproductive function of women is normal or not is mainly related to the function of kidney. If kidney gas is abundant, yin and yang are balanced, and then during the menstruation, pregnancy is normal (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The studies on PCOS have shown that kidney deficiency is the root, and blood stasis is the surface, strengthening kidney and promoting blood circulation is the fundamental method of treating PCOS.</p><p>Earlier we identified that there are certain effects of treating endomorphy-type PCOS by using traditional Chinese medicine for nourishing kidney and promoting blood circulation decoction. The kidney-nourishing traditional Chinese medicines are regarded as effect of endocrine hormone. The addition of blood circulation activation medicines on the basis of kidney nourishing can improve local blood circulation of ovary, can increase the blood flood volume of ovary, and therefore promote the development of follicles, induce ovulation and promote the formation of corpus luteum, which has been verified in large number of clinical research studies of Chinese and Western medicines (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). At the same time, it has been shown that traditional Chinese medicine treatments alone are dissatisfactory in lowering weight of patients. Therefore, we examined the effect of a kidney-nourishing and blood-promoting decoction in combination with acupoint catgut embedding to treat patients with endomorphy type with PCOS.</p><p>The mechanism of acupoint catgut embedding regards catgut as a type of heterogeneous protein, after inserting it into acupoints, its process of softening, decomposition, liquidation and absorption can effectively promote and enhance the nutrition metabolism and stress ability of bodies, vascular permeability and blood circulation can also be improved. It is a type of mixed treatment in combination with multiple treatments and effects, its simulation induction holding time can reach 20 days, which makes up the disadvantages of short period and more visiting times of acupuncture (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>We selected Renmai, Taiyinjing and Zhongji, Guanyuan, Zhongwan, Shenyu, Xuehai, Sanyinjiao, Fenglong, and Zusanli in Ynagmingjing. Renmai is &#x02018;the ocean of Yinmai&#x02019;, Elucidation of Fourteen Channels say Renmai is the foundation of women's health maintenance, the smooth of Renmai could maintain menstruation and fertility functions of women. Spleen is the foundation of acquired functions, spleen meridian, which has the functions of nourishing liver and kidney and regulating thoroughfare and conception vessels, has the meanings of acquired functions nourishing congenital functions. Stomach meridian of foot-yangming belongs to winding spleen stomach, spleen and stomach are the sources of acquired constitution and source of qi-blood. The normal stomach meridian could reconcile qi and blood and make the functions of internal organs normal (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-3715" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Apuncture was performed at Guanyuan, with two pinholes in the middle, which could reach two veins of Chong and Rei, and with the qi-blood of three yin of liver-spleen-kidney, which could reach the functions of complementing vigors and adjusting qi-blood. Apuncture at Sanyinjiao could adjust blood circulation, strengthen spleen and remove phlegm, and adjust the three organs of liver, spleen and kidney. In combination with Xuehai and Shenyu, it has the functions of nourishing liver and kidney, adjusting Chong and Ren, and nourishing uterus. Zusanli, Zhongwan and Fenglongxue adjusted spleen and stomach, which make the ascending and descending of spleen and stomach orderly. Endomorphy-type patients with PCOS, deficiency of the kidney and blood stasis were adjusted to reduce weight, the levels of endocrine hormone were adjusted, ovarian functions were improved, ovulation was promoted, menstrual functions were recovered, and therefore the functions of hypothalamus-hypophysis-ovary axis were adjusted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was supported by the Fund Project from Xuzhou Technology Division (no.
