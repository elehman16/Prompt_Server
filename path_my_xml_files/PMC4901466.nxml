Most therapeutic approaches fail to induce a sustained weight loss and most individuals undergo weight regain. In this paper the comprehensive design of the &#x0201c;MAINTAIN&#x0201d; study, all assessments as well as the one year lifestyle intervention will be outlined in detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p> One-center randomized controlled trial with seven assessment time points conducted 2009-2015. For the randomization eight groups were distinguished in a list to allocate intervention or control group: Females and males either pre-pubertal or pubertal and with a BMI-SDS under or over 2.5. Setting: Weight loss at a residential weight reduction programme Berlin/Brandenburg and intervention at a paediatric outpatient clinic; Participants: 137 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years). Intervention: Participants were randomized after an initial weight loss at a residential weight reduction programme and allocated to intervention (n=65) and control (n=72) conditions. The intervention group received an one-year group multi-professional lifestyle intervention with monthly meetings at the paediatric outpatient obesity clinic. The control group had a free living phase for one year and both groups 48 months follow up. Main outcome measures: Participants who are engaged in monthly intervention meetings will benefit in terms of a sustained weight maintenance. The primary aim is to describe the dynamic of hormonal and metabolic mechanisms counter-balancing sustained weight loss during puberty and adolescence. The secondary aim is to investigate the effect of an intensive family based lifestyle intervention during the weight maintenance period on the endogenous counter-regulation as well as on health related quality of life. The third aim is to establish predictors for successful weight maintenance and risk factors for weight regain in obese children and adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Weight maintenance after induced weight loss is one of the most important therapeutic challenges as long as most patients fail to maintain their weight loss. MAINTAIN is the first paediatric RCT addressing in parallel to a RCT in obese adults the course of weight regain after induced weight loss and is embedded in an experimental research consortium in order to also address several molecular mechanisms of weight regain.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00850629">NCT00850629</ext-link>, first registration 17 February 2009, verified January 2012, Paediatric part of the interventional study.

The increase in the prevalence of obesity results predominantly from multifactorial changes in lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The abundant availability of high refined, caloric foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle appears to be responsible for the enormous number of obese children and adults, although a genetic susceptibility to this phenomenon is also well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Obese children present an enormous public health concern since overweight and obesity increase mortality predominantly through co-morbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and childhood obesity transfers the risk of these complications into adult life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Weight loss is known to improve cardiovascular risk factors and this benefit persists as long as weight reduction is maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Multidisciplinary and behavior-oriented lifestyle interventions constitute the foundation of paediatric obesity therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several systematic reviews of the treatment of childhood obesity showed clinically meaningful effects of short-term lifestyle interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, almost all patients regained weight after initial successful weight loss.</p><p>Obviously, obesity is a chronic disease and maintenance of a steady weight after an initial weight loss represents the main challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Studies indicate that several biological factors, such as appetite regulating hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], demographic factors, such as age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], psychosocial factors, like maternal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], treatment-response related factors, such as change in BMI-SDS during the first year of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and presence of familial obesity and frequent family meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] may be predictive for long-term weight maintenance.</p><p>However, the process of weight regain is also mediated by a coordinated endocrine response, including leptin, ghrelin, thyroxin and numerous other hormones modifying food intake, energy expenditure and physical activity. Nonetheless, about 10 to 20&#x000a0;% of individuals do show a sustained body weight reduction after a lifestyle intervention, suggesting that a considerable variability in the quality, dynamics and extent of this endocrine response might exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Overall research on long-term weight change patterns and its predictors among children/adolescents following lifestyle intervention is scarce. The main objective in an in-depth and dynamic analysis of the endocrine network counter-balancing weight loss will increase our understanding of the endocrine circuits regulating energy homeostasis and should improve the prediction of successful therapeutic weight reduction. In addition, a clinical trial that explores the effectiveness of an intervention programme to specifically maintain a diet induced weight loss is completely missing in a paediatric obesity cohort so far.</p><p>Therefore, we intended a multidisciplinary clinical research effort called &#x02018;Hormonal Regulation of bodyweight Maintain &#x02013; Study, MAINTAIN&#x02019;, (DFG/KFO 218/0 with eight projects) including two randomized controlled trials (RCT) in children/adolescents and adults in parallel, investigating the mechanisms of weight maintenance and their relation to a lifestyle intervention.

Daily activities are commonly planned and conducted, thus participants learn to share their skills and ideas with a peer group, which strengthens self esteem and appearance in a social network. Social retreat and isolation is prevented by these techniques. Weekly group discussions on possible conflict-situations are conducted and supervised by professional pedagogues. Planning and organising of recreational activities is trained and excursions are conducted to improve physical capacities. At mealtimes participants are supervised and learn how to choose appropriate foods, beverages and serving size.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Psychotherapy</title><p>Psychological backgrounds for overeating and eating disorders are identified in group and individual consultancy. Emotional pressure and difficulties in the family as a cause for eating disorders have to be identified and treated accordingly.

This was combined with weekly nutritional advice sessions, a moderate physical exercise programme and psychological counselling. In fact, all participants were instructed to attend twelve 90&#x000a0;min nutritional counselling sessions with a trained dietitian consisting of nutritional advice and cooking classes. The physical activity consisted of aqua fitness under the supervision of a physiotherapist and was performed before or after each nutritional counselling session. All participants were instructed to further increase their daily physical activity. Weight loss and health status was monitored weekly during this period to ensure no adverse effect. Compliance with the parameters of the study was controlled by obtaining the number of Optifast&#x000ae; packages used as well as verifying attendance at the weight reduction courses and the physical exercise programme.

All study participants agreed to complete 1 or 2 units of exercise/sports every week throughout the study, which had to be documented and signed by the institution that was attended as well as usual sport classes at school. All participants were recommended to visit an institution on sports for adipose children based in Berlin, which is a specialised in all-round activity and exercise provider, where overweight and obese children and adolescents (from 5 to 18&#x000a0;years) participate in a playful way. They are encouraged to strengthen endurance, coordination muscle-training and flexibility according to the results of a personalised fitness check.

A very important advantage for group intervention was (different from routine outpatient obesity programmes) that the participants knew each other from the residential weight loss programme. The participants met again after completing the programme during these sessions. Nevertheless, only 31&#x000a0;% of the families fulfilled the criteria for regular participation (health insurance requires 80&#x000a0;% attendance in group sessions to refund of expenses) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intervention Group Attendance</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Group attendance</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0&#x02013;3</td><td>29.2&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19)</td></tr><tr><td>4&#x02013;7</td><td>40.0&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26)</td></tr><tr><td>8&#x02013;10</td><td>30.8&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Detailed Intervention-Module Description</title><p>The intervention-modules are designed according to the BABELUGA lifestyle target values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) to support children and their families by providing tools and practical advice for daily living, which can be realized and implemented individually. It can be assumed that participants have developed certain supportive techniques and strategies concerning weight management, eating habits and daily activity in their life. In Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> the 10 modules suggested for the intervention group are described in detail. It is not obligatory for parents to accompany their child to the group sessions/meeting, but highly recommended by the study team. As the age of study participants ranges from 10 to 17&#x000a0;years, especially adolescents often do not wish to be accompanied by their parents. Furthermore, the parents influence on eating habits of their children decreases with age. However, in the following description learning targets and intervention strategies for parents are suggested, as they are significant parts of the intervention (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Modules description regarding relevant BABELUGA lifestyle monitoring map, learning target, methods and instruments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Module and title</th><th>BABELUGA lifestyle monitoring item</th><th>Learning targets</th><th>Methods and instruments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.&#x0201c;How to do your shopping&#x0201d;: Food- and drink selection in the supermarket</td><td>&#x0201c;Food choice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Beverage selection&#x0201d;</td><td>Participants know how a healthy and balanced diet can be realised with the right selection of food, drinks and meal-composition.<break/>Parents are encouraged to buy more fruits and vegetables and generally replace highly processed food by natural alternatives.<break/>Participants are encouraged to try new food and experience the taste of natural food.<break/>Participants know how where to find, how to read and how to understand food labelling and declarations.<break/>Awareness is raised for hidden sources of sugar and fat by examining the ingredients list.<break/>Health claims on certain products can be analysed on their substance.<break/>Foods and beverages can be categorised correctly within the OptimiX food groups, according to their fat or sugar content.<break/>Participants are encouraged to plan their food-shopping more precisely to avoid the purchase of inadequate foods.</td><td>Introducing lecture on food labelling, declarations, health claims, listing of ingredients and processed vs. natural foods.<break/>Food and drink packing material is examined and the labelling is analysed.<break/>Quiz-questions are distributed, which are supposed to be answered by examining food products in the supermarket.<break/>In small working groups participants complete the task accompanied by supervisors and return to present their findings.</td></tr><tr><td>2. &#x0201c;Fast Lunch: quick and easy recipes to cook for yourself&#x0201d;</td><td>&#x0201c;Food choice&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Portion size and food intake&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Meals and In-Between-eating&#x0201d;</td><td>Participants clearly understand the advantages of regular mealtimes and commonly shares at least one regular meal daily, where new strategies, such as trying new foods or cooking smaller portions, are realised.<break/>Participants learn about factors that influence the feeling of satiety, such as watching TV during the meal or drinking water before eating.<break/>Children are encouraged to cook for themselves, rather than to eat fast food, sweets or ready meals.<break/>Parents are encouraged to cook for their family instead of using ready meals.</td><td>After a short introduction about food preparation, suitable serving size, right choice of ingredients considering energy intake, as well as time management and a lecture on how to integrate the preparation and the consumption of a warm meal for lunch into the day, parents and children are separated in groups.<break/>Parents prepare small side dishes together and are encouraged by a trainer to discuss and share relevant issues concerning their children and demands of daily life.

All subjects had a complete physical examination. Body weight was measured with a digital scale (Soehnle, Germany) to the nearest 0,1&#x000a0;kg. Height was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Keller, Germany). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters). Blood-pressure was measured as recommended by AGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Baseline samples were obtained for routinely measurement of metabolic parameters. Glucose was given orally (1,75&#x000a0;g/kg, up to a maximum of 75&#x000a0;g glucose).

The focus was on ways how to improve long-term weight development after an intensive rehabilitation-programme. For analysis, data collected in the RCT are used as well as complementary data on psycho-social and health-related life quality. Questionnaires on these issues were developed by the Berlin School of Public Health for parents and children. For the questionnaires - items of validated questionnaires (KINDL&#x000ae;Obesity Modul, KIDSCREEN-52 and DISABKIDS) were partially used. At enrolment parents completed a questionnaire on the parents&#x02019; perception of their child&#x02019;s psychological status and equally children completed their own questionnaire.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data management</title><p>All study relevant data are documented in pseudonymous form in a Clinical Record Form (CRF).

The primary endpoint of this study is weight change 6&#x000a0;month after ending of the intervention (T18) compared to randomization (T0). Therefore a reduction of the effect size by about 25&#x000a0;% (effect size of 0.83) compared to the end of intervention (T12) and a doubling of standard deviation (standard deviation: 1.4) was assumed. Using a <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples (&#x003b1;-error: 5&#x000a0;%; power: 80&#x000a0;%) 46 individuals per treatment arm were calculated (query 7.0) for T18. Considering a dropout rate of 15&#x000a0;% during intervention and 20&#x000a0;% dropout rate during the initial weight loss period, a total of 150 individuals was determined for the weight reduction period (T-3).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first paediatric RCT focused on weight maintenance (following weight reduction). From the clinical point of view, this part of treatment in obese children, adolescents and their families is even more relevant than the effect of structured weight reduction programmes themselves. In general, success in treating obese children and adolescents is limited by the fast weight regain and it is extremely difficult to achieve weight maintenance even in specialized institutions. This unfortunate situation has been quantified already in meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In principle, multi-professional teams and involvement of the family are positively associated with better outcome in these studies. In older age (pubertal or post-pubertal) and families with psychosocial problems or low socioeconomic status, the rate of success is significantly lower in relation to younger children without psychosocial problems. Aside from these public health aspects, family based therapy of childhood obesity is challenging the healthcare systems, because of an increased lifelong morbidity in this group. In the case that children are still obese at the end of their physical development, it is most likely, that obesity will persist throughout life, resulting in a higher rate of comorbidities e. g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Therefore the described research project aims to explore the effects of enhancing the long-term success rate of a multi-professional care in obese children to better maintain an initial weight loss.</p><p>The dynamic of hormonal and metabolic mechanisms counter-balancing sustained weight loss during puberty and adolescence is poorly understood. Puberty alone is accompanied by a physiological insulin resistance, especially in girls, shifting the metabolic situation to growth acceleration and anabolism. In obese adolescents these conditions are aggravated, resulting in e.g., early menarche in obese girls. Therefore, it is expected, that significant weight loss during puberty induces significant counter regulation in order to avoid further weight loss and promote regain. Aside from the clinical intervention trial, this research project will also investigate in depth the hormonal and metabolic counter-regulatory effects of weight loss in children for the first time.</p><p>So far, programmes for obese children and adolescents were conducted as a single intervention, not as a treatment chain like for other chronic diseases in childhood (e.g. diabetes, asthma). The intensive family based lifestyle intervention during the weight maintenance is still temporary, but could be helpful to avoid weight regain.</p><p>In summary, major questions remain unclear. It is entirely unclear whether a lifestyle intervention is able to shift the set-point of body weight. Theoretically the dynamic of regain may differ considerably between individuals. Thus, early and late &#x0201c;regainers&#x0201d; with a different hormonal make-up might exist, which has not been investigated yet. Finally, it is entirely unclear, whether the hormonal counter-regulation is comparable between children and adults. We therefore performed the above described randomized controlled trial in children, adolescents and adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BABELUGA, Berlin Adiposity Therapy Program for children and adolescents and their families &#x02013; Exercise, consultancy, guidance &#x02013; Eating and drinking, proactive behaviour &#x02013; Learning, Quality of Life &#x02013; Supporting families &#x02013; Group therapy for children and parents &#x02013; Adiposity diagnostics and long-term weight reduction; BMI, Body mass index; CBCL, Child Behavior Checklist (Parents); DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - research funding organisation; DGE, German Nutrition Society; DIJK, Children&#x02019;s Depression Inventory; DISHES, Diet history interviewing software for health examination studies; FKE, German Institute for Child Nutrition; KIDSCREEN-52, General quality of life; KIGGS, German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents; KINDL&#x000ae;Obesity Modul, Obesity-related quality of life; mMFT, modified Munich Fitness Test; OMD&#x000ae;, optimised mixed diet; PHOKI Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised; RKI, Robert Koch-Institute; YSR, Youth Self Report.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="40608_2016_110_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S5.</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.spirit-statement.org/publications-downloads/">http://www.spirit-statement.org/publications-downloads/</ext-link>.
