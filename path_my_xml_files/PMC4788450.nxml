In these areas, some subjects who are heavily infected (microfilaraemia &#x0003e; 30 000 microfilariae/ml blood) can develop severe and serious adverse reactions to ivermectin. In rare cases, these have been fatal. A way of preventing these reactions could be to administer a treatment that decreases the microfilareamia in all subjects below the risk level before mass treatment with ivermectin. Building on results of previous studies, this randomised placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of two or six doses of albendazole administered every two months on the microfilaraemia of <italic>Loa loa</italic>. Six doses led to a decrease in microfilaraemia by at least 50% for at least four months in 53% of participants.

It is estimated that at least 14.4 million people live in loiasis endemic areas [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Clinical manifestations include chronic intense itching and transient localized edema [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The chronic eosinophilia observed in infected individuals has been associated with endomyocardial fibrosis and related heart failure [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Spontaneous encephalitis has been described in some heavily infected patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As for other neglected tropical diseases, the limited geographic distribution of loiasis and the fact that it mainly affects poor rural populations have limited research on this disease [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>There is currently no safe and effective treatment. Diethylcarbamazine is effective against the larvae and adult <italic>Loa loa</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but can cause serious adverse reactions (SAR, for definition see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004492.t001">Table 1</xref> [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), such as meningoencephalitis, which can be fatal [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The rapid and massive effect of ivermectin on <italic>Loa loa</italic> blood-dwelling microfilariae can also lead to severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004492.t001">Table 1</xref> [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), including SARs such as a cerebral malaria-like encephalopathy which requires hospitalization, can lead to coma and is often fatal [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The mechanisms of these adverse reactions are not well understood. Three mechanisms have been postulated, including (1) the obstruction of the cerebral microcirculation in consequence of massive amounts of paralyzed or dead microfilariae, (2) the penetration of live microfilariae into the brain tissue following treatment, and (3) the inflammatory processes in the brain resulting from massive release of antigen from dead microfilariae [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pntd.0004492.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004492.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Adverse event terminology and definitions.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pntd.0004492.t001g" xlink:href="pntd.0004492.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Term (Abbreviation)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Definition [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adverse event (AE)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adverse drug reaction (ADR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">For marketed medicinal products: A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of physiological function.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">For new medicinal products or new uses of approved products: all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">- results in death,</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">- is life-threatening,</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>NOTE</italic>: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">- requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be considered serious.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Note: The terms 'serious' and 'severe' are not synonymous.

The relatively low number of participants with known pre-treatment LLM and adverse event data available from prospective studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] together with the likely underreporting of SARs and non-serious ADRs and the lack of pre-treatment LLM values from mass treatment with ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], do not permit a definition of the minimum pre- treatment LLM that puts subjects at risk for development of severe ADRs and/or SARs. The study by Gardon and colleagues showed that a pre-treatment LLM &#x02265;8100mf/ml is associated with significantly increased risk of 'marked reactions' (defined by the investigators as reactions accompanied by functional impairment requiring assistance for several days) as well as 'serious reactions' (SR, including (a) non-neurological reactions associated with functional impairment which required at least a week of full-time assistance to resume normal activities and (b) reactions with objective neurological signs with hospital admission). It was estimated that participants with pre-treatment LLM &#x02265;50000 mf/ml were 1000 times more likely to develop SR and that those with LLM &#x0003e;30000 were more than 200 times more likely to develop SR than non-infected participants [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) are two of the 17 neglected tropical diseases according to the WHO classification (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/">http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/</ext-link>). The number of people at risk of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> infection was estimated to be 113.5 million, and those at risk of LF to be 1.34 billion worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The cornerstone of the fight against onchocerciasis and LF in highly endemic areas in Africa is mass community treatment with ivermectin (Mectizan) alone and in combination with albendazole, respectively.</p><p>In loiasis endemic areas where onchocerciasis is mesoendemic or hyperendemic (i.e. prevalence of onchocercal skin nodules in adult males aged &#x02265;20 years higher than 20% and 40% respectively), ivermectin mass treatment is justifiable because the benefit of preventing onchocerciasis associated morbidity outweighs the risk of loiasis-related post-treatment adverse reactions [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In LF and loiasis co-endemic areas, the control of LF has not yet or only recently started, partly because of the risk of loiasis-related post-treatment SAEs [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This puts the planned elimination of LF at risk [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. WHO has recently suggested a provisional strategy for interruption of LF transmission in loiasis-endemic areas based on biannual treatment with albendazole complemented with vector control [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Studies in Senegal and Mali have shown that 15&#x02013;17 years of annual or biannual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) can result in elimination of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> infection following long term CDTI has been reduced significantly in many other areas [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consequently, the objectives of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control were expanded from elimination of onchocerciasis as a public health problem to elimination of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> transmission where feasible [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This may require treatment of onchocerciasis in hypoendemic areas co-endemic with loiasis. A treatment that can safely reduce LLM below the risk threshold for severe ADRs and SARs for a time sufficiently long to implement ivermectin mass treatment, would be a major contribution to efforts to control and eliminate onchocerciasis and LF. Such a treatment may also be beneficial for patients suffering from loiasis.</p><p>Previous trials of the effect of short-term albendazole treatments (1 to 21 days) have shown that albendazole results in a slow reduction of LLM, presumably not due to a microfilaricidal effect but to an effect on the reproductive capacity and/or viability of the macrofilariae. In these studies, the reduction in LLM was either not as extensive as required and/or the study did not include significant number of participants with LLM &#x0003e; 30000 mf/ml [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The LLM time course in these studies and comparison of the effect of different doses evaluated led to the hypothesis that multiple exposure of the <italic>Loa loa</italic> macrofilariae to albendazole at two months intervals may result in a significant and sustained reduction in LLM.</p><p>We report findings from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate whether 2 and/or 6 doses of 800mg albendazole administered at two-months intervals can reduce <italic>Loa loa</italic> microfilaraemia in patients with pre-treatment LLM &#x0003e;15000 mf/ml by at least 50% or even to &#x0003c;8100mf/ml for at least 4 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN25831558">http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN25831558</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and intervention</title><p>This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with three parallel treatment arms.

In contrast to our study, these studies included participants with pre-treatment LLM &#x0003c;8100 mf/ml, no or an unspecified number of participants with LLM &#x0003e; 30000 mf/ml and the results were presented only via summary statistics across all participants [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The cost-benefit of further efforts to improve an albendazole based treatment regimen, e.g. through sustained release formulation technology, for LLM reduction needs to be carefully considered. These considerations need to take into account the dose- and time-dependent pharmacokinetics of albendazole, including the inter-subject variability in albendazole bioavailability and conversion to the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, the fact that albendazole induces its own disposal during long term treatment resulting in decreasing levels of albendazole sulfoxide [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the potential toxicity associated with long term exposure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/020666s009lbl.pdf">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/020666s009lbl.pdf</ext-link>) and the time and cost to develop an affordable, safe and efficacious dose. These considerations also need to include the alternative drugs and approaches in development. An oral flubendazole formulation is now being evaluated for clinical development for onchocerciasis [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Prior clinical data suggest that flubendazole does not have a microfilaricidal effect, but leads to a slow reduction in microfilariae levels through an effect on the <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> macrofilariae [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Large scale efforts to discover novel antibiotics targeting the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts in the filariae that cause onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are under way [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Doxycycline treatment of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> infected individuals has provided proof-of-concept for the effect of antibiotics on the reproductive activity and viability of the macrofilariae without microfilaricidal activity [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One study of doxycycline in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic> infected people included 22 people with a pre-treatment LLM of &#x0003c; 8000 mf/ml. No adverse events of the type and severity observed after ivermectin treatment of people with high LLM were reported[<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Alternate approaches to onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control in <italic>Loa loa</italic> co-endemic areas are under evaluation. This includes development of diagnostics for high levels of infection with <italic>Loa loa</italic> to identify individuals at risk for severe ADRs and/or SARs to ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. If the ongoing field testing is successful, <italic>Loa loa</italic> infected individuals at risk of ADRs/SARs and co-infected with <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic>, could be treated with regimens of antibiotics already shown to be effective against <italic>O</italic>. <italic>volvulus</italic>. The implementation of this approach, including the 'cut-off' for exclusion from ivermectin treatment and the time between LLM measurements and treatment, needs to take into account the substantial intra-individual LLM variability observed in the absence of treatment in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004492.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004492.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004492.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Research on LLM variability within shorter intervals than the 1&#x02013;4 months in our study may be needed to inform the maximum time frame between LLM measurement and safe ivermectin treatment.</p><p>The level of variability we observed in the absence as well as during and after treatment has to our knowledge not previously been reported. It needs to be taken into account during review of the other studies which evaluated the effect of albendazole regimens on LLM based on summary statistics [<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004492.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Analysis of the data from this study via geometric mean LLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004492.g002">Fig 2</xref>), shows a progressive LLM decrease in the 6x albendazole arm from M2-M14 to around 50% of pretreatment levels. Only the review of the individual participant data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004492.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004492.t003">Table 3</xref>) showed that this mean decrease was driven by only a few individuals and that start time relative to treatment and the duration of LLM decrease differed between individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004492.t004">Table 4</xref>). Any treatment to ensure safe ivermectin mass treatment has, however, to reduce LLM below the level of risk in all to be treated with ivermectin and the start time relative to treatment and the duration of the LLM decrease below the risk level needs to reliable. Consequently, LLM variability needs to be taken into account in the design, analysis and reporting of all future studies on the efficacy and safety of drugs or strategies for addressing loiasis as an obstacle for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control and elimination and as a neglected disease that can negatively impact people's health, well-being and health care costs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004492.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004492.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004492.s002"><label>S1 Database</label><caption><title><italic>Loa loa</italic> Alben Trial data.</title><p>Variables: Loa Mx- <italic>Loa loa</italic> mf/50 &#x003bc;l at month x, Perstans Mx- <italic>Mansonella perstans</italic> mf/50 &#x003bc;lat month x.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004492.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004492.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol of the trial with amendment.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004492.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the population of the Ebolowa Health District who took part in this trial.
