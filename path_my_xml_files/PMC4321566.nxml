Numerous in vitro studies have shown the impact of mechanical forces on fibroblasts through mechanotransduction, which consists of the conversion of mechanical signals to biochemical responses. Such responses are characterized by the modulation of gene expression coding not only for extracellular matrix components (collagens, elastin, etc.) but also for degradation enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases [TIMPs]). A new device providing a mechanical stimulation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue has been used in a simple, blinded, controlled, and randomized study.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Thirty subjects (aged between 35 years and 50 years), with clinical signs of skin sagging, were randomly assigned to have a treatment on hemiface. After a total of 24 sessions with M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation&#x02122;, biopsies were performed on the treated side and control area for in vitro analysis (dosage of hyaluronic acid, elastin, type I collagen, MMP9; equivalent dermis retraction; GlaSbox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; n=10) and electron microscopy (n=10). Furthermore, before and after the treatment, clinical evaluations and self-assessment questionnaire were done.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In vitro analysis showed increases in hyaluronic acid, elastin, type I collagen, and MMP9 content along with an improvement of the migratory capacity of the fibroblasts on the treated side. Electron microscopy evaluations showed a clear dermal remodeling in relation with the activation of fibroblast activity. A significant improvement of different clinical signs associated with skin aging and the satisfaction of the subjects were observed, correlated with an improvement of the sagging cheek.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation is a noninvasive and safe technique delivered by flaps microbeats at various frequencies, which can significantly improve the skin trophicity. Results observed with objective measurements, ie, in vitro assessments and electron microscopy, confirm the firming and restructuring effect clinically observed.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>skin rejuvenation</kwd><kwd>skin sagging</kwd><kwd>mechanical stimulation</kwd><kwd>fibroblast synthesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibroblasts are the most abundant cells in the dermis. They play a major role in synthesizing collagen and elastic fibers, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix. They also develop contractile forces required for matrix remodeling and migration activities.</p><p>Skin aging is characterized by changes in the function and structure of the dermis. With aging, the skin tends to become thinner, drier, and less elastic. Fibroblastic dysfunction is one of the main markers of skin aging. This abnormal proliferation, differentiation, and synthesis of fibroblasts result in structural and functional skin changes. Phenotypic studies about wrinkle fibroblasts showed that the remarkable change in mechanical properties of the skin with aging is indeed due to reduced contractile capacity as well as reduced migration activity of wrinkle fibroblasts.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Early in 1911, Dr Lucien Jacquet observed that progressive gradual mechanical excitation of the skin (gradual progression in frequency and duration of treatment) is supposed to counteract the age-related loss of the firmness of the face, neck, and upper chest skin.<xref rid="b2-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>More recently, it has been shown that fibroblasts contain a molecular machinery to convert mechanical stimuli into responses that influence tissue remodeling. In vitro studies demonstrated that they are able to change their behavior and induce complex cascades of biochemical events in extracellular matrix.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, mechanical stimuli lead to a &#x0201c;synthetic&#x0201d; fibroblast phenotype characterized by the induction of connective tissue synthesis while simultaneously inhibiting matrix degradation; in mechanically &#x0201c;stressed&#x0201d; lattices, stress fiber and focal adhesion formation by fibroblasts have been observed.<xref rid="b6-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Mechanical stimulation performed on the skin surface sends a signal to the distant cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes and causes production of collagen, elastin, and activation of lipolysis. Loss of mechanical tension appears to be the major factor underlying decreased collagen synthesis in aged skin; an aging-related loss of fibroblast interaction with the surrounding fibrous matrix has also been shown, leading to the vicious cycle of diminished procollagen synthesis, disorganization of collagen bundles, and further loss of mechanical stimulation of fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts (active fibroblasts characterized by &#x003b1;-smooth muscle (SM)-actin protein expression) play a central role in scarring and cell migration and motility within the connective tissue.<xref rid="b7-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Fibroblast and collagen fibers presented alignment along the stretching axis upon axial stimulation, compared to free-floating lattices.<xref rid="b8-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>A previous study using a technique based on mechanical stimulation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues has shown that this technique is able to restart their natural production of collagen and elastin by delivering microbeats to the skin&#x02019;s surface, which can stimulate cell rejuvenation in-depth.<xref rid="b9-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, the evaluations were performed on the arm skin, and it was not clear if these results could be generalized to the face as well.</p><p>In the present study, a mechanical stimulation has been applied on the facial skin for 24 sessions over 8 weeks. The primary aim was to assess the clinical and macroscopic effect of mechanical stimulation on the facial skin. The secondary aim was to investigate the mechanism of action of this technique at the cellular level by measuring contractile activity of the fibroblasts and quantifying the skin changes induced by fibroblastic activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This is a monocentric, double-blinded, controlled, and randomized interventional study on the effects of a technique called M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation&#x02122;.</p><sec><title>Volunteers</title><p>Thirty healthy subjects (20 females and 10 males) aged 35&#x02013;50 years were enrolled in this study.

All volunteers signed an informed consent form in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki after having enough time to understand the modalities and the aim of the study. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee (CPP [Comit&#x000e9;s de Protection des Personnes] Est II) and the National French Health Authorities (ANSM [L&#x02019;Agence nationale de s&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; du M&#x000e9;dicament et des produits de sant&#x000e9;]).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>The treatment was applied on one side of the face (randomized hemiface: chin, nasolabial fold, cheek, cheekbone, temple, forehead) during 15 minutes, three times per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions). In order to standardize the treatment, all treatments were performed by the same practitioner. The treatment was carried out via the M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation system (LPG Systems, Valence, France), which transforms manual massage movements through mechanical procedures by means of different treatment heads. The treatment heads used in this study are composed of two motorized flaps inside a treatment chamber, which are dedicated to the treatment of the face or small areas. The treatment forces are exerted without any pinching or twisting of the skin but through combining both horizontal and vertical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-10-387">Figure 2</xref>). These heads contain a small engine allowing the flaps to vibrate in a regular repeated way, which is accompanied with aspiration.</p><p>Different parameters (intensity and rhythm of the aspiration and beating frequency of the flaps) can be modulated at any time according to the individual sensitivity and tissue state (infiltrated, loosened, or wrinkled skin).</p><p>Lift heads used in this study were &#x0201c;motorized&#x0201d;: heads contain a small engine allowing the flaps to beat in a regular and permanent way, synchronized specifically with the sequential aspiration.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement</title><p>Evaluations were performed before the treatment (T0), after 24 sessions (T1), and 1 month after the end of the treatment (T2). Volunteers were evaluated in the standard skin situation (last face washing the night before measuring sessions, without any cosmetic application until the measures [no water, soap, cream, or makeup]). During the study, they were also asked to not change their facial skin care habits, hygiene, and cosmetic products, to avoid sun exposure and UV treatment even occasionally, to avoid any medical and invasive treatment on the face, and to report systemically any medication consumption to the investigator. All evaluations and measurements were performed under standard conditions (constant temperature 20&#x000b0;C&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C and hygrometry 40&#x000b0;C&#x02013;60&#x000b0;C) after a 20-minute rest period.</p><p>The main evaluation criterion was clinical scoring for skin sagging using a photographic scale. The secondary outcomes were clinical scoring of skin relief and wrinkles, skin color and radiance, and subject self-assessments. The biopsies were taken from both sides of the face (treatment and control side) from 19 subjects, nine for histopathologic changes and ten for the in vitro evaluation of the fibroblasts for their contractile capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome, measured at T0 and T1, was the facial skin sagging quotation performed by a blinded dermatologist, thanks to a clinical scoring based on the six-grade scale of Ezure et al<xref rid="b11-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and carried out on three different locations: upper part of the cheek/nasolabial folds (B zone), lower part of the cheeks (C zone), and lateral part of the cheek (D zone), as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cia-10-387">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec><title>Clinical scoring</title><p>A blinded dermatologist evaluated the different signs of skin aging, with each criterion being assessed on both treated and nontreated side.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Skin radiance: A clinical scoring of skin radiance was calculated through a visual analysis scale (CLBT&#x02122;) which includes seven descriptors.

The samples were placed in sterile gauze moistened with saline and immediately treated: Each biopsy was placed in a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> culture dish and was allowed to adhere to the plastic surface for approximately 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Three milliliters of Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 40 mg/mL of gentamicin, and 2 mg/mL of fungizone (DMEMc) were added to each dish. The dishes were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Subculture of fibroblasts was established after 3&#x02013;4 weeks of outgrowth by trypsination (trypsin-EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetique) [1x]; PAA laboratory, France) of explant cultures. The culture medium was changed two times a week. Fibroblasts cultivated in passages lower than ten were used.</p><sec><title>Migratory capacity</title><p>Fibroblasts that were either subjected or not subjected to M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation were embedded in three-dimensional hydrated collagen, using a modified version of the technique developed by Bell et al<xref rid="b13-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, to study their mechanical behavior by measuring their capacity to contract free-floating lattices. Collagen lattices were made by mixing six volumes of 1.76&#x000d7; concentrated medium, three volumes of rat tail type I collagen solution (2 mg/mL), and one volume of fibroblasts suspension (8&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL). This mixture was poured into plastic Petri dishes (60 mm diameter). The gel polymerized in &#x0003c;30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Culture medium was then added and changed every 48 hours. To measure the retracted lattice diameter, the culture dishes were placed on a transparent metric scale. The measurement of the lattice diameter was performed for 10 days. The evaluation of the migratory capacities of fibroblasts makes it possible to show the possible reorganization of extracellular matrix in the presence of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Measurements of contractile forces developed by fibroblasts in GlaSbox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Growing Lattice Study box)</title><p>The cell chamber was composed of eight rectangular culture cavities in which the lattices developed. Two silicon beams were placed opposite to each other with strain gauges hanging apart, down into each cavity at 27 mm distance. The lattice was attached to this sensor through a grid directly etched onto the lower part of the beams. The output signal from the strain gauges was amplified, then converted, and collected by a computer, which included an acquisition card and a specific software giving the forces in real time. Fibroblasts were prepared as defined in the previous paragraph; the lattice mixture was poured into a rectangular culture cavity of the GlaSbox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and polymerized in &#x0003c;30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Two milliliters of culture medium was added. The GlaSbox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was then placed into a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C, and force measurements were started immediately and for 24 hours. The results were expressed as contractile forces (arbitrary unit) of the fibroblasts either subjected or not subjected to M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation according to the time. These measurements quantify the contractile forces of fibroblasts and make it possible to know whether a treatment applied for 15 minutes, three times per week during 8 weeks (24 sessions) already shows a &#x0201c;lifting&#x0201d; effect at the scale of fibroblasts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Synthesis studies</title><p>Fibroblasts either subjected or not subjected to M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation were seeded in 12-cavity plates at 0.04&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells per cavity. The plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. The next day, 500 &#x003bc;L of DMEMc was poured into each cavity and the plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. After 48 hours, the supernatant part was placed in a protease inhibitor cocktail (10% v/v, Merck Millipore, Fontenay sous bois, France). The samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Collagen I, hyaluronic acid, matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) assay</title><p>The quantification was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (USCN, Life Science and RayBiotech<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Inc). Standards or samples were added into the precoated cavities with a specific biotin-conjugated antibody. After washing the samples, avidin (collagen I and hyaluronic acid) or streptavidin (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were added to each cavity and then incubated. After adding the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution, only those cavities that contained study substances showed a color change. The enzyme&#x02013;substrate reaction is terminated by the addition of sulfuric acid solution and the color change is measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. The concentration is then determined by comparing the optical density of the samples to the standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Elastin assay</title><p>The total soluble elastin was assayed by a colorimetric method (Fastin&#x02122; Elastin Assay; Biocolor). The samples were precipitated with a solution of trichloroacetic acid and arginine, then the reagent 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21,23-porphine tetra-sulfonate was added, which can particularly bind to elastin. The formed complex was dissociated by a solution of guanidine-HCl and propan-1-ol. The developed color was measured at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiscan EX; Thermo).</p><sec><title>Ultrastructural studies</title><p>Two-millimeter punch biopsies were taken under local anesthesia (1% xylocain) from the jugular area of ten other subjects (five males and five females) at T1.

For standard morphological examination, the glutaraldehyde-fixed fragments were washed and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 hours. After dehydration in graded ethanol series, the fragments were impregnated and embedded in epoxy resins (60&#x000b0;C for 3 days). Ultrafine sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation.</p><p>The paraformaldehyde-fixed fragments, used for immunocytochemistry, were washed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin (UVA polymerization at 4&#x000b0;C; EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA). Ultrafine sections on formvar-coated nickel grids (EMS) were exposed to the &#x003b1;-SM-actin antibody (diluted 1/50, overnight at 4&#x000b0;C), washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 hour with goat anti-mouse antibodies coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold (diluted 1/10; Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). After final washes in PBS and distilled water, the sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate alone.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy of all specimens was performed, and digital images were obtained and analyzed. Density and overall quality of the dermal fibrous structures, ie, collagen bundles and elastic fibers, were evaluated semiquantitatively.

Fibroblasts that produce and organize the collagen matrix cannot attach to fragmented collagen. Loss of attachment prevents fibroblasts from receiving mechanical information from their support, and they collapse. Stretch is critical for normal balanced production of collagen and collagen-degrading enzymes.<xref rid="b17-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Then, in aged skin, collapsed fibroblasts produce low levels of collagen and high levels of collagen-degrading enzymes.<xref rid="b7-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>During the aging process, the proteoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, which has a high affinity for water, are less synthesized, and the contractile activity of fibroblasts decreases. Fibroblasts are losing their ability to express &#x003b1;-SM-actin and to differentiate into myofibroblasts. This induces lower forces of contraction on the extracellular matrix and a decrease of mechanical tension of the skin, producing a loss of elasticity and tonicity of the dermis.</p><p>Previous trials studied the effect of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation and showed its ability to reinduce natural production of collagen and elastin.<xref rid="b9-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In the present study, 30 subjects underwent 24 sessions of treatment on the face with the M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation in order to understand its effects through clinical, biological, and histological evaluations.</p><p>The results indicated that, while nonstatistically significant, a trend for a clinical improvement of skin sagging (the primary outcome) was observed, with an improvement of at least one parameter of the facial skin sagging clinical score<xref rid="b11-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in 73% of subjects. The location where the mechanostimulation was less efficient was the upper part of the cheek/nasolabial fold, while a clinical improvement of the sagging was observed in 70% of subjects either on the lower part or the lateral part of the cheek. This result is in accordance with the fact that structural skin changes, such as sagging and wrinkling, clearly originate due to alterations in the dermis, which is a tissue with slow turnover.</p><p>Indeed, the macroscopic clinical signs of wrinkles and firmness did not show any particular change over a 6-month period<xref rid="b18-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> while in the present study only 24 sessions of treatment over 8 weeks were performed. The wrinkle formation and sagging of the facial skin are long-term cumulative effects and would not be particularly affected by 8 weeks of treatment, so it is recommended to perform long-term studies in this field, as already reported in other studies.<xref rid="b19-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A longer treatment period could also enhance the visible changes over the treatment period.</p><p>In accordance with the latter observation, all the clinical scores for skin complexion radiance evaluated by the CLBT scale<xref rid="b12-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> were significantly upgraded after treatment.

This could reinforce the skin global improvement of the subjects from a clinical point of view, considering that skin relief, color, radiance, and sagging are strongly interrelated in the aging process also.</p><p>Self-assessment questionnaires expressed significant results in efficiency of the treatment for parameters such as wrinkles, roughness, nasolabial folds, elasticity, firmness, skin radiance, softness, and under-eye dark circles. After 24 treatment sessions, the patients found their skin firmer, smoother, less wrinkled and less sagged, with stable effect 1 month after last treatment session.</p><p>These results, together with the fact that between 90% and 100% (T1 and T2) of the volunteers were satisfied by this technique and that between 70% and 75% (T1 and T2) of the volunteers declared their wish to continue the treatment underlined both positive objective and subjective efficacy of this method.</p><p>Beyond these aspects, the use of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation is considered to increase the synthesis of some extracellular matrix components, particularly MMP-9. The composition and organization of extracellular matrix components are governed by MMPs.<xref rid="b22-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> MMPs play major roles in tissue regeneration and remodeling. MMP-9 protein expression has been reported in the epidermal cells of acute wounds.<xref rid="b23-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> MMP-9 catalyzes the cleavage of denatured collagens of all types present in aged skin and the components of natural basement membrane as well.<xref rid="b24-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Stimulation of MMP-9 synthesis explained no significant change in collagen I production in this study. No change in contractile forces developed by fibroblasts subjected to the action of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation was shown compared to control fibroblasts. These results indicate that the 24 sessions of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation are not enough in order to show a &#x0201c;lifting&#x0201d; effect at the scale of fibroblasts. However, the cell migration was faster due to the mechanical stimulations and could suggest a beneficial effect of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation on migratory and remodeling capacities. A significant increase in the synthesis of MMP-9 and the increase of fibroblasts migration suggest a beneficial early action of mechanical stimulation on the synthesis of extracellular matrix components. M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation stimulates the decreased cell activity found in aged skin through cellular mechanotransduction.</p><p>The results suggest that a prolonged action of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation might provide a significant difference in the synthesis of extracellular matrix components such as collagen I, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. The expected changes include improvement of contraction forces and the components of the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Ultrastructural histopathologic positive changes observed in four out of ten study subjects correlated well with the clinical and biochemical findings. One of the most striking features observed with electron microscopy was apparent restructuring of the fragmented elastin fibers. Although it is difficult to differentiate them from newly synthesized elastic fibers or from the degradation of the fiber remnants, there is some evidence confirming that the mechanically stimulated skin could recycle this functionally important component of the extracellular matrix. However, the restructuring effects were less remarkable than those observed after long-term treatment with topical cream containing vitamin C.<xref rid="b25-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Formation of stress fibers and their attachment to focal adhesions via vinculin have been demonstrated as hallmarks of fibroblast organization in collagen lattices subjected to tension.<xref rid="b6-cia-10-387" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Accordingly, the overall increase in &#x003b1;-SM-actin expression on the treated side in half of the cases might support our clinical and biochemical results pointing to the morphological improvement. Yet, expression of actin stress fibers by dermal fibroblasts appeared to be a less reliable feature in the evaluation of the tissue response to mechanical constrains. Labeling of the &#x003b1;-SM-actin was observed in all biopsies, either from the treated or control sides, although the level of expression varied among the cells within the same biopsy and/or between the subjects.</p><p>Our results confirm then the restructuring potential of the physical stimulation procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this original study allowed observing and demonstrating not only the clinical and visible immediate results but also the internal mechanisms of the skin through an external, noninvasive, and painless stimulation.</p><p>The study provides the evidence that the use of M&#x000e9;cano-Stimulation, a technique based on the application of mechanical stimuli of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue by delivering microbeats to the skin&#x02019;s surface, is able to induce clinically identifiable improvement in facial skin appearance. This improvement is associated with a tendency to increase the synthesis of extracellular matrix components.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was made possible by the help and support of the volunteers, technicians, and research engineers at our center; we gratefully acknowledge Mrs Aur&#x000e9;lie Durai, Vanessa Ecarnot, and Celine Thiebaud for their enthusiasm in carrying out the sensitive and accurate care and evaluation and Mrs Cl&#x000e9;lia Monteux and Mr Christian Gagni&#x000e8;re for providing us with the device.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors certify that there is no conflict of interest with any financial organization regarding the research described in the article.
