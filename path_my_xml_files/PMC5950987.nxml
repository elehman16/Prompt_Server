The jet injector administers insulin at a high velocity (typically &#x0003e;100 m/s) directly across the skin into the subcutaneous tissue, where it is dispersed in a spray-like pattern which facilitates its uptake into the circulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We have previously shown, both in healthy volunteers and in patients with diabetes, that insulin absorption from the subcutaneous tissue is considerably enhanced when insulin is administered by a jet injector instead of a conventional pen.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This enhancement leads to a 40-50% advancement in the time to reach the maximal glucose-lowering effect,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> a shorter duration of insulin action,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and a faster correction of incidental marked hyperglycemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>For such an improved insulin effect to become clinically relevant, it needs to be reproducible.

Prior studies have shown that the intraindividual variability of the metabolic effect of regular human insulin and of rapid-acting insulin analogues is still considerable, varying between 10-30%, when administered by needle and syringe.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Studies published in the 1980s suggested about similar intraindividual variability for regular human insulin when injected by jet stream as compared to administration by needle and syringe.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> There are no data on the intraindividual variability of the pharmacology of rapid-acting insulin analogues, when administered by jet injection.

The pharmacological variability of insulin administered by the two devices was largely, but not entirely, similar. In particular, the time until maximal insulin concentration was less variable after jet injection than after conventional administration, whereas the maximal insulin concentration was more variable. There were no differences in the variability of other pharmacokinetic endpoints or in that of the pharmacodynamic endpoints between the two devices.</p><p>The disparities with regard to the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters between insulin administered by jet injection or by conventional means were not mirrored by such differences in the more clinically relevant pharmacodynamic endpoints. Therefore, the play of chance cannot be excluded and the implications for clinical practice are probably limited. The intraindividual CV for the time to maximal glucose-lowering effect (T-GIR<sub>max</sub>) tended to be somewhat greater after jet than after conventional injection. Notably, this greater variability of jet injection was due to the ~40% advancement of insulin&#x02019;s time-action profile (the denominator of the equation) rather than to an actual extension in intraindividual time differences (the numerator). The &#x0201c;predictability&#x0201d; of the insulin effect will thus be of similar magnitude for the two devices, when used in daily clinical practice.</p><p>Our results extend those of two previous studies that compared the variability of regular human insulin administered by jet injection with that by needle and syringe.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> One study investigated the variability in insulin levels after injection of 10 units of regular insulin in 8 patients with type 1 diabetes. The authors found comparable intraindividual variation in peak insulin levels and time to peak levels for the two injection methods,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> albeit slightly higher than what we found with aspart insulin. The second study reported comparable intraindividual variability of both insulin effect and insulin action for jet injection and injection by syringes in healthy volunteers, based on two glucose clamps, although one of the clamps had a duration of only 4 hours.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Our data are also in line with a study investigating the variability of insulin aspart. When injected by syringes in healthy volunteers, intraindividual CVs for pharmacodynamic parameters ranged from 11 to 21% and those for pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 to 16%.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Finally, in a study among patients with type 1 diabetes, the variability in T-INS<sub>max</sub> for insulin aspart administered by subcutaneous pump was 27%.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The present observations should be seen in the context of the more rapid glucose-lowering effect of insulin after jet injection. We have previously shown that this reduces the postprandial hyperglycemic burden and advances the correction of marked hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that these benefits can be sustained with repeated injections. This is important, since high variability in the absorption and action of insulin impacts on glucose variability, which not only hampers efforts to achieve optimal glucose control, but also affects patient&#x02019;s wellbeing and trust in insulin therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Limitations of our study include the parallel study design, which was chosen over a cross-over design for practical reasons, and the small sample size, so that we cannot prove with statistical certainty that the pharmacological variability of the two devices are similar. When using the data from this study, power calculations show that with a power of 80% and a significance level of .05, 63 participants in each study arm would be necessary to demonstrate superiority. However, since the confidence intervals for the main outcome parameters largely overlapped (data not shown, but available upon request), such statistical prove may have limited relevance for daily clinical practice. A second limitation is that the healthy, young volunteers enrolled in this study do not necessarily represent the majority of patients, certainly not those with type 2 diabetes. However, although variability of the insulin effect may be greater in patients with diabetes,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the impact of clinical parameters on the pharmacokinetic variability of rapid-acting insulin has been reported small.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Third, we used &#x0201c;empty injections&#x0201d; as placebo, since prefilled insulin pens with placebo solution (Testmedium&#x000ae;) are not registered for human use. We do not think this caused a major bias since the same injection was used twice in each participant, an independent research nurse carried out the injections to assure blinding of researcher and participant, and the injections still looked and felt like a real insulin injection. Fourth, the laboratory assay we used was not specific for insulin aspart, which meant that it did not discriminate between insulin aspart and endogenous insulin. However, since we clamped glucose values below each individuals&#x02019; fasting glucose levels, we expect their endogenous insulin production to be suppressed and therefore negligible.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Finally, this study was not designed to assess the impact of factors relating to the site of injection, handling of the injection pen and the technique of injecting insulin on the variability of insulin.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1932296817699638" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Notably, the jet injector differs from conventional pens in that specific training is required to fill the device with the correct amount of insulin, to remove air bubbles from the nozzle, and to apply the right amount of pressure when putting the device to the skin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-1932296817699638"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the variability in glucose-lowering effect is considerable, but broadly comparable for jet injection and conventional pen administration.
