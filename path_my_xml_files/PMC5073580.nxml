Evidence-based psychosocial interventions to meet their specific needs are currently lacking. YP Face IT, developed by the UK's Centre for Appearance Research in collaboration with clinical experts and young people, is an innovative online psychosocial intervention designed to offer this group immediate support, advice and coping strategies. It has been endorsed by young people, their parents/carers, GPs, clinical psychologists and health professionals working with those affected by appearance-related conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Young people aged 12&#x02013;17 with an appearance-altering condition/injury that self-identify as experiencing appearance-related distress, teasing or bullying will be invited to participate via GP practices and UK charities. Consenting participants will be randomised to the intervention (YP Face IT) or the treatment as usual (TAU) control group. Outcome measures will be completed by young people and their parents/carers at baseline, 13, 26 and 52&#x02005;weeks. Primary outcome measures will be the Body Esteem Scale and the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents. Participants will complete other health-related outcome measures and resource use questionnaires for health economic analysis. We will assess recruitment rates, acceptability of the YP Face IT programme, adherence and retention to treatment, questionnaire completion rates, variation of TAU in Primary Care and the feasibility of GP practice staff supervising young people's use of YP Face IT.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This feasibility trial protocol (V.1, 3 March 2014), received a favourable ethical opinion from the NRES Committee South West-Frenchay (reference number 14/SW/0058). Findings will be disseminated through academic peer-reviewed publications, conferences and to participating GP practices and charities supporting those with conditions affecting appearance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/search?q=yp+face+it">ISRCTN40650639</ext-link>; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Appearance-related distress</kwd><kwd>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</kwd><kwd>Online intervention</kwd><kwd>Disfigurement</kwd><kwd>Visible Difference</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PB-PG-1112-29014</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first feasibility study to evaluate an online psychosocial intervention for young people living with a visible difference in an NHS Primary Care setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Public and patient involvement has informed the intervention and study design.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Feasibility data will be supplemented by qualitative data from young people, their parents/carers and GP practice staff.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participant outcomes, including 12-month follow-up, are self-reported.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants are not blinded to allocation and this could lead to reporting bias.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Looking &#x02018;different&#x02019; due to disease, treatments, injury or congenital conditions (eg, skin conditions, scarring, cleft lip and palate) can have a significant psychosocial impact during adolescence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> While it is important to highlight that many people living with a visible difference (&#x02018;disfigurement&#x02019;) adjust well to their condition and report increased well-being, self-acceptance and stronger social relationships,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> around a third of young people living with a visible difference suffer extensive and enduring difficulties, including bullying, low self-esteem, body image dissatisfaction, social anxiety and avoidance, poor quality of life and academic performance.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> Anxiety and avoidance interfere with social and emotional development and, if not addressed, can become chronic and disabling, leading to anxiety disorders which are an economic burden for society.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Research consistently shows that location, size and cause of a visible difference do not accurately predict levels of appearance-related distress.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

When combined with experiences of social stigma, these experiences can heighten social anxiety, resulting in individuals appearing distracted or anxious, which inhibits effective social functioning.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In a randomised controlled trial (RCT), Face IT reduced anxiety-related concerns and was comparable to a face-to-face CBT intervention.

YP Face IT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ypfaceit.co.uk">http://www.ypfaceit.co.uk</ext-link>) has attractive multimedia presentations and is appropriate for 12&#x02013;17&#x02005;years with a reading age of 12&#x02005;years and readability levels of 90&#x02013;100%.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Young people have endorsed YP Face IT over face-to-face therapy because it can be accessed in private, at their convenience and because they would feel less embarrassed/inhibited taking part.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Psychologists have welcomed its potential to address a current gap in care provision and to overcome barriers that prevent young people and parents using their services, including needing time off school/work, travelling, perceived stigma of therapy<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and social anxiety/avoidance: a defining characteristic of this group.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> GPs, parents and young people have also requested that YP Face IT be made widely available with minimal limitations on who can access it, as GPs report they struggle to identify appropriate evidence-based appearance-specific psychological interventions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, those with appearance-related distress rarely meet criteria for referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and many receiving secondary care for their condition have no, or limited, access to a psychologist.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Providing easily accessible interventions is in line with current policy<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and calls for innovations to improve access to primary care services.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>YP Face IT is an innovative, widely acceptable intervention offering immediate support, advice and strategies to young people affected by appearance-related distress, with potential benefits in terms of improved quality of life for a large and diverse user group.

Charities supporting those with a visible difference (eg, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.changingfaces.org.uk">http://www.changingfaces.org.uk</ext-link>) will be approached to ask them to advertise the study via their websites and newsletters to young people and parents. The main avenue for recruitment will be through primary care general practices that do not specialise in appearance-related issues; sites in Bristol and surrounding areas in the South West of the UK will be invited to take part. To increase representativeness of participants from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, we will aim to include practices with a range of index of multiple deprivation scores.</p><p>Based on advice from our YP Face IT advisory group (including GPs, parents/carers and young people), patients from GP practices will be made aware of the study in three ways; through targeted letters of invitation and, to enable introduction of the study to those whose appearance-altering condition is not recorded in their medical notes, via posters/leaflets displayed in the surgery and during consultations. How participants learnt about the study will be recorded to inform recruitment for a future RCT.</p><p>With the support of the West of England NIHR Clinical Research Network, a comprehensive list of conditions/injuries known to impact appearance were used to create a specific list of READ codes (medical diagnosis coding system used by practices). GP practices recruited to take part in the study will use these codes to identify eligible patients. GPs will review this list and at their discretion remove those deemed not suitable for invitation (eg, those whose condition has resolved). Young people will be posted an information pack, including a GP invitation letter and information sheet. For those under 16&#x02005;years, letters will be addressed to their parents/carers who will be asked to discuss participation with their child. A reminder will be sent 4&#x02005;weeks later to non-respondents, this will include a response form for indicating why they decided not to take part and self-addressed envelope.</p><p>Doctors and nurses from GP practices will be asked to recruit young people who meet the inclusion criteria during consultations. We anticipate that the GP practices we recruit will not have extensive experience of raising the topic of appearance with young people; therefore, GPs and nurses will receive training from the YP Face IT team on how to approach and sensitively introduce the study. Staff will provide interested young people with information sheets and leaflets. These will include details for contacting the research team. Posters, designed with input from the advisory group, will be displayed in participating practices inviting young people to contact their GP if the study is of relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Young people aged 12&#x02013;17&#x02005;years with any appearance-altering condition, injury or treatment side effect, who self-identify as experiencing appearance-related distress, teasing or bullying and their parent/carer will be eligible. The cause, location and severity of the visible difference will not be objectively assessed, as research consistently finds physical characteristics do not relate to distress levels.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Participants under 16&#x02005;years will require a parent/carer to join the study, those aged 16 or above will be encouraged to inform and involve their parent/carer, but this is not mandatory.

PTSD is a risk for those disfigured through trauma.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> GP practices will be asked to screen for study eligibility before inviting young people to participate. Confirmation of this eligibility will rely on parent and young people's self-report when the researcher speaks to them over the telephone before informed consent is obtained.

Remote randomisation will be provided by the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaborative based at the University of Bristol, with eligible participants randomised to &#x02018;Treatment as Usual&#x02019; (TAU-control group) or YP Face IT in addition to TAU (intervention group). Block randomisation will help ensure equal numbers in each practice are allocated to each condition. A pragmatic parallel-groups RCT, using current practice as the control arm, was acceptable to our advisory group and is the most methodologically robust design to measure self-report psychological outcomes. Randomisation will ensure that in the definitive trial, effects due to condition progression will be equally distributed across groups. Participants who meet our inclusion criteria and their parent/carer will be consented by the research team and asked to provide demographic information. At baseline, young people and their parent/carer will be asked to complete their outcome measures, consented participants will then be randomised to the TAU-control or intervention group. Owing to the nature of the intervention, neither the participants, GP practice staff nor researchers can be blinded to allocation. Participants will be informed that this is a feasibility study and that YP Face IT has not yet been proven effective.

Participants will also complete outcome measures at baseline and 13, 26 and 52-week follow-up. The intervention consists of 7 weekly sessions each lasting around 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;min, and a booster session 6&#x02005;weeks later to maintain therapeutic effect. Sessions provide advice and support in written, audio and video formats and include interactive and homework activities that teach and encourage users to practise strategies such as managing staring or bullying. Social skills, anxiety-management and CBT techniques are taught to overcome social anxiety and target negative appearance-related thoughts and behaviours that reduce self-esteem. Video inserts feature adolescent actors with a visible difference, who play different roles in scenarios scripted and created for the programme. Participants can hear testimonies from celebrity role models with appearance-altering conditions, learn from others who have adjusted positively to the challenges of living with a visible difference and can reflect on their own experiences via an online diary. To facilitate adherence to the intervention, participants identify a suitable day and time to complete their next session using the YP Face IT calendar. They (and a parent/carer if they choose) receive automated emails and/or texts 24 and 1&#x02005;hour before to remind them to complete the session. The content of YP Face IT is organised as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Session 1: Common problems</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 2: Improve your social skills</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 3: Don't be SCARED, REACH OUT</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 4: &#x02018;Think, Feel, Do&#x02019;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 5: SMART goals</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 6: Beating anxiety</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 7: Looking at your progress</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 8: Booster quiz</p></list-item></list></p><p>Young people randomised into the intervention group will receive an email with the YP Face IT website link and a secure username and password to access the intervention. Participants complete the intervention at home or in a location of their choice using a computer/tablet. Participants' use of the intervention will be monitored by the research team who have privileged access to data stored on the website. An administration area within YP Face IT records the participant's diary entries and qualitative responses to reflective activities and homework tasks and records their engagement with the website (pages viewed and time spent on each activity). In addition, to evaluate the feasibility of primary care staff supervising young people completing YP Face IT, 5&#x02013;8 practices will receive training to enable them to access data and monitor their own patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Trial design characteristics</title><p>We assessed the characteristics of the feasibility study using the pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator summary (PRECIS-2)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> in relation to eligibility, recruitment, study settings, flexibility of intervention delivery and adherence, follow-up, primary outcome and primary analysis. PRECIS is an accepted tool for assessing trial design on a continuum of effectiveness versus efficacy. Pragmatic trials aim to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in a real-life setting and with a study population that is similar as possible to those that will use it. Exploratory trials aim to explore whether the intervention can work under ideal conditions, whereas a pragmatic approach aims to explore whether the intervention works under usual conditions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>

We will liaise with companies providing similar computerised healthcare to estimate licence fee cost. Other resource use will be collected from baseline until 12-month follow-up by reviewing GP records and parent-completed resource use questionnaires. Participant questionnaires will be completed online at 13, 26 and 52-week follow-up by the YP or parent, and will include resource use required to deliver healthcare in the community, use of social services, private expenses (eg, make up, wigs) and productivity losses, including parent/carer time off work and children's days off school. We will further cross check patient-reported community healthcare resource use by asking participating GP practices to review young people's GP records at 52&#x02005;weeks.

No formal power calculations are undertaken in feasibility studies; instead, a suitable number of participants are recruited to gain knowledge about factors such as attrition and recruitment in relation to feasibility outcomes.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Using 10 sites, it is estimated a minimum of 100 young people would be eligible, with more than 60 providing consent for participation. These projected feasibility sample sizes allow consent percentage to be estimated with 95% confidence to within &#x000b1;11%. Under a worst-case scenario, the projected feasibility sample sizes would allow acceptability rates and completion rates to be estimated with error margins of &#x000b1;13%. Low participation in the TAU group would be a concern and a sample of 30 allocated to this group would have in excess of 80% power for detecting a 50% or lower participation rate against an anticipated rate 75% or higher and would therefore confidently discriminate between low and good participation rates.</p><p>Percentage missing values will be determined at each data collection stage and used to inform acceptability of the chosen outcome measures. Estimated participation rate per practice patient population and questionnaire completion percentages will be used to project the number of practices and sampling duration necessary for the sample size in an RCT. Simulation using participation rate information and response completion profiles of participants will inform these calculations. A feasibility sample size of 60 will ensure variation in individual questionnaire completion will be factored into the projected sample size determination. Findings will determine sensitivity to change of the proposed outcome measures and establish confidence in intervention effect. For a medium effect (Cohen's d=0.5), sample mean values for outcome measures based on 30 per group should align in the hypothesised direction of patient benefit &#x0223c;98% of the time. Sample sizes will permit SD of outcomes to be estimated within 25% of the true SD.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of participants is completed.

Online data provided by young people will be reviewed online and &#x02018;signed off&#x02019; each week by a researcher and a nurse/GP from their practice (if trained), who will check diary entries and qualitative data for safeguarding concerns (eg, signs of abuse or self-harm). Any concerns will be recorded as an adverse event, reported to the chief investigator and discussed with our clinical psychologist advisor who, if necessary, will make contact with the young person or parent/carer. Any further concerns or actions will be reported to the participant's GP who will respond following their usual protocols.

The data collected during the study will be essential to inform the design and delivery of a large-scale definitive trial. The need to improve support for young people distressed by appearance-altering conditions has been recognised by parents and NHS health professionals for some time.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Strengths of this study include the development of an innovative, easily accessible online intervention with the potential to improve outcomes for young people struggling with appearance-related concerns, a population who currently have limited access to evidence-based psychosocial support. However, there are some limitations to the study. First, allocation to TAU may be confounded if young people and their parents are disappointed and try to seek help elsewhere, however, this will be dependent on available alternative resources, which are currently limited. To account for this, we will record TAU received by participants via the health economic data collection tools, note reviews and participant interviews. Second, we require participants to have access to the internet and this might restrict access to those with lower socioeconomic status and is something to consider for the future RCT. Finally, the self-report measures selected might not be sensitive to all aspects of improvements and may result in reporting bias as young people will not be blinded to their allocation. Despite these limitations, if an RCT is considered feasible, in the future, we hope that YP Face IT will be made widely available throughout the NHS to support those young people with visible differences who are struggling with appearance-related distress.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> HW, DH, PW, EMRM, RP, LH and NR were involved in the study conception and design.
