exercise and deep trunk muscle exercise on the foot pressure of healthy adults. [Subjects]
The subjects were 30 healthy females and males who agreed to participate in this study.
There were two groups, a superficial trunk muscle exercise group and a deep trunk muscle
exercise group, with 15 participants in each. [Methods] The exercises were conducted 5
times a week for 4 weeks for both groups. A gait analyzer was used to measure foot plantar
pressure while walking on a plate. Participants were measured before starting the exercise
and after 4 weeks. The paired t-test was used to analyze the pre-and post-test results.
[Results] There were no significant differences in foot pressure in any region in the
superficial trunk muscle exercise group. In the deep trunk muscle exercise group, there
were statistically significant increase in F1, F4, F5, R1 and R3. In addition, there were
significant decreases in R2 and R4. [Conclusion] After the 4-week deep trunk muscle
exercise group decreases in foot pressure on the inner foot and increases on the outside
of the feet indicate normal and overall even distribution of body weight on the feet.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Superficial trunk muscle exercise</kwd><kwd>Deep trunk muscle exercise</kwd><kwd>Foot pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trunk stabilization exercises were developed in the late 1990s in order to improve the
stability and mobility of the spine by strengthening the deep trunk muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These stabilization exercises help to move
the spine during posture changes while maintaining a balanced, neutral spine position by
causing co-contractions and/or individual contractions of the deep trunk muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises can be prescribed as
therapies or as preventive measures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk stabilization muscles are categorized as deep or superficial. The deep trunk muscles
consist of the transversus abdominis, multifidus, quadratus lumborum, and rotatores muscles,
which attach to individual lumbar vertebrae and provide control and rigidity for the spinal
segments<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These muscles help prepare
the body for sudden movements by coordinating proprioception and activating small muscles in
the body<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A ball has been widely used as
an exercise method to increase trunk stabilization<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The superficial trunk muscles consist of the rectus abdominis,
internal oblique abdominal, external oblique abdominal, lateral quadratus lumborum, erector
spinae, and iliopsoas muscles. They do not directly attach to the vertebrae, so they only
stabilize pressurized spinal segments. These muscles respond to external loads which shift
the trunk&#x02019;s center of gravity and provide compression force upon strong contraction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For normal walking, it is important to control trunk posture so that it maintains a stable
body position against gravity. Trunk stability improves the functional stability of the
physical body and improves balance and gait abilities, preventing physical injury<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study aimed to assess changes in foot pressure elicited by 4 weeks of trunk stability
exercises for the deep and superficial muscles, using a Swiss ball and tools, including
bridge exercises, swimming posture, and unstable support surfaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were 30 healthy adults who voluntarily consented to take part and
had no congenital deformity, orthopedic disorder, or neurological disorder. Before the start
of the study, we received approval from Kangwon National University
(KWNUIRB-2014-06-004-001). The participants were divided into a superficial trunk muscle
exercise group and a deep trunk muscle exercise group, with 15 participants in each. The
superficial trunk muscle exercise group had an average age of 22.2&#x000b1;1.93&#x02005;years, an average
height of 170.5&#x000b1;10.5&#x02005;cm, and an average weight of 78.1&#x000b1;23.64&#x02005;kg. The deep trunk muscle
exercise group had an average age of 21.3&#x000b1;1.84&#x02005;years, an average height of 170.1&#x000b1;8.61&#x02005;cm,
and an average weight of 69.0&#x000b1;14.55&#x02005;kg.</p><p>Participants started the exercises on the date they submitted a consent form. A gait
analyzer (TechStorm Inc., Korea) was used to measure foot plantar pressure while walking and
exercising. The gait analyzer system analyzes foot pressure in 10 regions of the plantar
area while participants walk on a 384&#x000d7;1152&#x02005;mm plate with a film-type pressure sensor
consisting of a 2304-cell matrix array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The ten regions of foot pressure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-711-g001"/></fig>). Pressure distribution data were analyzed using Gait Analyzer application software
ver. 3.1. Pressure data by region were collected three times, and the mean values were used
in the analysis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While exercising, participants wore comfortable clothes but not socks. They conducted the
exercises on a mat after a demonstration and under the supervision of a physical therapist
in an exercise therapy room at the Physical Therapy Department of Kangwon National
University. The exercise routine consisted of 10 minutes of warm-up exercises, 40 minutes of
main exercises, and 10 minutes of cool down, for a total of 60 minutes. Participants
followed the routine 5 times a week for 4 weeks. For warm-ups, participants stretched the
large joints in a standing position. The main exercise included 10 exercises for the deep
and superficial trunk muscles. Each exercise was repeated for 3 sets, with 30 seconds of
rest between sets.</p><p>One set of the hundred (straight) deep trunk muscle exercise was performed by lifting both
legs 70&#x02013;80 degrees off the ground while lying down and lifting the upper body and waving
both arms 5 times while inhaling and exhaling. One set of the bridge (single leg straight)
exercise consisted of lifting the pelvis while lifting and lowering each leg 5 times while
lying down. In one set of the one-leg stretch exercise, one knee was lifted to the sternum
10 times while stretching the other knee in a diagonal direction in a supine position. One
set of the quadruped alternate exercise was performed by gathering the right elbow and left
knee in the center of the trunk and then stretching them in a quadruped position 10 times.
One set of the swimming exercise consisted of stretching 4 limbs, like while swimming, and
maintaining this position for 40 seconds in a supine position. One set of the side plank
exercise included lifting the trunk and pelvis and maintaining this position for 40 seconds
in a side plank position supported by the elbow. In 1 set of the gym ball plank exercise,
both feet were placed on a Swiss ball with the elbows on the ground for 40 seconds. One set
of the gym ball crunch exercise involved sitting up and lying down on Swiss ball while
lifting the upper body 20 times. One set of the gym ball jackknife exercise was performed by
resting the shins on a Swiss ball while rolling it toward the upper body. One set of the gym
ball kick forward exercise consisted of sitting on a Swiss ball, placing both feet on the
red balance board, and maintaining knee extension for 40 seconds<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One set of the crunch exercise in the superficial trunk muscle exercise involved lifting
the trunk until both shoulder blades were off the ground from a supine position 20 times.
One set of the crunch side exercise was performed by rolling the upper body toward the side
in a side plank position supported by one arm 15 times. One set of the crunch oblique
exercise included lifting the upper body obliquely from an oblique lying position 15 times.
In 1 set of the sit-up exercise, 2 people together rolled up the upper body as much as
possible for 60 seconds. One set of the leg raise exercise consisted of lifting and lowering
both legs from a lying-down position 20 times. One set of the twist crunch exercise was
performed by placing 1 leg on the knee and lifting the upper body obliquely toward the knee
from a supine position 15 times. In 1 set of the V sit-up exercise, participants maintained
the body in a position looking the like letter V while sitting for 30 seconds. One set of
the side band exercise included holding a dumbbell with 1 hand and bending the upper body
toward the dumbbell while standing 15 times. One set of the seated knee-up exercise involved
pulling the knees up to the sternum supported by both hands and releasing the knees while in
a sitting position 20 times<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. One set of
the mountain climbing exercise was performed by alternately bringing each knee up to the
chest in a push-up position 20 times.</p><p>For the cool down, whole body stretches were done in a lying-down position. After the
participants had performed these exercises for 4 weeks, their foot pressure while walking
was measured using a gait analyzer in the manner described earlier.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). The average and standard deviation of participants&#x02019; general characteristics were
calculated. The paired t-test was conducted to analyze the pre- and post-test results. The
statistical significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in foot pressure in any region in the superficial

with lower back pain and to prevent physical injury during exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Deep trunk muscle exercises using a Swiss ball have been
reported to have a positive effect on the prevention of falls among elderly women by
improving their balance and gait abilities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. As deep trunk muscle exercise can affect the body in various ways,
this study aimed to determine the effect of the trunk muscle exercises on foot pressure.</p><p>After the 4-week exercise program, the superficial trunk muscle exercise group showed no
significant differences in any region of the foot. However, the deep trunk muscle exercise
group showed increases in foot pressure on the outside of the forefoot, midfoot, and
hindfoot and decreases on the inner hindfoot and midfoot. The decrease in foot pressure on
the inner foot and the increase on the outside of the feet indicates normal walking and
overall even distribution of body weight on the feet. Consistent with these results, a study
by Lim et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that hemiplegic
patients who performed trunk stabilization exercises for 8 weeks showed a significant
increase in pressure on the hindfoot. In addition, Jang et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balanced incline shoes decreased foot
pressure by 15% compared to flat shoes, thereby reducing loads on the feet, ankles, and
knees by distributing pressure to the outside of the feet. The present study, too, found an
increase in pressure on the outside of the feet, resulting in a positive effect on the
body.</p><p>The present study did not specify a walking velocity when foot pressure was measured and
limited participants to adults in their 20s, so the results cannot be generalized to all
ages. The elderly may exhibit a decrease in foot plantar fat pad thickness and lowering of
the height of the longitudinal arch, along with structural changes, such as a claw or hammer
toe<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In consideration of
these changes, future studies should compare the foot pressures of young and elderly adults
after deep trunk muscle exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Couzens</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Brill</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: The Core Program: Fifteen Minutes a Day That Can Change Your Life, 1st
