According to the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study, LBP is the sixth highest overall burden on the society of the 291 conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and has thus been the focus of a number of related studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although acute LBP is usually recovered within six weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the clinical guidelines recommend surgery such as spinal fusion for chronic LBP in failure of more than two years of all other recommended conservative treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While lumbar spine surgery methods such as discectomy and spinal fusion continue to increase in popularity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] various complications may occur following back surgery, possibly resulting in worse conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The most common complication associated with back surgery is pain and approximately 40% of patients may experience pain after lumbar spine surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, in cases in which pain persists after back surgery, pain management is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Opioid analgesic drugs are a cornerstone of postoperative pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, opioids may cause various side effects ranging from itching and sedation to nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; effective and safe pain management after back surgery is thus warranted.</p><p id="Par22">Several clinical trials have demonstrated that acupuncture is generally safer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] than routine care. A recent systematic review suggested that certain modes of acupuncture improved acute postoperative pain and reduced opioid use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recently, the clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Physicians in 2017 indicated that acupuncture improved pain in acute and chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Electroacupuncture (EA) is the application of electrical stimulation to acupuncture techniques. Currently, EA is a common treatment for pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], including myofascial pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], osteoarthritis of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], chronic shoulder and neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. EA is regarded to modulate pain through significant changes in bioactive chemicals such as opioids, serotonin, and norepinephrine in peripheral injury sites, the spinal cord, and supraspinal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">In our recent systematic review, we found that acupuncture analgesia for pain after back surgery yields positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but there have been few clinical trials that have reported the effectiveness of EA for pain following back surgery. Therefore, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of EA in patients with non-acute pain after back surgery between 2013 and 2014 to assess the feasibility of a full-scale study and to calculate an adequately powered sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Using the pilot RCT results (currently being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal), we calculated the sample size and tested the acceptability of the study design to assess the effectiveness and safety of EA for post-back surgery pain. We thus propose a pragmatic, confirmative, and comparative multi-center RCT design following the CONSORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reporting guidelines and Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We selected usual care as the comparator in this study to reflect real-world conditions with reference to the most common treatments used in patients with LBP as assessed from the 2011 Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This study will additionally include a cost-effectiveness analysis and qualitative research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par25">We hypothesize that EA may have better effectiveness and cost-effectiveness with good tolerance in safety in patients with pain after back surgery when used as complementary treatment with UC. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of EA with UC versus UC alone on pain control and functional improvement after back surgery. Additionally, cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted to investigate the effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of EA in patients with pain after back surgery; qualitative research will be conducted to understand participants&#x02019; personal experiences with symptoms, factors influencing their pain, and their perceptions of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par26">This study is a multi-center, randomized, assessor-blinded trial with two parallel arms and an active control. This study will be conducted in three hospitals in South Korea. Participants will be independently recruited at each hospital site through online advertisements placed on the hospital website and offline on-site advertisements, such as hospital bulletin boards, to obtain the appropriate participant enrollment and target sample size. Potential participants will be required to undergo screening to determine their eligibility. When eligible, participants will be asked to provide written informed consent, after which the baseline evaluation will be conducted by a study researcher. At screening, a clinical research coordinator (CRC) will collect information on various basic sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age, vital signs, height, weight, and medication history. Korean medicine doctors (KMDs) will collect information on the medical history of individuals who have received spinal surgery, such as the timing of surgery, type of surgery (i.e. fusion, decompression, or discectomy), surgically involved vertebra(e), number of surgeries, time of pain, onset of symptoms, and duration of symptoms. On their second visit, screened participants who are considered eligible for trial participation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated using a 1:1 ratio to either the EA plus UC group or the UC alone group. After randomization, the treatment procedure will be scheduled and managed by a CRC. To maximize participant retention, there will be flexibility during the visit period and researchers will allow actual visits to be within seven days of prescheduled visits. The post-treatment follow-up will occur one, four, and eight weeks following the four-week interventional period to know whether the treatments effects are maintained.</p><p id="Par27">All participants will be enrolled through voluntary participation and written informed consent from all participants will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Trial participation may be terminated at any time during the trial through voluntary refusal to continue or in cases of significant clinical deterioration as judged by KMDs. Participants suffering from trial-related problems or adverse events (AEs) may receive medical treatment for compensation.

The scales for these dimensions are in the range of 1&#x02013;3 and lower scores represent a better health status. The EQ-5D scores will be evaluated before treatment at the initial treatment session (second visit) and at each follow-up (visits 10&#x02013;13). For cost-effectiveness analysis, EQ-5D will be additionally evaluated via telephone at the 13th visit.</p><p id="Par56">Changes in medicine intake and dosage will be investigated through interviews at each visit.

An independent t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to analyze continuous data to test for significance in between-group differences and will be presented as the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD. Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be conducted for categorical data and the data will be described as the frequency and percentage (%). To analyze the VAS pain intensity score as the primary outcome, we will perform an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) considering the baseline scores as covariates and treatment group as the fixed factor. A paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed to analyze within-group differences pre and post treatment. Repeated measure analysis of variance (RMANOVA) will be used to analyze the between-group differences at each visit.

We aim to estimate the short-term cost-effectiveness of EA with UC compared to UC alone from the South Korean societal perspective. Cost components of both treatments will be defined and measured according to the identification, measurement, and valuation process. Cost data from all individual participants will be obtained using separately developed economic case report forms. Effectiveness and utility measurements will be collected from the main comparative effectiveness RCT. Quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D instrument; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in both groups will be calculated using the area under the curve method. Cost and effectiveness (utility) will be analyzed as intention to treat and missing data will be imputed using multiple imputations. In the deterministic analysis, mean values of cost and effectiveness (utility), derived from generalized linear model adjusting for potential confounders, will be used as a representative value for calculating ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). We will use the bootstrapping percentile method to identify the sampling uncertainty of ICER. Cost-effective planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will also be estimated to display and interpret statistical uncertainty and economic decision-making according to the maximum willingness to pay. If we could not observe the fully yield cost and effective outcomes of both alternatives in this short-term within trial evaluation, we will develop a decision analytic model and conduct a longer-term period evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Qualitative research</title><p id="Par64">The qualitative research will be conducted with participants receiving EA and UC. We aim to describe the meaning of these participants&#x02019; personal experiences, perceptions, and expectations of EA with UC. Twenty participants receiving eight sessions of EA plus UC, consisting of EA, physical therapy, pain medication, and patient education two times/week at the three Korean medicine hospital sites, will be included in the qualitative analysis. Qualitative interviews will be conducted at four weeks after the completion of treatment (10th visit) by trained researchers. Additional informed consent for the qualitative research will be obtained and incentives will be given to participants as an ethical consideration. The data will be collected through in-depth individual interviews with audio recordings and verbatim transcriptions. All of the text will be read line-by-line for coding and the data will be processed using qualitative content analysis. The codes will be classified according to concepts, categories and subcategories by abstractness. The data will be compared for interrater reliability with regard to the researchers&#x02019; theoretical sensitivity. To ensure the rigor of the study, the researchers will consider the credibility, fittingness, auditability, and confirmability.

Theoretical saturation of the data and the researchers&#x02019; theoretical sensitivity will be added fittingness will be enhanced by providing demographic and illness-related data of the participants along with various incidents and events in the texts. Auditability will be ensured by providing analysis procedures in detail and by showing conclusions explicitly linked with displayed data. Confirmability, which refers to a freedom from possible research biases, will be achieved by undertaking the strategies discussed above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection, management, and monitoring</title><p id="Par65">The data will be collected through paper-based documents written by the CRC and outcome assessors and will then be entered into web-based case report forms on electronic data capture (EDC) systems.
