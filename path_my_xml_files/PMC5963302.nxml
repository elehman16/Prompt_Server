Older age, multiparity, caesarean section, gestational weight gain, high birth weight, multiple pregnancy, and child care have been proposed.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref></sup> There is also scant knowledge on the consequences of DRA.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It has been postulated that DRA, in addition to being a cosmetic concern for many women, may reduce low back and pelvic stability, cause low back and pelvic girdle pain, and be related to pelvic floor dysfunctions such as urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Physical therapists commonly treat pregnant and postpartum women with DRA. Keeler et al<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported that women`s health physical therapists in the United States applied myriad different exercises and manual techniques to treat patients referred with DRA as the primary diagnosis or secondary to other postpartum diagnoses. The 3 most frequently used interventions were strengthening exercises of m. transversus abdominis (TrA), pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training, and the &#x0201c;Elizabeth Noble technique,&#x0201d; which involves manipulation of the rectus muscle bellies while the patient performs a partial sit-up.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that correct PFM contractions cause co-contractions of the abdominal muscles.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Hence, it has been suggested that PFM contractions can be used to train the TrA.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, to date, there is scant evidence for the effect of any exercise programs in prevention and treatment of DRA. In a systematic review, Benjamin et al<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found 8 studies that addressed treating DRA. All included abdominal and 1 included PFM training. However, only 1 study with a small population was a randomized controlled trial (RCT).<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> They concluded that there was no consensus on which abdominal exercises to recommend in order to narrow the diastasis.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A new search on PubMed revealed only 3 additional RCTs.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref></sup> These studies vary in methodological quality and content of the intervention, and to date there are no clear conclusions that can be made on the effect of the different exercises on DRA.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 16-week supervised postpartum exercise program focusing on PFM training, in addition to daily home exercise of the PFM, on the prevalence of DRA in primiparous women.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This is a secondary analysis of a 2-armed RCT in which the primary aim was to evaluate the effect of PFM training on urinary incontinence.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The study was conducted at Akershus University Hospital, Norway, from February 2010 to May 2012. The present study evaluated the effect of the 16 weeks postpartum exercise program on the prevalence of DRA immediately after cessation of the intervention and at follow-up 12 months postpartum.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from a cohort study at the project hospital or in conjunction with the routine medical visit 6 weeks after delivery. Inclusion criteria included primiparous women who had given birth vaginally to a singleton infant after more than 32 weeks of gestation and who were able to understand Scandinavian languages. Women presenting with third- and fourth-degree perineal tears after vaginal delivery, serious illness to mother or child, and women having their child delivered by caesarean section were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>The Postpartum Training Program</title><p>The intervention started 6 weeks postpartum and consisted of 1 weekly supervised exercise class for 16 weeks. The classes lasted for 45 minutes and were led by 3 experienced physical therapists, 2 at the university hospital and 1 in a private institute. The main focus of the exercise protocol was to strengthen the PFM, but the program also contained strengthening exercises for the abdominal, back, arm, and thigh muscles, stretching, and relaxation. All exercises, except the PFM exercises, were performed to music. The protocol has been described in detail by B&#x000f8; et al<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and M&#x000f8;rkved and B&#x000f8;.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The PFM exercises were performed in 5 different positions, and 8&#x02013;12 attempts of maximal contraction were conducted in each position. Each PFM contraction was held for 6&#x02013;8 seconds, in addition to 3&#x02013;4 fast contractions on top of the last 4&#x02013;5 contractions. For progression, the women were instructed to increase the intensity of the contraction according to their perceived strength, always aiming for a close to maximal contraction. In addition, the women were asked to perform daily PFM training at home with 3 sets of 8&#x02013;12 maximal contractions. The weekly exercise class included 3 sets of 8&#x02013;12 contractions of different abdominal exercises, shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>. The physical therapists used a variation of these different exercises throughout the exercise period. Group session participation was registered by the physical therapists, and the participants recorded home exercise participation in training diaries. The control group received no intervention beyond the initial instruction on how to contract the PFM correctly and the written information received at discharge from the hospital.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Illustration of the abdominal exercises performed by the intervention group: (1) draw-in (&#x0201c;on all fours&#x0201d;), (2) draw-in (prone), (3) half-plank, (4) side-plank, (5) oblique sit-up, (6) straight sit-up.

To measure DRA, the interrecti distance was palpated using finger widths. This method has shown to have good intrarater reliability (K<sub>w</sub> = 0.70) and a moderate interrater reliability (K<sub>w</sub> = 0.53) in postpartum women.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the test situation, the women were in a standardized supine position with arms crossed over the chest.

Hence, a direct comparison between studies is not possible. As the ultrasound method to assess interrectus distance and DRA was in its early development at the onset of our study,<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> we chose to apply palpation with finger width as the method to assess the condition. This method is the most commonly used assessment method in clinical practice and is widely accepted by patients.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition, van de Water and Benjamin<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> found the method to be feasible to screen for presence of DRA, which was the main outcome variable in the present RCT. However, today, ultrasound is recommended as a more responsive and reliable method.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> More detailed information about the width of the interrectus distance may reveal differences in response to treatment, and we support the recommendation that ultrasonography should be the method of preference in future studies.<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>As for the negative results of our RCT, the findings correspond with 2 other RCTs.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Only 1<sup>17</sup> of the published RCTs found a significant improvement of the exercise group compared to a nontreated control group. In this trial, Mesquita et al<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in DRA in an intervention group performing 2 individual exercise sessions at 6 and 18 hours after childbirth. The 2 sessions consisted of pelvic tilt with simultaneous contraction of the TrA and PFM in addition to abdominal breathing exercise.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Participants were not followed up after these 2 sessions; hence, the long-term effect of this early intervention is not known. Kamel and Jousif<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> found a significantly greater reduction in DRA in a group receiving a combination of abdominal exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. However, they did not compare their intervention with a nontreated control group. The 2 other RCTs did not find a significant difference between groups in reduction of diastasis<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or in muscular improvement<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> after a combination of PFM and abdominal exercises<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and abdominal exercises alone.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Abdominal and PFM Training</title><p>According to Keeler et al,<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> women's health physical therapists use several interventions, often in combination, in treatment of DRA. Until now TrA training, PFM exercises, and the Noble technique have been the most commonly used exercises. The choice of different abdominal exercises is a logical choice when the aim is to close the DRA and abdominal exercises have always been part of this comprehensive exercise program. There is evidence from several studies assessing the influence of PFM contraction on the abdominals that PFM contraction causes co-contraction of different abdominal muscles.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Hence, PFM contraction could be expected to provide a training effect for the TrA. TrA training is a logical treatment for DRA. An exercise class once a week may be considered an insufficient dosage of supervised training to restore the DRA.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, the most common frequency of training for women postpartum has been reported to be once a week.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition, the women participating in the present study did 3 sets of PFM training every day for 4 months, and their participation in the exercise protocol was high.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We suggest that if PFM/TrA training is indeed effective in closing the diastasis, this program should have shown positive results. However, our results showed no effect on the condition.</p><p>In new knowledge emerging from experimental studies by our research group,<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the drawing-in exercise, mostly activating TrA and the internal oblique muscles, tended to widen instead of narrow the interrecti distance. This was also confirmed in a recent study by Lee and Hodges.<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> They postulated a new hypothesis that contraction of the PFM with co-activation of the TrA may tighten the linea alba and hence be important for the function of the abdominal wall. For the time being, this hypothesis needs further investigation, and to date there are no RCTs to support this suggested training protocol in clinical practice. We would argue that for women with DRA, the main goal is to close the diastasis, and that this has been, and is, the expected outcome of exercise training interventions for this prevalent condition following pregnancy and childbirth. Given the few RCTs in this area, low methodological quality of the published studies,<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and scant knowledge from basic studies on how to close the diastasis, there is not yet enough evidence to guide clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Strengths of the present study are the randomized design, masking of the assessors, control of ability to perform a correct PFM contraction, and the sample size, which is by far the largest in RCTs reporting results on DRA.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref></sup> In addition, we included a homogeneous group of primiparous women, and the women demonstrated high participation in the exercise program. Limitations are lack of power calculation for DRA as an outcome, and that 2 different physical therapists conducted the assessment. A post hoc power calculation of the results of the present study showed that thousands of women would be needed to show a statistically significant difference, a small difference that most likely is not clinically relevant. Hence, one could argue that the study was not underpowered. Palpation, using finger widths, has been shown to have lower inter- than intrarater reliability, and this may have influenced the results.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, the interrater reliability has been found to be moderate, and the 2 physical therapists were thoroughly trained to assess DRA. The assessment procedure was also standardized, with the aim to minimize inaccuracy. Use of palpation and finger width to determine the outcome measure limits our ability to report the differences between groups to only &#x0201c;diastasis or no diastasis.&#x0201d; Ultrasonography would have enabled measurement of the interrectus distance and provided more detailed information. Another limitation is that our sample included women with and without DRA, and among those assessed to have DRA most of them had mild and moderate diastases. Hence, an effect may have been found if women with more severe diastases had been included. Due to the inclusion of multiple exercises in the exercise program, if the program had worked, it would not be possible to determine which of the exercises might have been responsible. Our study sample consisted of women able to speak and understand Scandinavian languages, which most likely caused a selection of participants which also limits generalization of our results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A weekly comprehensive exercise program with focus on strength training of the PFM and with additional daily home training of the PFM was not effective in reducing the prevalence of DRA. Further high-quality RCTs with interventions applying different abdominal exercises with higher training dosage and head-to-head comparisons of different abdominal exercise programs with or without PFM exercises are needed before evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice can be given.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author Contributions and Acknowledgments</title><p>Concept/idea/research design: K.
