Some 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) have proven effective but have serious side effects. Ondansetron, also a 5-HT3RA, has been widely used as an antiemetic with an excellent safety record for over two decades. Our aim was to assess its effectiveness in IBS-D.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>120 patients meeting Rome III criteria for IBS-D entered a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 5&#x02005;weeks of ondansetron 4&#x02005;mg versus placebo with dose titration allowed, up to two tablets three times daily in the first 3&#x02005;weeks. Patients completed daily diaries documenting stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form score. Gut transit was measured in the last week of each treatment. The primary endpoint was average stool consistency in the last 2&#x02005;weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ondansetron significantly improved stool consistency (mean difference in stool form between ondansetron and placebo &#x02212;0.9, 95% CI &#x02212;1.1&#x000a0;to &#x02212;0.6, p&#x0003c;0.001). Compared with placebo, patients on ondansetron experienced fewer days with urgency (p&#x0003c;0.001), lower urgency scores (p&#x0003c;0.001), reduced frequency of defaecation (p=0.002) and less bloating (p=0.002), although pain scores did not change significantly. IBS symptom severity score fell more with ondansetron than placebo (83&#x000b1;9.8 vs 37&#x000b1;9.7, p=0.001). 65% reported adequate relief with ondansetron but not placebo compared with 14% reporting relief with placebo but not ondansetron, relative risk 4.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 8.5, p&#x0003c;0.001.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ondansetron relieves some of the most intrusive symptoms of IBS-D, namely loose stools, frequency and urgency.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</kwd><kwd>Serotonin</kwd><kwd>Clinical Trials</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Significance of this study</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alosetron, the best studied 5-HT3RA, was withdrawn from general use because of constipation and rarely ischaemic colitis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ondansetron is a 5-HT3RA widely used as an anti-nauseant for over 20&#x02005;years and never associated with ischaemic colitis.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ondansetron improves symptoms of frequent loose stools with urgency characteristic of IBS-D.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ondansetron slows the accelerated colonic transit associated with IBS-D.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Those with severe diarrhoea respond less well.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ondansetron is a safe inexpensive 5-HT3RA available worldwide which could improve symptoms in many patients with IBS-D with mild to moderate symptoms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The main benefit, which is seen within 7&#x02005;days, is to reduce urgency.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The median dose is 4&#x02005;mg per day in those who respond.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction, background and objectives</title><p>Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) affects approximately 3% of the general population and accounts for approximately 20% of gastroenterology outpatient visits in the UK. Since many conditions can cause diarrhoea, such patients typically undergo numerous negative tests. IBS regardless of subtype is also associated with considerable impairment of quality of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> IBS-D is particularly a debilitating form of IBS as it reduces the ability to eat out and socialise because of fear of pain, urgent defaecation and even incontinence. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) is a major mediator in the gut, signalling via afferent nerves to influence gut motility and secretion.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RAs) block the vagal stimulation induced by 5-HT<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and were developed as a highly effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, known to be mediated via vagal stimulation by cisplatinum-induced 5-HT release.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It was soon discovered that 5HT3RAs also cause constipation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Early studies with ondansetron demonstrated that 16&#x02005;mg three times a day, the usual dose for chemotherapy-induced emesis, delayed colonic transit in healthy subjects,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and reduced the postprandial increase in colonic tone in carcinoid diarrhoea.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A small trial using the much lower dose of 4&#x02005;mg three times a day suggested benefit in IBS and functional dyspepsia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our aim was to determine whether this inexpensive, safe generic drug would provide similar relief to patients with IBS-D. We also wished to determine the mechanism of action and in particular whether clinical factors or polymorphisms in the SERT genotype could predict those that would respond, as has been suggested for alosetron.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of ondansetron 4&#x02005;mg/tablet versus placebo. Patients were given one to two tablets three times a day with dose titration for the first 3&#x02005;weeks of each period and a 2&#x02013;3-week washout period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2013305989F1">figure 1</xref>). The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT00745004), approved by Nottingham Research Ethics Committee 2 (REC reference number 08/H0408/134) and by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory authority (MHRA, London, UK), and conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Funding was provided by the National Institute for Health Research through a Research for Patient Benefit grant and salary support for Dr Garsed from the Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit.

The supervising staff obtained a randomisation reference number by a remote, internet-based randomisation system. All participants stayed blinded until the study, data collection and assessments were complete. CTSU Data Manager and the Queen Medical Centre (QMC) Trials pharmacy had access to the treatment allocations.

To detect a difference of 0.4 which was considered clinically signficant with 90% power and 1% type I error we needed 113 subjects. To acount for dropouts we randomised 120.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with IBS-D were recruited from IBS clinics at the Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham and Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester and via the Trent Primary Care Research Network from 1 January 2009 to May 2011 using the Rome III diagnostic criteria.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> To exclude other causes of diarrhoea we required a normal colonoscopy and colonic biopsies, normal full blood count, serum calcium and albumen, C-reactive protein and negative serological tests for celiac disease. All patients consuming more than the equivalent of 240&#x02005;ml of milk/day were tested for lactose intolerance. Most had either a therapeutic trial of colestyramine or a test of bile salt absorption using the 7-day retention of selenium<sup>75</sup>-labelled homocholic acid taurine to exclude bile salt malabsorption. Patients gave written informed consent. Inclusion criteria were age 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years; meeting Rome III criteria; no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease/microscopic colitis and able to give informed consent. Women of child-bearing potential tested negatively on pregnancy test and had to agree to adequate contraception during the study. Patients on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants were included, provided they had been on medication for at least 3&#x02005;months and the dose remained unaltered throughout the study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or breast feeding, unwilling to stop anti-diarrhoeal medication (loperamide or codeine phosphate), prior abdominal surgery other than appendectomy and cholecystectomy, being in another trial or being in the opinion of the investigator unsuitable.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Healthy controls for transit studies</title><p>We also studied 21 healthy controls to provide normal values for the transit studies. They completed the same questionnaires and underwent the same transit measurement protocol. None met Rome III IBS criteria. They comprised 16 women and 5 men, with median age (IQR) of 45 (23&#x02013;56) years. Bowel frequency was median (IQR) of 1.0 (1.0&#x02013;1.4) bowel movements per day.</p></sec><sec id="s3a"><title>Intervention</title><p>Each participant received 5&#x02005;weeks of oral placebo treatment and 5&#x02005;weeks of ondansetron 4&#x02005;mg tablets using dose titration for the first 3&#x02005;weeks of each period with a 2&#x02013;3-week washout period in between each treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2013305989F1">figure 1</xref>). The hospital pharmacy provided the 5-week drug supply at the beginning of each period. The investigational medicinal product was either a 4&#x02005;mg ondansetron tablet (Pliva, Zagreb, Croatia) or placebo, both identically over-encapsulated in a gelatine capsule by Bilcare (Crickhowell, Powys, UK). The placebo formulation matched that of the ondansetron in appearance and composition, except for the active drug.</p><p>The patients were instructed to start with one capsule once a day, increasing daily to a maximum of two capsules three times a day, depending on the response. If stool consistency increased to stool form 1 or 2, or if bowel frequency dropped below one per day the dose was reduced to a minimum of one capsule taken every 2&#x02005;days. Patients were required to stay on a stable dose for the last 2&#x02005;weeks of each period. Loperamide, 2 mg twice daily, was allowed as rescue medication in the event of uncontrolled diarrhoea, but needed to be discontinued for the final 2&#x02005;weeks of each period. Patients attended for a total of seven visits as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2013305989F1">figure 1</xref>): screening visit 1 was followed by a 1-week period when stool and symptom diaries were completed (week 1). At visit 2, after checking patients met Rome III criteria and had completed the stool diaries, they were enrolled and instructed to start treatment at one capsule daily increasing or decreasing the dose by one capsule per day every 2&#x02005;days to a maximum of two capsules three times daily. They were told to increase the dose if the stool form was 6 or 7 and decrease if it was 2 or 1. After 1&#x02005;week patients were telephoned to confirm the dose was optimum. They were also called a few days before visit 3 to confirm the appointment and before visit 4 to remind them to take the transit markers for 3&#x02005;days before the visit. Visit 3 was after 3&#x02005;weeks of treatment and visit 4 was the final visit of the first treatment period when stool diaries were collected and colonic transit assessed by a plain X-ray. There was then a 2-week washout which was extended if necessary to ensure bowel habit had returned to baseline. Return to baseline was confirmed by asking patients whether their bowel dysfunction was back to pre-study levels and this was objectively corroborated by examination of the visit 5 diaries. In those participants in whom pre-study levels had not been reached by 2&#x02005;weeks, initiation of the second treatment phase was delayed until pre-study levels were confirmed.</p><p>The second treatment period was identical to the first. Compliance was monitored by asking the patient at each study visit and by a final pill count of all returned medicines.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Data collection</title><p>Personal baseline data were collected at visit 1: age, gender, depression and anxiety scores from the Hospital and Depression Scale, score from the Patient Health Questionnaire 15,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> perceived stress score from the Perceived Stress Scale Questionnaire.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> IBS-related quality of life from the IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and IBS severity score from the IBSS Severity Score Questionnaire<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> were collected at visit 1 and at the end of each treatment period (visits 4 and 7).

Worse diarrhoea at baseline was associated with decreased effect of ondansetron (every 1 point baseline average stool form increase reduced effectiveness by 0.4 points, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.8, p=0.032). For example, people with less severe diarrhoea (lower quartile: average stool form 4.9) benefited more from ondansetron (stool form difference &#x02212;1.0, 95% CI &#x02212;1.3&#x000a0;to &#x02212;0.7, p&#x0003c;0.001) compared with those with more severe diarrhoea (upper quartile: average stool form 5.9), with stool form difference &#x02212;0.7, 95% CI &#x02212;1.0&#x000a0;to &#x02212;0.4, p&#x0003c;0.001.</p><p>PPA showed average &#x02212;0.9, 95% CI &#x02212;1.2&#x000a0;to &#x02212;0.6 stool form difference between ondansetron and placebo. One point increase in baseline stool form was associated with decreased effect of ondansetron by 0.5 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.8, p=0.017.</p><p>One concern about crossover design studies is the possibility of a carryover effect such that those who received active treatment first would have less symptoms at the beginning of the second treatment period. However the washout period of 2&#x02005;weeks was sufficient for most patients to report their symptoms were back to baseline and only 17 (17%) needed longer, the maximum period being 36&#x02005;days. They were asked whether their bowel dysfunction was back to its usual pre-study level and this was confirmed objectively from their symptom diaries on visit 5. Average stool consistency in the week prior to starting the second arm of the trial was slightly improved at 5.2 compared with 5.4 for baseline (p=0.031) but there was no difference according to whether active was first or second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2013305989F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). Furthermore, with respect to either average bloating, urgency or abdominal pain scores, there was no difference in the last 7&#x02005;days of the washout period between those who had active or placebo first, the differences being 0.17 (0.2), 0.01 (0.2) and 0.10 (0.2), p=0.4, 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Thus symptoms at the start of the second period were not affected by the treatment allocation in the first phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2013305989F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). As can be seen, there was very little placebo response and onset of treatment effect and loss of effect on discontinuing ondansetron was rapid, occurring within the first week in both cases.

Baseline characteristics did not correlate with the above efficacy parameters. The results were similar for PPA.

This, therefore represents an important unmet need. The abnormalities of serotonin metabolism which have been demonstrated in IBS-D make 5-HT3 antagonists a logical treatment. Post-infective IBS, a subtype of IBS-D with very similar clinical features,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> has been shown to be associated with increased 5HT-containing enteroendocrine cells,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> and also increased postprandial 5-HT release.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Further studies have also shown reduced mRNA for SERT in IBS-D duodenal<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and colonic biopsies<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>which, in keeping with animal studies of post inflammatory bowel dysfunction,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was correlated with mucosal immune response.</p><p>Our study showed patients with IBS-D have a clear preference for ondansetron compared with placebo, even though it did not alter the number of days with pain, suggesting that for these patients it was urgency and loose stools which were the most troublesome symptoms. It is of interest that animal studies have shown that alosetron, a 5-HT3RA shown to be effective in IBS-D, inhibits spinal pathways mediating the response to painful colonic distension.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We have also shown in a rat model of postinfective visceral hypersensitivity that ondansetron reduces afferent firing induced by colonic distension,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> suggesting that ondansetron might have reduced pain if we had used higher doses. However, this would undoubtedly have produced more constipation which our patients were keen to avoid. Although only 41% met FDA criteria for responder to both pain and consistency, 67% reported adequate relief of symptoms, suggesting that when urgency is the main problem ondansetron will be effective but less so when pain is the main complaint. It should be noted that dyspepsia is a common comorbidity with IBS and earlier studies suggest benefit to heartburn and postprandial pain.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore some of the global benefit may have been from improvement in dyspepsia, though we did not assess this in the current study. Future studies should probably include a dyspepsia assessment.</p><p>Our variable dosing regime mirrored clinical practice and we feel gives a better idea of how the drug will perform in clinical practice. It undoubtedly improved response rate and had we chosen a fixed dose many patients would have developed constipation and probably dropped out or had worsening symptoms. As expected, the median number of tablets per day was much lower for ondansetron than placebo, median (IQR) 1 (0.5&#x02013;1.4) and 2 (1&#x02013;5), respectively. However, dose titration does complicate analysis since only the stool diaries in the last 2&#x02005;weeks are truly informative of the response, meaning that we cannot impute data to allow for incomplete diaries, which would be normal practice. These incomplete data led to only 98 subjects being analysed.</p><p>Our evaluation time of just 2&#x02005;weeks was short but in patients with diarrhoea and rapid transit, drug effects tend to be rapid and quickly reversible, for example with loperamide. We found that most subjects returned to their previous bowel habit within the 2-week washout and only 17 patients required longer.</p><p>Our patients were moderately affected by bowel disturbance and psychological comorbidity similar to other recent trials of IBS-D treatment,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> so we expect our findings to be generalisable to the general IBS population with symptoms severe enough to warrant referral to secondary care.</p><p>Regrettably alosetron, a 5-HT3RA for which there is substantial evidence of benefit,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> was withdrawn from widespread use because of an unacceptable incidence of severe constipation (around 25%) and a much lower incidence (0.7 per 1000 patient-years<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) of unexplained ischaemic colitis. Our trial shows that ondansetron can achieve useful results with a low incidence of side effects. While our small study cannot prove safety, the fact that the drug has been used widely for over 25&#x02005;years without a single report of ischaemic colitis suggests that this side effect will be rare. Constipation occurred in just 9% and rapidly resolved on dose reduction, giving a discontinuation rate due to constipation of just 2%. Our constipation rate is lower than the 18&#x02013;29.6% and 10&#x02013;19.3% respectively reported in the meta-analysis of alosetron 2&#x02005;mg and cilansetron 6&#x02005;mg daily,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> while ramosetron 5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g was associated with a comparable rate of 7.4%.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Our low rate undoubtedly reflects the use of dose titration, to avoid constipation, with many patients only requiring 4&#x02005;mg daily or on alternate days. This mirrors what would happen in clinical practice. The high incidence of constipation with alosetron is dose related and 0.5&#x02005;mg daily is associated with a much reduced incidence of constipation (just 9%) with relief of symptoms in 50.8% of patients compared with 30.7% in placebo.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Unfortunately ischaemic colitis remains a concern even at 0.5mg daily despite careful monitoring, with an incidence of 2 per 1000 with alosetron<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and it seems unlikely that alosetron will ever be marketed worldwide. Ondansetron's potency in blocking the 5-HT3 receptor is 3&#x02013;10 times lower than alosetron,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which may explain the low incidence of side effects in our study. Ramosetron is another 5-HT3RA, proven effective in IBS-D,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> but unfortunately only marketed in Japan. It has an affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor three times that of alosetron<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> but is given at a very low dose of 5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g, equivalent to 0.015&#x02005;mg alosetron, again suggesting that lower doses of 5-HT3RAs might well be the best strategy in treating IBS-D.</p><p>Previous authors have reported that individuals with the heterozygote <italic>sl</italic> genotype responded less well to alosetron as assessed by the change in colonic transit,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> a finding which does not seem true for ondansetron (see online supplementary appendix).</p><p>The strongest effects were on transit, stool consistency and urgency, which are important since urgency is one of the strongest predictors of reduced quality of life<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and as others have reported, response to 5-HT3RAs also correlates with improvement in quality of life.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Unlike the larger alosetron trials we did not find a significant improvement in abdominal pain versus placebo, with only 41% of individuals meeting FDA dual criteria for being &#x02018;responders&#x02019; for pain and stool consistency, a value not significantly different from 17% on placebo. However, 67% of our patients reported &#x02018;adequate relief&#x02019; from their symptoms with ondansetron but not placebo, compared with 14% with placebo but not ondansetron. Furthermore, the IBS SSS score, an overall IBS severity score, fell significantly compared with placebo. The largest numerical effect we found was the reduction in days with urgency, which is known to be one of the most bothersome symptoms in IBS-D<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and a very important driver of impairment of quality of life.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> It is also rated by patients as the most important attribute of a successful treatment for IBS-D.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>We found that those most severely affected were more likely to drop out, less likely to respond and showed a smaller reduction in stool consistency, indicating that the efficacy for treating severe diarrhoea is limited and the best response will be in those with mild to moderate symptoms who represent the majority of patients seen in primary care. However, given its safety, low side effect profile and rapid onset of effect within 1&#x02005;week in most cases, a trial of treatment would seem reasonable in most cases of IBS-D. Whether it would help patients with functional diarrhoea remains to be determined.</p><p>Ondansetron is a generic drug, available worldwide at a low price, with a very long experience of safe usage, which our study suggests would benefit patients with IBS-D troubled mainly by urgency and loose stools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2013-305989-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1354" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Melanie Lingaya and Rawinder Banwait are thanked for providing technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Conception, design and overall supervision of study: RS, KG, PW and IH.
