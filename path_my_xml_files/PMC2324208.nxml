Rapid cycling is an independent predictor of inadequate treatment response in patients with bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and is associated with greater morbidity vs. non-rapid-cycling disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is not well understood and also may be missed, thus representing an important unmet need in the treatment of bipolar I disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of misdiagnosis in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder may be even greater than in non-rapid-cycling patients given the nature of this pernicious variant or phase of bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Indeed, misdiagnosis of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder has been associated with a twofold increase in the rate of hospitalisation compared with patients who were never diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Lifetime history of suicide attempts was also significantly elevated in patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder who had previously been misdiagnosed and whose clinical situation was complicated by substance use disorders, highlighting the importance of early and accurate diagnosis of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder to offer timely therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>To be diagnosed with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) course specifier of rapid cycling, patients must have at least four mood episodes within 12 months. These episodes must be demarcated by either a full or partial remission of at least 2 months&#x02019; duration or a switch to an episode of opposite polarity. In the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder, a naturalistic study, &#x0223c;20% of patients were diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder at study entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Controversies exist, however, regarding the necessary criteria for the diagnosis (particularly duration of episodes), and the aetiology of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is poorly understood. Additionally, patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are often excluded from clinical trials, so this lack of a full evidence base is associated with little consensus on the most appropriate treatment for these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Previous studies with lithium, divalproex and carbamazepine have indicated moderate-to-marked effects on mania, but poor-to-moderate effects in the treatment of the depressed phase of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In a prospective study with lamotrigine in which 182 patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder were randomised to lamotrigine (<italic>n</italic> = 93) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 89), there was no difference between treatment groups in the time to additional pharmacotherapy (primary end-point) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, survival in the study (time to any premature discontinuation) was significantly longer with lamotrigine (p = 0.036) and a greater percentage of lamotrigine-treated patients were stable without relapse for 6 months of monotherapy vs. placebo-treated patients (41% vs. 26%; p = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Attention is shifting towards the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, albeit via analyses of data from acute bipolar mania or bipolar depression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), open-label studies with atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) or case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Relatively fewer data exist regarding longer-term, maintenance therapy of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.</p><p>Aripiprazole is pharmacologically distinct from other atypical antipsychotics, as the efficacy of this agent is mediated through its dopamine partial agonist activity at D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonist activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> partial agonist activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole have been evaluated in both short- and longer-term studies in patients with bipolar I mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>A longer-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week study showed that aripiprazole was superior to placebo in delaying the time to relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Furthermore, in the 74-week, double-blind extension of that 26-week study (providing a total of 100 weeks&#x02019; double-blind treatment), time to relapse for the overall population continued to be significantly longer with aripiprazole vs. placebo, and aripiprazole maintained a good safety and tolerability profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present data from a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of patients with rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder who were included in that 100-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Details of the study methods have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Briefly, the original study was randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled. During the initial stabilisation phase, patients were treated with open-label aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day). Patients who achieved a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score &#x02264; 10 and a Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score &#x02264; 13 over a minimum of six consecutive weeks were eligible for double-blind treatment.</p><p>In the 100-week, prospective double-blind period, patients were randomised (1 : 1) to receive either aripiprazole or placebo for an initial 26-week treatment period, the results of which have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Patients who completed the 26-week period without relapse were offered to continue a further 74 weeks of double-blind treatment under the same regimen. Results from the 100-week treatment period have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Entrance into the 74-week double-blind, extension phase ended when 45 patients had relapsed. All patients continued in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion in the study until the last randomised patient completed the 26-week phase. At that time, the study was terminated, and any patient remaining in the 74-week phase was discontinued, regardless of the time point they had reached.</p><p>Study visits took place at randomisation (day 1 of the double-blind phase), weekly for weeks 1&#x02013;4, biweekly for weeks 6&#x02013;28, monthly for weeks 28&#x02013;52 and bimonthly for weeks 52&#x02013;100. All study sites received prior Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) approval before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>All patients provided written informed consent, as required by the IRB/IEC. Participants met the criteria for bipolar I disorder according to the DSM-IV. Diagnoses were performed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM or the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses reported here consider only those patients diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder.</p><p>Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are available elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Briefly, patients were eligible for entry into the stabilisation phase if they had either recently completed a 3-week, placebo-controlled acute mania study of aripiprazole, if they met eligibility criteria for an acute mania study but had declined participation, or if they had experienced a manic or mixed episode requiring hospitalisation and treatment within the previous 3 months. All psychotropic medications, except lorazepam and anticholinergic agents, were discontinued prior to enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Dosing schedule</title><p>Study medication was administered orally, once daily, at approximately the same time each day. During the stabilisation phase, patients received open-label aripiprazole, initially 30 mg/day. Dose decrease to 15 mg/day was permitted at any time, depending on tolerability. Following entry to the double-blind phase, patients were assigned, in a double-blind manner, to continue the dose of aripiprazole they were taking at the end of stabilisation or to receive placebo. Based on the investigator's assessment of therapeutic effect and tolerability, the aripiprazole dose could be increased to 30 mg/day or decreased to 15 mg/day at any time.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy measures</title><p>The primary efficacy end-point was the time to relapse for a mood episode (manic, depressive or mixed) during the initial 26-week, double-blind period of the study. Relapse was defined as discontinuation because of lack of efficacy (indicated by hospital admission because of a mood episode and/or addition to, or increase in, psychotropic medication other than study drug for manic and/or depressive symptoms). Additional efficacy measures included the mean change from double-blind randomisation to end-point in YMRS and MADRS total scores, and time to relapse over the course of the additional 74-week, double-blind extension phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety measures</title><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs; using COSTART terminology) were collected from study commencement. Vital sign measurements and changes in body weight were also assessed. Clinical laboratory tests included fasting measurements of triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, glucose and prolactin levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy measure &#x02013; time to relapse &#x02013; was evaluated using statistical methods designed for the time-to-event data. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves were generated for the time-to-relapse data, and between-group differences were tested using log-rank tests at an alpha level of 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Patients who did not relapse, including those who discontinued participation early for reasons other than relapse, were censored on the date of their last efficacy evaluation or the last dose of study medication.</p><p>Treatment differences for the incidence of clinically significant weight gain were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) modelling was used to analyse change from baseline to last observation carried forward (LOCF) end-point in laboratory parameters. ANCOVA models included the baseline measure as covariate and treatment group as main effect.</p><p>Primary presentations of results from ANCOVA and analysis of variance were the model-based estimates corresponding p-values for the test of treatment differences. Changes from baseline were derived by subtracting the baseline score from that of the LOCF end-point.</p><p>Analyses of laboratory parameters were performed on LOCF data for the 26-week maintenance phase and the combined 26-week maintenance and 74-week double-blind, extension phases. LOCF values at week 26 for those patients who did not enter the 74-week double-blind, extension phase were carried forward to week 100.</p><p>All safety and efficacy analyses were performed using <sc>sas</sc> statistical software, version 6.12 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). For the comparison of aripiprazole with placebo, two-tailed tests were used to determine statistical significance and p <italic>&#x02264;</italic> 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and characteristics</title><p>Detailed presentations of patient disposition and demographics in the total population during stabilisation and the initial 26-week double-blind phase of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and the entire 100-week double-blind phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) are provided elsewhere.</p><p>Of the 161 patients in the total population, 28 had a history of rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder, met the stabilisation criteria and were randomised to aripiprazole (<italic>n</italic> = 14) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 14).

In comparison, in the original study in the total population of patients with bipolar disorder, 5/83 placebo-treated and 7/78 aripiprazole-treated patients completed the 100-week trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This high attrition rate is not uncommon in long-term trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), but this can limit the usefulness of long-term results, and highlights the difficulties inherent in treating bipolar patients.</p><p>The changes in YMRS and MADRS total scores from baseline in the aripiprazole group in this analysis of patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder were similar to the changes observed in the overall population of aripiprazole-treated patients with bipolar I disorder in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and in the subpopulation of patients with non-rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. With aripiprazole monotherapy, small increases in YMRS and MADRS scores were observed over the course of the 100-week study, yet the average total scores remained below the stability criteria used in the open-label phase (i.e., YMRS total &#x02264; 10 and MADRS total &#x02264; 13). Thus, aripiprazole monotherapy appears to have a consistent efficacy profile in maintaining mood stability in patients with bipolar I disorder, including those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.</p><p>Long-term aripiprazole monotherapy was generally well tolerated in this population of rapid-cycling patients, with the majority of treatment-emergent AEs occurring during the 26-week, double-blind treatment phase of the study. The effect of aripiprazole on body weight in this study is of interest as obesity is more prevalent in patients with bipolar disorder than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and has been noted as a correlate of poor outcome in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Importantly, in the current study, aripiprazole was not associated with either significant weight gain or clinically relevant changes in metabolic parameters, including glucose, lipid or prolactin levels, during long-term treatment of patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.</p><p>Much insight into the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is derived from subanalyses of larger studies in patients with bipolar disorder. Such analyses have indicated the short-term efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and of olanzapine for the treatment of manic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) in rapid-cycling patients. However, treatment response in rapid-cycling patients should be assessed over at least 4 months or three cycle lengths, as resolution of an acute cycle is not necessarily evidence that a treatment has worked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). A previous <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of a 47-week, randomised, double-blind study comparing olanzapine (5&#x02013;20 mg/day) with divalproex sodium (500&#x02013;2500 mg/day) in 251 patients with bipolar mania (manic or mixed) showed greater overall improvement with non-rapid-cycling vs. rapid-cycling patients during long-term treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), with little difference between olanzapine and divalproex in the improvement in mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Most pertinent to the results of the current study, an analysis of 179 patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy in relapse prevention in patients with bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed) indicated a longer time to relapse with olanzapine vs. placebo during up to 48-weeks maintenance therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). One prospective, randomised study investigated lamotrigine monotherapy in patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In that study, there was no difference with lamotrigine vs. placebo in the time to additional pharmacotherapy (primary end-point) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), but more patients were stable without relapse for 6 months with lamotrigine vs. placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Of note, the 100-week study described in the current analysis of rapid-cycling patients is the longest double-blind, placebo-controlled study to date investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of any agent other than lithium for the prevention of relapse in the treatment of bipolar I disorder.</p><p>Interpretation of the current study is limited by the <italic>post hoc</italic> nature of the analysis and by the small population size (<italic>n</italic> = 28); however, the paucity of other long-term data in patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder should be acknowledged. It should also be noted that as all patients were stabilised for at least 6 weeks on aripiprazole prior to randomisation, the study represents an enriched population who continued into the double-blind treatment. Thus, the results are only applicable to those rapid-cycling patients who respond to and are stabilised on aripiprazole following a manic or mixed episode. The study focused on patients with an index episode of bipolar mania, and further studies would be required to more specifically determine the efficacy of aripiprazole in the prophylaxis of depressive episodes in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. This would be of particular relevance, as patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder present more frequently in the depressed phase than the manic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and have substantial depressive morbidity compared with bipolar patients without rapid cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>These encouraging results with up to 100 weeks of aripiprazole treatment call for further research with more prospectively designed and adequately powered trials to better investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Maintenance studies that stratify patients according to index mood polarity at study entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and protocols to assess the benefits of combination regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) using atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole would be of substantial clinical interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ, USA) and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
