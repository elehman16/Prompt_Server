As shown in Fig. S1, smoking is particularly burdensome in the Appalachian region of the state, with nearly double the U.S. prevalence (30.9% versus 18.5% among men, and 27.3% versus 15.8% for women, respectively) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b</xref>). Related, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates are 43% and 60% higher in Appalachian Kentucky than in the rest of the nation.

Those that have used CBPR generally have yielded modest positive outcomes.

In this article, we report results from a CBPR group-randomized trial designed to test the efficacy of a community-based smoking cessation intervention in Appalachian Kentucky.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0025"><label>2.1</label><title>Setting and overview</title><p>This faith-placed CBPR project was located in six counties of rural Appalachian Kentucky from 2009 to 2013. Despite the risk factors and health disparities in this region, central Appalachia is rich in local resources that can be leveraged to improve health, including strong social ties, commitment to remain in place, a history of social activism and mutual aid, involvement with local institutions like churches, and traditions like storytelling that can convey important sociocultural messages.</p><p>A decade of CBPR in this region informed the project's focus on local practices and institutions to address health inequities. &#x0201c;Faith Moves Mountains&#x0201d; (FMM) was initiated in 2008 to develop, implement, and evaluate three community-based interventions targeting smoking cessation, energy balance, and cancer screening (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Qualitative formative work revealed community preferences for health promotion interventions to be delivered in local churches. Partnering with 28 diverse, rural Appalachian churches that facilitated recruitment and allowed the integration of culturally salient elements into existing interventions. Such elements included an emphasis on group discussions and social support, the inclusion of scripture, and the traditions of storytelling and witnessing (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2012</xref>). Churches and participants were recruited from six Appalachian counties in Kentucky.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.2</label><title>Theoretical bases</title><p>The intervention was informed by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the socioecological model (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Glanz et al., 1997</xref>). Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Glanz et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1986</xref>) posits that both internal and external factors (such as self-efficacy, lack of knowledge about how to quit smoking, or availability of smoking cessation classes) influence one's willingness and ability to change an unhealthy behavior. The socioecological model emphasizes contributing factors beyond the individual level, extending consideration to multiple levels of influence including the social environment and social support (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">McLeroy et al., 1988</xref>). Consistent with a socioecologically-imbued SCT and extensive community feedback, the program was placed in churches using lay health advisors as interventionists.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3</label><title>Church and participant recruitment, enrollment, randomization, and staff</title><p>All study procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. In this group-randomized trial, churches were the unit of randomization. No complete sampling frame of churches in this region exists; thus, a snowball sampling approach was used to recruit churches. Church representatives (typically the pastor or minister) from diverse congregations were contacted by the local project directors and personally invited to participate in this study. Of the 29 churches invited to participate, 28 agreed to enroll in the project; the declining church suggested that its congregation lacked smokers. Consistent with the central Appalachian region, most congregations were relatively small (50&#x02013;100 members) and were Baptist (32%), Pentecostal (21%), or non-denominational (18%). Other denominations included Mainline Protestant, Church of God, and Roman Catholic. Since the study design was a cluster-randomized trial, the sample size focused on the group allocation rather than the individual. We aimed to have at least 30 participants in each church, anticipating a substantial attrition rate.</p><p>The 28 participating churches were randomly assigned by the study biostatistician to either the intervention (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) or the attention control (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) group using a computer-generated random number sequence, stratified by congregation sizes (i.e., less than 50 members, 50&#x02013;100 members, and 100 plus members). Table S1 shows the distribution of the churches by size and denomination.</p><p>Within each church, local project staff recruited participants by offering an information session, generally after church services or another church event. Interested individuals were screened for eligibility (age 21 and older, being a current cigarette smoker, speaking English, and residing in Appalachian Kentucky with no plans to move out of the area in the next 9&#x000a0;months). Participants were not required to be church members, but did have to be willing to affiliate with a congregation for the duration of the program. Trained study staff completed the informed consent process and administered the baseline questionnaire to willing and eligible participants. These documents were administered orally, if desired by the participant, to reduce concerns about literacy. Participants received $25 for each questionnaire they completed. A total of 585 individual participants clustered in 28 churches were enrolled in the study.</p><p>We employed 6 local lay health advisors (LHAs). The LHAs were identified by the local FMM staff based on their willingness to attend training sessions and periodic retraining; personality traits including integrity, honesty and trustworthiness; commitment to their fellow community members; ability to work with diverse participants; and willingness to travel, be persistent, and communicate effectively with both staff and community members. Most LHAs had worked in previous intervention studies conducted by the investigators in these communities. The LHAs ranged in age from early 20s to late 60s, were both male and female, represented several counties, ranged in educational attainment from having a GED to having completed college, and generally had low to moderate incomes. During the course of a three-day training session, the LHAs were trained and certified in the delivery of human subject's protection and the Cooper/Clayton Method by the developers of the intervention. They also received training in Motivational Interviewing by an external and certified consultant. The LHAs were given continuous feedback throughout intervention delivery by the FMM project directors. In addition, formative community input had previously suggested that given the challenges of quitting smoking and the high degree of ambivalence about tobacco use in the region, extra attention must be provided to support the struggles of life-long smokers. We employed and trained interviewers, distinct from lay health advisors, to assess outcomes, thereby likely limiting potential positive self-reporting bias.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.4</label><title>Measures</title><p>Consistent with our theoretical underpinnings, study measures included a selection of SCT and socioecological constructs. Specifically, participants completed the MOS social support scale (19 Likert-type items, higher scores indicated higher levels of social support); (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991</xref>) the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m nicotine dependence scale (6-item scale yielding both continuous and categorical levels of nicotine dependence); (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Buckley et al., 2005</xref>) adapted measures of smoking cessation self-efficacy (10 Likert-type items, higher scores indicated higher levels of self-efficacy); (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Velicer et al., 1995</xref>) and smoking cessation decisional balance (5 Likert-type items measuring perceived benefits, 5 Likert-type items measuring perceived barriers, higher scores indicated higher levels of each) (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Prochaska and DiClemente, 1983</xref>). Data from the formative phase focus groups (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2014</xref>) guided the development of a 10-item index of barriers to smoking cessation. Standard sociodemographic and health data were also collected, including race, age, education and income levels, insurance coverage, household composition, and a comprehensive series of questions on health status. To measure smoking cessation, we used self-reported smoking status, the most commonly employed assessment measure at the time of project initiation and still common today. {Ybarra, 2013 #5134} Cessation was measured as seven-day point prevalence for abstinence. {Williams, 2005 #5135} All instruments were pilot tested with eight local residents to ensure relevance and comprehension.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.5</label><title>Study design</title><p>Fig. S2 depicts the flow of this single blinded, two-arm group-randomized trial with an attention control group, through the assessment of the primary outcome at posttest 1. In the intervention arm, data were collected during three assessment periods: upon enrollment (baseline); at 17&#x000a0;weeks after baseline, which was approximately one month after intervention completion (posttest 1); and at 43&#x000a0;weeks after baseline, which was just over six months after intervention completion (exit interview). Participants in the attention control group were administered assessments upon enrollment (baseline); at 17&#x000a0;weeks after baseline (posttest 1); and at 43&#x000a0;weeks after posttest 1, which was 60&#x000a0;weeks after baseline and the same length of time after intervention completion as was scheduled for the intervention group. The intervention group received the smoking cessation program shortly after enrollment, while the attention control group received an attention-control lunch program on stress management between one and three weeks after baseline and initiated the smoking cessation program within one month following posttest 1.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.6</label><title>Smoking cessation intervention</title><p>The Cooper/Clayton Method to Stop Smoking is a 12-week behavioral smoking cessation program targeting participants who are dependent on nicotine. Participants met with an interventionist for one 90&#x000a0;min group session once per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The manualized intervention curriculum incorporated in-session didactic information via DVDs delivered in each session by the developers, group discussion and processing, and scheduled nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Following the introductory session, the participants completed a weekly self-monitoring log between sessions to record every cigarette smoked in 30&#x000a0;min segments. Log results were used to recommend dosing of Nicoderm CQ&#x000ae; patches, initiated after the introductory session and used throughout the remainder of the program. All participants were offered NRT free of charge, but receipt of NRT was for one week only and required program attendance.</p><p>The first 6 sessions of the Cooper/Clayton Method focused on biological aspects of nicotine dependence. The final 6 sessions addressed issues related to relapse prevention (i.e., coping with stress, depression, anger, and other triggers for relapse; exercise and food intake). During each weekly group session, participants shared their successes as well as strategies used to overcome any struggles encountered during the previous week. The LHAs were trained to be positive and encouraging. Report of a lapse was addressed with the question, &#x0201c;How many cigarettes were you smoking when you entered the program?&#x0201d; Generally, the relapse level was lower than the starting point, eliciting encouragement from the LHAs. Between the first and second sessions, the LHAs conducted one individualized MI session with each participant to promote adherence to the program, including development of individualized action plans.</p><p>The sessions took place in community settings, mainly churches. In the formative work preceding this project, churches were viewed as positive locations, perceived as trustworthy, centrally located, convenient, and more personal and warm than health or medical settings. Moreover, given our past successful health-promotion partnerships with faith communities in the region, we anticipated being able to reach diverse community members. Churches provided space, amenities like beverages and snacks, and input from ministers on spiritual guidance that might bolster cessation efforts. These spiritual references were part of the LHAs' opening and closing segments of the session. In qualitative post-intervention interviews, many participants articulated that the inclusion of scriptural references and location in the church bolstered their commitment to cessation efforts.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>2.7</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Four major research questions were addressed in the analyses. First, intervention efficacy was assessed by comparing the primary outcome of the proportion of individuals smoking at posttest 1 between the intervention and attention control group churches, using individual-level marginal modeling with generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Second, potential differences between intervention and attention control groups were examined for the secondary outcomes of Fagerstr&#x000f6;m nicotine dependence, stage of change, self-efficacy, and decisional balance, also using GEE for continuous outcomes. Third, to evaluate the effect of the intervention within the attention control group churches, McNemar's test for paired proportions adjusted for the group-randomized design (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Obuchowski, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Lieber, 1998</xref>) was conducted with participants in attention control group churches only. This analysis compared the proportions of attention control participants smoking at posttest 1 and at exit interview (i.e., pre- and post-intervention). Fourth, the potential dose effect of session attendance was assessed, controlling for study arm. Five participants were excluded after randomization and baseline because they reported already having stopped smoking. Of the 585 remaining participants, 48 (8%) did not provide posttest 1 data, and their smoking status was coded as missing. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s0065"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample characteristics</title><p><xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows baseline participant characteristics for the entire sample (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;585) and indicates initial equivalence between individuals in intervention versus attention control churches. Reflecting the demographics of the region, most participants were white (95.4%) and of lower socioeconomic status (SES), with 70% having a high school education/GED or less; over two-thirds with incomes below $30,000; and fewer than one in three currently employed. Nearly one-third of the participants reported lacking health insurance. Regarding health status, only 22% reported their health as excellent or very good, while 37.4% and 18.3% classified their health as fair or poor, respectively.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, no statistically significant differences were detected at baseline between participants in the intervention versus attention control group churches regarding scores on the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m scale of nicotine dependence. Most participants were categorized as dependent on nicotine. There were also no statistically significant differences between participants in the intervention and attention control churches in self-efficacy, decisional balance, and barriers to smoking cessation.</p><p>Because the randomization scheme involved churches rather than individuals, it is important to examine potential differences between intervention (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) and attention control (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) congregations. As shown in Table S1, several minor imbalances existed between the two groups. For the intervention group, approximately half of the churches were considered small (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;50 members), with the remaining churches medium-sized (50&#x02013;100 members) or larger (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;100 members). The attention control group was nearly evenly divided among these three sizes. The use of GEE with unequal cluster sizes likely preserves power despite minor imbalances (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Eldridge et al., 2006</xref>). Flow of participants through the study is depicted in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>3.2</label><title>Primary outcome: smoking status at posttest</title><p><xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>a highlights the primary outcome, smoking status at posttest 1, collected from 92% of enrolled participants (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;537).

As shown in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>b, adjusting for church size and number of enrollees from each church, the odds of stopping smoking were 13.6 times higher among participants in intervention group churches. This effect size increases when sociodemographic and theoretical baseline covariates of interest are included (i.e., education level, income level, insurance status, age, perceived health status, Fagerstr&#x000f6;m nicotine dependence score, stage of change, self-efficacy, and decisional balance).</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3.3</label><title>Secondary outcomes: Fagerstr&#x000f6;m and psychosocial scales</title><p><xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the effects of the intervention on secondary outcomes at posttest 1.

Participation in the intervention was significantly (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05) associated with all of these outcomes, with the exception of perceived benefits of quitting smoking. Specifically, compared to those in attention control group churches, at posttest 1 participants in intervention group churches had lower levels of nicotine dependence, greater movement in stage, a stronger sense of self-efficacy, and fewer perceived barriers to stopping smoking.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>3.4</label><title>Smoking cessation within attention control group churches only</title><p>Of the 145 participants in attention control group churches who had smoking status data at posttest 1 and the exit interview (conducted approximately 6&#x000a0;months after intervention completion), 23 (15.8%) reported that they had stopped smoking post-intervention, compared to 5 (3.2%) who reported having quit at posttest 1, before receiving the intervention. However, McNemar's test (adjusting for group-randomization) of paired proportions revealed that this difference was not statistically significant, &#x003c7;2 (1df, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;145)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.19, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.07.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>3.5</label><title>Dose effect of the intervention</title><p>The average number of sessions attended (out of 12 possible) was similar for participants in the intervention group churches (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.7) and attention control group churches (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6). Logistic regression analyses controlling for intervention versus attention control group status revealed that independent of group assignment, for each additional session attended, the odds of smoking cessation reported at the exit interview (i.e., 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention) increased by 26%. For example, a participant who attended 6 sessions had 26% higher odds of becoming a nonsmoker than a participant who attended 5 sessions (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001). Given that most smoking cessation interventions limit the measurement of programmatic adherence exclusively to participants' self-report on NRT use, these exposure results are particularly noteworthy (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kotz et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The 585 participants in this group-randomized trial were residents of 6 persistently poor, rural and isolated Appalachian counties, likely predisposing them to even greater challenges than those facing other nicotine dependent populations. Health and health care resources are less available to health disparity populations, making it challenging to access and utilize existing health care resources. Further, the high prevalence of smoking in this extremely close knit rural region (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2016</xref>) constitutes a significant barrier to smoking cessation.</p><p>This CBPR project used a single blind, group-randomized trial design, assigning churches to intervention and attention control conditions. One month after the intervention was completed, participants in intervention group churches had dramatically higher odds of quitting smoking (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13.6) compared to those in attention control group churches. Among only those participants in attention control group churches, the proportion reporting smoking cessation increased from 3.1% at posttest 1 (before the attention control group churches received the intervention) to 15.4% at exit interview (6&#x000a0;months after the intervention ended), though this increase was not statistically significant.</p><p>Controlling for intervention versus attention control group status, a significant dose effect was detected among all participants: for each additional intervention session completed, the odds of quitting increased by 26%, a finding rarely reported. One factor that might contribute to this dose effect is the distribution of free nicotine replacement therapy during the sessions. The characteristics of participants themselves may also shape the dose effect; it is possible that those participants who attended more sessions may have been more committed to quitting or may have had more resources (transportation, social support, free time) than participants who attended fewer sessions (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kotz et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Raupach et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several features of this intervention may have resonated with the target population. First, the Cooper/Clayton Method is a comprehensive intervention, allowing participants to address the spectrum of challenges with smoking cessation, from physiologic urges to psychological discomfort to behavior maintenance. Additionally, given the emphasis on social connectedness in this population, the group format and socially supportive orientation of the intervention may have been helpful. The faith-placed nature of the program may have engendered trust in the program and setting. The distribution of free NRT to a low income, underinsured, under-employed population likely increased its access to a proven cessation treatment, as did the delivery of the Cooper/Clayton Method intervention by local LHAs. Moreover, the training and certification of LHAs by the program developers likely promoted fidelity to the intervention.</p><sec id="s0095"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>As in many community-engaged research endeavors, several limitations of this study deserve mention. First, smoking status, the primary outcome variable, was self-reported and not biochemically verified. Self-report was commonly employed at the initiation of the project, and was consistent with the approach we proposed in our NIH-sponsored proposal. Furthermore, as suggested by the Behavioral Change Consortium (BCC), while biochemical validation is encourage in populations with distinct social demands (pregnant women, adolescents, patients with smoking-related illnesses), our general population may not warrant such an approach. {Williams, 2005 #5135} Consistent with the BCC, we maintain that the population has a low misrepresentation rate, given the study setting&#x02014;in small rural churches and counties where &#x0201c;everyone knows what everyone else is doing&#x0201d;&#x02014;it is likely that participants self-reported smoking status accurately. Additionally, in a region where over one third of adults smoke, {Foundation for a Health Kentucky, 2015 #5136} continuing to smoke may be less stigmatized than in most US locations.</p><p>Second, in spite of a relatively large overall sample (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;585) and roughly equal number of churches in the intervention (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) and attention control (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) groups, the number of individual participants in the two groups was unequal. While our analytic procedures took into account unequal cluster sizes, and while we employed individual-level marginal modeling with GEE, the unequal number of participants in intervention versus attention control group churches illustrates one of the challenges of conducting community-engaged research with local staff in underserved settings. In addition, five participants who were originally enrolled were subsequently excluded because they reported having already stopped smoking at the baseline assessment. We treated the 8% of participants who did not provide posttest 1 data as missing rather than imputing values of the primary outcome variable, so a pure intent-to-treat analysis was not used. Finally, the results observed in our rural Appalachian Kentucky population may not be generalizable to other populations; however, we conclude that if this program offers promise among this low resourced, highly nicotine-dependent population, other groups may demonstrate even greater success.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><title>Fig. S1</title><p>Current adult smokers in Kentucky.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.docx"><alt-text>Fig. S1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0010"><caption><title>Fig. S2</title><p>Study design.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.docx"><alt-text>Fig. S2</alt-text></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0015"><caption><title>Table S1</title><p>Age, Fagerstr&#x000f6;m score and means (standard deviations) for psychosocial scales by group at baseline.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc3.docx"><alt-text>Table S1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Financial disclosure and conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors have no financial or other conflicts of interests or disclosures.
