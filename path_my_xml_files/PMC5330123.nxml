However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in this field that investigate changes in <italic>cognitive control</italic> processes across the different hours of the day. We find this question to be very important since it has a direct influence on the training programs in the cadet&#x02019;s academy.</p><p>Cognitive control is defined as the ability to organize, monitor and regulate low-level cognitive processes (such as perceptual, motor, and memory processes) in order to match information processing to the current situation&#x02019;s demands. Braver&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] new model of dual mechanisms of control (DMC) is aimed to explain the <italic>variability</italic> in cognitive control processes. The DMC model refers to two distinct modes of control: &#x02018;proactive control&#x02019; and &#x02018;reactive control&#x02019;. The proactive control is when goal-relevant information is actively maintained in a sustained manner until the action is completed whereas in reactive control, attention is recruited in a just in time manner and it is stimulus-driven goal reactivation. The proactive control strategy is strongly resource consuming, requiring continuous goal maintenance, however behavior is continually adjusted to facilitate successful completion of the goal. In other words, less economic but more efficient. By contrast, the reactive control strategy has the advantage of being economically-efficient yet sometimes in a price of inaccuracies.</p><p>In this study, our intent was to investigate the cognitive performance of young cadet pilots across different hours of the day (morning, late afternoon and late evening). These young cadets have a very tight and intensive schedule routine, and although they are well selected and have high cognitive skills, at this point in their training, they are <italic>not</italic> highly trained, and have little experience in actual flight. Since flight is an environment of high mental-load, mechanisms of cognitive control are expected to be activated. Moreover, cognitive control mechanisms will be even more pronounced in inexperienced aviators, like cadet-pilots, before automatization processes start to occur as a result of training. Therefore, we hypothesized that these cadet pilots may adopt different cognitive strategies across the day as a result of internal and external environmental cues that may have a direct influence on their aerial functioning. More specifically, in the morning, when they feel alert and vital, they will be more reactive and responsive, whereas in the late hours of the day, as a result of fatigue, they may slow down in their performance. At first glance, high functioning in the morning and decrease in performance in the late hours of the evening may sound trivial. However, we also hypothesize that during high mental load tasks (i.e. flight), performance in the late evening hours of the day will be slower yet more accurate, whereas performance in the early hours of the day will be fast yet less accurate.</p><p>Or in other words, we expect that the &#x02018;reactive control&#x02019; mode will be activated when these cadets will have an inner feeling of vitality and the &#x02018;proactive control&#x02019; mode will be activated when their inner feeling will be of fatigue and not an &#x0201c;at peak&#x0201d; feeling, which is usually occurs during the late hours of the evening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The present study</title><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are changes in cognitive control across the different hours of the day (morning, late afternoon and late evening). We used a cognitive battery that was designed for that purpose. The cognitive battery contained both simple measures, such as simple reaction time in a psychomotor vigilance task, measures of motor inhibition and complex measures like dual-tasking and mental rotation tests, abilities associated with flying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our hypothesis was that in this high functioning population, the best performance will be detected in the late afternoon group as compared to the morning or late evening group. We also hypothesized that a decline will be seen <italic>only</italic> in the performance on complex measures for the morning and late evening groups, due to the high mental load of the measures and the high cognitive profile of this specific population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>In this study we recruited 39 cadet pilots forming one cohort in their academic phase of their military training, aged 21&#x02013;23, with no history of psychiatric disorders, head trauma, central nervous system disorders or use of psychotropic medications.

In order to minimize the individual differences that are more related to situational differences (like sleeping hours, time of meals, etc.), we tested a group of cadet pilots that have the same routine, in a group-testing procedure.

<bold>Simple Reaction Time (SRT):</bold> This task was designed to measure the participant&#x02019;s psychomotor response to a single visual stimulus. Participants were instructed to fixate on a &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; symbol which was presented at the center of the screen for a variable amount of time (500 or 1000&#x000a0;ms). A 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;cm black square (target) was then presented in the middle of the screen and participants were instructed to respond with their right index finger on the spacebar, as fast as they can, when they detect the target. The target disappeared from the display after participant&#x02019;s response or after 5000&#x000a0;ms. All 200 trials were organized in 4 blocks, 50 trials in each block. At the end of every block, the participant was granted a recess and was asked to initiate the next block by pressing any key on the keyboard.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Choice Reaction Time (CRT):</bold> In this task, the participants were asked to discriminate between two objects comprised from two different semantic categories. Each trial began with a &#x02018;&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;&#x02019; symbol presented on the display for 350&#x000a0;ms followed by a picture of either &#x0201c;shirt&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;pants&#x0201d;. The stimuli were randomly selected from four different pictures of pants and four different pictures of shirts. The participants were asked to respond with either the &#x02018;x&#x02019; key (left side on the keyboard) or the &#x02018;m&#x02019; key (right side on the keyboard) to discriminate between the shirts and the pants. The assignment of keys (x/m) was counterbalanced between participants. The object disappeared from the display after participant&#x02019;s response or after 5000&#x000a0;ms. A &#x0201c;beep&#x0201d; sound signaled error response. All objects were displayed 5 times, 40 trials over-all.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Go/no-go:</bold> Participants were required to fixate on a &#x02018;&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;&#x02019; symbol which was presented at the center of the screen for a variable amount of time (300&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;ms, leaps of 300&#x000a0;ms). Following fixating, the participants were presented with either the symbol &#x02018;S&#x02019; or &#x02018;$&#x02019; at the center of the display with a font-size equal to 40&#x000a0;pt. Participants were instructed to respond only when the &#x02018;S&#x02019; symbol (target) appeared on the screen, by pressing the spacebar key with the right hand index finger as fast as they can. When the &#x02018;$&#x02019; symbol (lure) appeared on the screen, participants were instructed to avoid responding. The presentation of the target or the lure symbols ended at the participant&#x02019;s response or after 700&#x000a0;ms. A &#x0201c;beep&#x0201d; sound signaled error response. All 300 trials were organized in 6 blocks, 50 trials each. At the end of each block, the participant was granted a recess and was asked to initiate the next block by pressing any key on the keyboard.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Anti-saccade:</bold> This version of the task was adopted from Katzir, Eyal, Meiran, and Kessler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Participants were instructed to fixate on a &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; symbol which was presented at the center of the screen for a variable amount of time (1500&#x02013;3500&#x000a0;ms, leaps of 250&#x000a0;ms). A flashing black square (cue sign) was then flashed either to the left or right of fixation (distance from center 11.33&#x000b0; of visual angle). The interval between the cue (black square) and the target (an arrow) is called CTI (cue-target interval) and it varied between 200&#x02013;500&#x000a0;ms (in leaps of 100&#x000a0;ms). The target (an arrow sign) appeared for 100&#x000a0;ms and then disappeared by a masking stimulus (black square) until a response was given. All targets appeared in the opposite location of the flashing cue. Participants had to indicate the direction of the target arrow (up, down, right or left) by pressing the corresponding arrow key on the keyboard. They performed first a practice block (8 trials) followed by 3 experimental similar blocks (44 trials each, 132 trials over-all).</p></list-item><list-item><p>

Each group performed a <italic>single</italic> session (60&#x000a0;min approximately) in one out of three different daytimes. We preferred to exhibit a single session for each participant in order to minimize the learning effect that occurs when repeating the same task more than once.</p><p>The single session protocol initiated with participants gathering in an isolated and quiet classroom at the IAF Flight Academy Campus. Each participant took his seat voluntarily and instructed first to close all running software, especially internet browsers, media software, anti-virus and all other resource consuming and visual pop-up software in order to prevent unwanted disturbances during the experiment. Then, each participant was instructed to open the main window of the cognitive battery on his personal laptop. Participants were instructed to sit straight in their chair, position the laptop screen approximately 60&#x000a0;cm in front of them with the screen center at the center of their visual field. It is important to note that all participants were using the laptops with the same configuration normally distributed to pilot-cadets by the IAF. During this initial phase, participants were also asked to complete a simple demographic questionnaire and were instructed to check their earphones and audio configuration.</p><p>After the initial phase, the participants performed all 6 cognitive tasks sequentially. For every task, a researcher orally explained the relevant instructions and participants were instructed to wait when completing each task until all the other participants completed their task in order to start the next task together with the rest of the group. This way, we ensured that all participants performed the tasks simultaneously. It also prevented participants&#x02019; motivation to perform fast at the expense of accuracy.

Therefore, mean accuracy was defined as the proportion of the correct responses in all 20 trials of 1-back task. A mixed design ANOVA analysis was performed in order to test the influence of &#x02018;time of day&#x02019; and dual tasking on accuracy in the 1-back task. The dual task factor was considered as a within subject with two levels (single task, dual task) and the &#x02018;time of day&#x02019; as a between subject with three levels (morning, late-afternoon, late evening). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> depicted the accuracy differences in the 1-back task between single and dual-tasking conditions in the three different daytimes.

Analysis of the effect of &#x02018;time of day&#x02019; and dual tasking on CT followed a mixed design model.

They are operating in very high mental-load scenarios and a decline in their cognitive control abilities may have a crucial negative effect on their flying performance. Consequently, the cadet population is more vulnerable because they are young and unexperienced but are still expected to maintain high level of performance for prolonged hours during training days.</p><p>Our findings suggest that in this highly functioning population, there are no differences in performance on simple tasks that involve low-mental load (SRT, go/no-go task, anti-saccade and CRT) for the different hours of the day. However, in tasks that are high-mental load consuming, we found a difference in performance for the different hours of the day. In the MRT, which is a task that involves visual WM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we found very impulsive performance- fast and not accurate- in the morning group (07:00 a.m.), and more precise yet slower performance in the late evening group (10:00 p.m.). We suggest that this &#x02018;trade-off&#x02019; behavior in performance on the MRT in the late evening group (slowing down in order to perform better) may be a result of a voluntary control mechanism (top-down process) activated at night, in this group. The combination of feeling fatigue, along with the understanding that this specific task is more resource consuming (the cadets reported that the MRT was the most difficult task in the cognitive battery) caused them to check and double-check before pressing the button and answer, whereas in the morning group, they felt alert and vital, and acted more reactively ended in impulsive manner and caused inaccurate performance.</p><p>Similar results were also found in the dual task, a task known to be a resource consuming activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, we found a decrement in performance (accuracy scores) on the 1-Back task during the dual task condition for the morning group but not for the late evening group, a finding that is in line with the MRT results. Once again, the morning group behaved in an impulsive way and showed a decrease in accuracy, while in the late evening group, participants were probably aware of their lowered cognitive capacity at night and therefore activated compensating cognitive control functions in order to overcome their fatigue. It is also reasonable that the differential effect in the dual task was found only in the 1-back task and not in the visual tracking since it is known that the motor reaction is more automatic and strong than working memory (executive function ability).</p><p>In a future study, we suggest performing the same procedure again and adding another morning group that is lectured regarding the influence of cognitive control mechanisms on performance <italic>before</italic> performing the cognitive battery. Our hypothesis is that after awareness, the results of this morning group will be more similar to that of the late evening group due to the activation of voluntary cognitive control abilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p>The use of one test session for each pilot-cadet in this study prevented influence of practice/learning effect that is inevitable as a result of test-retest examination. It is possible that the differential results found were due to individual differences. However, it is less likely to assume, since we found consistent results in both complex tasks. It a future study it will also be interesting to add a group of non-pilot population preforming the same test-battery. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size, therefore a replication study should be conducted so as to increase validity. Lastly, the sleeping habits of the young cadets were not thoroughly investigated in this study, which may have affected our results. Future research can examine this possibility through the use of subjective questionnaires such as the Morning&#x02013;Evening Questionnaire (MEQ; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) or the Munich Chrono-type Questionnaire (MCTQ; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>The reason for unequal group numbers was previous engagements of some of the cadet pilots in the day of the experiment.</p></fn><fn><p>Shirley Gordon and Nir Getter contributed equally to the present study</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SG carried out this study, participated in the sequence alignment and wrote the manuscript.
