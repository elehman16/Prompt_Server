with congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) according to the age when treatment was
started. [Subjects and Methods] 102 infant CMT patients under the age of 6 months were
selected. The subjects were divided into a group that started treatment before six weeks
(n=55) and a group that started treatment after six weeks (n=47). Asymmety was evaluated
by determining the difference in the thickness of the two sternocleidomastoid muscles
(DTSM) using ultrasonography, head tilt (HT) based on a physical examination, and the
torticollis overall assessment (TOA). Patients received ultrasound and massage therapy for
30 minutes, in conjunction with passive stretching exercises, 3 times a week. [Results]
Following the intervention, the DTSM, HT and TOA showed significant differences in the two
groups. The DTSM of the group that started treatment before six weeks was significantly
better than that of the group that started treatment after six weeks. [Conclusion] The
results of this study suggest that early intervention is more effective than later
intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Congenital muscular torticollis</kwd><kwd>Sternocleidomastoid muscles</kwd><kwd>Head tilt</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT) is a congenital deformity characterized by unilateral
shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle resulting in lateral inclination of the neck
associated with contralateral torsion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is synonym with fibromatosis colli, wry neck, and twisted neck<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CMT is a prevalent disease similar to congenital dislocation of the hip joint next to the
talipes varus. The frequency of wry neck is between 0.2&#x02013;2.0%<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the latest research, asymmetric restriction of the cervical
range of motion occurred in one in every 6 infants in a group of 102 healthy infants<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are many secondary diseases of CMT such as brachial plexus damage, limb deformity and
early developmental delay<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, facial
asymmetry, which influences function and appearance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and temporomandibular joint (TM joint) disorder<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and TM joint
hypofunction on the affected side and the weakened masticatory muscles influence the
formation of articulation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most ideal period of treatment for CMT is between the age of 1 and 4<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In prospective and retrospective studies of
the passive cervical range of motion, the success rate appeared to be 61&#x02013;99% when the
intervention began prior to the age of 1. Age is reported to be an important factor that
influences the treatment outcome<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In the previous studies, the prognosis was most favorable for 3-month-old babies. The
prognosis is comparably good if the correction is performed within 1 year<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The age of intervention greatly influences the possibility of achieving symmetric head
posture<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. With a longer delay, the
cervical range of motion will gradually decrease and infant patients might require 9&#x02013;10
months of intervention if the intervention begins more than 6 months after birth<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, this study was performed to compare the outcomes of asymmetry in infants with
CMT according to the age when treatment was started (treatment starting before six weeks and
treatment starting after six weeks), and to provide basic data through analysis of the
efficacy of early physiotherapy intervention in infants with CMT according to the age upon
starting treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All infants with clinically suspected CMT who visited the Seoul K Medical Center as
outpatients between January 2007 and May 2013 were considered for inclusion in this study. A
total of 102 infants (62 boys and 40 girls) met the inclusion criteria, and their parents
agreed to a conservative treatment program. The inclusion criteria were: an age of less than
6 months, a palpable neck mass or limited neck motion, and receipt of informed consent from
the parents or caregivers. The exclusion criteria were a history of other diseases or
disorders, congenital anomalies of the cervical spine, apparent ocular torticollis, or
neurologic or auditory problems. The present study was approved by the Sahmyook University
Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2014-069) and the objective of the study and its
requirements were explained to the subjects, and all participants provided written parental
consent, in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The parents of each infant were required to provide their written consent to the
examination of the patients&#x02019; medical records as a prerequisite for study inclusion. The
clinical characteristics of the participants, including gender, mode of delivery, direction
of torticollis, gestation period, birth weight, and presence of lesions such as spinal
neurological lesions of the hip joint, were evaluated and recorded. The general

visited the Seoul K Medical Center as outpatients. The subjects were divided into a group
that started treatment before six weeks (n=55) and a group that started treatment after six
weeks (n=47). Three times a week, the infants with CMT received therapeutic ultrasound,
massage therapy, and manual stretching exercises for 30 minutes along with passive
stretching exercises. The most common type of electrotherapy is ultrasound and therapeutic
ultrasound was delivered to the infants using a 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> transducer at an intensity
of 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3 minutes. Massage therapy was performed for 5&#x02013;7 minutes
using the effleurage method with oil to increase muscle stretching and blood flow. A passive
stretching program was employed to increase the range of neck rotation on the affected side
and involved lateral neck flexion to the contra-lateral side, which was held for 10&#x02013;30
seconds and repeated 10 times<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
physical therapist provided the interventions and evaluation. While the interventions, we
not allowed to do home exercise.</p><p>The data for all the subjects were analyzed to determine the differences in the thickness
of the two sternocleidomastoid muscles (DTSM), head tilt (HT), and torticollis overall
assessment (TOA).</p><p>DTSM was evaluated using a LOGIQ S8 ultrasound scanner (General Electric, 2012, Korea) with
a 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;MHz linear array transducer. Ultrasonography as an indicator of muscle activity is a
non-invasive method to measure the thickness of the muscle and is a reliable tool.
Ultrasonography of the SCM muscles was performed by two physicians in order to confirm the
existence of a neck mass or hypertrophy of the SCM muscle; the thicknesses of the SCM
muscles were measured in longitudinal and transverse views. The infants were examined in the
supine position, with slight extension of the neck from gentle rotation of the head to the
opposite side<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. SCM muscle thickness was
recorded in millimeters (mm).</p><p>Still photography was used to evaluate HT, as suggested by Rahlin<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the amount of an infant&#x02019;s habitual lateral flexion in
the supine position was recorded as HT. This method involves positioning the infant in a
supine state and providing a visual stimulus at the midline, without making any additional
effort to place the head in the midline position. To evaluate HT, two lines were drawn on
printed photographs, one across the infant&#x02019;s eyes and the other through the superior aspect
of the acromion processes (at the top of the lateral third of the shoulder). These lines
were extended until they intersected, and the acute angle between the two lines, which
represents the spontaneous lateral tilt from the midline exhibited by an infant, was
measured to the nearest degree with a protractor<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. To minimize measurement error, HT was independently evaluated by
three physical therapists with more than 4&#x02005;years of experience.</p><p>TOA was used to evaluate rotation deficits (degrees), side flexion deficits (degrees),
craniofacial asymmetry, residual bands (none, lateral, cleido, or sternal), HT (none, mild,
moderate, severe), and subjective assessments by parents (cosmetic and functional) to yield
an overall score. In the final assessment, the overall results were rated as excellent,
good, fair, or poor using a scoring system based on both subjective and objective
criteria<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 18.0. The general
characteristics are presented as frequencies and percentages, with average and standard
deviations also provided. The Paired t-test was used for analysis of changes in independent
variables between before and after the training. The independent t-test was used for
analysis of changes in dependent variables between groups. The significance threshold was
set to p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in DTSM, HT and TOA after the intervention are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of outcomes of asymmetry within groups and between groups

with a reported incidence of 0.3&#x02013;1.9%<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to Tatli et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, the recovery
rate is higher for the group of children that receive an intervention within 6 weeks of
birth compared to the group of children that receive an intervention after 6 weeks. Early
intervention has a faster effect than later intervention. The authors also reported that if
the intervention is begun within 1.5 months, 98% normal cervical range of motion can be
achieved<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the DTSM, HT and TOA showed significant differences in the group that
started treatment before six weeks and the group that started treatment after six weeks.
DTSM only showed significant differences between the two groups after the intervention. The
infants with CMT received therapeutic ultrasound, massage therapy, and manual stretching
exercises for 30 minutes along with passive stretching exercises. And early intervention for
a child with CMT at less than 1 month of age yields a 98% success rate by 2.5 months of age,
with the infant achieving near normal range of motion.</p><p>The ultimate goal of physical therapy for CMT children is to minimize abnormal voluntary
placement and movement and to normalize the cervical range of motion<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the success rate of conservatory treatment for
infant patients within 12 months after birth is closely related to the age of the patients
and the time of enforcement of exercise treatment, active and passive extensional movements
during this period can be a very effective means of treatment<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cheng et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>
and Persing et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that manual
stretching is beneficial even in children with severe contracture. However, passive
extension sometimes causes micro damage to the cervical soft tissue. In such situations
involving pain, passive manipulation to increase the range of motion and manual stretching
is not recommended, because micro damage in the soft tissue eventually decreases the range
of motion and brings about fibrosis proliferation<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, in previous studies, the most common treatment for SCM mass and muscular
torticollis is manual extensional movement. The advantage of this treatment is that there is
no need to consider the intensity and technique when extending the neck to increase the
passive range of motion, and passive cervical stretching can be applied to the baby while
feeding them<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study by Cheng et
al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, an accurate application of a
protocol for manual extensional exercise by a skilled therapist resulted in a high success
rate. According to existing studies on the application of manual extensional exercise, since
there can be severe resistance from 3-month-old patients due to the pain and discomfort of
manual extensional exercise, prolonged stretching with low intensity is better than a
forcible method to effectively increase the range of motion<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Even though SCM masses reach a maximum size then gradually decrease and disappear and
muscle tension also subsides in most childhood patients<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, fibrosis does not disappear in many portions of the SCM, remaining
in some childhood patients and causing secondary problems. If the restriction of movement
range persists and the head position and posture including motion remain asymmetric after
interventions for the infant patients, continuous physical therapy is the optimal
method<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, if abnormal tension and
mass in the SCM remains after long term conservative treatment, surgical treatment must be
considered<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The conclusion of treatment is achieved after gaining a symmetric cervical range of motion
in terms of the functional aspect for infant patients, with unapparent head inclination, and
symmetry of the SCM with thickness less than 10%<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The typical compensation action among the characteristics of torticollis in children is
tension in the upper trapezius<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to previous studies, while the shape of the upper neck is formed by the fibers of
the SCM, the shape of the lower neck is formed by the fibers of the upper trapezius. This is
why there is a possibility of lesion formation in the ipsilateral upper trapezius, which
co-contracts with the affected SCM. Some infant patients lift the affected shoulder to place
their head in the center. CMT children experience disproportionate development of the
musculoskeletal system starting in the uterus until 1&#x02005;year after birth, and have abnormal
movement planning and practice due to dyscinesia.</p><p>The general opinion on the treatment outcome for infants with congenital muscular
torticolis is related with ROM and the age when treatment is started. Retrospective and
prospective studies on cervical AROM exercise intervention started before the age of 1
confirmed 61 to 99 percent successful treatment outcomes, thus demonstrating a direct
influence on the entire intervention<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, &#x000d6;hman et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> contended that the age when intervention
is started has a definite effect on the acquisition of symmetric cervical posture and
therefore recommends early intervention. To conclude, early intervention shortens the
intervention period and secures the best result<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
