Such patients continue to be followed during the trial and are at risk for the occurrence of additional events, but second and third order events are generally not considered in a primary endpoint efficacy analysis. However, in a real-world clinical setting, both patients and clinicians are concerned not only with the initial event a patient may experience but with subsequent events as well. Additionally, patients who experience multiple events may be a subset of subjects who are poor responders to therapy. Identification of baseline characteristics, including platelet response measures in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome, among such subjects may allow modifications of the clinical management strategy prior to the occurrence of subsequent events, such as providing more intensive or additional therapy.</p><p>As previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref></sup> The TRial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet InhibitioN with Prasugrel (TRITON)-TIMI 38 showed an overall reduction in the composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke over a median duration of therapy of 14.5 months (interquartile range 8.8 months, 15.1 months) with intensive dual antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel compared to the approved regimen of clopidogrel in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). These benefits of prasugrel over clopidogrel in preventing events were achieved at the cost of an increased rate of TIMI major non-CABG-related bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref></sup> We hypothesized that not only first events but subsequent events would also be reduced with greater platelet inhibition using prasugrel when compared with standard therapy with clopidogrel. We also sought to evaluate whether repeated bleeding events occurred more frequently with prasugrel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study design and primary results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial have been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C2">2</xref></sup> A total of 13 608 patients with an acute coronary syndrome (both UA/NSTEMI and STEMI) for whom a PCI was planned were enrolled in TRITON-TIMI 38 and were randomized to prasugrel (loading dose of 60 mg and daily maintenance dose of 10 mg) or the approved regimen of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg daily maintenance dose).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref></sup> Randomization was to occur prior to the onset of PCI and blinded study drug administration was to be administered as soon as possible after randomization. During the maintenance phase, patients were to receive blinded study drug and aspirin (suggested dose of 75&#x02013;162 mg). After hospital discharge, follow-up visits were conducted at 30 days, 90 days, and at 3 month intervals thereafter for a minimum of 6 months and maximum of 15 months.</p><p>All endpoints used in the analyses in the initial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref></sup> as well as this report were adjudicated by members of an independent clinical events committee who were blinded to the treatment assignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C2">2</xref></sup> Fatal events were counted as a single event, not as two separate events. For example, if a patient experienced an MI and then had cardiovascular death with the cause of death adjudicated as due to the MI, the event was considered one fatal MI event and was not counted as both an MI and cardiovascular death. Patients were to remain on study drug even if the subject experienced one of the efficacy endpoints of the study. If a subject experienced a bleeding event, study drug could be continued or discontinued at the treating physician's discretion.</p><p>Efficacy comparisons were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A sensitivity analysis was performed that included only efficacy events that occurred during the &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; period, defined as on study drug or within 7 days after permanent study drug discontinuation. The analysis of bleeding events was also restricted to the &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; period.</p><p>Baseline clinical characteristics are presented as frequencies for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. Comparisons between baseline characteristics for patients with no events, a single event, or multiple events (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHN362TB1">1</xref></italic>), as well as for the comparison of prasugrel with clopidogrel in the cohort of patients with at least one non-fatal event (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHN362TB2">2</xref></italic>), were made using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank for continuous variables. Poisson regression analysis was performed to compare the total number of occurrences of the primary endpoint between all patients in the prasugrel and clopidogrel groups. Poisson regression is a generalized linear model applied when analysing multiple discrete counts (i.e. number of occurrences of an event) over a period of time (i.e. duration of follow-up in the trial). Landmark analytic methods were used to evaluate the risk of a second event following the initial event, with entry time into the analysis being set at the time of the first event. The landmark method of survival analysis utilizes a fixed timepoint from which patients were entered into the analysis and considered at risk (in this case, after the occurrence of an initial primary endpoint event) to assess the subsequent response in the treatment groups. Landmark event rates were presented as Kaplan&#x02013;Meier failure estimates and were compared using the log rank test. Hazard ratios for the landmark analyses were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. All tests were two-sided with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 considered to be significant. Due to the exploratory nature of the analysis, no adjustments were made to thresholds for significance for multiple testing. Analyses were performed using Stata/SE 9.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).</p><table-wrap id="EHN362TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics in

While the early benefit of prasugrel was evident in the primary analysis in the report of the main results as shown by the immediate separation of the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C1">1</xref></sup> our findings suggest that continued therapy with a regimen that provides higher levels of IPA remains important, even after an ischaemic event has occurred. Indeed, intensive anti-platelet therapy seems to be of added benefit to those who have already had such an event, an observation evident in both the intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses.</p><p>Despite the practice of censoring patients who experience a component of the primary composite endpoint in standard statistical analysis of clinical outcomes trial data when applying survival methods, what is of importance to patients and from a healthcare resource utilization perspective are the outcomes for a patient during the course of the entire trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C3">3</xref></sup> Multiple events experienced by a given patient require more hospitalizations, tests, treatments, and physician visits, resulting in increased costs. From a patient perspective, additional ischaemic events result in a higher mortality as well as an impaired quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Several validated scoring systems accurately predict those at an increased risk of events following an ACS based on baseline characteristics and index presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C9">9</xref></sup> While risk scores were higher and baseline clinical risk factors (e.g. older age, more frequent diabetes, hypertension, and prior MI) were more frequent among patients with multiple events than those with a single event, other unidentified factors also influence the risk of recurrent ischaemic events. Based on the observation that total events in this study were higher with clopidogrel, it is possible that those patients with recurrent events may be more resistant to anti-platelet therapy, and/or more likely to be hyporesponders to platelet inhibition, a concept previously reported to be associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C14">14</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that prasugrel produces higher and more consistent levels of the active metabolite that binds to the platelet P2Y12 receptor than clopidogrel, both at the approved dose used in the current study as well as at higher doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with diabetes experiencing ACS are of particular interest since they are known to have an increased rate of cardiovascular events and more aggregable platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN362C19">19</xref></sup> and the primary analysis of TRITON-TIMI 38 showed that they responded particularly well to prasugrel. In this analysis, we observed that a significant interaction occurred between diabetes and randomized therapy on the risk of a recurrent primary endpoint event, with a hazard ratio of 0.40 favouring prasugrel in patients with diabetes.</p><p>There was no difference between treatment groups in the risk of recurrent bleeding events, although such events were rare due to a high rate (42%) of study drug discontinuation following the initial bleeding event. As per the protocol, if a subject experienced a bleeding event during the trial, the investigator was permitted to discontinue study drug therapy and restart study drug after the bleeding event had subsided. However, a large number of patients in both arms who experienced a major bleeding event permanently discontinued study drug.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>It should be noted that with landmark analyses comparing two therapies within a trial, the original randomization assigned at study entry is subject to survivor bias and study drug discontinuation. However, among patients with a non-fatal ischaemic event who comprised the landmark analysis cohort, there were few significant differences in evaluated baseline characteristics between the prasugrel and clopidogrel groups (age, history of diabetes, and multivessel PCI). When the landmark analysis for a second event was adjusted for these imbalanced covariates, as well as covariates associated with the occurrence of an additional event, prasugrel remained associated with a lower risk of additional events compared with clopidogrel (univariate HR 0.65; adjusted HR 0.66, <italic>P</italic> = 0.024). Additionally, there was no difference in mortality between treatment groups overall in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial (3.0 vs. 3.2%, HR 0.95, <italic>P</italic> = 0.64). The impact that continued therapy with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel could have had on recurrent bleeding events may not be fully assessed due to the high rate of study drug discontinuation (in both treatment arms) following the initial bleeding event and the infrequent nature of repeat bleeding events.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Prasugrel, a more potent thienopyridine than clopidogrel, reduced not only the first but also subsequent occurrences of primary endpoint events compared with the approved dose of clopidogrel. This observation emphasizes the need for continued high levels of platelet inhibition following an acute coronary syndrome. Patients who experience an ischaemic event despite treatment with clopidogrel may be hyporesponders to this drug and may require more intensive platelet P2Y12 inhibition to prevent the occurrence of subsequent adverse thrombotic complications. Patients at greatest risk for events, such as those who have already experienced an event while on clopidogrel (especially diabetic patients) may experience especially salutary effects when treated with a drug that provides more intensive inhibition of the platelet P2Y12 receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>TRITON-TIMI 38 was supported by research grants from Daiichi Sankyo and Eli Lilly.
