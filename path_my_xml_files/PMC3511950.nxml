Patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I, aged between 20 to 50 years scheduled for surgery in distal region of upper limb under IVRA were included. Those with history of allergic reaction to lignocaine, significant cardiovascular disease, sickle cell disease, history of chronic pain or regular medication with analgesics, history of opioid dependence, drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric disorder, peripheral vascular disease, and neurological diseases were excluded from the study. At the pre-operative visit, on the evening before surgery, the visual analog scale (VAS) scoring system was explained to all the patients.</p><p>Patients were assigned randomly to one of three groups depending on the drug solution used for IVRA (n = 24 in each group). Patients in Group L received lignocaine only; Group LK received lignocaine along with ketamine (0.5 mg/ kg); and Group LD received lignocaine and dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/ kg). The lignocaine used in the study was 2% preservative free and constant (200 mg) in all groups, as was the total volume of test solution (20 ml). Normal saline (0.9 %) was added to make up the volume as required.</p><p>No premedication was given to any of the patients. Standard monitoring was used in all patients, which included noninvasive arterial blood pressure, heart rate, electrokardiogram and pulse oximetry. Prior to administration of IVRA, an infusion of 0.9 % normal saline was started in the normal limb. A 20G IV cannula was inserted into distal vein of the extremity that was to be studied; cotton pad was applied to the arm to protect the skin. Two tourniquets were placed over the cotton pad. The arm was exsanguinated by using an Esmarch bandage. The proximal tourniquet was inflated to 100 mm Hg above the systolic pressure of the patient. The absence of radial artery pulsations and failure of pulse oximetry tracing in the ipsilateral index finger was confirmed. 20 ml of test solution was injected over 10 seconds by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the drug being administered.</p><p>After the injection of different study solutions, the onset of sensory block (defined as loss of pain sensation) was determined by the pin prick method, with a 22G hypodermic needle, distal to the tourniquet at 20 sec intervals. The motor block was assessed at one min interval till the patient was not able to produce movement of any fingers. On complaint of the tourniquet pain by patient intraoperatively, the distal cuff was inflated and the proximal cuff was deflated. If required, the timing of the second cuff inflation was noted.</p><p>Need for intraoperative analgesia was also recorded. At the end of the operation, a blinded anesthesiologist recorded the satisfaction score of the patient for the anesthetic technique according to the following numeric scale: 3 = good (no complaint from patient), 2 = moderate (minor complaint with no need for supplemental analgesics), 1 = poor (complaint which required supplemental analgesics). Recovery room pain score, time to first analgesic demand, and sedation score (Ramsay Sedation Score) were compared. We also recorded the occurrence of any unpleasant psychologic effects postoperatively.</p><p>Postoperatively patients received diclofenac 75 mg intramuscular if VAS was &#x0003e;4.</p><p>All values were calculated with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The parameters were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD and t-test was used for comparing demographic and clinical data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was used for comparison between the three groups for parametric data. Chi-square test was used for non-parametric data. For the comparisons, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The sample size was chosen after reviewing many randomized control studies on the same subject and had a sample size ranging between 20 and 40 patients. The statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS version 11.0.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Result</title><p>A total of 72 patients were enrolled in the study (n = 24 in each group). The mean age and duration of surgery were not different between groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). All the patients operated during the study period were male. Among the patients, none was excluded from the study because of technical failure. The patients in Group L weighed less than those in Group LK or Group LD. Duration of surgery were similar in all the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Types of surgery performed are depicted in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

IVRA is safe and problems are few. The advantages of IVRA are high indices of reliability, rapid onset of analgesia within 5-10 minutes and good muscular relaxation. The disadvantage of IVRA is the application of a tourniquet, which must remain inflated continuously throughout the procedure. The duration of surgery is limited by the time during which the arterial tourniquet could be kept safely inflated. Tourniquet pain, which is described as a dull and aching pain sensation, is a well-known limitation of IVRA. Skin compression, tourniquet size, and inflation pressure have been implicated as factors involved in tourniquet pain. Another drawback with this technique is the absence of postoperative analgesia. In several studies it was tried to find a local anesthesia mixture that allows relief from tourniquet pain and prolonged duration of analgesia after tourniquet release. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and combination of opioid and muscle relaxant have been used without demonstrating clear advantage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine, a phenyl-piperidine derivative, was first synthesized in the early 1960s as an IV anesthetic agent. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine exerts a noncompetitive blockade of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA receptors play a major role in synaptic plasticity and are specifically implicated in central nervous system facilitation of pain processing. NMDA receptor antagonists have been implicated in perioperative pain management. Ketamine also has local anesthetic qualities, which have been studied as a sole agent for IVRA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In addition to spinal cord NMDA receptors, NMDA receptors have also been identified on peripheral unmyelinated sensory axons. This can explain why ketamine as an NMDA receptor antagonist was able to attenuate the tourniquet pain. Ketamine 0.5 and 0.3% produced adequate IVRA. Anesthesia was inadequate when a 0.2% concentration was used. Although 0.3% concentration provides complete sympathetic, sensory, and motor blockade when injected into the isolated extremity. Unpleasant psychotomimetic effects after the release of the tourniquet limit the usefulness of this use of ketamine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] When ketamine is used with lignocaine (0.5%) in a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight, duration of analgesia after release of tourniquet is longer, and the quality of analgesia is superior. The onset of analgesia and motor blockade remains similar and all patients suffered from disorientation and hallucinations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In comparison to systemic administration, there is no selective benefit to adding ketamine to the IVRA injectate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Ketamine cannot be recommended as a sole agent for IVRA unless these unpleasant side effects are abolished or controlled by means of pharmacologic adjuvant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] When used in the doses of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg of body weight in IVRA no central nervous system symptoms have been observed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our study clearly demonstrated benefit of ketamine in IVRA when compared to a placebo. There was an early onset of sensory and motor block and good postoperative analgesia, although postoperative analgesia was longer in the dexmedetomidine group. No second cuff inflation was required in any patient denoting delay in onset of the tourniquet pain. Ketamine has well known hemodynamic effects (hypertension and tachycardia) but it failed to show any of these effects when given as an adjuvant in IVRA in our study. This could be due to the fact that the tourniquet was not deflated before 30 min.</p><p>Clonidine has been shown to decrease tourniquet pain and intraoperative analgesic requirement in IVRA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is approximately eight times more selective toward the &#x003b1;2 -adrenoceptors than clonidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Centrally active &#x003b1; -adrenergic agonists exert powerful analgesic action that probably is transduced at several levels. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to enhance the local anesthetic action of lignocaine via &#x003b1; 2A adrenoceptor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Perioperative dexmedetomidine administration decreases the requirements for opioid or non-opioid analgesics both intra and postoperatively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] IV dexmedetomidine as a premedication has been effective before IVRA because it reduces patient anxiety, sympathoadrenal responses, and opioid analgesic requirements but it did not reduce tourniquet pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Addition of dexmedetomidine to prilocaine in IVRA decreases pain scores, improves anesthesia quality, decreases analgesic requirement, shortens sensory block onset time, and prolongs sensory block recovery time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Addition of dexmedetomidine to lignocaine in IVRA also improves the quality of anesthesia and decreases the analgesic requirements but has no effect on the sensory and motor block onset and regression time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Our study demonstrated that the addition of dexmedetomidine, in dose of one mcg/kg of body weight, to lignocaine for IVRA not only improved quality of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia without causing significant side effects but also shortened the onset of sensory and motor block as compared to placebo. Dexmedetomidine administration produces abrupt hypertension and bradycardia until the central sympatholytic effect dominates, resulting in moderate decrease in both mean arterial pressure and heart rate from baseline.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In our study, no such hemodynamic changes were observed with use of dexmedetomidine in IVRA. IV dexmedetomidine is also known to exert a sedative effect, which was significantly higher than other groups in our study.</p><p>This is the first clinical study comparing the addition of dexmedetomidine and ketamine to lignocaine for IVRA. Superiority of one over the other could not be established as ketamine produced early onset of block and delayed onset of tourniquet pain, whereas dexmedetomidine when added in IVRA provided better postoperative analgesia. Ketamine use was associated with better patient satisfaction than placebo or dexmedetomidine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intravenous regional anesthesia.
