Current therapeutic management of PD largely involves strategies to optimize the replacement of deficient dopamine, using levodopa, dopamine agonists, and inhibitors of dopamine-metabolizing enzymes. Currently under investigation for use in the treatment of PD, safinamide has multiple modes of action including monoamine oxidase B inhibition. It is well absorbed orally, has a long plasma half-life, and does not have liver enzyme-inducing or liver enzyme-inhibiting activity. Peak plasma concentration occurs 2&#x02013;4 hours after single oral doses. Safinamide as monotherapy and as an adjunct to dopamine agonists improves Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale motor scores. One randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 168 patients given a median safinamide dose of 70 mg/day (range 40&#x02013;90 mg/day) significantly increased the proportion of responders &#x02013; defined as patients improving their Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale motor scores by 30% or more from baseline &#x02013; after 3 months (37.5% for safinamide versus 21.4% for placebo; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Safinamide increased &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time with no or minor dyskinesia compared with the placebo in another trial, but dyskinesia severity was not reduced. Safinamide was well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile similar to that of the placebo. Further Phase III trial data for safinamide efficacy is awaited, and will be of interest in a comparison with other developments in PD therapeutics: modified formulations of available compounds, new drug classes such as adenosine receptor antagonists, and gene-based therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>monoamine oxidase B inhibitors</kwd><kwd>dyskinesia</kwd><kwd>Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale</kwd><kwd>antiparkinsonian drug</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction to the management issues in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a deficiency of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway. It is recognized by the core motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability that help to make the clinical diagnosis of PD (according, for example, to the UK Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria<xref rid="b1-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), but nonmotor symptoms such as sleep disturbances, olfactory dysfunction, and behavioral and cognitive problems can also cause considerable functional disability. Management initially involves a discussion of the diagnosis and nature of the condition with the patient, followed by a combined approach to ameliorate the motor and nonmotor symptoms, with pharmacotherapy and physical, occupational, and speech therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of current pharmacological management strategies</title><p>Since the discovery of levodopa as a treatment for PD, additional treatments, with fewer long-term side effects such as dyskinesia and with a better pharmacokinetic profile than the short half-life of levodopa (1&#x02013;2 hours), have been developed.<xref rid="b2-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Over the last decade this search has been further motivated by discoveries in the understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying PD. Available PD treatment options largely improve motor symptoms rather than being neuroprotective, although there is an indication that some agents may fulfill both objectives.<xref rid="b3-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Current pharmacological management of the motor symptoms of PD relies mainly on dopamine precursors (levodopa), dopamine agonists (DAs), enzyme inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and amantadine, which is an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.</p><p>Levodopa was first introduced in the 1960s for the treatment of PD and remains the gold standard. It is an amino acid precursor of dopamine and acts by replenishing striatal dopamine. Levodopa is combined with an extracerebral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI), either benserazide or carbidopa, to inhibit peripheral breakdown and enhance central delivery. Levodopa-based treatment may cause nausea, vomiting, and postural hypotension in the early stages, and it is linked to the development of dyskinesia in the later stages when response fluctuations emerge. It causes fewer neuropsychiatric side effects than other antiparkinsonian drugs and is, therefore, a common first choice for older patients and those with comorbidities.</p><p>DAs bind directly to the postsynaptic dopamine receptors and are effective in improving function in patients with PD, both as monotherapy and as adjuncts to levodopa. The ergot-derived DAs (bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide) have fallen out of favor because of their fibrogenic potential. Non-ergot DAs including pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine are often first-line agents in younger-onset PD patients, where the risk of longer-term motor complications is higher. Side effects include nausea, hypotension, peripheral edema, tiredness, and impulse control disorders.</p><p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is one of the enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of dopamine. Selective MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline are effective as monotherapy and as adjuncts to levodopa or other agents, without having the dietary restrictions of nonselective MAO inhibitors. When used with levodopa, selegiline may accentuate postural hypotension. Rasagiline is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>COMT is another enzyme that catabolizes dopamine, both peripherally and in the central nervous system. Inhibition of COMT in the periphery allows for increased bioavailability and longer duration of action of levodopa. Entacapone and tolcapone are used as adjuncts to levodopa for PD patients who experience &#x0201c;end of dose&#x0201d; deterioration. Because of the hepatotoxic potential of tolcapone, entacapone is the preferred COMT inhibitor. Entacapone is contraindicated in those with pheochromocytoma, a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Side effects include diarrhea, nausea, dry mouth, and sweating. It is available as a triple combination tablet with levodopa and a DDI, marketed as Stalevo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland).</p><p>Amantadine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist and a weak DA with modest antiparkinsonian effects. It is used as an antidyskinetic agent in PD. It is contraindicated in epilepsy and in those with a history of gastric ulceration. Tolerance to its effects may develop, and confusion and hallucinations occasionally occur.</p><p>Anticholinergic drugs (orphenadrine, procyclidine, and trihexyphenidyl) exert their antiparkinsonian action by reducing the effects of relative central cholinergic excess that occurs as result of dopamine deficiency. However, the use of anticholinergic drugs has declined significantly because of adverse cognitive effects; other side effects include dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention.</p><p>In the early stages of the disease, DAs, MAO-B inhibitors, and levodopa with a DDI are the main choices for the symptomatic treatment of the motor symptoms of PD. There is no single drug of choice. Physician and patient preference, considering the adverse effect profile of individual drug classes, and comorbidities influence the choice and sequence of drug therapy. Current approaches favoring DAs initially for many young-onset patients who are otherwise well and levodopa as the first choice for older patients (often with comorbidity) may change with results of the Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Medicines (PDMED) trial, although full results are not yet reported.<xref rid="b4-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The management of later stages of PD often involves combinations of dopamine replacement therapies, such as levodopa with a DDI, DAs, MAO-B inhibitors, and COMT inhibitors. However, motor and nonmotor complications may limit drug choices and require individualization of drug therapy. Parenteral routes of drug delivery (apomorphine, levodopa plus carbidopa intestinal gel) are utilized when motor complications become more troublesome, providing a more physiologic nonpulsatile delivery of dopamine.</p></sec><sec><title>Safinamide</title><p>MAO plays a major role in the in vivo inactivation of biogenic and diet-derived amines, in both the central nervous system and the peripheral body tissues. MAO isoenzyme A (MAO-A) is mainly responsible for the deamination of serotonin and noradrenaline in the intestine. The MAO-B isoenzyme predominates in the striatum.<xref rid="b5-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Dopamine is a substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B. Selective inhibitors of MAO-B reduce the catabolism of dopamine and thereby increase the presynaptic levels of this neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia, without affecting the metabolism of other amines that are catabolized by MAO-A.</p><p>Safinamide mesylate was first synthesized in 1989 in the medicinal chemistry program at Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Initial investigation of safinamide was for its use as a potential antiepileptic drug, following the observation that milacemide, from which safinamide is derived, had some anticonvulsant activity.<xref rid="b6-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Safinamide mesylate is an alpha-aminoamide (chemical formula C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>FN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x000b7; CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S) with multiple mechanisms of action.</p><sec><title>Mechanism of action</title><p>Sodium channel- and calcium channel-blocking properties led to initial trials of safinamide as an antiepileptic drug, but its selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor activity drew attention toward its potential use in PD.<xref rid="b7-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The selectivity of safinamide for the B isoform of the human enzyme versus the A isoform is about 1000:1, compared with selegiline at 3400:1 and rasagiline at 2500:1.<xref rid="b6-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Safinamide also inhibits dopamine reuptake and glutamate release, the latter action being shared with amantadine, which has some efficacy in reducing dyskinesia in PD.<xref rid="b13-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The main safinamide mechanism of action is inhibition of the sigma-1 receptor, where the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 19 nM.<xref rid="b8-jep-4-085" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The potency of safinamide is less at other sites, being in the micromolar range for sodium channel blockade (IC50, 8.2 &#x000b5;M) and the high micromolar range for calcium channel blockade (IC50, 31.5 &#x000b5;M) and glutamate release (IC50,&#x0003e;.56.4 &#x000b5;M).

The clearance half-life was about 22 hours and 89% was bound to plasma proteins.</p><p>Both dose linearity and dose proportionality were demonstrated after enteral absorption.

It has been studied in a large number of PD patients at doses ranging between 50 and 200 mg/day without serious side effects. There have been no direct comparisons made with selegiline or rasagiline. Two further Phase III trials, MOTION (safinamide add-on to DAs for early idiopathic PD) and SETTLE (safinamide in idiopathic PD with motor fluctuations, as add-on to levodopa), have yet to report. Merck KGaA recently returned the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize safinamide for PD to Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA.</p><sec><title>Future directions</title><p>Drugs that are the subject of current trials for treatment of PD include modified formulations of levodopa (IPX066), DAs (pardoprunox), COMT inhibitors (nebicapone), adenosine receptor antagonists (istradefylline, preladenant), neurotrophic factors (Cogane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), gene therapies utilizing an adeno-associated virus vector to deliver the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene, stem cell therapies, antidyskinetic agents (fipamezole), and drugs for treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (pitolisant). Nondopaminergic mechanisms play a role in many of the nonmotor manifestations of PD and are therefore a key current focus of research. Dopaminergic therapies underpin current management strategies in treating PD, and their evolution continues with agents such as safinamide. It is also anticipated that the scope of antiparkinsonian therapy will broaden, with new treatments that influence nondopaminergic mechanisms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments/disclosure</title><p>DG has received consultancy fees from Civitas Therapeutics Inc and Vectura Group plc and honoraria from Teva/Lundbeck, UCB Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Pharmacia, and Abbott.
