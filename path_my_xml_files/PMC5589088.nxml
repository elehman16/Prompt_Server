Some trials report a prolongation in the duration of nerve block [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], whereas others do not [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In-vitro animal studies have demonstrated a perineural effect of block prolongation, mediated through a direct inhibition of the I<sub>h</sub> current in C-fibers [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but clonidine also possess systemic analgesic properties.</p><p>Peripheral nerve blocks are frequently used for surgical procedures, either as the sole anesthetic, or as part of a multimodal pain management to reduce opioid related side effects [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>One of the shortcomings of single injection nerve blocks is the relatively limited duration of action. There are several ways of extending the duration of nerve blocks: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the use of long acting local anesthetics or the addition of different adjuvants [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have shown an increase in postoperative sensory block duration [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and improved postoperative analgesia [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], when adding clonidine to ropivacaine. However, these studies did not control for systemic effects, and whether the difference in duration is caused by local effects, or by a systemic uptake of the peripherally administered clonidine remains unknown. The only clinical study including a systemic control group, added clonidine to ropivacaine in a sciatic-femoral nerve block. This study showed no difference in block duration between the placebo, systemic or perineural groups [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] suggesting no clinically relevant effect of clonidine.</p><p>To achieve control of a possible systemic effect of clonidine, we developed a model based on simultaneous bilateral Adductor Canal Blocks (ACBs) in volunteers with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5% + 1 ml clonidine 150&#x003bc;g/ml in one leg and 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5% and saline in the other leg. As the perineurally administered clonidine on one side was absorbed and redistributed systemically, it would equally affect both nerve blocks in each participant. A longer duration of the nerve block receiving clonidine perineurally would therefore entirely be attributed to a local effect of clonidine on the saphenous nerve.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that perineural injection of clonidine, used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine, prolongs the duration of an ACB by a peripheral, local mechanism when controlling for a possible systemic effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The Regional Ethics Committee (Region Sj&#x000e6;llands Videnskabsetiske kommit&#x000e9; VEK SJ-437), the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2014-005640-18) (United States Food and Drug Administration equivalent), and the data protection agency approved the study. Prior to enrollment of the first patient on 05/12/2015, the study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02444559) by the principal investigator Jakob Hessel Andersen. Signed informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study design and description are in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Clinical Trials (CONSORT) (See CONSORT diagram <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181351.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The study was monitored by the Copenhagen Good Clinical Practice Unit and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Clonidine is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration or by the European Medicines Agency for perineural use, but is a widely used and accepted adjuvant for perineural administration [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this blinded, randomized paired trial, we planned to include 21 healthy volunteers. Eligible subjects were male, ASA physical status I, age &#x0003e;18 years. Exclusion criteria were: Inability to cooperate, inability to read and speak Danish, known allergies to any of the involved drugs, weekly alcohol consumption of more than 21 units, medical abuse, consumption of opioids within 4 weeks or any analgesics within 48 hours, neuromuscular defects, former surgery or trauma to the lower extremities. Upon screening, the principal investigator included the participants consecutively. The study was conducted in the Perioperative Unit, Department of Anesthesiology, Zealand University Hospital, K&#x000f8;ge, in the period May to June 2015.

In the period 4 to 10 hours post block (approximately midnight to 6AM) the participants were allowed to sleep and no sensory tests were done. We considered this reasonable, as none of the subjects with an ACB in a previous, similar study had a duration of less than 14 hours. When VAS scores became &#x0003e; 0 during tonic heat stimulation the temperature discrimination test (alcohol swab) was repeated every 30 minutes. Rebound pain, defined as pain during tonic heat stimulation, was measured one hour after normalization of temperature sensation. The principal investigator or the sub investigator did all assessments.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Block performance</title><p>We monitored all participants with continuous ECG, blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation every 15 minutes for the first four hours, and thereafter every hour. Sedation was scored hourly according to a verbal Likert scale 0&#x02013;3 (0 = no sedation, 1 = light sedation, 2 = moderate sedation, 3 = severe sedation). We inserted an intravenous line prior to block performance. Each participant received an ultrasound-guided (Sparq Ultrasound System, Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands) ACB, first in the right leg and then immediately hereafter in the left leg. At the mid-thigh level, the femoral artery was visualized in the short axis below the sartorius muscle. Using an in-plane technique with a 22G x 80 mm needle (Pajunk SonoPlex Stim cannula, Gelsingen, Germany) the sartorius muscle was pierced and study medication was injected slowly anterolateral to the femoral artery surrounding the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal in 5 ml increments preceded by aspiration as described previously[<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The &#x0201c;adductor canal approach&#x0201d; was chosen since this technique results in a high success rate when blocking the saphenous nerve.[<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study medication</title><p>Each participant received bilateral ACBs with 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.5% mixed with 1 ml clonidine 150&#x003bc;g/ml in one leg and 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.5% with 1 ml isotonic saline in the other leg according to randomization in a blinded fashion. Investigators, participants and all other personnel were unaware of the allocation. Skanderborg Pharmacy, Denmark prepared the computer-generated randomization list as well as one box containing study medication for each participant. The boxes were sequentially numbered according to the randomization list. Each box contained two identical ampoules, one containing 1 ml of clonidine 150&#x003bc;g/ml, and the other 1 ml of isotonic saline. According to the randomization list, these ampules were marked left and right leg. The study medication was drawn in syringes marked &#x02018;left&#x02019; and &#x02018;right&#x02019; leg by the principal investigator and checked by the sub investigator.

Assuming a correlation of 0.5 between duration for intervention leg and duration for control leg and setting the minimal relevant difference to four hours, &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.10 a sample size of 18 volunteers would be required.

The clonidine administered perineurally in one leg was absorbed into the systemic circulation, and due to the bilateral setup, systemic effects of clonidine would equally have affected both blocks. Accordingly, if we had seen a longer duration of the nerve block in the leg receiving clonidine perineurally, it would have been caused by a local effect of clonidine. The main limitation of the present design is that it only allowed us to draw firm conclusions had we found a difference in duration. As there was no difference between the groups, there are four possible interpretations of our result: Clonidine has systemic effects, but no local effect. A larger systemic effect overshadowed the local effect. The effects of perineural and systemic clonidine are the same or lastly, that there is no effect of clonidine at all. We observed equal, relatively long durations of nerve blocks, which could be caused by systemic absorption and redistribution of the perineurally administered clonidine. We may have been able to conclude on systemic effects of clonidine as an adjuvant, had we included a placebo-group receiving no clonidine at all.</p><p>Most previous trials have employed a two-group design where one group received a block with ropivacaine and clonidine and the other group only ropivacaine [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This type of design investigates the overall effect of clonidine on block duration, but it does not allow us to conclude on the site of action. Results from these trials are conflicting. Four of the trials found no prolongation of the sensory nerve block supporting that clonidine has no effect at all [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas others found a prolonging effect of adding clonidine to ropivacaine [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This effect could be caused by a peripheral mechanism of clonidine, or the absorption and systemic redistribution of the perineurally administered clonidine exerting its properties systemically.</p><p>Five trials have aimed to control for possible systemic effects of clonidine by adding a third group. All patients received active nerve blocks with local anesthetic and either perineural-, systemic- or no clonidine (placebo). Again, results are conflicting [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Helayel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] used intramuscular clonidine as a systemic adjuvant to ropivacaine in a sciatic nerve block for foot and ankle surgery, whereas Culebras et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] added a group receiving intramuscular clonidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in an interscalene block for rotator cuff repair. Both trials found no difference in duration of analgesia between the perineural, systemic and placebo groups, suggesting that there is no effect of clonidine used as an adjuvant.</p><p>In a trial on hip fracture patients, all received psoas compartment block with levobupivacaine and either a perineural or an intravenous administration of clonidine or placebo. Administration of intravenous but not perineural clonidine prolonged postoperative analgesia supporting a systemic mechanism of action [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Opposed to this, a trial on hand surgery in axillary nerve block combining mepivacaine/ epinephrine with clonidine found significantly longer anesthesia and analgesia in the perineural group compared to placebo and the subcutaneous groups [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, a trial on foot and ankle surgery in popliteal/saphenous nerve block combining bupivacaine/epinephrine with clonidine found significantly longer analgesia in the perineural group compared to placebo and intramuscular groups [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These two trials suggest a perineural advantage of clonidine and thus challenges our results.</p><p>The problem concerning the three-group design is that it lacks control of the systemic contribution of clonidine, and therefore does not enable us to conclude on the site of action. Both the perineurally- and the systemically administered clonidine would be absorbed, and exert systemic effects. The contradicting results observed in these trials [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] could be explained by the pharmacokinetic profile of clonidine. Perineural administered clonidine may have a different rate of absorption, compared to the subcutaneous or intramuscular administered clonidine and could explain the difference in duration of nerve blocks reported between perineural and systemic groups in these studies.</p><p>Whether our findings of a lacking advantage of administering clonidine to ropivacaine peripherally can be generalized to other local anesthetics is unknown. One trial compared the addition of clonidine to three different local anesthetics. Clonidine prolonged the duration of motor block in the bupivacaine and mepivacaine groups but not in the ropivacaine group [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Pratap et al. performed a bilateral trial on healthy volunteers resembling ours. They injected 0.5 ml of lidocaine 0.5% with 10 &#x003bc;g clonidine subcutaneously on one forearm and 0.5 ml of lidocaine 0.5% with saline subcutaneously on the opposite forearm. The duration of anesthesia was prolonged from 3.5 hours to at least 6 hours when clonidine was added [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. They assumed that 10 &#x003bc;g of clonidine would be without systemic effects and concluded that clonidine had a peripheral action in enhancing duration of anesthesia on superficial co-infiltration with lidocaine. However, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptors are more numerous at peripheral nerve endings compared to axons which may explain the difference in results [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Also, lidocaine (as well as bupivacaine) have vasodilator effects and the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonists vasoconstriction properties may delay washout of some local anesthetics [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Ropivacaine has intrinsic vasoconstriction properties [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the additional vasoconstriction mediated when adding clonidine to ropivacaine may not be beneficial.</p><p>The systemic adverse events observed in other studies range from no side effects [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to mild sedation [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] lower heart rate [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and lower blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and are consistent with our results. These hemodynamic changes are primarily observed during the first four hours. Side effects seems to increase as higher doses of clonidine are used, and 150&#x003bc;g is currently the recommended dose [<xref rid="pone.0181351.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The bradycardia observed between four and ten hours post block during nighttime in our study is probably physiologically normal for these young healthy males. The participant that fell during the trial had reduced strength in the quadriceps muscle because of proximal spread of study medication in the adductor canal to trigonum femorale eliciting a femoral nerve block.</p><p>Our trial has several other limitations than the already mentioned. Since we conducted the study using an almost exclusively sensory nerve block, we cannot comment on clonidine&#x02019;s effects on motor block. The generalizability to other nerve blocks and whether clonidine could be efficient as a systemic adjuvant requires additional investigation. Further, as no surgery was performed and no inflammatory response or real postoperative pain was present in this trial, generalization to a clinical setting may be difficult. We used 20 ml ropivacaine, which may have led to an insufficient concentration of perineural clonidine (7.5 &#x003bc;M) in order to demonstrate a peripheral effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clonidine administered as a perineural adjuvant to ropivacaine in an ACB does not prolong the duration of sensory block in a setup controlling for systemic effects of clonidine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181351.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol original language.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181351.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181351.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol English.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181351.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181351.s003"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Individual data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181351.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181351.s004"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>Hemodynamic data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181351.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181351.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181351.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to the nurses at the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, University Hospital Zealand, K&#x000f8;ge, Denmark for their invaluable help.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0181351.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>QE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Manjunatha</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Amir</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jamil</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Quadir</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Efficacy of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block: A prospective study</article-title>. <source>Indian journal of anaesthesia</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>58</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>709</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>13</lpage>.
