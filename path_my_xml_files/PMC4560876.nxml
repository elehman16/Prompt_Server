Functional and social barriers are common reasons for non-adherence to post-discharge rehabilitation. Home rehabilitation is an alternative to centre-based rehabilitation but is costlier. Tele-rehabilitation is a possible solution, allowing for remote supervision of rehabilitation and eliminating access barriers. The objective of the Singapore Tele-technology Aided Rehabilitation in Stroke (STARS) trial is to determine if a novel tele-rehabilitation intervention for the first three months after stroke admission improves functional recovery compared to usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a single blind (evaluator blinded), parallel, two-arm randomised controlled trial study design involving 100 recent stroke patients. The inclusion criteria are age &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years, having caregiver support and recent stroke defined as stroke diagnosis within 4&#x000a0;weeks. Consenting participants will be randomized with varying block size of 4 or 6 assuming a 1:1 treatment allocation with the participating centre as the stratification factor. The baseline assessment will be done within 4&#x000a0;weeks of stroke onset, followed by follow-up assessments at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. The tele-rehabilitation intervention lasts for 3&#x000a0;months and includes exercise 5-days-a-week using an iPad-based system that allows recording of daily exercise with video and sensor data and weekly video-conferencing with tele-therapists after data review. Those allocated to the control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is improvement in life task&#x02019;s social activity participation at three months as measured by the disability component of the Jette Late Life Functional and Disability Instrument (LLFDI). Secondary outcome variables consist of gait speed (Timed 5-Meter Walk Test) and endurance (Two-Minute Walk test), performance of basic activities of daily living (Shah-modified Barthel Index), balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale), patient self-reported health-related quality-of-life [Euro-QOL (EQ-5D)], health service utilization (Singapore Stroke Study Health Service Utilization Form) and caregiver reported stress (Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this trial is to provide evidence on the potential benefit and cost-effectiveness of this novel tele-rehabilitation programme which will guide health care decision-making and potentially improve performance of post-stroke community-based rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>This trial protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov on 18 July 2013 as study title &#x0201c;The Singapore Tele-technology Aided Rehabilitation in Stroke (STARS) Study&#x0201d; (ID: The STARS Study, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01905917">NCT01905917</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tele-rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Home rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Post-stroke functional recovery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Supervised therapy is an important factor in determining post-stroke functional recovery. In a 1-year cohort study on local post-stroke patients in the community, only a third of the subjects undergo supervised rehabilitation one month after discharge into the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Those who performed supervised therapy &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;% of the recommended amount of time recovered faster than those who performed a lesser amount of supervised therapy &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;% at 1- and 6-months. Performing therapy at outpatient rehabilitation centre at 1- and 6-months post-stroke is also independently predictive of better Barthel Index (BI) scores at 1&#x000a0;year (72.4 vs. 62.7 at 1&#x000a0;month and 74.7 vs. 59.4 at 6&#x000a0;months). Greater functional independence is associated with reduced caregiver burden, better patient health-related quality of life and potentially lower cost of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In a mixed methods study on non-adherence with recommendations for continued rehabilitation, although 86&#x000a0;% acknowledged that rehabilitation was beneficial, only 40&#x000a0;% intended to continue with rehabilitation after discharge, citing functional and social (e.g. unwillingness to inconvenience their caregiver) barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on the qualitative results, a quantitative questionnaire was administered on a new set of 70 patients with follow-up telephone interviews at three, six, nine and twelve months after discharge. The longitudinal adherence to rehabilitation rate fell from 100&#x000a0;% in hospital to 20.3&#x000a0;% at 3&#x000a0;months, 9.8&#x000a0;% at 6&#x000a0;months, 6.3&#x000a0;% at 9&#x000a0;months and 4.3&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months after discharge.</p><p>Solutions to addressing non-adherence to rehabilitation include the use of transportation and mobility systems such as stair-lifts for stroke survivors living in apartments on floors without access to an elevator. Paid handicap-fitted transport services to ferry stroke survivors to and back from outpatient rehabilitation centers can also overcome physical barriers. Providing paid caregivers for social support and subsidies for outpatient rehabilitation may reduce financial and social barriers. Nevertheless, all such services and/or equipment are expensive; moreover, caregivers are in short supply around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Given the heavy cost and inconvenience incurred in transporting stroke survivors to outpatient rehabilitation centers, home rehabilitation seems to be a viable option in the delivery of post-stroke recovery. Even through home rehabilitation was shown to be equally effective as inpatient rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], it is less cost-efficient than outpatient rehabilitation center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Gladman et al. randomized 327 patients to receive domiciliary or routine (hospital-based) care. Over a 14-month time frame, mean per patient costs for hospital-based services were less than domiciliary services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, the cost of home rehabilitation is at least two times more expensive than therapy at an outpatient rehabilitation center (in Singapore, the norm cost of one hour of home rehabilitation is S$125 per hour and one hour of centre-based rehabilitation is S$50 per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). The relatively higher cost for home rehabilitation can be attributed to the greater economies of scale in outpatient rehabilitation as compared to home rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance, home therapists can only see one patient at a time whereas centre-based therapists can directly supervise the treatment of more than one patient at a time.</p><p>Recent studies focus on the use of home-based tele-health technologies to provide support and guidance by rehabilitation therapists at a distance, representing a novel potential approach for addressing the access to post-acute rehabilitation care problem for stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Tele-rehabilitation provides greater convenience to patients and families and encourages rehabilitation within the patient&#x02019;s home. A study by Sanford et al. showed the feasibility of providing a multi-factorial, multidisciplinary individualized, home-based tele-rehabilitation intervention, demonstrating improved self-efficacy in mobility-impaired adults (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) to the same degree as those who received supervised rehabilitation with physiotherapists and occupational therapists at outpatient rehabilitation centers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These findings were corroborated and extended in two subsequent randomized clinical trials, with differing populations (stroke survivors and intensive care survivors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the intervention still require home visits and video-recordings by a therapy aide. Moreover, as video-recordings do not allow the collection of physical and sensor information from patients, this approach to tele-rehabilitation limits the therapists&#x02019; assessment of patient performance.</p><p>Given the current heterogeneity and room for improvements in solutions related to post-stroke rehabilitation, there is a need for well-designed intervention and rigorous trial to close the gap. The Singapore Tele-technology Aided Rehabilitation in Stroke (STARS) Study is a parallel, two-arm (intervention-control), single blind (evaluator-blind) randomised controlled trial to determine if a novel tele-rehabilitation intervention can improve functional recovery of post-stroke patients. For the tele-rehabilitation intervention arm of this study, the team developed small affordable lightweight wireless wearable sensors which can be strapped onto patients to allow real-time biofeedback and collection of sensor data from the sensors for subsequent transmission to patient&#x02019;s rehabilitation team wirelessly via the internet. The sensor data is automatically summarized in chart form for quick review by therapist to allow them to prescribe further rehabilitation exercises remotely. The system also automatically allows the patient to self-record videos of them exercising which will also be transmitted to the therapist (termed &#x02018;tele-therapist&#x02019;) for review where needed, and allow patients and their therapists to communicate with each other using video-conferencing. The study&#x02019;s primary hypothesis is that this novel tele-rehabilitation intervention during the first three months after stroke admission will result in greater functional recovery compared to usual care three months after stroke admission, as determined by the Jette Late Life Functional and Disability Instrument (LLFDI). Secondary hypotheses are that tele-rehabilitation intervention during the first three months after stroke admission will result in greater functional recovery as determined by gait speed, 2-min walk test and Shah modified Barthel Index, less health service utilization, greater contact time with therapist, better balance, better quality of life, less caregiver burden and be more cost-effective compared to usual care three months after stroke admission. Process measures in the form of a diary will be used to assess improved adherence in rehabilitation. Outcomes will also be assessed again at six months post-stroke to determine whether any improvement in outcomes is sustained in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All procedures conducted during this trial with human participants were carried out in compliance with institutional ethical standards. All research procedures were approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each participating site: Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB Reference No. 2011/779/D), and Ang Mo Kio Thye Hua Kwan Hospital (AMKTHKH) from National University of Singapore (NUS) IRB (NUS IRB Reference Code 11&#x02013;013) and accepted by the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB). SGH is an acute hospital with an acute stroke unit and an inpatient rehabilitation unit, whereas AMKTHKH is an inpatient rehabilitation hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a parallel, two-arm (intervention-control), and single blind (evaluator-blind) randomised controlled trial of a novel home-based tele-rehabilitation intervention provided for 3&#x000a0;months after discharge for stroke admission compared with usual care. Prior to the study, a pilot study was done to test the procedures, interventions and assessments. Eligible participants are randomized to the intervention and control groups at baseline before discharge from the hospital. With regards to mean length of stay in hospital, Chen. et al. reported that patients admitted in local inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (e.g. AMKTHKH) for stroke stayed for 33&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In another study done by Ng. et al., in which 57.9&#x000a0;% of the participants were admitted to an acute hospital (e.g. SGH) for stroke, the mean length of stay for acute referring unit and inpatient rehabilitation unit were 14.5 and 21.5&#x000a0;days respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Prior to the tele-rehabilitation intervention, the research assistant, who previously recruited the participant, will train the participant and their caregiver on the usage of the devices and sensors. The participant and their caregiver will learn how to wear the sensors, operate the hardware and perform all the rehabilitation exercises with the hardware. The training is usually done within 1&#x02013;3 sessions, with each session being an hour long, until the participant and caregiver are competent in its use. These sessions are done before the discharge of participant and, if necessary, in their homes after discharge. To ensure that the participant/caregiver is able to use the devices and sensors, the participant/caregiver must pass a competency check list, such as switching on the iPad and applying the sensors. Additionally, a baseline visit is scheduled for set-up of tele-rehabilitation system in the participant&#x02019;s house.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Hardware component</title><p>The hardware component comprises of an iPad, two limb sensors, a heart rate and blood pressure monitoring set and chargers for these devices. A stable movable floor-mounted flexible iPad stand will be provided to allow easy positioning of iPad to video-record exercises performed by the patient. Engineering details on the tele-rehabilitation system infrastructure and the accuracy of the sensors have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Only basic details necessary to understand how the tele-rehabilitation system works are mentioned here.</p><p>The limb sensor node is used in the system to determine the orientation of the limb being exercised, which is in turn sent to iPad to determine the number of repetitions and range of motion. Each sensor node consists of an ATMEGA328 microprocessor embedded on a printed circuit Board with three motion sensors and attached to a Bluetooth module. The three motion sensors attached are: ITG3200 (gyroscope) and LSM303DLHC (accelerometer and magnetometer). The Bluetooth module, which is a BLE112-A low energy single mode module produced by Bluegiga tech, is required for wireless communication with iPad.</p><p>The data collected from these motion sensors are polled into ATMEGA328 microprocessor through a daisy-chained I<sup>2</sup>C connection. The microprocessor will perform sensor fusion which involves the fusion of data to a 4-dimensional quaternion orientation vector using the algorithm devised by Madgwick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to denote the orientation of the sensor with respect to gravity. This is followed by date and time stamping the orientation. The resulting date/time-stamped orientation data is transmitted to the iPad using Bluetooth 4.0 connection. The patient application in the iPad will analyze the data to determine the orientation of the two limb sensors. The orientation data in turn is used to calculate the angle of movement as performed by the participant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Software component</title><p>The MySQL relational database management system will be used to store data in the system.

Those who are totally dependent or fully independent in activities of daily living (ADL) usually do not receive post-stroke rehabilitation. Those who are mild to moderately dependent in ADL are usually referred for centre-based rehabilitation after discharge from acute hospital. For those who are moderately to severely dependent in ADL, they usually receive inpatient rehabilitation for 4&#x02013;6 weeks at inpatient rehabilitation hospitals after discharge from the acute stroke unit. These moderately to severely ADL dependent patients usually would have recovered to become mild to moderately ADL dependent during their inpatient rehabilitation hospitals stay, and hence would be referred for centre-based rehabilitation after being discharged home from inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. In acute hospitals, rehabilitation is usually started soon after stabilization of stroke and would be provided once a day for a total of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h a day by a physiotherapist and occupational therapist. In inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, rehabilitation is continued upon admission and would be provided twice a day for a total of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h a day by a physiotherapist and occupational therapist. After discharge, it usually takes 1&#x02013;2 weeks for centre-based rehabilitation to be initiated and this is usually provided 1&#x02013;2 times a week for an hour each time.</p><p>Home rehabilitation in Singapore is relatively under-developed and generally unavailable and unaffordable for the majority of stroke patients. Government subsidies for acute hospital and inpatient rehabilitation hospital stays are available, and government subsidies for centre-based rehabilitation are also available. However, government subsidies for home rehabilitation, previously unavailable, were only made available mid-way through this trial in July 2014.</p><p>It should be noted that for ethical reasons, the intervention group is allowed to supplement their tele-rehabilitation sessions with centre-based rehabilitation if they desire. To control for this at the data analysis stage, we will capture data on the total number of hours of use of centre-based and home rehabilitation for both intervention and control groups throughout the six months from study recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Process measures</title><p>In this study, exercise done by the participant refers to those that are prescribed by the therapist. Both unsupervised (defined as exercise done by patient without physical presence of a therapist) and supervised exercise (defined as exercise done by patient in the physical presence of a therapist) that participants have performed are tracked during the trial for both intervention and control subjects. Adherence to supervised and unsupervised therapy will be recorded by the subject in a diary to record the number of minutes subject spent each day in therapy with a therapist (excluding time with the tele-therapist) and the number of minutes subject spent each day doing their prescribed rehabilitation exercises. The tele-therapist will check that the intervention subject is entering these data during tele-consultations. For the control (usual care) subjects, the Study Coordinator will call the subject every 4&#x000a0;weeks to check that the intervention subject is entering these data as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Feedback</title><p>For intervention participants, feedback about their rehabilitation progress is given via real-time and Facetime. For real-time biofeedback, visual and audio feedback is given to the participant through the iPad for every repetition that exceed the target angle when the participant is performing the rehabilitation exercises. For Facetime, the tele-therapist will have a face-to-face consultation with the participant via video call once a week. They will evaluate the participant based on the data collected from the sensors (which capture the progress of the participant when he/she performs the rehabilitative exercises), and the exercises which the participant may be asked to perform during the video call.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>The primary outcome variable and the secondary outcome variables chosen for the study are based on the notion that patients undergoing rehabilitation are more concerned with their improvement in activities and participation instead of reducing their impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although many of the exercises prescribed in this study are known to only reduce impairment, the uses of the primary outcome variable and secondary outcome variables are still valid as the exercises prescribed also improve activity and participation. Furthermore, the participants are asked to walk as much as possible during the 3&#x000a0;months of tele-rehabilitation.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Primary outcome variable</title><p>Functional ability may be quantified using performance based measures or self-report.

Investigators will report to IRB of any adverse events or unanticipated problems, serious or continuing noncompliance, and suspensions or termination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Definition of adverse event</title><p>An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal signs, symptoms, or diseases, temporally associated with the subject&#x02019;s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject&#x02019;s participation in the research. All adverse events regardless of the seriousness and its relation to the study will be reported to the principal investigator. The research member who observed the adverse event will report the following: the date of onset, action taken with respect to study procedures, corrective treatment/therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether the adverse event is related to the intervention exercises.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Definition of unanticipated problem</title><p>In general, an unanticipated problem includes any incident, experience, or outcome that meet all the following criteria: (1) unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents and the characteristics of the subject population being studied, (2) related or possibly related to participation in the research and (3) suggestions that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized and requires changes to the research protocol or informed consent document or other corrective actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or others. Even though the IRB does not require unanticipated problems to be reported, the principal investigator would be informed of them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Reporting of adverse event and unanticipated problem</title><p>Adverse events which will be monitored include unplanned re-hospitalization, emergency department visit, death, falls and fractures, recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction. The principal investigator will determine if the adverse event or unanticipated problem has to be reported to IRB such that any corrective changes to the research protocol, informed consent document or other corrective actions are needed. Reporting of any adverse event or unanticipated problem would be done within five working days from the day the principal investigator is aware of the issue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The STARS Study is a multi-site randomized controlled trial designed to determine the impact of video-conferencing and the use of wearable monitoring devices compared to usual care on the functional recovery of stroke survivors. Stroke results in disabling limitations for patients and supervised rehabilitation can improve functional recovery, but only a minority is undergoing supervised rehabilitation one month after discharge into the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This trial will make several contributions to the practice of rehabilitation after stroke. Firstly, it will test the practicability of a tele-technology aided rehabilitation intervention on a sufficient number of participants to provide a reasonable basis for confident inference to clinical practice. Secondly, this trial will also test the secondary outcomes of tele-rehabilitation in terms of gait speed, contact time with a therapist, balance, self-reported health-related quality of life, health service utilization and caregiver burden in comparison to usual care. Next, the trial will examine if any greater functional improvement in the intervention group is due to better adherence to supervised exercise or independent of better adherence to supervised exercise. Lastly, the tele-technology aided rehabilitation intervention will be tested against usual care to provide an economic evaluation that incorporates resource utilization and patients&#x02019; valuation of their quality of life over the trial period, helping to determine the cost-effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation. Previous studies of the cost of stroke in Singapore estimate only total hospital costs for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and no published studies has examined the cost-effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation over usual care. Optimal usage of technologies in nationwide post-stroke rehabilitation remains a subject of discussion amongst healthcare decision makers and one of the most paramount problems that stops them from implementing it is due to cost. The trial will provide a start in the process of weighing the clinical and economic costs and benefits.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ABC</term><def><p>Activities-specific balance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMKTHKH</term><def><p>Ang Mo Kio Thye Hua Kwan Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of Covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>Barthel Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CES-D</term><def><p>Center for Epidemiologic Studies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CESD-11</term><def><p>Centre for Epidemiologic Studies &#x02013; Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIRB</term><def><p>Centralised Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSRB</term><def><p>Domain Specific Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-QOL(Euro-5D)</term><def><p>patient self-reported health-related quality-of-life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTTPS</term><def><p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLFDI</term><def><p>Late Life Functional and Disability Instrument</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>Mini-Mental State Exam</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NUS</term><def><p>National University of Singapore</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF-10</term><def><p>Physical functioning</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALYs</term><def><p>Quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGH</term><def><p>Singapore General Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STARS</term><def><p>Singapore tele-technology aided rehabilitation in stroke</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ZBI</term><def><p>Zarit burden interview</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>YSC, AT and GCHK are co-owners of T-Rehab Pte Ltd which will market the tele-rehabilitation system.
