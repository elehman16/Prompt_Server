Adding probiotics to foods could be one way to increase iron absorption. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that non-haem iron absorption from a fruit drink is improved by adding <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v (Lp299v). Iron absorption was studied in healthy women of reproductive age using a single-blind cross-over design in two trials applying the double-isotope (<sup>55</sup>Fe and <sup>59</sup>Fe) technique. In Trial 1, iron absorption from a fruit drink containing 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) Lp299v was compared with that from a control drink without Lp299v. Trial 2 had the same design but 10<sup>10</sup> CFU were used. The test and control drinks contained approximately 5 mg of iron as ferrous lactate and were labelled with <sup>59</sup>Fe (B) and <sup>55</sup>Fe (A), respectively, and consumed on 4 consecutive days in the order AABB. Retention of the isotopes was measured with whole-body counting and in blood. Mean iron absorption from the drink containing 10<sup>9</sup> CFU Lp299v (28&#x000b7;6(<sc>sd</sc> 12&#x000b7;5) %) was significantly higher than from the control drink (18&#x000b7;5(<sc>sd</sc> 5&#x000b7;8) %), <italic>n</italic> 10, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;028). The fruit drink with 10<sup>10</sup> CFU Lp299v gave a mean iron absorption of 29&#x000b7;1(<sc>sd</sc> 17&#x000b7;0) %, whereas the control drink gave an absorption of (20&#x000b7;1(<sc>sd</sc> 6&#x000b7;4) %) (<italic>n</italic> 11, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;080). The difference in iron absorption between the 10<sup>9</sup> CFU Lp299v and the 10<sup>10</sup> CFU Lp299v drinks was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;941). In conclusion, intake of probiotics can increase iron absorption by approximately 50 % from a fruit drink having an already relatively high iron bioavailability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Probiotics</kwd><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v</kwd><kwd>Fruit drinks</kwd><kwd>Iron status</kwd><kwd>Radio iron</kwd><kwd>Radioisotopes</kwd><kwd>Females</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">CFU</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">colony-forming units</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">Lp299v</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion"><italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">PA</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">phytic acid</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Iron deficiency and low iron status are common all around the globe<sup>(</sup>

Strategies to increase the intake of foods rich in iron, as well as dietary factors with enhancing effect on iron absorption, are therefore important.</p><p>A number of dietary factors affect the absorption of non-haem iron. Intake of ascorbic acid and meat stimulates absorption, whereas calcium, polyphenols (e.g. in tea, coffee, vegetables) and phytates (e.g. whole grain cereals) inhibit absorption<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">

The iron absorption was very low (1&#x000b7;1 % of the non-haem iron), and it is not known whether Lp299v can affect iron absorption in a meal with a higher availability of iron, thereby justifying the present study.</p><p>The primary aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that non-haem iron absorption from a fruit drink is improved by the addition of Lp299v. The secondary aim was to investigate whether this hypothesised effect is dependent on the Lp299v concentration by giving the subjects a dose of 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>10</sup> CFU Lp299v.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="general"><title>Design</title><p>The study comprised two cross-over double radio-iron isotope single-blinded trials in young healthy Swedish women. The reason for confining the study to women was that women are one of the main vulnerable populations when it comes to iron deficiency. This double radio-iron method enabled the effect of adding or not adding Lp299v on iron absorption to be measured separately in the same individual. The two separate trials were performed from August to December 2007.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="general"><title>General protocol</title><p>In each trial, eleven subjects were served either a 200-ml fruit drink containing Lp299v (B) or a 200-ml fruit drink without lactobacilli (A). In Trial 1, drink B contained 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) Lp299v, and in Trial 2 it contained 10<sup>10</sup> CFU Lp299v. The fruit drink was served as breakfast during 4 consecutive days in the order AABB. During the first 2 d, the drink was served without lactobacilli, after which the fruit drink containing lactobacilli was served on days 3 and 4. This order was chosen to avoid the possible effect of any lactobacilli remaining in the body if Lp299v was administered before the placebo. No food or drink was allowed within 3 h of the intake of the fruit drink. To determine the amount of iron absorbed, the iron in the fruit drinks was homogeneously labelled with extrinsic <sup>59</sup>Fe (B) and <sup>55</sup>Fe (A). Each portion of fruit drink was labelled, through pipetting, with the radioisotope (as FeCl<sub>3</sub>) immediately before serving. Blood sample was taken approximately 2 weeks after fruit drink administration.

<sup>)</sup>, which is based on the diffusion-driven isotopic exchange occurring between extrinsically added iron and native iron in a meal &#x02013; that is the common available pool of iron. In short, iron absorption is assessed by calculating the difference between the administered radioactivity and the radioactivity measured in the body. One of the advantages of using two different isotopes is that each person becomes their own control.</p><p>Each drink was administered on an empty stomach (i.e. no food after 22.00 hours and no drink after 24.00 hours the evening before) over consecutive days, after which the mean daily iron absorption was calculated. This was to reduce the effect of day-to-day variation in iron absorption.</p><p>Approximately 2 weeks (10&#x02013;16 d) after drink administration, a whole-body counting was performed using a very sensitive whole-body counter<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The iron absorption from the <sup>59</sup>Fe-labelled fruit drink (B) was calculated as the percentage of detected whole-body radioactivity, corrected for physical decay and background radioactivity. The radiation from <sup>59</sup>Fe corresponds to the amount of absorbed <sup>59</sup>Fe, which in turn, according to the &#x02018;pool concept&#x02019;, corresponds to the amount of absorbed total iron from the drink containing Lp299v. However, absorption from <sup>55</sup>Fe (i.e. the drink without Lp299v) cannot be detected by whole-body counting. Consequently, after the whole-body counting, a blood sample was drawn in which the relative absorption of each of the two isotopes was determined using a liquid scintillator. This relative absorption was then used, together with the blood volume calculated from each individual&#x02019;s height, weight and Hb concentration<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, to also calculate the total body <sup>55</sup>Fe absorption (i.e. fruit drink A).</p><p>After the whole-body counting and the blood test, a reference dose (10 ml of 0&#x000b7;01 mol HCl containing 3 mg of <sup>59</sup>Fe-labelled iron (II)+30 mg of ascorbic acid) was administered orally as breakfast together with 100 ml of water. Another reference dose was administered as breakfast the following morning. No food or drink was allowed within 3 h after the intake of each of the reference doses. The absorption from the reference dose was measured after another 2 weeks in the whole-body counter. By relating the absorption from the fruit drinks to this reference dose absorption, the variation depending on differences in iron absorption capacity was corrected.</p><p>The recorded radioactivity for each subject in the different trials amounted to a total of 2 &#x003bc;Ci from <sup>55</sup>Fe and 2&#x000b7;0 &#x003bc;Ci from <sup>59</sup>Fe (2&#x000d7;0&#x000b7;5 &#x003bc;Ci from reference dose+2&#x000d7;0&#x000b7;5 &#x003bc;Ci from fruit drink). A wet chemical analysis of <sup>55</sup>Fe and <sup>59</sup>Fe was carried out according to a modification of the analysis method described by Eakins &#x00026; Brown<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Duplicates of whole blood corresponding to 10 mg of Fe were pre-treated and finally analysed in a liquid scintillator (Tri-Carb; Packard Instruments) to determine the radiation from <sup>55</sup>Fe and <sup>59</sup>Fe.</p><p>Iron absorption is affected not only by the composition of the meal but also by intra-individual differences in iron absorption capacity, in which iron status is the predominant affecting factor<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. This entails a problem when comparing different meals administered to subjects with different iron status and different iron absorption capacity, and thus there was an informal agreement on normalising iron absorption results to the 40 % absorption from a reference dose of iron. The normalised meal absorption is the iron absorption for an individual having a reference dose absorption of 40 %<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, corresponding to borderline iron-deficit individuals who have not developed anaemia. The absorbed amount of iron at this standardised iron status is obtained by multiplying the drink and reference dose ratio by 40.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="general"><title>Composition of the fruit drink</title><p>The fruit drink with an oat base included grape, mango, passion fruit, banana and added sugar. Mango provided 6&#x000b7;5 %, the other fruits provided 28&#x000b7;5 %, oat base provided 5 % and added sugar provided 4 % of the content. The fruit drinks were supplemented with iron (2&#x000b7;1 mg/100 ml, in the form of ferrous lactate dehydrate; Vitablend) and ascorbic acid (50 mg/100 ml; Vitablend) and were produced in connection with Trial 1 and Trial 2, respectively.

Divalent metal transporter 1, which can transport Fe2+ into the cells, is concentrated in mucin vesicles near the luminal surface, strengthening the role of mucin in iron uptake<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Another possible mechanism underlying the observed results could be an increase in colonic iron absorption due to a decrease in colonic pH, thereby reducing ferric iron into highly absorbable ferrous iron as a result of lactobacilli growth. In a cell-line study by Bergqvist <italic>et al</italic>., lactic acid fermentation by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> enhanced Caco-2 iron uptake from carrot juice. As soluble ferrous iron was increased about 16-fold by lactic acid fermentation, and about one-third of the ferrous iron remained soluble after <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion (about 4- to 5-fold higher than in fresh juice), the authors concluded that enhanced iron uptake was a result of the increased level of soluble ferrous iron<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, no absorption of non-haem iron in the distal part of the intestine (ileum, colon) was observed in healthy young women.</p><p>In the present study, as in every study, there are several potential sources of error, both random and systematic, which ought to be minimised. In iron absorption studies, random sources of error are present in everything from preparation of isotopic solutions and meals to the very handling of the blood samples. This has previously been discussed thoroughly<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. The main limitations of the present study could, as discussed earlier regarding the trial with the high dose of Lp299v, include the small sample size. In addition, iron absorption capacity for women can differ according to the menstrual cycle phase. As all subjects in the present study were women, the optimal approach would therefore be to administer the reference dose and the fruit drinks at the same point in the menstrual cycle &#x02013; that is, 4 weeks apart. This would ensure that subjects had a similar absorption capacity when administering both the fruit drinks and the reference dose. However, even if there had been a large difference in iron absorption capacity at the two points in time, it would have had no impact on the present results. The only consequence would be difficulties when comparing present results with results in other studies. The ratio (i.e. difference) between the Lp299v drink and the control drink remains regardless.</p><p>Another limitation was that blood for analysis of the iron and inflammatory status was only drawn 2 weeks following the fruit drink administration. To gain a better overall insight into iron and inflammatory status, blood samples should also have been drawn when the fruit drinks were administered.</p><p>The source of error with the largest impact is the compliance of the subjects, which includes heeding the instructions regarding fasting when served the study meals and the reference dose.</p><p>As a consequence of the observed significant iron absorption-enhancing effect of Lp299v, there might be practical applications of such lactobacilli products in populations with high prevalence of iron deficiency (e.g. developing countries). However, supplementing food stuffs with live probiotics results in difficulties with regard to storage and shelf life. This could, in theory, be overcome by using lyophilised probiotics, which could either be administered in capsules or as sprinkles in fortification programmes. However, it is still unknown whether the iron absorption-enhancing properties of Lp299v remain following direct administration of lyophilised probiotics.</p><p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, the iron absorption from the fruit drinks with Lp299v had a much wider distribution than the control drinks. The interquartile range for iron absorption in Trial 1 from the Lp299v drink was 18&#x000b7;7 % and from the control drinks it was 8&#x000b7;2 %, respectively. The corresponding interquartile ranges in Trial 2 were 21&#x000b7;7 and 8&#x000b7;9 %, respectively. An interpretation is that the subjects when consuming an Lp299v drink had a much more diverse response compared with when they merely drank a control drink without Lp299v. In fact, six out of the twenty-one subjects did not respond positively to the added Lp299v.</p><p>It has been estimated that approximately 1200 different bacterial species inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract, and that each individual harbours at least 160 of these species<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, in iron-deficient and anaemic women in southern India, it was observed that the amount of faecal lactobacilli were significantly lower than in a control group. However, there was no difference between the two groups with respect to the other investigated bacteria strains<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>50</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. With this in mind, the diverse response to the addition of Lp299v in the present study could perhaps be found in an intra-individual difference in the already existing microbiota. If this were the case, adding Lp299v to a microflora already rich in Lp299v-related lactobacilli should not give any further effect compared with if it were added to a gastrointestinal flora with little lactobacilli.</p><p>Interestingly, the reference dose absorption (which is used as a comparable measure of iron absorption capacity, and thereby facilitates comparisons between different studies) in the six individuals not responding positively to the added Lp299v in this present study was higher (mean Fe abs=35&#x000b7;4 %) compared with the fifteen individuals who did actually respond (mean Fe abs=29&#x000b7;7 %). However, the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> 6) probably prevented the difference in reference dose absorption being statistically significant. Nevertheless, the question of whether this was because of a gastrointestinal environment already rich in Lp299v could not be answered in this present study. Future studies involving faecal sampling could cast more light on these questions.</p><p>In conclusion, intake of Lp299v can increase iron absorption by an additional 50 % from a fruit drink that already has a relatively high iron bioavailability. This effect may be related to the colonisation of the bacteria in the intestine.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Marie Birger and Lena Nyberg, Sk&#x000e5;nemejerier, for excellent help with formulation and production of the study products.
