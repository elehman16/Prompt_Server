The enormous increase in the use of the Internet has made such interventions increasingly common all over the world <xref rid="pone.0110117-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Different web-based computer-tailored (CT) smoking cessation interventions have already been developed and implemented to aid people to quit smoking <xref rid="pone.0110117-Civliak1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Lancaster1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Elfeddali1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Previous research has indicated that tailored health messages were successful in attracting smokers' attention, resulting in an enhanced processing of the health message <xref rid="pone.0110117-Dijkstra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Kreuter1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and an increase in smoking cessation rates <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-TePoel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Even though evidence exists for the effectiveness of web-based CT smoking cessation interventions <xref rid="pone.0110117-Civliak1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Elfeddali1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, they often have difficulty attracting and holding respondents <xref rid="pone.0110117-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110117-Brouwer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Most of the web-based CT interventions consist of simple text messages <xref rid="pone.0110117-Civliak1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Elfeddali1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, since websites increasingly make use of new web-based technologies like videos or pictures, simple text messages may no longer be attractive enough for current Internet users. Less educated groups, in particular, often quit web-based interventions before completing all elements of the intervention <xref rid="pone.0110117-Fidler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Kotz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since video-based messages seem to require less mental effort and may help the person to concentrate on the core elements of the message <xref rid="pone.0110117-Guimares1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the integration of video messages may increase the appeal and potentially the (cost-)effectiveness of web-based CT smoking cessation interventions. As a result, two multiple CT smoking cessation interventions were developed: 1) a text-based multiple CT intervention, where smokers received tailored messages via text and 2) a video-based multiple CT smoking cessation intervention, where smokers received tailored messages via video <xref rid="pone.0110117-Stanczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Although web-based smoking cessation interventions have already demonstrated favourable behaviour change outcomes <xref rid="pone.0110117-Civliak1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Shahab1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, to date relatively little is known about whether these CT interventions are preferable in terms of their cost-effectiveness, when compared to other treatments. Given the fact that health-care budget holders have to make choices regarding the implementation of different smoking cessation programmes, it is essential to know whether the societal benefits of these programmes are worth the investments that have to be made to offer them <xref rid="pone.0110117-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To date, several economic evaluations of smoking cessation interventions have already been conducted <xref rid="pone.0110117-Feenstra1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110117-Mudde1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The majority of these studies reported that these interventions were cost-effective since they were relatively low in costs accounting for the resulting gains in terms of avoided mortality and the prevention of care costs for smoking-related diseases. To our current knowledge, only one recent study in the Netherlands has investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a web-based CT smoking cessation intervention <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This study showed that a web-based CT smoking cessation intervention seemed to be more cost-effective with regard to smoking abstinence rates assessed after twelve months than the usual smoking cessation care in the general practice setting, taking into account a willingness to pay of &#x020ac;18,000. However, the cost-utility analysis (calculating utility outcomes in monetary values) revealed that care as usual was the most efficient treatment <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Even if web-based smoking cessation interventions are found to be as effective as, or less effective than traditional interventions (e.g. face-to-face counselling or care as usual), their possible lower delivery costs via the Internet may result in interventions being more cost-effective <xref rid="pone.0110117-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As web-based interventions have the potential to contribute to reducing health-care and societal costs, economic evaluations of these interventions are required to be able to choose the most cost-effective treatment.</p><p>Given the importance of this topic, the purpose of the current study was to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of 1) a video-based multiple CT smoking cessation intervention, 2) a text-based multiple CT smoking cessation intervention, and 3) a control condition (respondents received brief general text advice about quitting) after a follow-up period of twelve months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and participants</title><p>The current economic evaluation study was embedded in a three-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) that tested the effectiveness of two multiple CT smoking cessation interventions against a control condition. The study was submitted for approval to the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) of the Atrium Medical Centre Heerlen, the Netherlands. The MREC decided that no MREC approval was needed for this study because respondents were not obliged to engage in a certain act. Additionally, the questionnaires of the intervention were judged not to have a deep psychological impact. Nonetheless, when submitting our study protocol for publication we were advised to register the trial and we did so shortly after the enrolment of respondents had started. We can thus confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR3102) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3102">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3102</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Dutch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The study was in line with the ethical codes of conduct of the American Psychological Association (APA) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Association1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Dutch smokers were included to participate in the RCT from December 2010 up to June 2012 by general practices throughout the Netherlands, several Dutch paid advertising campaigns and different health funds. Interested smokers could receive more information on the website and could sign up via the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.steunbijstoppen.nl">http://www.steunbijstoppen.nl</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Steunbijstoppennl1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> by choosing their own username and password. This website was accessible on the Internet, so smokers could choose to sign up at home, at work, or anywhere else where they had access to the Internet. Smokers were randomly allocated to one of the two experimental conditions (video- vs. text-based CT) or the control condition. Randomization took place via a computer software device <xref rid="pone.0110117-OSE1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. After giving online informed consent, respondents were included when they were daily smokers, 18 years or older, motivated to quit smoking within the following six months and had Internet access. The flow chart of respondents is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110117-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The trial had follow-up measurements after six (between May 2011 and January 2013) and twelve months (between December 2011 and June 2013).

The I-Change model formed the theoretical framework of the two interventions. After filling out the baseline measurement, respondents received tailored feedback on their smoking behaviour, attitude, perceived social influence, perceived self-efficacy, and on how to plan a quit date. At the end of the session, respondents were asked to set a quit date within the following month. Depending on respondents' readiness to quit smoking within the following month, they received personalized feedback during multiple CT sessions and were directed into one of two routings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110117-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0110117-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0110117.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Intervention design.</title><p>Legend: T&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;time, BL&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Baseline, QD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; Quit date, 1 m&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1 month, 2 m&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2 months.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0110117.g002"/></fig><sec id="s2b1"><title>Routing 1</title><p>The aim of routing 1 was to help smokers to facilitate the translation of their intention into action by providing tailored feedback to increase self-efficacy and effective action planning. Respondents ready to quit within one month were directed to routing 1, which consisted of six different sessions: 1) at baseline, after feedback on their smoking behaviour, their attitude, social influence and self-efficacy, respondents were asked to choose a quit date; 2) one week before their quit attempt, respondents received tailored feedback on the extent to which they had planned their quit attempt (preparatory plans), on their perceived self-efficacy to deal with difficult situations and on how to cope with these situations (coping plans); 3) three days after their quit attempt, respondents received feedback on their perceived self-efficacy, including feedback on how to deal with difficult situations and were invited to formulate coping plans to prevent potential relapse; 4, 5 and 6) two, four and eight weeks after their quit date, respondents received tailored feedback on their perceived self-efficacy, on how to deal with difficult situations and on their attitude towards smoking and quitting smoking. During these last three sessions, respondents could choose to receive feedback on different items. This option was provided since it was expected that they would encounter different problems during their quit attempt.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Routing 2</title><p>The goal of routing 2 was to quit smoking and to increase motivation by increasing perceptions of the pros of quitting and how to obtain support for quitting. Respondents who were not ready to quit within one month were directed to routing 2, which including several sessions: 1) directly after baseline, respondents were encouraged to use the next month to reflect on their motivation to quit smoking; 2) one month after baseline, respondents received tailored feedback on their smoking behaviour, their attitude regarding smoking and quitting smoking, their perceived social support and their readiness to quit smoking; respondents ready to quit within a month were directed to routing 1; 3) two months after baseline, respondents who were still not ready to quit received another tailored feedback letter, using a similar strategy as used before in session 2; respondents who were ready to quit within one month were directed to routing 1. If respondents were still not prepared to quit, they received an email telling them that the programme would end at this stage and that they would receive no further invitations.</p><p>After each feedback moment (in routings 1 and 2), a summary with all tailored feedback messages was sent to the respondent by email.

In the video-based multiple CT intervention, the same tailored messages were presented as in the text-based intervention; however, the tailored messages were translated from text into videos. The tailored messages were presented by five different adults in a TV &#x02018;news programme&#x02019; format.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Measurements</title><p>Self-reported online questionnaires were used to assess effects and costs. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Measurements</xref> were conducted at baseline, six- and twelve-month follow-up. Respondents who did not complete the follow-up measurements after one and two weeks were prompted twice more by email to complete the questionnaire on the intervention website. Respondents who did not react to the two reminders received another invitation by email to briefly indicate their current smoking status. In this third email, they were asked to fill out a shortened version of the six-and twelve-month follow-up measurement, consisting of 10 important smoking-related questions, which they could send back by email. Lastly, when the follow-up measurement was still not completed, respondents were contacted by a short phone call, with the same questions being asked as in the shortened questionnaire.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline measurement</title><p>The baseline measurement assessed factors related to smoking cessation and societal costs. These included demographics (age, gender, educational level), health-care-related costs and productivity costs (see below), occurrence of smoking-related diseases, and smoking-related factors such as addiction level, which was measured by the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m test for cigarette dependence (FTCD) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Heatherton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Fagerstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cost measures</title><p>The present economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective.</p><p>Intervention costs, health-care-related costs, productivity costs and respondent costs were assessed at baseline and at the follow-up measurements, using three-month retrospective questionnaires.</p><p>
<italic>Intervention costs</italic> included costs that could be attributed to the delivery of the intervention, such as hosting costs for the web-based CT smoking cessation intervention. Costs for the development of the intervention and research-specific costs were excluded since these costs are non-recurring costs that will not be spent again if the intervention is implemented elsewhere.</p><p>
<italic>Health-care-related costs</italic> related to general practitioners' or practice nurses' consultations or home visits, inpatient and outpatient specialist care, mental health care, alternative medicine, hospital admissions, smoking cessation aids, prescribed and over-the-counter medication, and other care (e.g. professional home care, paramedic consultations). Respondents had to indicate what type of care they had received and how often they had received it during the previous three months. The updated Dutch manual for cost analysis in health-care research was used to value the health-care-related costs of the respondents <xref rid="pone.0110117-HakkaartvanRoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. If costs for medical health care were not found in the manual, costs were searched on the Internet. Normally, the mean price of three different cost prices was used. In the case of uncertainty, the lowest cost price was taken. Furthermore, the Dutch website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicijnkosten.nl">www.medicijnkosten.nl</ext-link> was used to value medication costs. The costs of medications were calculated based on the dose described by the respondent, i.e. costs per tablet, gramme or millilitre were used to calculate the total medication costs for each respondent.</p><p>
<italic>Productivity costs</italic> related to absenteeism. Productivity losses for paid work were calculated according to the human capital method using a mean income valuation of the Dutch population <xref rid="pone.0110117-HakkaartvanRoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This approach estimates the annual earnings for each year of potential lost employment and adds these earnings together. Since income differs between age and gender, productivity losses were valued differently based on respondents' age and gender <xref rid="pone.0110117-HakkaartvanRoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Respondent costs</italic> consisted of costs related to the time respondents spent on the CT intervention and travel costs. For the time spent on the intervention, we used a mean score that was needed to complete all intervention elements (without the follow-up measurements). A mean score of 120 minutes was used for the two CT interventions (video vs. text CT) and five minutes for the control condition. To determine the costs regarding time spent on the website, we used the human capital method using the mean valuation of the Dutch population (again, costs were valued differently based on age and gender) <xref rid="pone.0110117-HakkaartvanRoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

The benefit of our cost-effectiveness analysis is that it allows policy makers to compare the net benefit of the intervention to other smoking cessation interventions.</p><p>Cost-utility analysis on the other hand is a form of cost-effectiveness analysis that aims to calculate the cost per unit of utility. A common unit of utility is quality adjusted life-years (QALY). The benefit of cost-utility analysis is that its results allow comparing outcomes of economic evaluations across diverse other health-related interventions, also (having other goals than smoking cessation, e.g. improvements in dietary behaviour or physical activity) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Gold1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>The primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was prolonged abstinence (PA), which was assessed by one item asking respondents whether they had refrained from smoking (including a grace period of two weeks where someone could have smoked a maximum of 1&#x02013;5 cigarettes) since their last quit attempt (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;yes; 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no).

A secondary outcome measure for the CEA was seven-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA), which was assessed by one item asking respondents whether they had refrained from smoking during the last seven days (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;yes; 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no).</p><p>The outcome measure for the cost-utility analysis (CUA) was quality of life, measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In order to estimate the effects in QALYs, utility scores needed to be calculated. Utilities can be regarded as the preferences that society has for a set of health-related outcomes <xref rid="pone.0110117-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In the current study, health states were assessed by the Dutch version of the Euro-Qol (EQ-5D-3L) which is regarded as a validated measure to assess quality of life and which is often used in the Netherlands <xref rid="pone.0110117-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110117-Drummond2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The Dutch EQ-5D is a measure of self-reported health outcomes that is applicable to a wide range of health conditions. The EQ-5D-3L entails five health state dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension was assessed by asking respondents to specify their health status, resulting in three-point scale (3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;many complaints, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;some complaints, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no complaints) <xref rid="pone.0110117-EuroQol1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The health states, coming from the Euro-Qol questionnaire, were transformed into a utility score, using the Dutch tariff <xref rid="pone.0110117-Lamers1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Utility scores could range from &#x02212;0.33 (worst imaginable health status) to 1 (perfect health status). The utility scores of the three measurements (baseline, and six- and twelve-month follow-up) were computed into an overall QALY score, whereby the &#x02018;area under the curve method&#x02019; was used. The area under the curve is regarded as the duration of the health state, i.e. survival (on the x-axis; one year) multiplied by the quality weight for the health state (y-axis; QALYs gained). In this case, the number of QALYs represents the life years gained during a one-year follow-up measurement <xref rid="pone.0110117-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Analyses</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Baseline characteristics and dropout</title><p>To investigate possible differences between the three conditions with regard to demographics, baseline values of the outcomes and societal costs over the previous three months, Chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted.

Missing data for the costs, EQ-5D-3L questions and smoking related variables were first replaced by mean imputation, using respondents' scores on the previous and next measurements. If we were not able to impute missing data by mean imputation, we replaced our missing data by using the last observation carried forward technique (LOCF). Mean imputation followed by LOCF is a common approach to replace missing data in trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses with incomplete observations <xref rid="pone.0110117-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Gregorio1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

The same methods were used to impute missing cost data for the six-and twelve-month measurement. For missing effect data, i.e. missing data for the smoking abstinence variables, a negative scenario was used to replace missing values, in which respondents who did not fill in the follow-up measurement were regarded as smokers. This &#x02018;negative&#x02019; scenario is recommended by the Russell standard and was chosen to avoid a false positive intervention effect <xref rid="pone.0110117-Laaksonen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Costs and effects at the twelve month follow-up</title><p>To deal with uncertainty around the estimates of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, mean costs of the three groups were compared using nonparametric bootstrapping (5000 times) with 95% confidence intervals in percentiles <xref rid="pone.0110117-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

For quality of life, ICERs are often called incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). However, since ICERs and ICURs can only compare two groups, a net monetary benefit (NMB) had to be calculated in order to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the three conditions in our study <xref rid="pone.0110117-Stinnett1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The NMB was calculated by valuing the effectiveness and utility outcomes in monetary values using a threshold for society's willingness to pay (WTP).

Four different outcomes were possible: 1) more effects and lower costs (dominant); 2) fewer effects and lower costs; 3) more effects and higher costs; or 4) fewer effects and higher costs (inferior). The resulting decision uncertainty is graphically presented by a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) and a cost-utility acceptability curve (CUAC). In addition, different sensitivity analyses were executed to control for possible uncertainty of parameter estimates during the primary analyses: (1) we used seven-day PPA as outcome variable (instead of PA); (2) we excluded all surgery costs since these costs were extremely high compared to the other health-care-related costs; (3) we tested the results from a health-care perspective and excluded the respondent costs and productivity costs because these might be reflected in the respondents' reported quality of life <xref rid="pone.0110117-HakkaartvanRoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; (4) we excluded all medication costs, because these were very high compared to the other societal costs.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL.

Furthermore, results revealed that the video-based condition was more expensive and more effective than the control condition in increasing the number of QALYs gained. When comparing the video-based condition with the text-based condition, costs were lower and effects were higher regarding QALYs gained within the video condition. Therefore, the text-based condition was dominated by the video-based condition.</p><p>The probability that the control condition was efficient at a WTP of &#x020ac;0.00 per QALY was 45%, for the video-based condition 38%, and for the control condition18%.

However, increasing the threshold value up to &#x020ac;80,000, the video-based condition would probably be the most efficient treatment (i.e. 41%), followed by the control condition (i.e. 39%) and text-based condition (i.e. 20%).

In addition, even less is known regarding the relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different delivery methods for web-based CT smoking cessation interventions <xref rid="pone.0110117-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two CT smoking cessation interventions (video- vs. text-based CT), delivered via the Internet. The results of the present study revealed that the video-based CT smoking cessation intervention was the most cost-effective treatment for smoking abstinence assessed after twelve months from a willingness to pay of &#x020ac;18,000. Varying monetary threshold values up to &#x020ac;80,000 showed a similar pattern. Findings suggest that the video-based intervention was far more cost-effective than the text-based intervention and the brief generic advice that respondents received in the control condition, since it resulted in more quitters and lower societal costs. The cost-utility analyses with quality of life as outcome measure revealed a different pattern. The QALYs gained by the video condition during the one year follow-up period were almost the same as those gained among respondents in the control condition, with far greater costs in the video-based CT intervention. Consequently, in terms of QALYs, the control condition seemed to be the most preferable treatment when using a monetary threshold of &#x020ac;0 to &#x020ac;18,000. When increasing the threshold value for an additional QALY up to &#x020ac;80,000, the results changed and showed a preference for the video condition. The results from sensitivity analyses revealed comparable results. When cost estimations varied, the video-based CT intervention remained the most cost-effective treatment, whereas cost-utility was still the highest within the control condition.</p><p>Consistent with findings from other economic evaluations of smoking cessation interventions <xref rid="pone.0110117-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Woolacott1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, our results indicated that the video-based CT smoking cessation intervention is likely to be most cost-effective. Compared to the control condition, &#x020ac;1,500 had to be paid within the video-based intervention per additional 1% probability of abstinence. This amount is somewhat lower than what was found in previous research <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Salize1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Nevertheless, these results are difficult to interpret since little information is available on the amount of money that society is willing to pay for smoking cessation and as a result no accepted cut-off points exist for smoking abstinence rates <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Since difficulties may arise when policy makers try to compare results from cost-effectiveness analyses in which the cost-effectiveness ratios are expressed as concerning different outcome measures, we furthermore included the cost-utility analyses to our study. With regard to cost-utilities, if society is willing to pay only a small amount per QALY gained, our results showed that the control group might be the most preferable treatment compared to both CT smoking cessation interventions. Comparable results were found in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, where the control condition (usual smoking cessation care in the general practice setting) was also more preferable compared to a CT smoking cessation intervention and a CT smoking cessation intervention with face-to-face counseling by a practice nurse. One possible reason for this finding might be that the follow-up period of twelve months was not long enough to observe improvements in quality of life. Previous economic evaluations in respondents with smoking-related diseases indicated that quality of life could only be detected with longer time periods <xref rid="pone.0110117-Ladapo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-QuistPaulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. One possible explanation for the different results of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses could be that respondents may not have perceived improvements in their quality of life during the one-year follow-up period used in the present study. Since we used a relatively short follow-up period of twelve months, respondents may not have perceived any direct health benefits in the short term, due to possible withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting <xref rid="pone.0110117-Wiggers1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Shiffman1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Although other studies did identify a positive association between smoking abstinence and quality of life yet over a twelve-month follow-up period <xref rid="pone.0110117-Sales1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Hays1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, future economic evaluations should include longer time horizons in order to detect an improved quality of life for respondents who quit smoking.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our current knowledge, this was one of the first studies examining the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a video-and text-based CT intervention for smoking cessation. In order to compare the three different conditions more specifically, the effects of the current study were not only assessed in terms of quality of life but also in terms of smoking abstinence. The inclusion of this cost-effectiveness analysis (using smoking abstinence as outcome measure) allows policy makers to compare the net benefit of the intervention to other smoking cessation interventions. Moreover, several sensitivity analyses were conducted to test for uncertainty of parameter estimates which can be seen as another strength of our study.</p><p>Yet, several limitations of the current study should also be discussed. First, we interpreted our results at varying monetary threshold values of smoking abstinence and QALY up to &#x020ac;80,000. However, until now no information has been available on the exact amount of money that society is willing to pay for smoking cessation, i.e. per additional ex-smoker, which makes interpretation difficult. Although the WTP of &#x020ac;18,000 is an accepted Dutch-cutoff point for measuring the QALY <xref rid="pone.0110117-Casparie1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, past research has suggested varying these WTP values <xref rid="pone.0110117-Gerhards1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Nevertheless, we assume that the chosen range of our study from &#x020ac;0 to &#x020ac;80,000 was broad enough to capture all important threshold values. As already recommended by previous research <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, future studies should however aim to determine a cut-off point for the WTP per abstinent respondent in order to enable an accurate interpretation of the findings from the present and similar studies. Second, we were not able to detect improvements in quality of life between the different conditions. For future economic evaluations regarding smoking cessation interventions, it may be useful to include other operationalizations of the QALY or other outcomes, which may be better able to detect short-term health changes (e.g. non-health-care-related outcomes such as satisfaction or enablement) <xref rid="pone.0110117-Lorgelly1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Chalkidou1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Third, health-care utilization was based on self-reported data, which might have introduced recall bias. However, we tried to keep recall bias low by using a three-month instead of six-month retrospective questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0110117-Margetts1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Hassan1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Upcoming economic evaluation studies may, however, want to include more objective measurements (such as data from health insurance, or medication registration from the pharmacy or medical professions) of health-care utilization. At last, although attrition rates in our study were relatively low compared to dropout rates in other Internet-based smoking cessation intervention trials <xref rid="pone.0110117-Shahab1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Elfeddali1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we replaced missing data using several imputation techniques that are commonly used to impute missing data in cost-effectiveness studies <xref rid="pone.0110117-Smit2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Gregorio1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and are recommended in the smoking cessation literature <xref rid="pone.0110117-Laaksonen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Yet, the most optimal strategy for missing data imputation is currently not evident and it may thus be that our strategy could have influenced the results presented. Missing values on the primary outcomes measure were replaced using a negative approach, in which respondents lost to follow up were regarded as smokers. Although this approach is widely used, it might have been too strict since many dropouts might actually have been quitters no longer in need of the intervention, rather than smokers. Therefore, this approach might have resulted in an underestimation of the intervention's effectiveness <xref rid="pone.0110117-Heritier1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110117-Hollis1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, and possibly its cost-effectiveness. As web-based interventions have been found to be subject to relatively large attrition rates, future research is needed to estimate the most optimal strategy for handling missing data in cost-effectiveness trials that evaluate web-based smoking cessation interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of our study revealed that the video-based CT smoking cessation intervention had the highest probability of being cost-effective. The video-based intervention was far more cost-effective than the text-based intervention and the brief generic advice in the control condition, since it resulted in more quitters and lower societal costs. Yet, the cost-utility outcomes tended to be in favour of the control condition, but interpretation of this finding is hindered by the relatively short follow-up and great likelihood of insensitivity of the QALY assessment. Future studies need to assess which QALY measure may be the most sensible method to detect short-term improvements regarding quality of life. Furthermore, more research should concentrate on the most optimal strategy for handling missing data in economic evaluations of web-based smoking cessation interventions. Finally, more research is needed to identify an acceptable cutoff-point for the WTP per abstinent respondent in order to interpret incremental costs in future studies concerning the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s8"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110117.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
