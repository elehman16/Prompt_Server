Current vaccines and antiviral drugs are only partially effective against influenza, and may be ineffective in the setting of epidemics due to antigenic shift or emergence of drug-resistant strains <xref rid="pone.0098671-Ison1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098671-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, novel strategies for controlling influenza are needed, especially for susceptible subpopulations such as those with chronic disease, or with chronic exposure to airborne pollutants. Tobacco smoke has been repeatedly shown to be a significant risk factor for severe influenza infection, whether from active smoking<xref rid="pone.0098671-Kark1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098671-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> or from second-hand exposures<xref rid="pone.0098671-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Using transient low-level nasal infection with standard dose of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine as a model, we have previously shown that healthy young adult smokers have blunted host defense responses to LAIV and enhanced viral replication, compared to healthy nonsmokers <xref rid="pone.0098671-Noah1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We have also shown that epithelial antiviral responses to influenza <italic>in vivo</italic> and in experimental cell culture models are blunted in smokers, and that the abnormalities can be corrected <italic>in vitro</italic>with antioxidants including sulforaphane(SFN) <xref rid="pone.0098671-Jaspers1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098671-Kesic1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. SFN, which has shown promise as a potent antioxidant and chemopreventive agent due to its upregulation of<italic>Nrf2</italic>-dependent, cytoprotective Phase II antioxidant enzymesincluding heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and NAD(P)H: quinoneoxidoreductase (NQO1), is present in high concentrations in broccoli sprouts<xref rid="pone.0098671-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098671-GuerreroBeltran1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Prior investigation in human volunteers has demonstrated a measurable,dose-dependent, short-term effect of broccoli-sprout homogenates on expression of <italic>Nrf2</italic>-dependent enzymes in the upper airway<xref rid="pone.0098671-Riedl1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>and in the skin <xref rid="pone.0098671-DinkovaKostova1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Additionally, broccoli sprouts were shown to reduce nasal allergic inflammation after diesel particle exposure<xref rid="pone.0098671-Heber1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that short term ingestion of broccoli sprouts would have a beneficial effect on nasal responses to influenza virus in smokers, by preventing the enhanced virus quantity and blunted IL-6 responses we observed in our previous study. Using LAIV as a model infection as previously reported<xref rid="pone.0098671-Noah1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098671-Noah2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we carried out an interventional study in otherwise-healthy smokers and in nonsmoking, healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that antioxidant-focused, &#x0201c;nutraceutical&#x0201d; approaches may be a promising strategy to pursue as a low-costadjunct to existingapproaches for reducing the impact of influenza on individuals exposed to airborne oxidant pollutants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CONSORT checklist and IRB protocol</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098671.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098671.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>To confirm that a broccoli sprout homogenate (BSH) preparation would upregulate antioxidant enzymes in nasal cells similarly to the previously published study of Riedl et al. <xref rid="pone.0098671-Riedl1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we initially conducted a pilot study in 10 healthy young adult volunteers. We then carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study measuring the effect of short-term ingestion of BSH,compared to alfalfa sprout homogenate (ASH) controls, on nasal mucosal host defense response to a standard nasal vaccine dose of LAIV. Randomization was 1&#x02236;1 and the randomization method was by the permuted blocks method.</p><p>Subjects underwent screening for smoking history, informed consent, and randomization. A baseline superficial scrape biopsy of the epithelium was performed on the inferior surface of the middle nasal turbinate and epithelial RNA was isolated. Three to four weeks later, one BSH or alfalfa sprout control (ASH) shake was ingested daily for 4 consecutive days, designated days &#x02212;1, 0, 1, and 2 (see belowfor preparation method). Shakes were ingested by subjects under direct observation by study staff. On day 0, a standard vaccine dose of LAIV (MedImmune, Inc.) was administered into each nostril as a nasal spray according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nasal lavage was done on days &#x02212;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7. Anothersuperficial nasal biopsy on the inferior surface of the middle turbinate was done on day 2 and processed for qRT-PCR endpoints in similar fashion. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and nasal biopsy material were used to measure host defense factors and virus quantity, as described below.</p><p>Subjects were 18&#x02013;40 years old, healthy, and had a history of smoking defined as&#x0003e;0.5 pack/day. Subjects were instructed to avoid cruciferous vegetables (which contain SFN) and anti-inflammatory medications, including corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, during the study period. A history of either receiving influenza vaccine or having a documented influenza infection in the previous year was a criterion for exclusion. Additionally, a cohort of healthy nonsmokers with otherwise identical inclusion and exclusion criteria were studied.</p><p>Both the pilot and the main study were approved by the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board. The main study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01269723). All subjects gave written informed consent. The start date of the study was 1/24/2011 and the end date was 4/8/2013.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Preparation of sprout homogenates</title><p>BSH shakes were prepared similarly to a previously published method <xref rid="pone.0098671-Riedl1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. One daily &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; was 200 grams of BSH,containing approximately 111 grams fresh sprouts (about one 4-ounce package of Broccosprouts (Brassica Protection Products LLC)). The homogenates wereprepared by our clinical/translational research center'sNutrition Research and Metabolism Core, and were homogenized with water using a ratio of 1&#x02236;1.2 in a clean blender. The same weight of alfalfa sprouts, which contain minimal SFN, was prepared in an identical manner for the placebo (ASH) treatment. Both BSH and ASH were prepared from single lots of sprouts to insure uniform SFN dosing for the study, and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in aliquots, and thawed for ingestion the day prior to use.

Both nostrils werelavaged in this way and the resulting nasal lavage fluid (NLF) from both sides was combined. NLF was centrifuged at 500<italic>g</italic>&#x000d7;7 minutes to remove cells, and the cell-free supernatant stored in aliquots at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until used in mediator assays.

Riedl et al.<xref rid="pone.0098671-Riedl1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported that ingestion of broccoli sprout homogenates resulted in dose-dependent increased expression of Phase II enzymes over baseline, including HMOX1 and NQO1, in NLF cells from human volunteers, an effect not seen with alfalfa sprouts; the BSH and control preparations and &#x0201c;doses&#x0201d; we used in the present study were modeled after this. It was also recently reported by Heber et al.<xref rid="pone.0098671-Heber1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> that broccoli sprout extracts at a similar dose, given for 4 days, had a suppressive effect on diesel particle-induced allergic inflammation in volunteers with allergic rhinitis.

For example, Vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with a reduction in antigen-positive influenza A infection from 18% to 10% in school children<xref rid="pone.0098671-Urashima1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and may have decreased the incidence of asthma exacerbation. In a double-blind randomized trial, cranberry juice, which has high concentration of polyphenols and antioxidant activity, was consumed daily for 10 weeks and resulted in reduced cold and flu symptoms as well as markedly enhanced proliferation of peripheral blood <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0098671.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula>-T cells after PHA stimulation <italic>ex vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098671-Nantz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In another double-blind placebo-controlled study, fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from seaweed, was shown to enhance antibody production to trivalent influenza vaccine in elderly Japanese volunteers, possibly associated with enhanced NK cell activity<xref rid="pone.0098671-Negishi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. An herbal mixture of Echinacea, propolis, and Vitamin C taken for 12 weeks reduced upper respiratory infections in children<xref rid="pone.0098671-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Green tea catechins and threonine taken in capsule form reduced the incidence of clinically-defined influenza illnesses in Japanese health care workers from 13% to 4% <xref rid="pone.0098671-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our study thus adds to a small but growing body of randomized controlled studies supporting the concept that nutritional factors can alter specific host defense responses and could thus potentially play an important role in reducing the severity of influenza.</p><p>We sought evidence for upregulation of the <italic>Nrf2</italic>-dependent antioxidant enzymes HMOX1 and NQO1 in nasal cells in our BSH treated volunteers. While there was a statistically significant elevation in AUC for NQO1 in NLF cells of smokers treated with BSH, we did not see a significant effect of BSH on HMOX1. It is possible our subject population was heterogeneous for baseline oxidant stress. Though our study was not designed to test dose response or pre-existing &#x0201c;deficiency&#x0201d; of antioxidants, the impact of BSH on expression of HMOX1 and NQO1 after infection may have been linked to baseline levels, i.e. the lower the starting levels of expression, the greater the impact. Interestingly, this pattern appeared to be present in both smokers and nonsmokers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098671-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). It seems plausible that nutritional interventions aimed at boosting antioxidants may be most effective in individuals who are relatively antioxidant-deficient at baseline, a condition likely to be more prevalent in smokers. <xref rid="pone.0098671-Cantin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>
</p><p>Our study had several limitations. The infection induced by the LAIV vaccine is inherently limited as a model for natural infection, since the vaccine is specifically designed to have only limited replication in the upper airway, a feature which makes the model safe but places constraints on how generalizable or clinically relevant the study conclusions are for community-acquired influenza infections. Since our purpose was to study LAIV as a model infection rather than as a vaccine, we focused on shorter-term innate immunity endpoints, and did not assess longer term effects of BSH on immune responses to LAIV. To minimize altered responses to LAIV due to prior influenza exposures, we excluded subjects with a history of either vaccination or influenza in the past 12 months, but serologic screening could have confirmed an immunologically na&#x000ef;ve subject population. We had relative difficulty with recruitment and retention of subjects in the smokers cohort, resulting in a smaller N than originally targeted.</p><p>Ingestion of the kind of BSH used in the study described here may not be feasible to enhance mucosal host defense in the general public; however, based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies<xref rid="pone.0098671-Jaspers1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098671-Kesic1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> activation of <italic>Nrf2</italic>-dependent pathways are mechanistically linked to the SFN-induced protection against respiratory virus infection, suggesting that other <italic>Nrf2</italic>-activating agents may have similar effects. For example, the benefit of synthetic or naturally occurring triterpenoids, which have significantly greater potency in activating <italic>Nrf2</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098671-Kensler1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, may need to be explored in the context of viral infection.</p><p>Despite some of thelimitations described above, we believe our study to be the first randomized, placebo controlled trial suggesting a measurable effect of a short-term nutritional intervention on specific mucosal host defense responses to influenza, and perhaps virus replication, in humans.Our study focused on specific host defense factors using a relatively artificial model, and its clinical significance is unclear. However, our results are encouraging as proof of concept for further study of the strategy of developing nutritional antioxidants as an additional, low-costand low-risk measure for reducing the impact of influenza. This may be especially true for subgroups with underlying risk factors related to chronic smoke exposure, pre-existing poor nutrition, or underlying disease. While our study was not designed to directly compare the effects of broccoli sprouts in smokers vs. nonsmokers, we speculate that nonsmokers with relative antioxidant deficiency could also benefit from this approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0098671.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
