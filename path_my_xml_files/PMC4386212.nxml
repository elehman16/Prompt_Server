Hence in both groups, BMI, WHR and insulin with empty-stomach reduced, and a considerable improvement was observed in the menstrual cycle and fertility in both groups, but the ovulation rate and frequency of menstruation in the exercising group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) were higher than the control group.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a research, which the overweighed women with PCOS (n = 7) or without PCOS (n = 8) underwent an intense endurance exercise (one that involves the use of several large groups of muscles and is thus dependent on the delivery of oxygen to the muscles by the cardiovascular system) (1 h. 3 times/week) with no diets. Finally, the exercises reduced BMI, android mass and full fat mass; sensitivity to insulin was improved in all of the women. In the women with PCOS, AMH (Anti-m&#x000fc;llerian hormone) was considerably less, in comparison with the control group, before and after the exercise, but no changes were observed in the women with PCOS for AMH. Since about 1.3% of the obese patients with PCOS are affected by glucose tolerance, and 7.5 to 10% are affected by diabetes type II, it seems that reducing the fat, especially viscera and intestinal fat has considerable effect in improving other biochemical risk factors.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Women affected by PCOS have rates of total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride and lower HDL.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Also, hyperinsulinemia is more prevalent in overweighed women and its androgenic effects are more intensified.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Physical activities or exercises reduce the fat mass, has deterministic role in increasing energy costs and effects the density of metabolic stress hormones (insulin, Cortisol, growth hormone, catecholamine, sex hormones, etc.) and metabolites (free fatty acids, lactic acid, triglyceride, etc.).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Aerobic exercise is usually considered as a solution for facilitating weight reduction and improving lipidos compositions and serum lipoproteins.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] If factors such as BMI, waist and hip size, systolic and diastolic pressures, glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, lipoproteins with low density (LDL) and with high density (HDL) were normal, not only the development of coronary heart diseases reduce, but this could increase survival without the heart (cardiac) diseases and cause better life quality.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Hence the preset research deals with the effect of aerobic exercises on plasma lipoproteins in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was of semi-empirical, pre-test, post-test type with a control group.

The result was consistent with the findings of researches conducted by Samantha K <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Stener Victorin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Vigorito <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Palomba <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Giallauria <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Thomson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Bruner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Randeva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Brown <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Exercise and physical activities reduce the body fat that stores estrogens and provides production of steroid hormones.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The obtained results from the present research confirms the effect of aerobic exercise in reducing the body compositions. The reductions in body compositions could be due to the lipolysis activity of the body adipose tissues.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Long-term exercise increases lipolysis in the adipose tissue. This is approved by the micro-dialysis of the outer cell space of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The main activator of lipolysis during exercise is sympathoadrenal system. Arner <italic>et al</italic>. by this method showed that inhibiting mechanism of alpha adrenergic regulates the resting lipolysis, while the simulating effect of beta-adrenergic is important during the exercise. The effect of beta-adrenergic is based on sympathetic nerve system or epinephrine simulation. Epinephrine hormone is considered as the main activator of the sensitive lipase to hormones. But, there are also other hormones that simulate the lipolysis.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>In a study with long-term exploitations, it was shown that in women with anovulation and having polycystic ovaries, the risk of D.M is 5 times more than control group with the same age.</p><p>Moreover, the insulin level in obese women with polycystic ovaries is higher than the lean women with polycystic ovaries and its androgenic effects are more severe. Also SHBG, LH level decrease significantly with aerobic exercise (with moderate activities). Reduction of ovarian insulin level reduces the production of ovarian androgen. Normalizing the growth of follicle and its development and there is an assumption that it causes more ovulation.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Since, WHR is the index for abdominal obesity and there are relations between WHR changes, body fat percentage and sensitivity to insulin, it can be said that by reducing WHR, and the rate of body fat after aerobic exercise, the average sensitivity to insulin increases and production of SHBG increases, too. By increasing SHBG, production of androgen decreases and finally, ovulation occurs.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Also the results of the present study showed the increase in HDL level and reduction of triglyceride after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise. But there were no significant changes in LDL, VLDL and total cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The result was consistent with the findings of researches conducted by Randeva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Braner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Vigorito <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Gialauria <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Staner Victorian[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Samanta K <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In the study by Thompson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] a considerable improvement in cholesterol, HDL and LDL was observed following 20 weeks of exercise. Increasing HDL was in conformity with this research. It seems that intensity of the exercise and similar age in the participants is the reason for the conformity. Specific diet or difference in type, intensity and duration of exercises in the research could be the reason for inconformity in other results. Various studies have shown that regular endurance exercise reduce cholesterol, triacylglycerol and LDL in blood, while increase the level of HDL. The decrease in triglyceride, cholesterol, VLDL and the increase in HDL after the exercise could justified through the following mechanism: The hydrolysis rate of triacylglycerol of VLDL increases after the exercise that is regarded due to increasing the activity of LPL enzyme of the muscles and increasing the section area of capillary endothelial after the exercise. In comparison to the inactive and stagnant people, the active people with endurance exercises have higher potentials for refining plasma triacylglycerol. This refinement could be dependent on increasing the activity of LPL enzyme of muscles and increasing the area of capillary capacity resulted by the exercise. By increasing of the two mentioned aspects, it could be expected that the rate of refining of VLDL and blood triacylglycerol to be increased.</p><p>Decomposition of triacylglycerol has close relations to synthesis of HDL, and hence any increase in the metabolic capacity, for metabolizing triacylglycerol could justify the higher value of HDL cholesterol in active people doing exercises. It seems that the reason for increasing HDL is due to increasing the production of HDL by liver and change in the activities of different enzymes, such as increasing LDL and LCAT (Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) activities and reducing the hepatic lipase activity, followed by continuous sporting activities. Long term and intense exercise could create changes in LDL-C particles and their sizes and their compositions. Although the level of LDL-C changes continually, but exercise could reduce the LDL-C viscosity and increase larger, more floating LDL-C, and there is a relation that seemingly depends on the rate and intensity of exercise.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The possible reason of increasing HDL is due to increasing the production of HDL in liver and changing the activity of different enzymes, such as increasing the activity of LDL and decreasing the activity of hepatic lipase, followed by the regular exercise activities. Regarding the relation of obesity and overweight in women with PCOS, with lipid profile abnormalities, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes type II and cardiovascular diseases, the present study could have beneficial effect in management and reducing the rate of complications in women with PCOS.</p><p>In most of the researches done, aerobic exercises cause the reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride, LDL and VLDL, and increase in HDL, but in our research no significant decrease in the level of LDL, VLDL and total cholesterol. Since apart from some, the rest of the participants in our research had normal levels of LDL, VLDL and cholesterol (which may be due to genetic aspects). The reason for did not reduce the variables during the 12-week of exercise could be due to the fact that the people usually have low levels of LDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol from the beginning. The relevant rates remain low during treatment by exercise, while in people with higher LDL, cholesterol and triglyceride, there would be a greater possibility for decreasing the relevant rates.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The other possible reason is the inadequate difference in duration and intensity of the physical exercise for the variables mentioned before to be reduced.</p><p>Giallauria F <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] presented a research regarding the improvement of immune system independently by physical exercises, in women affected by PCOS. The participants in this research were 62 people in the experimental group (with average age of 22.8 and BMI of 29.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 62 people in the control group (with average age of 22.6 years and BMI of 29.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The exercises of the exercise (sport) group included fixed cycling (3*30 min.week) with medium intensity (60 to 70% VO<sub>2</sub> max) that was done for 12 weeks and eventually the experimental group had a considerable reduction in BMI, and WHR, as compared to the control group. But there was no considerable change in the level of HDL and LDL. This was in conformity with the results obtained by the researcher. Giallauria used the fixed cycling for his exercise protocol, but we used aerobic exercises in our protocol despite similarity of duration and intensity of the exercise, but some discrepancies are observed in the results our research. Reducing of BMI and WHR and no alteration in LDL had conformity with the results we obtained, but no change in HDL was not in conformity with our results that indicate its increase.</p><p>In the research Tofighi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] 30 PCOS women were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group did selected aerobic exercises for 10 weeks, with the intensity of 50-75% of maximum heart rate. The results showed that the physical exercise reduced the rates of WHR, fat percentage, ratio of LH/FSH, SHGB and insulin serum of the experimental group, significantly, but no significant changes were observed for the values of BMI, testosterone serum. The only similar measured factor in the present research was the rate of BMI that it contradicts with the previous results. This could be due to the difference in the period of exercises.</p><p>In another study conducted by Thompson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] 94 patients were divided into 3 test groups that included: First group with diet only (30 people); 2<sup>nd</sup> group will diet and aerobic exercises (31 people); and 3<sup>rd</sup> group with diet, aerobic exercises and endurance exercises. The duration and intensity of the exercises for the first weeks was 25-30 min and 60-65 maximum heart rate that reached to 45 min and 75-80 maximum heart rate. This research had the following results: A considerable reduction for BMI and insulin with empty stomach was observed for all the 3 groups and the fat mass was reduced in both of the exercise groups. Also a considerable improvement was reported in cholesterol and LDL. Ovulation and menstrual cycle were also improved in all the 3 groups. Reduction of BMI of this research was in conformity with the present research, but LDL levels contradict with our results. It is possibly due to different durations and intensities of the exercises in these researches.</p><p>By the end, increased risk of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease had proven in women with PCOS.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Lifestyle changes, had significant role in the prevention of complications. This study demonstrates that moderate intensity exercise (The exercise included 12 weeks of aerobic exercise, for 3 sessions a week, each session for 60 min), can improve several components of lipoprotein profiles. Our results support the beneficial effect of exercise and reducing the role of PCOS complications.
