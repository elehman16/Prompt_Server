The rationale and details of future analysis, in particular, non-inferiority calculations, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of each intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A multicentre, prospective randomised controlled clinical trial, conducted in 2 Australian tertiary paediatric hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Children who meet the inclusion criteria of an age between 5 and 15&#x02005;years and a clinical diagnosis of AUA will be invited to participate, and after consent will be randomised via a computer-based program into treatment groups. The study started in June 2016, and the target recruitment is 220 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Children in the control group will be treated with prophylactic antibiotics and appendicectomy, and those in the intervention group will be treated with antibiotic therapy alone. Primary outcome measures include unplanned or unnecessary operation and complications at 30&#x02005;days.

Standard treatment of management has remained largely unchallenged since its introduction in the late 19th century, largely because of the assumption that AUA progresses to perforation should an operation be withheld.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, appendicectomy via laparoscopic or open approach is not without its risks. Postoperative complications following appendicectomy, including wound infection and ileus, have been reported to be between 1.9% and 8.8%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, 2.8% of patients require further admissions for appendicectomy-related adhesive small bowel obstruction.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Despite recent improvements on medical imaging techniques, 6&#x02013;15% of all appendicectomies are performed on patients with histologically normal appendices.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Non-operative management (NOM) with antibiotics has been increasingly accepted as mainstay therapy for many intra-abdominal infections. Children with appendicitis complicated by perforation, abscess or phlegmon formation can be primarily treated non-operatively with antibiotic therapy, with or without percutaneous drainage.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>Prospective studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that antibiotics are a safe and effective treatment for AUA in adults.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;19</xref> The Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in adults reported a significantly lower overall complication rate of 2.8% in the NOM group, compared with 20.5% in patients who received operative management (OM). Importantly, only 7 of 256 patients in the non-operative group had progression to complicated appendicitis during the 1-year follow-up period.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>There is growing evidence that NOM is also safe and effective in children.

The pilot RCT is limited by its small sample size and short follow-up period. The other studies, while limited by study design, demonstrated a promising initial treatment success rate of 58&#x02013;100%, a considerably shortened recovery time, and improved quality of life scores when compared with the OM.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;32</xref> It is not known how amenable parents and carers will be to the offer of NOM to treat AUA in their child.

Patient enrolment started in June 2016, and assuming a recruitment rate of 30%, we would recruit 110 per annum, thus aiming to recruit over a period of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;years.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>The study will use the web-based application Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> to record outcome variables for inpatient events, follow-up telephone calls and clinic visits. Data will be entered each day by the treating team and checked for completion and accuracy by one of the investigators. Data will then be entered in to an excel spread sheet and accuracy checked by two investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Data management</title><p>The hard copies will be stored securely in a locked office and the soft copies on a password-protected REDCap database.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle, but intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed. The intention-to-treat population will include all randomised participants who start on a treatment, excluding consent withdrawals. The per-protocol population will include all participants who complete the study at 1-year follow-up. A non-inferiority analysis will be performed to compare the primary and secondary outcomes. Based on current adult literature, the treatment efficacy difference between operative and non-operative treatment is about 25&#x02013;35%.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;19</xref> The most recent RCT in adults used 25% as its non-inferiority margin.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In children, a 10% failure rate of NOM has been noted in the pilot study.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus, a non-inferiority margin of 15% will be used in this study.</p><p>Categorical variables will be characterised using frequencies and percentages. Statistical significance for categorical data will be tested using the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Continuous variables will be characterised as means and SDs or medians and IQR for non-parametric data. Differences between groups for normally distributed variables will be tested using the independent sample t-test. The Mann-Whitney test will be used for variables not normally distributed. Non-inferiority for NOM will be tested using the one-sided Wald tests with an &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS Statistics Program.</p><p>The predetermined power (1&#x02013;&#x003b2;) is 80% for this study.</p><p>The total number of consent withdrawals from the study after randomisation will be reported but will be excluded from the final analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Monitoring</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Interim analysis, auditing, harms and adverse event reporting</title><p>Monitoring for safety will occur to detect any unacceptably high levels of complications or adverse events. Primarily, this is to monitor the occurrence of progress to complicated appendicitis in the intervention (NOM) arm, but other adverse events will also be monitored. To do this, a formal independent modified Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DMSB) will be convened for the study.</p><p>The DMSB will consist of three senior clinicians&#x02014;one paediatrician, one surgeon and one infectious diseases specialist&#x02014;none of whom are involved in recruitment or as investigators. Ad hoc specialists may be invited by the DSMB to participate as non-voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired. The chief investigator will provide the DSMB with:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Interim/cumulative data from each centre;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment and retention rates;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any protocol violations;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any adverse events and other unintended effects of the trial.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The DSMB will look at ongoing issues of participant recruitment, conduct of the trial and safety of participants and alert the investigators of concerns. Once assembled, the DSMB will revise their guidelines early in the study and they are at liberty to request additional information beyond what is described in the protocol at any time throughout the study.</p><p>The DMSB will be convened prior to the first recruitment and meet regularly throughout the trial.</p><p>The main perceived concern in this study is the potential increased risk of perforated appendicitis developing in patients in the NOM group. Other potential adverse events include prolonged hospital stay, operative complications, recurrent appendicitis, pain issues and antibiotic complications. Other adverse events unrelated to the trial may occur as is the case with any clinical situation. In order to minimise these risks, the protocol requires close clinical monitoring while in hospital, with clear criteria for cross over to OM in the NOM group. Other clinical issues that may arise will be monitored and managed by the treating team as is usual practice. Patients will be discharged with clear instructions on when to seek further medical attention. In addition, the planned telephone and clinic follow-up will actively seek information about complications or adverse events which will be managed as per usual clinical practice.</p><p>The investigating team will monitor the study progress, including adverse events with monthly meetings. The proceeds of these meetings will be provided to the DSMB along with a specific report on complications and adverse events experienced. Any interim serious adverse events reported spontaneously by the participant or observed by the investigators or staff will be documented and reported immediately to the chief investigator, who will inform the DSMB within 24&#x02005;hours. Any concerns of the DMSB will be immediately discussed with the investigators, and reported directly to the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). The board may recommend trial termination or suspension pending an HREC review.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Dissemination</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>Protocol amendments will be requested through the SCHN HREC. These changes will be communicated to the DSMB. Any material difference this makes to the participants in terms of what is required of them or what is consented to will be communicated to them with renewed consent sought where appropriate.

This study and its findings will provide essential information on the utility of NOM in children with AUA, and yields potential benefits for the wider community as well. These include decreased total treatment cost, shortened length of hospital stay, reduced days of sick leave for participants and carer leave as well as a non-inferior alternative option for those unfit for surgery. The potential for avoiding an operation also includes reduced degree and duration of pain, reduced rate of complications from an appendicectomy, reduced negative appendicectomy rate, expedited return to school and other normal activities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SA and JK initiated the project, and are the chief investigators.
