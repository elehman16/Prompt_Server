training on the balance and gait ability of stroke patients who were dependent ambulators.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty stroke patients participated in this study. The participants
were allocated to either group 1, which received robot-assisted gait training for 4 weeks
followed by conventional physical therapy for 4 weeks, or group 2, which received the same
treatments in the reverse order. Robot-assisted gait training was conducted for 30&#x02005;min, 3
times a week for 4 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale, Modified Functional Reach Test,
Functional Ambulation Category, Modified Ashworth Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Motricity
Index, and Modified Barthel Index were assessed before and after treatment. To confirm the
characteristics of patients who showed a significant increase in Berg Balance Scale after
robot-assisted gait training as compared with physical therapy, subgroup analysis was
conducted. [Results] Only lateral reaching and the Functional Ambulation Category were
significantly increased following robot-assisted gait training. Subscale analyses
identified 3 patient subgroups that responded well to robot-assisted gait training: a
subgroup with hemiplegia, a subgroup in which the guidance force needed to be decreased to
needed to be decreased to &#x02264;45%, and a subgroup in which weight bearing was decreased to
&#x02264;21%. [Conclusion] The present study showed that robot-assisted gait training is not only
effective in improving balance and gait performance but also improves trunk balance and
motor skills required by high-severity stroke patients to perform activities daily living.
Moreover, subscale analyses identified subgroups that responded well to robot-assisted
gait training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Robotics</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke have gait and balance problems related to joint mobility and
stability, muscle tone, muscle weakness and endurance, and loss of proprioception<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. While most patients regain independent
ambulatory function within 6 months, problems with balance continue even after 6 months<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impairment of balance ability makes the
daily life of a stroke patient difficult, and the fear of falls and other secondary
disabilities is likely to aggravate the state of disability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, poor sitting balance in the acute stages after
stroke indicates a poor prognosis for motor recovery in performing routine activities such
as wheelchair transfer and eating<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these reasons, balance ability is most
important component in rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Robust balance can be achieved through either direct balance training for enhancing balance
performance or gait training<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of these
two intervention methods, gait training is predominantly a direct approach requiring the
involvement of a therapist, such as body weight-supported treadmill training and overground
walking training. However, such overground walking therapies are not likely to provide
hemiplegic stroke patients with continuous and consistent training, and they impose
substantial physical burdens on even skilled therapists<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, high-severity stroke patients incapable of walking owing
to weakness and poor coordination cannot benefit from overground walking therapies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. To address these limitations,
robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) was introduced, and it is attracting interest<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. RAGT has the advantages of enabling gait
training in otherwise non-trainable patients by assisting their ambulatory functions with
exoskeletal assistive devices to enable a task-focused training and providing the patient
with regular feedback. Furthermore, it provides continuous and symmetrical training without
time and duration constraints<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 2013 review, which examined 23 randomized controlled
studies with a total of 999 subjects, showed that the likelihood of attaining independent
ambulation is greater in a stroke patient group receiving a combination of RAGT and
conventional gait training than in a stroke patient group receiving conventional gait
training only, thus supporting a previous review&#x02019;s finding<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous other randomized controlled studies also reported
improved independent ambulation and enhanced lower extremity functionality in combination
groups compared with single therapy groups<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to the results of a study with chronic stroke patients, contrary to the generally
known poor prognosis for improvement of ambulatory function of patients with high-severity
lower extremity paresis more than 11 weeks post stroke, the subjects demonstrated improved
ambulatory functions after body weight-supported treadmill training, and the results of some
domestic studies supported this finding<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In light of these findings, numerous
studies presented the possibility of using RAGT as a therapy device for non-ambulatory
chronic stroke patient groups<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Against this background, this study aimed to determine the effectivenss of RAGT as a
therapy. To this end, we provided RAGT to individuals who were dependent ambulators to
confirm its effects on balance and gait function as well as to identify the patient group
that responded well to RAGT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>As the subjects of this study, stroke patients with hemiplegia or quadriplegia admitted
to the National Rehabilitation Center were evaluated. The inclusion criteria were onset
period of &#x0003e;6 months, functional ambulation category &#x0003c;2, independent ambulation
before stroke, capability of understanding and executing RAGT, and an absence of other
orthopedic or neurosurgical problems in the lower extremities. The exclusion criteria were
weight &#x0003e;120&#x02005;kg; femoral length &#x0003c;35&#x02005;cm or femoral length &#x0003e;47&#x02005;cm; history of low
extremity fracture after stroke, instability or subluxation of the hip joint, or pressure
ulcers on the hips or lower extremities; and any underlying disease preventing execution
of RAGT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was an 8-week prospective, crossover research study with parallel groups (AB,
BA) and designed as a randomized controlled trial. Group 1 underwent RAGT in the first 4
weeks, and group 2 commenced RAGT after 4 weeks. Conventional physical therapy (PT) was
performed throughout the 8 weeks in both groups; only the application of RAGT was
different. Balance and walking ability were evaluated before the commencement of RAGT and
4 and 8 weeks thereafter.</p><p>A Lokomat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Hocoma AG, Zurich, Switzerland) system was used for RAGT.
Initially, the guidance force was set at 100% for both the hip and knee joints. Depending
on the patient&#x02019;s functional characteristics, the guidance force was decreased in
increments of 10%. In cases of quadriplegia, settings appropriate to the symptoms of the
most severely affected side were used. Patients selected the walking speed, in the range
of 1.0&#x02013;1.8&#x02005;km/h that they felt was most comfortable. Initially, the level of weight
bearing support was set at 40% of the patient&#x02019;s weight, and this was decreased by 2&#x02005;kg
each session. Subjects used the Lokomat system for 30&#x02005;min, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The
PT consisted of the Bobath training approach, neurophysiological exercise training and
theory, inhibition of spasticity and synergy pattern movement, and standing or sitting
exercises for 30&#x02005;min, 5 times a week.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Modified Functional Reach Tests (MFRTs; forward and
lateral) were used for evaluating the primary outcome of balance. The BBS is designed to
assess static and dynamic balancing in the elderly and disabled adults with 14 different
criteria<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the MFRT is a
balancing ability evaluation that requires stretching the arm in the sitting position,
patients who are unable to walk may also be evaluated<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient&#x02019;s maximum forward and lateral reach are measured for
evaluation.</p><p>The secondary outcomes measured in the study were walking ability, motor function, and
independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Gait ability was measured using the
Functional Ambulation Category (FAC); patients were scored from 0&#x02013;5 depending on the
amount of help needed when walking. Muscle tone and muscle recovery degree of the
extremities were used to evaluate movement function. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS),
which defines 6 different categories, was used to evaluate muscle tone, and the Fugl-Meyer
Assessment of Lower Extremity (LeFMA) and Motricity Index (MI) were used to evaluate the
degree of muscle recovery of the extremities. The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was used to
assess the patient&#x02019;s independent mobility for ADL, and the scores for lower
classifications such as transfer and ambulation were recorded separately.</p><p>To confirm the characteristics of patients who showed a significant increase in BBS score
after RAGT when compared with after PT, subgroup analysis was performed according to the
patient&#x02019;s paralyzed side, guidance force, and body weight support rate. The guidance force
(GF) subgroup was divided into GF subgroup 1, which had a median guidance force below 45%,
and GF subgroup 2, which had a guidance force greater that 50%. The weight bearing support
(WBS) subgroup was divided into WBS subgroup 1, which had a median weight bearing support
below 21%, and WBS subgroup 2, which had a median weight bearing support of more than
21%.</p><p>This research received IRB approval (09-01) from the Korea National Rehabilitation Center
IRB Committee, and all participants gave informed consent to the research.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed to compare the 2 treatments. The possibility of a
period effect was tested using a 2-sample t test to compare differences in period between
the 2 groups of patients. We also investigated the possibility of a treatment period
interaction by assuming that in the absence of an interaction, a patient&#x02019;s average
response to the 2 treatments would be the same regardless of the order in which they were
received. The treatment effect was tested by performing a 1-sample t test on all 20
subjects regardless of differences between the 2 treatments because there was no period
effect and no treatment period interaction. Because the 2 crossover groups were not the
same size, we considered the average effect in the 2 periods, which was the equivalent of
performing a 2-sample t test. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 14.0 software for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value less than 0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups; group 1 contained 13 patients and group 2

to determine the therapeutic effects of RAGT on balance and gait functions and to identify
the patient group suitable for RAGT.</p><p>Balance is a key element contributing to the optimal gait function in stroke patients. In
particular, sitting balance is an important prerequisite for conducting independent daily
activities in the stages prior to recovery of ambulatory function<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the
approaches used for the recovery of balance ability in stroke patients is gait training. A
study that investigated the relationship between gait training and balance in stroke
patients reported that its Lokomat training group showed significantly greater improvement
in terms of the BBS score than its control group<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies evaluating the balancing ability of chronic stroke patients
(&#x02265;6 months post stroke) also reported significant positive effects of RAGT that were
comparable with those of regular physiotherapies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a study conducted on
severe stroke patients, RAGT was more efficient than a regular ambulation therapy in
improving the functions necessary for ambulation, such as proprioceptive balance control,
lower-extremity mobility, and endurance<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. A large number of studies have presented their findings of
investigations of the effects of RAGT, and a systematic review showed that the efficacy of
RAGT in improving the balance ability of stroke patients is comparable to but not superior
to that obtained with other ambulation training methods<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, too, the BBS evaluation results revealed that both
RAGT and PT contributed to enhancing balance ability, although there were no significant
duration-dependent differences. The Texas Woman&#x02019;s University provided MFRT-related standards
of forward reaching &#x02265; 32&#x02005;cm and lateral reaching &#x02265; 18&#x02005;cm<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, while the number of patients that showed
improvements in forward reaching &#x02265; 32&#x02005;cm increased by 25% after PT, no patient showed
post-training improvement in lateral reaching &#x02265; 18&#x02005;cm compared with his/her baseline
performance. In contrast, while the extent of RAGT-mediated improvements in forward reaching
&#x02265; 32&#x02005;cm was similar to the 25% achieved after PT, the number of patients who demonstrated
improvements in lateral reaching &#x02265; 18&#x02005;cm increased by 35% relative to the baseline level.
From these results, it can be inferred that RAGT is superior to PT as a treatment method for
improving lateral reaching. Furthermore, these findings are similar to those of previous
studies in which improvement in the weight-supporting function of the paretic lower
extremities was directly associated with improvement in forward and lateral reaching and
findings in previous studies indicating that successful coordination between the trunk and
upper extremities improves extension performances in the sitting position<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both groups showed significant improvements in the ability to perform ADL. This was induced
by the improvement of balance ability, as judged on the basis of the findings of previous
studies that confirmed the positive relationship between ADL and sitting balance<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies conducted on acute- and subacute-stage patients
who were dependent ambulators and chronic ambulatory patients, the post-intervention MIs
were significantly improved compared with baseline levels in their RAGT and PT groups<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the current study showed similar pre-post differences
in both groups, thus supporting the results of previous studies. The post-intervention MAS
score tended to decrease in the RAGT group but tended to increase in the PT group.</p><p>The subgroup analyses revealed that the hemiplegia subgroup showed statistically greater
improvements in BBS than the quadriplegia subgroup and that the RAGT group managed to reduce
the GF to &#x02264;45% and successfully decreased the WBS to &#x02264;21%, showing significant improvements
compared with the PT group.</p><p>This study included chronic stroke patients who were dependent ambulators to determine the
effects of RAGT. We verified that RAGT is efficacious in regaining balance and gait
functions in stroke patients who are dependent ambulators. Additionally, patient groups
suitable for obtaining optimal RAGT effects could be identified using subgroup analyses.
These results are expected to serve as basic data for discussions about rehabilitation
training methods that can maximize the advantages of robot-assisted devices as well as for
the development of treatment protocols tailored according to patient characteristics. They
will also serve as important basic data for development of future treatment devices for
stroke patients who are dependent ambulators.</p><p>The following may be mentioned as limitations of this study: difficulties related to
finding stroke inpatients who were dependent ambulators with a symptom duration &#x02265;6 months
and a high dropout rate during the study owing to health status aggravation anticipated in
high-severity patients, refusal of study participation, and adverse dermatological effects.
Moreover, the session and program durations were insufficient to induce physical changes.
Thus, future research must focus on verifying the advantage of RAGT over PT in inducing
significant balance ability improvements. Additionally, studies with larger sample sizes and
longer time frames are needed to provide regular guidelines on training protocol progression
and manifest physical functions.</p><p>In conclusion, RAGT is a treatment method with obvious therapeutic effects that is safely
applicable to chronic stroke patients who are dependent ambulators. Not only was it
efficacious in improving balance and gait performance to an extent equivalent to PT, but it
was also verified to be conductive to improving the trunk balance and motor skills necessary
for high-severity stroke patients to perform daily routine activities. Moreover, subscale
analyses identified three patient subgroups that responded well to RAGT.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grants (Code No. 10-B-01 and NRCTR-IN15004) from the
