We performed a double-blind crossover design study to investigate subjective ratings, EEG and ECG following experimental laser pain under the influence of sham and verum acupuncture in 26 healthy volunteers. We analyzed neuronal oscillations and inter-regional coherence in the gamma band of 128-channel-EEG recordings as well as heart rate variability (HRV) on two experimental days. Pain ratings and pain-induced gamma oscillations together with vagally-mediated power in the high-frequency bandwidth (vmHF) of HRV decreased significantly stronger during verum than sham acupuncture. Gamma oscillations were localized in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), primary somatosensory cortex and insula. Reductions of pain ratings and vmHF-power were significantly correlated with increase of connectivity between the insula and MCC. In contrast, connectivity between left and right PFC and between PFC and insula correlated positively with vmHF-power without a relationship to acupuncture analgesia. Overall, these findings highlight the influence of the insula in integrating activity in limbic-saliency networks with vagally mediated homeostatic control to mediate antinociception under the influence of acupuncture.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A network of multiple cortical areas underlies the multidimensional sensory and emotional experience of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Cortical areas involved in pain processing include the primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), limbic areas such as the insula and the cingulate gyrus, midbrain and brainstem areas and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Somatosensory regions are widely accepted to represent sensory-discriminative aspects whereas limbic areas seem to be more important for emotional and motivational aspects of pain processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Numerous studies demonstrated that gamma-band synchronization between different brain areas allows binding of stimulus features into a coherent percept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, evidence exists that changes in thalamo-cortical oscillatory synchrony in the gamma range result in more efficient stimulus processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Gamma-band oscillations in somatosensory and limbic areas can also be observed following experimental pain stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Pain-related brain areas are not solely activated by noxious stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> but also engaged by other emotional and cognitive processes. Hence, gamma-band synchronization across different cortical areas may indicate how the brain orchestrates the various sensory, cognitive and emotional components of pain perception. Furthermore, pain-induced gamma-band activity can be modulated by top-down and bottom-up attention leading to altered pain perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, gamma-band oscillations are likely to reflect both the integration of activity across different pain-related regions underlying subjective pain experience and its endogenous modulation by attention and expectation.</p><p id="Par3">Although the specificity and mechanisms of acupuncture effects are under debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> some evidence is available suggesting an involvement of different processes at all levels of pain processing including peripheral tissue reactions, modulation of spinal cord processes, as well as subcortical and cortical modulations. For example, local transmitter release has been made responsible for the acupuncture effect in the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Central mechanisms include a modulation of &#x000b5;-opioid receptors which has been observed in cingulate cortex, caudate, insula, thalamus and amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, presumably representing a similar mechanism as in placebo analgesia. Some authors interpret acupuncture as stress-related analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, evidence is available that acupuncture can modulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Recent studies support the view that acupuncture might modulate pain through the interaction of cortical sensory, limbic and executive networks with longer lasting changes in the default mode network and the ANS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To investigate the influence of pain modulation by acupuncture on pain related communication processes and responses of the ANS we tested the influence of sham and verum acupuncture in a double-blind repeated measures design on cortico-cortical coupling and heart rate variability (HRV) following experimental pain induced by laser radiant heat stimuli. On two different experimental days, subjects were either treated with a verum or sham acupuncture. ECG and EEG were recorded and further analyzed with a focus on HRV analysis as well as power and coupling of neural gamma oscillations. We expected acupuncture analgesia to be associated, on the one hand, with changes of inter-regional coherence of gamma-oscillations between pain-relevant brain structures and, on the other hand, with changes in the sympatho-vagal balance as derived from HRV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioral data</title><p id="Par5">After completion of recordings on the second experimental day, the subjects were told that only one session day involved a verum acupuncture, the other day a sham acupuncture. Subsequently, we asked them to estimate in percent (100%&#x02009;=&#x02009;totally certain and &#x02212;100% totally uncertain) about how certain they would be to judge on which day they received sham or verum treatment. The mean correct estimation rate was 23,1%, but did not reach significance based on a one-sample t-test (t<sub>(25)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.078). Therefore, subjects were not systematically able to distinguish between sham and verum acupuncture. Subjects who received sham treatment on the first day estimated with 41,7% correctly and subjects who received acupuncture on the first day estimated 7,1% correctly the treatment order. However, no significant difference between the groups in estimation error was found (t<sub>(25)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.4; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.175). Furthermore, subjects were asked, whether they believe in the effectiveness of acupuncture in general and whether it would work also for themselves. Furthermore, the subjects were asked, if they consider themselves as religious. 84&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16% believed that acupuncture is effective in general and 78&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;19% believed it would also work for themselves. The two belief variables correlated significantly (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). 40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;35% of the subjects declared themselves religious, which was unrelated to their belief in effectiveness of acupuncture. Furthermore, we divided all subjects in religious and non-religious subjects and compared the groups, which showed no significant differences in belief on effectiveness of acupuncture.</p><p id="Par6">In the beginning and the end of each experimental day, we performed a pain-threshold estimation.

MIM is a measure to investigate synchronization processes of brain sources in the EEG/MEG, which are robust to artifacts of volume conduction. This can be achieved by maximization of imaginary coherency in virtual channels on the source level (see methods). Based on the source localisation of gamma oscillations, five regions of interest were chosen for connectivity analysis, namely bilateral PFC, MCC, contralateral SI and contralateral insula. To reveal significant functional connections, differences in pain-induced MIM were calculated between pre- and post-stimulus intervals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). During the pre-block, we were able to identify two significant connections. One significant connection was found between ipsilateral PFC and contralateral insula. The second significant connection was found between the contralateral insula and contralateral SI. Interestingly, these connections were the same on both experimental days during the pre-block, indicating a strong retest reliability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). During both treatment days, the connections between the ipsilateral PFC and the contralateral insula remained stable but with decreasing MIM values over time. Furthermore, during verum treatment, connection between ipsilateral PFC and contralateral MCC as well as contralateral PFC and contralateral SI were significant in the treatment block 3 at the end of the experiment. These connections were not present during sham stimulation in the treatment block 3. Furthermore, the connection between contralateral PFC and SI was not only present during verum treatment, but also in the treatment block 1 in the sham treatment condition. Taken together, during verum treatment there is evidence for increased neuronal communication in the gamma band between prefrontal sides and the cingulate gyrus, insula and SI.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Coupling of gamma oscillations.

For this analysis parameters were pooled over both conditions. Changes in pain ratings were significantly negatively correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with MIM parameters between insula and MCC.

This indicates that the higher the connectivity between insula and MCC the greater is the reduction of both pain and vmHF-power. This is compatible with the assumption that an increase in neuronal communication between insular and cingulate parts of the limbic network mediate decreased pain during the experiment together with decreased vagal tone. On the other hand, neuronal coupling between left and right PFC (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) as well as between ipsilateral PFC and insula (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.22, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) was positively correlated with an increase in HF power. This finding could indicate that with stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity within prefrontal cortex and with increased prefrontal-insular connectivity the vagal tone is less weakened. Overall, these findings highlight the influence of the insula in connection with hubs of cognitive-executive and limbic-saliency networks to mediate antinociception and HRV-parameters under the exteroceptive processing of verum, but also to some degree sham acupuncture.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Correlation between cortical connectivity, pain ratings and HRV parameters.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">We examined the analgesic effects of verum in comparison to sham acupuncture on laser-induced pain using a double-blind controlled study design in healthy participants. Our analysis focused on the modulation of laser-induced gamma oscillations in pain-related brain regions and on changes of inter-regional coupling in this frequency band by acuptuncture. Verum treatment diminished pain more than sham treatment. Furthermore, we observed a decrease of vagally mediated HRV components (vmHRV) in both treatments, which again was significantly stronger in the verum than in the sham acupuncture group. This effect indicates a predominant negative modulation of the vagal influence on HRV by acupuncture. The major drive for the vmHRV comes from the baroreceptor input via bronchial, diaphragmatic and aortic afferent activity to the nucleus tractus solitarii due to breathing-related changes in intrathoracic pressure, giving rise to respiratory sinus arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A baroreceptor receptor loop over the nucleus tractus solitarii and the rostroventral medulla to the sinus node also mediates a sympatho-excitatory slow HRV component. One of the reasons why vagal and sympathetic outflow of the autonomic nervous system differentially influence the respective rapid and slow HRV components is that postganglionic autonomic efferents have an about tenfold slower conduction velocity than preganglionic fibers. Whereas parasympathetic efferents have longer preganglionic rapidly conducting pathways with ganglia near the sinus node, sympathetic efferents synapse already in the stellate ganglia close to the cervical vertebral column and reach the sinus node over significantly longer slowly conducting postganglionic pathways. Yet, given the antagonistic interaction of vagal and sympathetic activity within a central autonomic network in the brainstem, the negative modulation of vmHRV components by acupuncture can be the result of a combination of parasympatho-inhibitory and sympatho-excitatory effects. However, both parasympatho-inhibitory and sympatho-excitatory effects on the heart can also be modulated indirectly through pathways linking the frontal cortex with the autonomic network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is therefore also possible that an acupuncture-mediated change in frontal networks may have caused this shift in sympatho-vagal balance associated with reduction of pain sensitivity, an explanation that we want to further elaborate by discussing the results of the EEG analysis.</p><p id="Par20">Pain-related gamma oscillations in the EEG were more strongly decreased during verum than sham treatment in our study. These gamma oscillations were localized in bilateral PFC, SI, MCC and the insula. Connectivity analysis between these regions showed a relation of coupling between insula and MCC to both pain sensitivity and a reduction of vmHRV. Stronger coupling of insula with PFC or between left and right PFC resulted in greater vmHRV, but left pain sensitivity unchanged. It has been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> that vmHRV indicates a central state in which interoception and activation of the default mode network (DMN) predominate in the cortex. States with increased processing of exteroceptive input, especially from salient stimuli such as pain or other task-relevant stimuli, are believed to give rise to a dominance of strongly task-related networks like the saliency network or the central executive network, which are anti-correlated to the DMN. Given the pivotal role of both MCC and insula in the saliency network, it is therefore possible that acupuncture as exteroceptive stimulus shifts brain network activity from DMN towards task-related networks. However, our paradigm did not allow to analyse coupling within the DMN because we only studied gamma oscillations induced by laser pain stimuli but did not have sufficient recording periods of ongoing activity. Thus, we can only speculate that stronger decrease of DMN activity might have occurred as effect of verum compared to sham acupuncture, which indirectly could be reflected in the stronger reduction of vmHRV. This view is consistent with that of Bai <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> that acupuncture might modulate pain through a shift in the interaction of different cortical sensory, limbic and executive networks with the DMN and the autonomic nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">It is possible that other effects might have contributed to the observed reduction of pain sensitivity and vmHRV in our study. Habituation effects due to repetitive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or shifts in attentional mechanisms could have decreased perceived pain in our study. The subjects were told that the experimental purpose was to test the reliability and effectiveness of acupuncture. Interestingly, most of the subjects expressed a general belief in the effectiveness of acupuncture and the belief that acupuncture would also be effective on themselves. Therefore, it is possible that both conditions, namely sham and verum treatment induced an expectation of analgesia equivalent to placebo cognitions that could have contributed to the reduced painfulness of laser stimuli. For this study, we chose a sophisticated double blind randomized study design, the effectiveness of which has been already approved in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, even though not statistically significant, 23% of the subjects recognized the treatment order correctly, which could have biased verum acupuncture towards greater placebo cognitions than sham treatment. The belief in the effectiveness of a treatment is a strong pain modulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> not only in placebo experiments. If placebo effects in fact influenced verum acupuncture more than sham acupuncture in our study we cannot exclude that placebo effects may have reduced pain and vmHRV more in the verum condition. Furthermore, expectation-related placebo analgesia involves a fronto-cingulate descending pathway, which projects to the periaqueductal grey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and engages the endogenous opioid system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Sympatho-excitatory outflow and descending pain inhibition pathways converge anatomically in the rostroventral medulla. Therefore, it remains an important question whether placebo and acupuncture share common pathways to mediate analgesia. Acupuncture per se can alter autonomic function as well. Most experiments, which investigated autonomic and HRV parameters were performed without the presence of pain. In these studies, divergent results are reported, which may be due to the different study designs and different approaches of acupuncture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Taken together, it is likely that acupuncture modulates the autonomic nervous system and, when associated with painful stimulation, contributes to a decrease in parasympathetic activity.</p><p id="Par22">In summary, we were able to show that pain induced gamma oscillations in pain-related brain areas are more strongly reduced by verum than sham acupuncture. Furthermore, vagally-mediated high-frequency ECG power and other short-term HRV-parameters derived from time-domain and non-linear analysis decreased also more strongly during verum than sham acupuncture treatment. Reduction of pain ratings and vmHRV parameters were significantly correlated with increase of connectivity between the insula and the mid-cingulate cortex. Overall, these findings suggest that the insula may play a key role in regulating the interplay between limbic-saliency networks and homeostatic autonomic control to mediate antinociception under the influence of exteroceptive signals triggered by acupuncture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par23">Thirty-two healthy right handed participants were recruited and 26 subjects completed the study (19 female), aged 20 to 29 years (mean 25.3).

On this rating scale, a value of 0 indicates no sensation at all and 3 indicates the threshold for a pain sensation. Sensation higher than 0 and below 3 indicates non-painful warm, barely tactile sensations, whereas sensation at pain threshold indicates the beginning of a painful hot and stinging pain. Values of 10 denote worst imaginable pain. Individual pain threshold was tested by calculating the average intensity at which subjects reported first a rating value above 3 in three ascending stimulus series and, moreover, first a rating value below 3 in three descending series of laser stimuli using successive intensity increments of 20&#x02009;mJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

These small needles have a diameter of 0.2 mm and length of 0.6 mm and are fixed on an adhesive round plaster. The sham needles are visually identical to the verum needles with the needle element removed from the shaft.

A window of 500 ms length was shifted over the data with a step size of 10 ms. Spectral smoothing of 10&#x02009;Hz was achieved by 3 slepian tapers. Time-frequency results were expressed as percent signal change relative to baseline, using a baseline interval from &#x02212;1000 ms to 0 ms prior to stimulus onset. The gamma band was defined as frequencies between 40 to 100&#x02009;Hz.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Source Localization</title><p id="Par30">For each subject, data sets were averaged for each block. Source reconstruction was applied using exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). A realistic 3-shell model was constructed of the Montreal Neurological Institute template brain (MNI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mni.mcgill.ca">http://www.mni.mcgill.ca</ext-link>). Using this head model and a lead field tensor for approximately 10.000 source points, an eLORETA spatial filter was constructed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> for each grid point. The eLORETA filter is linear and non-adaptive. Applying this filter, which consists for each grid point of an Nx3 matrix for N sensors and 3 dipole directions, on data is a weighted minimum norm inverse solution with weights designed such that, for a single dipolar source, the reconstructed distributed source has the maximum amplitude at the location of the dipole. For statistical analysis of neuronal activity, a paired t-test was performed on the result for each grid point to estimate the signal change of each condition versus baseline. Subsequently t-values were transformed to z-scores. All results were corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster randomization approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Connectivity analysis</title><p id="Par31">To analyze neuronal coupling related to pain processing, we applied a multivariate interaction measure (MIM) approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The connectivity analysis was data driven and only nodes obtained from the source reconstruction results were fed into the analysis of MIM. Hence, we only calculated MIM values between the four sources obtained from the source analysis. MIM is a multivariate extension of the imaginary part of coherence: it is a multivariate linear measure of functional connectivity at a specified frequency robust to artifacts resulting from volume conduction, implying that a non-vanishing value cannot be explained by an instantaneous mixture of sources that are actually independent. This is in contrast to classical coherence and also to other newly developed coherence based methods like icoh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> which is in particular designed as a measure of directed (and direct) interaction. For MIM, for each pair of grid points the functional dependence is measured between the two 3-dimensional spaces spanned by three possible dipole orientations for each grid point. This measure is in contrast to bivariate measures for which at first source orientation are estimated by maximizing the power which may lead to missing relevant interactions. For statistical analysis of neuronal communication, a paired t-test was performed for each connection to estimate the signal change of each condition versus baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par32">For statistical analysis, the statistics toolbox running under Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) and SPSS 20 (IBM, NY) was used. Because the gamma-band activation was most pronounced in the central region, all sensor level analyses were performed using the data of the centro-frontal region of interest. All variables were first tested with a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution. As no deviations from the normal distribution were detected, we used parametrical statistics. Pain ratings, heart rate variability parameters, gamma-power values and source reconstruction CSD values were analyzed using repeated measures 2-way analyses of variance (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 ANOVA) testing for the effects of treatment (sham versus verum) and repetition (Pre, Treat 1, Treat 2, Treat 3). Significant main and interaction effects were then subjected to post-hoc paired t-tests. For all analyses, the critical p-value was set to <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. The p-values were corrected after adjustment of the degree of freedom of all effects with more that 2 factor levels by multiplying with the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon values. Source reconstruction results were corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster randomization approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
