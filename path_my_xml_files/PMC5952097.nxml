The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of ulinastatin combined with mechanical ventilation on oxygen metabolism, inflammation and stress response, as well as the antioxidant capacity of ARDS. Eighty patients with ARDS treated in Yiwu Central Hospital from January, 2015 to December, 2016 were enrolled in the present study and divided into the observation (n=40) and control (n=40) groups, using a random number table. The control group was treated with mechanical ventilation, while the observation group, based on treatment of the control group, was treated with ulinastatin for 14 consecutive days as one course of treatment. The changes in the relevant indexes of oxygen metabolism, lung function, time of ventilator treatment, total hospital stay, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score of the two groups after intervention were compared, and the changes in inflammatory cytokine levels, dopamine receptor-related hormone levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity of the two groups before intervention and at 1 and 4 weeks after intervention were compared. After intervention, the arterial blood lactate in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), the oxygen uptake rate was significantly higher than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05) and the arterial oxygen content was significantly higher than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). In the lung function indexes, the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC levels in the observation group were smaller than those in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), the duration of ventilator treatment was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), and the hospital stay was significantly less than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Prior to intervention, SGRQ scores in the two groups were not statistically significant (P&#x0003e;0.05). At 1 and 4 weeks after intervention, the SGRQ scores of the observation group were significantly increased to those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The tumor levels of necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CRP were significantly lower than those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The levels of adrenaline and norepinephrine were significantly lower than those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The levels of MDA, SOD and the total antioxidant capacity were significantly increased to those of control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The application of ulinastatin combined with mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients is of great significance in improving the oxygen delivery-consumption balance of body, increasing the lung function, reducing the inflammatory and stress response, and improving the antioxidant capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ulinastatin</kwd><kwd>mechanical ventilation</kwd><kwd>acute respiratory distress syndrome</kwd><kwd>oxygen metabolism</kwd><kwd>inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>antioxidant capacity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disease that poses a serious threat to human life and health (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

The effective improvement of the clinical treatment of these patients, reduction of the body's inflammatory response and antioxidant response, and improvement of the oxygen delivery-consumption balance of the body are key and difficult points in the treatment of ARDS at present (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Ulinastatin is mainly isolated and extracted from the fresh urine of healthy adult males, which, as a kind of glycoprotein, can effectively improve the stability of lysosomal membrane and reduce the synthesis and delivery of lysosomal enzymes, thus scavenging oxygen or hydroxyl radicals, thereby inhibiting the body's inflammatory response (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and improving the body's immune capacity (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).

The control group was treated with mechanical ventilation. First, the patients were treated with pulmonary re-expansion for 10 consecutive seconds. Then the Respironics 3100B mechanical ventilation instrument (Sensor Medics, Homestead, FL, USA) was connected with the airway pressure of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O under the SIMV mode; the respiratory frequency was set as 5 Hz, the inspiratory/expiratory ratio was set as 1:2 and the fraction of inspired oxygen was set as 80&#x02013;100%, and these parameters were decreased step by step. The observation group, based on the treatment of the control group, was treated with the ulinastatin injection (NMPN H20040476; Guangdong Techpool Biochemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China): 200,000 units were added into 0.9% 100 ml normal saline for intravenous infusion once every 12 h, and continuous application for 14 days was considered one course of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Observational indexes</title><p>The changes in relevant indexes of oxygen metabolism, lung function, time of ventilator treatment, total hospital stay, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score of the two groups after intervention were compared, and the changes in inflammatory cytokine levels, dopamine receptor-related hormone levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the total antioxidant capacity of the two groups before intervention and at 1 and 4 weeks after intervention were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation criteria</title><p>Artery blood lactate was detected using whole spectrophotometry (Beckman and Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and the normal value was 0.5&#x02013;1.7 mmol/l (5&#x02013;15 mg/day). The oxygen uptake rate mainly reflected the affinity of hemoglobin and oxygen, and the normal value was 25&#x02013;33%. Arterial oxygen content was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the normal value was 8.55&#x02013;9.45 mmol/l. FEV<sub>1</sub> was considered the total gas volume within 1 sec of maximal inspiration after maximal expiration. SGRQ score was mainly used for the evaluation of breathing difficulties in the past 4 weeks. There were a total of 76 questions, using the 5-point system and the higher the score, the worse the respiratory function. Inflammatory factors were determined using ELISA, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) (adult's reference value, 1&#x02013;10 ng/ml), interleukin-1 (IL-1) (adult's reference value, 130&#x02013;250 ng/ml), IL-6 (adult's reference value, 67.37&#x02013;150.33 ng/l) and hs-CRP (adult's reference value, &#x0003c;10 mg/l). The ELISA antibody-sandwich method was used to determine the levels of serum cortisol (adult's reference value, 80&#x02013;550 nmol/l), epinephrine (adult's reference value, within 480 pmol/l) and norepinephrine (adult's reference value, 615&#x02013;3240 pmol/l).

Its pathological feature is primarily diffuse alveolar epithelial cell and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell damage, mostly accompanied with severe pulmonary edema and the formation of pulmonary hyaline membranes. With disease progression, the lung volume is significantly reduced, lung compliance is decreased, and ventilation/blood flow ratio is out of balance (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The imbalance of oxygen metabolism, inflammatory response and antioxidant capacity disorder are important links in the occurrence and development of ARDS (<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). High-frequency oscillatory ventilation ventilates through the high airway positive pressure circuit formed by the high speed continuous air flow, which is repeatedly superimposed by the shock wave formed by the piston device, thus reducing the gas and CO<sub>2</sub> retention in the normal breathing support (<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), thereby significantly improving the respiratory support effect. However, single application of mechanical ventilation is mainly used to improve the respiratory function of patients with ARDS, but has no significant effect on the body's inflammatory response and stress response (<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, ulinastatin and mechanical ventilation were combined.</p><p>Findings of the present study showed that after intervention, the arterial blood lactate in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group, the oxygen uptake rate was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the arterial oxygen content was significantly higher than that in the control group. In the lung function indexes, FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV1/FVC level in the observation group were larger than those in the control group, suggesting that the application of ulinastatin in ARDS patients can significantly improve the body's oxygen supply-demand balance, improve the lung function, reduce the lactic acid accumulation and improve the patients' prognosis. In addition, the duration of ventilator treatment was significantly shorter than that in the control group and the hospital stay was significantly less than that in the control group. At 1 and 4 weeks after intervention, the SGRQ scores of the observation group were significantly increased compared to those of the control group, further suggesting that the application of ulinastatin in ARDS patients is important for shortening the duration of ventilator treatment and hospital stay and improving the overall respiratory function of patients. At the same time, the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CRP were significantly lower than those of the control group at 1 and 4 weeks after intervention, suggesting that the application of ulinastatin in ARDS patients can decrease the body's inflammatory cytokines. Finally, at 1 and 4 weeks after intervention, the levels of adrenaline and norepinephrine&#x02019; were significantly lower than those of the control group, while the level of SOD and total antioxidant capacity were significantly increased compared to those of the control group, indicating that the application of ulinastatin in ARDS patients has a positive significance in reducing the oxygen-free radical damage and decreasing the stress response.</p><p>Ulinastatin, as a kind of broad-spectrum protease inhibitor, can effectively inhibit the activity of inflammatory factors and reduce their levels, thus playing a role in protecting the body organs and system (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Its intravenous administration can effectively inhibit a variety of cell proteolytic enzymes in the body (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), reduce the damage of hydrolase to normal tissues, stabilize the intracellular lysosomal membrane, and reduce the body peroxidation reaction by inhibiting the production of peroxide, thus inhibiting the inflammatory response (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, ulinastatin can inhibit the proteolytic enzyme activity widely and improve body microcirculation and tissue perfusion functions (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The stability of intracellular lysosomal membrane (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) can help improve the organelle mitochondrial activity, improve cell respiration (<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), enhance cell elastinase activity, and remove the body oxygen or hydroxyl-free radicals (<xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-6012" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the application of ulinastatin combined with mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients is of great significance in improving the oxygen delivery-consumption balance of the body, increasing lung function, reducing the inflammatory and stress response and improving the antioxidant capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing
