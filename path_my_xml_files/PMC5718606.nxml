The fraction of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and partial pressure of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were 0.209 and 133.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 mmHg for NBR and 0.141 &#x000b1; 0.004 and 90.0 &#x000b1; 0.4 mmHg for both hypoxic variants (HBR and HAmb; ~4000 m simulated altitude), respectively. A number of parameters linked to intestinal environment such as defecation frequency, intestinal electrical conductivity (IEC), sterol and polyphenol content and diversity, indole, aromaticity and spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured (64 variables). The structure and diversity of bacterial microbial community was assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Inactivity negatively affected frequency of defecation and in combination with hypoxia increased IEC (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In contrast, sterol and polyphenol diversity and content, various characteristics of DOM and aromatic compounds, the structure and diversity of bacterial microbial community were not significantly affected over time. A new in-house PlanHab database was established to integrate all measured variables on host physiology, diet, experiment, immune and metabolic markers (n = 231). The observed progressive decrease in defecation frequency and concomitant increase in IEC suggested that the transition from healthy physiological state towards the developed symptoms of low magnitude obesity-related syndromes was dose dependent on the extent of time spent in inactivity and preceded or took place in absence of significant rearrangements in bacterial microbial community.

Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that modern humans in general lack a substantial portion of natural diversity in their intestinal microbiome rendering them more susceptible to dysbiosis [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The close affiliation between the triad of diet, metabolism and exercise was clearly outlined recently as increased exercise and dietary extremes shaped microbial diversity in professional athletes [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most studies in this field have focused on comparing groups with already developed symptoms and the consequent effects of restoration of physical activity in (previously unfit) population. Reduced risk for several metabolic, inflammatory and neoplastic conditions has been observed as a consequence of exercise introduction [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, exercise was recently linked to modifications of the gut microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], increased vagal-nerve tone at rest [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], gene expression of transport proteins [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as exercise related immunological responses [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the relationship between exercise, intestinal microbiota, human physiology and diet has not been explored during acute cessation of exercise in healthy test participants leading to deconditioning of various subsystems, similar to medical conditions such as fractures, chronic heart failure or obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity related syndromes.</p><p>Our recent study Sket et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] took advantage of the experimental setup of the PlanHab project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188556.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188556.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This study was designed to investigate the combined effects of prolonged (21-day) complete inactivity and hypoxia on healthy-participants under strictly controlled conditions according to ESA/NASA core bed rest data collection SOP [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

We hypothesized that the cessation of exercise and hypoxia would result in quantitative and qualitative differences in microbial community structure that would enable elucidation of the first responding taxa linked to the inflammation of the host. Secondly, based on observation that significant changes in a number of intestinal parameters developed over time, we hypothesized that correlation of changes in microbial community structure and environment would enable identification of the key structuring environmental parameters. Our third hypothesis was that the timing of physiological changes coincided with concomitant changes in microbial communities over the course of 21-day experiment.

The extent of unexplained variation at 97% OTU and genus levels was consequently attributed to a combination of: (i) experimental sources of variation, (ii) unknown real sources of variation and (iii) random noise.

This finding supports recent observation that professional athletes exhibited lower levels of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and increased microbial diversity at higher dietary protein and fat intake than control groups [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HAmb exhibited a healthy phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], despite the fact that most of the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species observed in HBR were also present in NBR and HAmb at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188556.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, HAmb, NBR and HBR groups of PlanHab study contained at least 28.8%, 35.8% and 21.2% lower fraction of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, respectively, than the athletes, low BMI and high BMI controls, reported before, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This clearly shows that related species and microbes can have multiple, very different or even opposing effects on host metabolism and health [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] based on microbial metabolic responses to the detected changes in the multivariate environment of intestinal tract. Consequently, for the development of the observed pathologies in host physiology other conditions than the sole presence or abundance of particular microbial type are necessary making the microbial metabolites the key effectors and mediators of signal for the real-time modification of host physiology.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Changes in environmental parameters shape microbial activities</title><p>Numerous characteristics of intestinal environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188556.s006">S2 Table</xref>) that were measured in this and our past study [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] revealed that many of these variables were either correlated and also covaried over the course of experiment, indicating a substantial and potentially hierarchical codependence between parameters within intestinal environment. In addition, the majority of variables did not change significantly, indicating that the extent of experimental disturbance (inactivity, time, hypoxia) and their interactive effects were not sufficient to induce significant changes, as observed for sterol and polyphenol content and diversity next to DOM spectral derivatives in this study. Dietary polyphenols are a major source of antioxidants consumed by humans. Polyphenols possess not only antioxidant properties but also antiviral, antibacterial, antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, as well as the ability to modulate certain signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B activation. Sterols as lipids have important biological functions in humans depending on the interaction between the diet of the host (that determines the relative quantities of sterol precursors) and the complex metabolic transformations of sterols by intestinal microbiota to their secondary derivatives with potent biological effects [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Constipation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188556.g005">Fig 5</xref>) in response to inactivity effectively changed IEC that is linked to the effectiveness of microbial nutrient transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188556.g006">Fig 6</xref>), mucin characteristics (folding, thickness and porosity) and consequently surface availability of tripartite complex of glycans derived from diet (plant polymers), host (mucin-O-glycans) and microorganisms (extracellular polymeric substances) [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>In line with these observations, the major factor shaping the metabolism of intestinal communities, including <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, is competition for nutrients. This competition is paralleled by the simultaneous need to shield themselves from harmful environmental factors, innate and adaptive parts of immune system, through coordinated modulation of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and surface antigenicity [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The capacity of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> to respond to environmental change within the timescale of minutes [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] is supported by the coordinated regulation of nutrient intake and surface antigenicity, the general prioritization of available plant polymers over host mucus and the dynamic responses in expression of genes sustaining metabolic hierarchy of available resources on three levels: enzymatic, transport and regulatory [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

Phylogenetically distant mammalian species were shown to share similar mechanisms of network control of the same orthologous genes during physical inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], including humans as controls. The characteristics of inactive phenotype observed in 21-day PlanHab experiment in NBR and HBR variants corresponded surprisingly well to the hibernation characteristics of mammals during their general 28-day torpor cycle.

In contrast, other negative physiological characteristics of NBR and HBR matched those observed during seasonal overeating (hyperphagia) in the same mammals (e.g. increased bile acid content, adiposity).

However, interactive and dose dependent responses to extensive physical inactivity and overeating, previously not encountered in the human evolution, lead to progressively significant system deconditioning, physiologic, immune and psychologic comorbidities observed in primates in captivity and humans indulging in Western lifestyle over prolonged periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188556.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>A few limitations and concepts of this study need to be considered as well [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Firstly, the sample size in this study was relatively small, but well within the limits of recent detailed studies [<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188556.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Second, the limited statistical power and accompanying potential for type-II error was at least partly alleviated by the fact that the test participant population was prescreened for healthy young males according to SOP used by ESA/NASA and the study executed according to SOP for NASA bed rest studies. Nevertheless, a larger study sampling random population longitudinally as participants experience variations in intestinal transit times might be able to find additional and more significant effects. Third, the inclusion of female participants would definitely add a much needed layer of complexity. Four, many of the initially measured variables were found to be correlated and hence did not contribute to the partitioning of variability in microbial communities. Next, the use of 16S rRNA genes has limited capacity for linking the phylogenetic information with microbial physiology. For the scope of detecting more subtle changes in microbial community structure at the level of bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and also functional genes, the analyses adopting shot-gun metagenomics approaches would be even better suited. Moreover, novel draft genome sequences of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species reconstructed from sequenced metagenomes would help explore the genetic plasticity and pathogenicity potential of this genus. Last, measurements of additional variables and possibly at different scales, collected continuously and noninvasively could decrease the extent of unexplained variation. In this respect the developed approaches of full-scale metabolomic analyses of fecal content have the potential to increase the number of metabolites and provide means for chemical identification of novel compounds present in significantly different concentrations in intestinal tract.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Conclusisons</title><p>The results of our study show that cessation of exercise resulted in progressive decrease in defecation frequency and concomitant increase in IEC. The transition from healthy physiological state towards the developed symptoms of low magnitude obesity-related syndromes was dose dependent on the extent of time spent in inactivity and preceded or took place in absence of significant rearrangements in bacterial microbial community.

The inactivity-generated negative physiological and psychological symptoms diminished after reintroduction of exercise in NBR and HBR over 5 and 14 days, respectively, and may be related to the cyclic energy-conservation mechanisms evolutionary shared among mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188556.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of experimental outline used in PlanHab study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/104127_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/104127_en.html</ext-link>).</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> The parameters (hypoxia and exercise) and the resulting status of host physiology after 21 days in controlled experiment. <bold>(B)</bold> Human systems biology exploration space mapping exercise with oxygen saturation levels and human population diversity.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="pone.0188556.ref001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="pone.0188556.ref004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>
