The levels of anti-flagellin antibodies had decreased at w72 (0.35 vs 0.31 [OD]; p&#x0003c;0.0004), although significantly only in the LPV/r arm. I-FABP levels increased at w72 (2.26 ng/ml vs 3.13 ng/ml; p&#x0003c;0.0001), although significantly in EFV treated patients only.

However, HIV-1 persists in reservoirs like latently infected CD4+ T cells <xref rid="pone.0055038-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and in body compartments that have restricted permission for antiretroviral drugs. It is hypothesized that these reservoirs are refilled by the low grade viral replication seen in patients on suppressive ART who otherwise have undetectable viremia by routine assays <xref rid="pone.0055038-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Lindkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Translocation of bacterial products across a damaged gut-blood barrier has been proposed to be one important mechanism for the persistence of a chronic immune activation which is found also in well-treated patients <xref rid="pone.0055038-Troseid1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There is growing evidence that this immune activation may contribute to the low-grade viremia and e.g. cardiovascular and CNS complications <xref rid="pone.0055038-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Boccara1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Eden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Several markers are used to assess microbial translocation (MT) in patients with HIV or inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="pone.0055038-Lichtfuss1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, such as microbial products [lipopolysaccharide (LPS), plasma bacterial 16SrDNA, anti-flagellin antibodies] <xref rid="pone.0055038-Abdurahman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, markers of the systemic response to bacterial products (sCD14, LPS-binding protein), and of enterocyte damage [intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP)] <xref rid="pone.0055038-Pelsers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Sandler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. During successful ART, MT and systemic immune activation are usually reduced, but not normalized, suggesting that the damage of the gut-blood barrier is only partly restored <xref rid="pone.0055038-Troseid1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The reasons why this improvement varies between patients are not known.</p><p>The origin of low-level viremia in patients on suppressive ART has been disputed. Residual virus replication from anatomical compartments like the gut could be one of the explanations. Firstly, levels of HIV-1 DNA and RNA were substantially elevated in the gut compared with peripheral blood in patients on ART with &#x0003c;40 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, indicating that the gut may serve as a potential source of viremia during suppressive ART <xref rid="pone.0055038-Yukl1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, in a set of patients on long-term ART, levels of HIV DNA in sigmoid colon were positively correlated to plasma LPS levels <xref rid="pone.0055038-Chege1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting a connection between residual viremia and MT. In a cross-sectional study of patients with persistently undetectable HIV-1 RNA, a higher proportion of participants treated with nevirapine and efavirenz achieved &#x0003c;2.5 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml compared to lopinavir/r based ART <xref rid="pone.0055038-Bonora1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Given the link between MT and low-level viremia, we assumed that choice of ART could differently affect kinetics of MT markers.</p><p>In the present study, we analyzed the levels of LPS, sCD14, I-FABP, and anti-flagellin antibodies, at baseline (BL) and after 72 weeks (w72) of ART in a controlled randomized clinical trial in which the patients received either lopinavir/r +2 nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or efavirenz +2 NRTI. Additionally, we studied if ongoing antibiotics treatment had an impact on the explored parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>During 2004&#x02013;2007, 239 HIV-1 infected subjects received allocated intervention after written consent in a Scandinavian randomized clinical phase IV efficacy trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01445223).

The reliability of our results is strengthened by the fact that the patients were included in a randomized clinical trial and were followed closely before, during and after the study. Based on the randomization, we found that the effects on the selected MT parameters could partly differ depending on the type of ART and if antibiotics were given or not. We therefore suggest that other factors than HIV treatment in itself may be relevant for the kinetics of the biomarkers which should be considered when interpreting studies on MT in HIV-1 infected patients.</p><p>Data from our RCT cohort showed that the plasma levels of LPS were significantly reduced after 72 weeks of ART with similar pattern in patients treated with NNRTI or PI/r containing therapy. Similar observations on the decrease of plasma LPS after ART have been reported in some <xref rid="pone.0055038-Troseid1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Cassol1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, but not all studies <xref rid="pone.0055038-Wallet1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Merlini1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Although, estimating MT by measurement of plasma LPS levels is common, both LAL assay variability as well as patient cohort heterogeneity (e.g. diverse rate of opportunistic conditions or hepatitis co-infection) may lie behind the different results. E.g., in a recent work, the kinetics of MT markers (measured by LPS and sCD14 levels) differed according to the severity of pre-ART CD4+ T-cell count <xref rid="pone.0055038-Marchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The effect on sCD14 has also been disputed with studies showing decline <xref rid="pone.0055038-Wallet1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Rajasuriar1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or increase <xref rid="pone.0055038-Cassol1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Merlini1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> after initiation of ART. In our study, the sCD14 levels were reduced during ART with a unified pattern in the two treatment arms which is in line with a decreased MT during 72 weeks of ART. It has also been suggested that sCD14 independently predicts mortality in HIV-1 infected patients when adjusting for other key markers <xref rid="pone.0055038-Sandler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We found a strong inverse correlation between CD4+ T-cells and sCD14 as well as a direct correlation between sCD14 and VL <xref rid="pone.0055038-Marchetti2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These findings warrant the hypothesis that higher viral replication is associated with more profound inflammatory response (reflected by sCD14) and leads to lower CD4 T cell counts that also reflect poorer surveillance of gut microbes. The viscous circle of viral replication and inflammation is created and maintained by the &#x0201c;leaky gut&#x0201d; as suggested by Douek et al <xref rid="pone.0055038-Douek1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. One should acknowledge that the sCD14 levels are also elevated in other infections (RSV, Dengue Virus, Mycobacteria) and inflammatory conditions <xref rid="pone.0055038-Anas1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Ayaslioglu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, although analysis of sCD14 is important for the evaluation of MT in the setting of HIV-1 infected patients, it cannot be considered as a specific marker for MT alone.</p><p>Our untreated patients exhibited elevated plasma levels of I-FABP, as compared to historical healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0055038-Funaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which is in line with the suggestion that I-FABP can be applied as a marker of enterocyte damage and possibly of MT in HIV-1 infected patients <xref rid="pone.0055038-Funaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Actually, the levels were similar to those reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref rid="pone.0055038-Kanda1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, supporting the presence of a significant damage to the enterocytes in HIV-1 patients, at least in those who have a relatively advanced immunodeficiency. To our knowledge, no data on the effect of ART on I-FABP levels have earlier been published. Surprisingly, we found that the I-FABP levels increased in the whole cohort despite 72 weeks of efficient ART. A subgroup analysis revealed that the I-FABP increase occurred in the patients treated with EFV, but not in those with LPV/r. This difference between the two treatment arms could not be explained by any coexisting liver failure, gastrointestinal disease (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, gastroenteritis) or reported side effects such as diarrhea (data not shown). The finding was unexpected particularly in view of the reports claiming a lower level of the residual viremia in EFV-treated patients as compared to those on a PI/r regimen <xref rid="pone.0055038-Bonora1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Palmisano1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Nicastri1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although I-FABP has been firmly described as marker of enterocyte damage in other diseases <xref rid="pone.0055038-Derikx1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-WiercinskaDrapalo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we cannot exclude that the increased I-FABP concentrations in our patients might be related to other events such as drug toxicity or metabolic lipid changes. However, the available laboratory blood and lipid-profile data (baseline and follow up) from our patients did not support these relationships (data not shown). Another hypothesis could be based on that EFV may induce oxidative stress related cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0055038-Pilon1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-BlasGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Conversely, PIs are attributed the anti-apoptotic effect <xref rid="pone.0055038-Rizza1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Badley1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The CD4+ T-cell recovery did not differ significantly between treatment arms, but tended to be higher in LPV/r group. As such, the possibility of immune reconstitution in the gut as a cause of the increasing I-FABP levels in EFV group thus seems to be less likely. Further studies are required to determine if the difference reported by us is related to variation in apoptosis or enhanced turnover of intestinal epithelial cells and as a consequence shedding of I-FABP. In the light of our report, the use of I-FABP for evaluating MT in patients introduced to ART seems questionable, as the kinetics differed compared to the other markers of MT. Most likely the systemic I-FABP levels in patients on ART do not reflect only MT itself. Further studies that include also intestinal biopsies should address these questions.</p><p>The bacterial flagellin is known as a microbial compound with strong immune modulatory properties that has an essential role in conditions with intestinal damage, like IBD. Hence, flagellin is regarded as a dominant immune antigen in Croh&#x00144;s disease (CD) where the antibodies to bacterial flagellin (Anti-CBir1) are detected in about half of patients <xref rid="pone.0055038-Lodes1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recently we found elevated levels of flagellin-specific IgG in three cohorts of HIV-1 infected patients <xref rid="pone.0055038-Abdurahman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additionally, two years of ART reduced the levels of anti-flagellin IgG, although they were not normalized <xref rid="pone.0055038-Nowak1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the present study, we confirm and expand our previous observations. Thus, the baseline anti-flagellin levels were increased in all patients and decreased significantly after 72 weeks of ART. However, stratifying the cohort into the treatment arms showed that the significant decrease occurred in the LPV/r containing arm only. This effect was not due to the general polyclonal B-cells activation as the normalization of specific anti-flagellin antibodies to total IgG levels yielded similar results. Our hypothesis is therefore that the decline of the anti-flagellin antibodies was due to decrease of exposure for flagellin itself, as a consequence of restoration of the gut-blood barrier. We also claim that the positive correlation between anti-flagellin antibodies and LPS supports the credibility of anti-flagellin antibodies as a marker of MT, theoretically being more specific than e.g. sCD14, which is a polyclonal marker in nature <xref rid="pone.0055038-Lien1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The relevance of the observed difference between treatment arms is not clear. It is thus possible, that since both arms tended to decrease the levels of anti-flagellin antibodies, differences in time kinetics between the arms could possibly result in a faster decline in LPV/r group.</p><p>Antibiotic treatment leads to changes in the gut microbiota <xref rid="pone.0055038-Jakobsson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055038-Jernberg1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Also, plasma LPS levels are reduced in SIV infected macaques that are treated with &#x0201c;gut sterilizing&#x0201d; antibiotics <xref rid="pone.0055038-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, so far the impact of antibiotics has not been considered in studies on MT in HIV-1 infected patients. In our study, antibiotic treatment was found to influence the sCD14 levels. ANCOVA-analysis thus revealed that former use of antibiotics at baseline as well as ongoing antibiotic treatment lowered sCD14 levels at week 72 compared to non-antibiotic treated individuals. Additionally, the group using antibiotics at base-line had a larger decrease in sCD14 levels up to week 72. A higher reduction of sCD14 levels in antibiotic treated patients could be due to decreased LPS signaling as a consequence of altered gram-negative intestinal flora. The use of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in ART na&#x000ef;ve patients has been associated with a lower annual increase in HIV-1 RNA <xref rid="pone.0055038-Mermin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Antibiotics like minocycline decrease monocyte activation and can dampen the general inflammation as shown in SIV model <xref rid="pone.0055038-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Moreover, rifaximin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic with minimal systematic uptake, has recently been shown to affect endotoxinemia in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Thus, plasma LPS levels were significantly reduced after 8 weeks course of this antibiotic <xref rid="pone.0055038-Kalambokis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These findings together suggest that antibiotic treatment may influence levels of MT markers, potentially providing a bias in studies not compensating for the use.</p><p>Collectively, we found that markers of MT were reduced after 72 weeks of ART. EFV and LPV/r based ART, which had similar virological outcome, presented with somewhat different effects on the kinetics of MT markers. Thus, although the profiles of the established markers LPS and sCD14 were unified after 72 weeks of treatment, the levels of I-FABP increased and anti-flagellin antibodies were not significantly reduced, respectively, in the patients on EFV containing therapy. Our data underscore the importance of unraveling the multifaceted correlations between microbial translocation, immune activation, antibiotics usage, HIV-1 replication and the chosen ART.
