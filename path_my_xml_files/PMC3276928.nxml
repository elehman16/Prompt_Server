These include psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and medical disorders, including coronary heart diseases, hypertension and diabetes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Physiological studies have shown that stress from any source can influence the endocrine, hemopoietic and immune system. Cytokines and cortisol seem to play an important role in the communication of these systems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The stress response consists of activation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The activation of the SNS results in non specific physiological changes including release of catecholamines which increases heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac volume.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have been conducted to examine lipids and lipoproteins under different stressors. Some of those have shown increase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and others detected decrease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] of blood lipids and lipoproteins.</p><p>Studies on the effect of episodic stress such as final examinations on lipid concentration have been reviewed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Exam stress can also cause some physiological changes. Qureshi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] have found that exam stress in students alters certain blood cell parameters which includes neutrophils and platelets.</p><p>Higher levels of stress may have a negative impact on the students&#x02019; learning ability. Excessive stress may result in mental and physical problems and may cause negative academic, emotional or health outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>If a method to reduce exam stress as well as enhance coping ability and academic performance exists, students would perform better. Hobson and Delunas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] have performed a study to find out the efficacy of different techniques for reducing stress in business students. They have shown that relaxation therapies significantly reduce the stress level in students.</p><p>Mind body medicine (MBM) is an exciting field of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). MBM combines the characteristics of ancient traditional healing system with the modern biomedical model to create an integrated approach to health care. <italic>Sudarshan kriya</italic> and <italic>pranayam</italic> (SK and P) is a rhythmic breathing technique which emphasizes breathing in three different rhythms. SK and P is preceded by <italic>Ujjai Pranayam</italic> and <italic>Bhastrika</italic>. SK and P has been found to be useful for relieving depression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and improving antioxidant defenses in the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] EEG studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] revealed increased beta-activity during resting state (indicative of alertness) and increased alpha and beta-activity during the process of SK and P (indicative of relaxed alertness).</p><p>Although many stress reduction techniques are well known, there is lack of research about their usefulness in reducing exam stress in students which may help in better performance by the students.</p><p>Hence, the present study is aimed to find out the effect of SK and P in reducing exam stress in students by measuring the levels of lipid profile and blood cell parameters which are found to be altered during exam stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The subjects in this study included 43 undergraduate students (aged 18&#x02013;23 years, males- 20, females-23) from SRM Engineering College, SRM University. The students volunteered themselves after an orientation session in the campus. The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Ethical committee. The participants gave informed consent after the study design was fully explained.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had a medical disease, they currently suffer from any infections, allergies or inflammatory responses, and they had ever been taking major psychotropic medications, smokers or alcoholics. Also subjects were excluded if they had abnormal baseline blood tests (lipid profile and blood cell parameters).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The study included forty-three students and was randomized into two major groups.</p><p>Group I (<italic>n</italic>=21) : Control group</p><p>Group II (<italic>n</italic>=22) : Study group</p><p>The two groups were further subdivided as follows</p><p>Group Ia : Baseline (no exam) [BL]</p><p>Group Ib : Exam stress [ES]</p><p>Group Ic : Three weeks+exam stress</p><p>Group Id : Six weeks+exam stress</p><p>Group IIa : Baseline (no exam) [BL]</p><p>Group IIb : Exam stress [ES]</p><p>Group IIc : SK and P practice (three weeks)+exam stress</p><p>Group IId : SK and P practice (six weeks)+exam stress</p><p>There were three drop outs, two from control group and one from study group because of abnormal baseline parameters. The remaining 40 students (19 in control and 21 in study group) participated in the study.</p><p>Baseline data was measured few days after beginning of the second academic year. The students did not have any exams or any academic burden during baseline investigations. There was approximately two week time between baseline and exam stress. After collecting the baseline and exam stress blood samples, the students of study group participated in the yes plus course which is a six day course and students were asked to practice these exercises daily for six weeks. Follow up sessions were conducted every week. Blood was collected after three weeks and after six weeks from both the groups. Care was taken so that exams took place at the end of three and six weeks in order to study the true effect of SK and P practice on exam stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Description of intervention</title><p>Yes plus course of Art of Living Foundation is a one week course. The instructors in SK and P were trained by International Art of Living foundation. <italic>Sudarshan kriya</italic> is derived from the Yogic Sciences of Breath from Vedic texts.

</p><p><italic>Sudarshan kriya</italic> involves rhythmic breathing where three cycles of breath namely slow, medium and fast breath are followed cyclically. The entire <italic>kriya</italic> involves multiple rounds with each round having long, medium and short inhalation and exhalation with varying rhythms and intensities. The home SK and P instruction was given on the last day of the workshop. It starts with 20 long and slow in and out breaths, 40 medium length breaths and 40 short and fast ones. This 20-40-40 is done three times and lasts a total of 7-9 min. After practicing SK and P, the practitioners observed silence keeping his/her body immobile for 1 min and pay attention to their body and then finish with five long, slow so-hums after which the practitioners lies down in supine position for deep meditation for few minutes.</p><p>Meditations used in this are Guided Meditation and includes Panchakosha meditation and Space meditation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Methodology</title><p>Fasting blood sample (5 ml) was collected between 8.00 and 9.30 am by vein puncture.

Studies on yoga claim prolonged existence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and has therapeutic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] and rehabilitation effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Yoga includes breathing exercises, physical exercises (Asanas) and meditation. One such practice is <italic>Sudarshan kriya</italic> and <italic>Pranayam</italic> (SK and P) which includes asanas, meditation and special breathing technique.</p><p>Examination stress has been considered as a good model of naturally occurring psychological stress. It can be very potent stressors especially when the exam is perceived as important to the individual's future career objective. Excessive stress may result in mental and physical problems and may diminish a student's sense of worth and might affect his/her academic achievement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGL) and VLDL were found to be increased during exam stress. The elevated TC, TGL and VLDL were decreased after three and six weeks practice of SK and P. HDL and LDL were observed to be unaffected during exam stress. Dietary intervention affects lipid profile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In our study, even though the students had similar dietary habit and level of physical activity, students had significantly higher serum cholesterol, TGL and VLDL during ES which was decreased appreciably after SK and P practice.</p><p>These findings are consistent with previous reports on the effects of exam stress on plasma lipid concentration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] However, exam stress in engineering students has not been scientifically reported so far. This is the first study of its kind to document effect of yoga and exam stress on lipid profile and hematological parameters in engineering students. Since SRM University is a multi stream University this task was possible for our group.</p><p>Activation of sympathetic nervous system during psychological stress increases the production of serum lipids and lipoproteins by altering serum lipid metabolic processes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Catecholamines induce lipolysis and release free fatty acids into the circulation; free fatty acids in turn serve as substrate for the re synthesis of triglycerides and subsequently VLDL production by the liver.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>Another reason for the increase in serum lipids during stress was given by Patterson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] according to which psychological stress can cause acute intravascular hemoconcentration through a decrease in plasma volume, which leads to an increase in the concentration of blood cell, plasma proteins and circulating lipoproteins. Several studies have suggested that hemoconcentration accounts for rise in total and HDL cholesterol during experimental stressors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] However, certain studies have found that adjusting for hemoconcentration did not eliminate increase in lipid concentration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]</p><p>In our study after three weeks of practice of SK and P, there was a significant reduction in the level of TC, TGL and VLDL which were found to be elevated during exam stress. Further reduction in the levels was seen after six weeks of practice of SK and P. Better ability to overcome stress can be cited as a possible mechanism for improvement in lipid profile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>Recently Sayyed <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] have found significant improvement in lipid profile parameters after SK and P practice. The improvement in the lipid profile could be due to increased hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase in cellular level, which affects the metabolism of TGL by adipose tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p><p>In our study, certain hematological parameters like neutrophils, platelet counts, packed cell volume (PCV) and mean cell volume (MCV) were found to be increased and lymphocyte count was found to be decreased during exam stress in students. No significant changes were seen in hemoglobin, red blood cells and other parameters.</p><p>Our result is consistent with previous report of Qureshi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] indicating an increase in neutrophils, platelet count and decrease in lymphocytes. But they have reported that PCV and MCV remain unaltered during exam stress. Maes <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] studied the influence of academic examination stress on hematological measurements and found that exam stress significantly increased hematocrit, HB, MCV, MCH and MCHC.</p><p>It has been suggested that stress-induced pro inflammatory cytokine production may stimulate the proliferation of hematopoietic cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] Increase in neutrophils, platelets, PCV, MCV following stressor may be explained by hemoconcentration, which is caused by shifts of fluid from the intravascular to extra vascular spaces concentrating non diffusible blood constituents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>]</p><p>Jern <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] found that there was a significant increase of platelet during psychological arousal. The increase in platelet concentration during psychological arousal is also in accordance with what has been observed in response to other stressors i.e. physical exercises, adrenaline infusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] The mobilization of platelets is probably the effect of an instant alpha adrenergically mediated release of platelets from the exchangeable splenic platelet pool.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] This platelet activation may be a mechanism linking psychosocial stress with increased coronary risk, and may also play a role in the emotional triggering of acute coronary syndromes in patients with advanced coronary disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>]</p><p>After practicing SK and P for three weeks, the level of neutrophils and platelets were decreased significantly. Further reduction in the level was seen after six weeks of practice. SK and P were not found to have any effect on PCV and MCV. Lymphocyte count was increased after SK and P practice indicating that practice of SK and P improves immunity. Previous reports suggest that total T cells and its T helper subsets were significantly higher in SK and P practitioners.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] Practice of SK and P cause relaxation response. This relaxation might have stopped the alpha adrenergically mediated platelet release.</p><p>However, further extensive and long-term studies are required to prove these findings and understand the basic mechanisms involved. Thus, practice of SK and P seems to be beneficial on lipid profile and hematological parameters during ES in engineering students.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
