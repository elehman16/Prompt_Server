exercise and plyometric exercise on female volleyball players. [Subjects and Methods]
Subjects were randomly allocated to two exercise groups (whole-body vibration exercise
group and plyometric exercise group). The exercise was conducted three times each week for
8 weeks. Isokinetic muscular strength, jumping performance, and balance were measured
before starting the exercise and after finishing the 8 weeks of exercise. [Results]
Measurements of isokinetic muscular strength revealed that the whole-body vibration
exercise group showed significant increase after the exercise. However, the plyometric
exercise group had no significant increase in lumbar flexion, extension, and knee flexion.
Measurements of vertical jumping revealed that, the whole-body vibration exercise group
had no significant increase after the exercise. However, the plyometric exercise group
showed significant increase. Measurements of balance revealed that, the whole-body
vibration exercise group showed significant increase. However, the plyometric exercise
group showed no significant increase. [Conclusion] Although both whole-body vibration and
plyometric exercises are effective intervention methods, the two methods have different
effects on the improvement of isokinetic muscular strength, jumping performance, and
balance of female volleyball players.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Female volleyball</kwd><kwd>Whole-body vibration</kwd><kwd>Plyometric exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Volleyball is recognized as one of the most popular sports in the world amongst men and
women. It is an increasingly popular team sport<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, volleyball has witnessed remarkable technical
progress, particularly in women&#x02019;s volleyball, with faster performance and evolving
techniques accompanied by changes in the type<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most sports require various kinds of high and low muscle strength with fast or slow speed.
Plyometric training is widely used as a method to develop explosive power capacity in sports
that require jumping ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plyometric
training is a type of muscle strength exercise that can improve basic physical strength. It
has been extensively studied for its ability of improving exercise performance. It uses
muscles&#x02019; stretch reflexes and stretch-shortening cycles to develop lower extremity
muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, plyometric training
has been used a typical intervention method to enhance muscular function, and power<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it might cause musculoskeletal
injuries at landing phase<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, various kinds of training methods have been implemented in order to improve the
muscular power of sports players. Roelants et al. have reported that whole-body vibration
exercise is an effective method for improving muscular strength instead of resistance
movements. In addition, it is a safe and effective exercise method for improving muscle
strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whole-body vibration exercise
provides an external stimulus for improving muscular strength, power, and performance in
sports players<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trovinen et al. have
reported that whole-body vibration exercise offers a good chance of improving the jumping
ability and the muscle strength of lower limbs in 56 healthy adults<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is expected that whole-body vibration
exercise can enhance exercise capacity not only in athletes but also in the general
population.</p><p>However, previous studies have not yet applied whole-body vibration exercises in female
volleyball players. Therefore, in the present study, female volleyball players were divided
into two groups: the whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) group and the plyometric exercise
(PME) group. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the two exercises on
isokinetic muscular strength, jumping performance, and balance ability of female volleyball
players.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted among players who were registered and who played for female
professional teams that belonged to the Korea Female Volleyball Federation. Study subjects
were selected from those who had no orthopedic disease as disease could make it difficult
for them to participate in regular games or training for regular games, and those who
sufficiently understood the purpose and intent of this study. This study complied with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects agreed to participate in the
study after receiving explanations regarding its purpose and procedures. They all signed an
informed consent statement before participation. The study protocol was approved by the
local ethics committee of Yongin University (2-1040966-AB-N-01-20-1603-HSR-046).</p><p>Thirty subjects were initially selected and randomly divided into the whole-body vibration
exercise group (WBVE group) or the plyometric exercise group (PME group). A total of 30

measured using a Humac (CSMI, USA). Subjects were instructed to perform flexion and
extension exercises. Each subject practiced the exercises three times and took rest for
three minutes before the measurement. Jumping performance was measured using digital jump
meters (Takei, Japan). The vertical jump height with simultaneous explosive power in both
legs was measured in units of 0.1&#x02005;cm using measuring sensors. Jumping was performed a total
of three times. The most excellent value was used as the measured value. Romberg&#x02019;s test was
conducted to examine balance ability. Each subject was instructed to stand with the hip
joint and knee joint flexed to 90&#x000b0; with eyes closed and both hands placed on the waist. The
measurement was conducted three times repeatedly. The average value was used as the measured
value.</p><p>For data processing, SPSS 20.0 version for Windows software was used. Descriptive
statistics were processed using the general characteristics of the subjects. Analysis of

to perform exercise or play games<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Plyometric exercise has been a typical intervention method for enhancing the muscle
power<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, plyometric training
requires careful attention because it requires high level of physical strength. It involves
high intensity exercises. Therefore, it is associated with high risk of injuries<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whole-body vibration exercise is a stable
exercise method as it reduces physical stimulation while mechanical stimuli are applied to
the muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present
study examined the effect of whole-body vibration exercise versus plyometric exercise on
female volleyball players.</p><p>With respect to the measurement of isokinetic muscular strength, the WBVE group showed
significant increase in lumbar flexion and extension, and knee flexion and extension
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Rees et al. have reported that vibration training is effective in improving the
muscle strength of lower extremities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Kim et al. have also reported that vibration exercises can stimulate the muscle spindles to
recruit more motor units, thereby exerting greater power<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study also found that whole-body vibration activated
proprioceptor (muscle spindle) and positively affected muscle strength ability.</p><p>In contrast, the PME group only had significant increase in knee extension (p&#x0003c;0.05), but
not in lumbar flexion and extension, or knee flexion (p&#x0003e;0.05). Plyometric exercises are
considered to have positive effects on the muscular strength of the extensor muscles of the
lower limb rather than on the flexor muscles. Vertical jump was increased in the PME group
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The strengthening of the extensor muscles of the lower limb is considered to
have positive effect on jumping ability. Park has reported that plyometric exercises can
improve jumping ability through instantaneous exertion of elastic energy and stretch reflex
of the lower limb with increased muscular strength<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason for this occurrence might be due to the fact that
plyometric exercise can increase the jumping performance.</p><p>The scores of Romberg&#x02019;s test were significantly increased in the WBVE group (p&#x0003c;0.05).
Courtine et al. have reported that vibration exercise can improve the proprioceptive
function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception maintains
the stability and orientation of the body during static and dynamic movements<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, whole-body vibration in this
study appears to have stimulated the proprioceptors, resulting in a positive effect on
balance. However, the PME group showed no significant increase in the scores of Romberg&#x02019;s
test (p&#x0003e;0.05), indicating that plyometric exercise alone does not have a positive effect
on balance ability.</p><p>In the present study, the whole-body vibration exercise had positive effects on isokinetic
muscular strength, and balance ability. However, it did not have positive effect on jumping
performance. In contrast, the plyometric exercise had positive effects on jumping
performance. However, it did not have positive effect on balance. Therefore, we conclude
that, although both whole-body vibration exercise and plyometric exercise are effective
interventions for female volleyball players, there is a difference in improvement of
isokinetic muscular strength, jumping performance, and balance between the two types of
exercise.</p><p>This study included a limited number of subjects. Therefore, future studies should be
performed using a larger number of subjects. Nevertheless, our study demonstrated the
importance of whole-body vibration exercise and plyometric exercise in female volleyball
players. We hope that diverse training methods will be used to train female volleyball
players based on the findings of this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>LP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>VG</given-names></name><name><surname>Beckman</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Injury risk management plan for volleyball
