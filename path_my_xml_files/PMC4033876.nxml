Oxidative stress occurs when the pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance shifts in favor of the former, leading to potential damage.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is now understood that while the primary etiological agent for periodontitis is predominantly gram-negative anaerobic or facultative bacteria within the subgingival biofilm which initiate the destruction, the majority of the periodontal tissue damage is caused by an inappropriate host response to these microorganisms and their products.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Bacteria and their products stimulate accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes at the gingival site and subsequently the release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] ROS include molecules like hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, and ozone, and their excessive production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes is one of the pathologic features in the periodontal lesion.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Numerous studies have shown that an excess of ROS and depletion of antioxidant levels in the gingival crevicular fluid are responsible for the chronic local activation of periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] ROS can cause periodontal tissue destruction by oxidizing DNA, proteins, lipids, and important enzymes such as antiproteases, stimulating proinflammatory cytokines&#x02019; release through depletion of intracellular thiol compounds, and activating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>With the progression of periodontitis, ROS produced in the periodontal lesion may diffuse into the blood stream and cause systemic oxidative stress. Numerous studies have suggested a positive association between periodontitis and blood ROS levels.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is also known that oxidative stress makes a significant contribution to a variety of human diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, alcoholism, and many more.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] So, it is hypothesized that periodontitis-induced increased levels of circulating ROS could be detrimental to systemic health, in which case, periodontal treatment should be effective in maintaining systemic health by decreasing ROS.</p><p>Recently, reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) were recognized as a useful measure of ROS.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This analysis measures the whole oxidant capacity of blood against <italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-para-phenylenediamine in acidic buffer. The main components of ROM are hydroperoxides, which are intermediate oxidative products of lipids, peptides, and amino acids. Despite the fair oxidant power, hydroperoxides in the plasma are relatively stable compared to their parent free radicals; therefore, their levels can be detected. This test is based on the reaction of plasma samples with transition metal ions to form alkoxy and peroxy radicals. Recently, Tamaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and D&#x02018;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their study have shown that in patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), non-surgical periodontal therapy was effective in reducing plasma ROMs. However, the effect of surgical periodontal therapy on plasma ROMs has not yet been explored. Systematic review has shown that surgical debridement is a more effective method for the treatment of moderate to severe CP in terms of attachment level gain and reduction in gingival inflammation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, it would be interesting to compare the effects of surgical to non-surgical periodontal treatment with respect to plasma ROM levels.</p><p>Since there is limited literature on the effect of treatment on the blood ROM levels, this study was conducted with an objective to compare the ROM levels between patients with CP and controls, and to investigate the effects of non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment on the plasma ROM levels in patients with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>A sample size of 15 per group was required for the detection of a significant difference in clinical parameters (80% power; two-sided 5% significance level).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Subject recruitment</title><p>Forty-five subjects from the Out-patient Department of Bapuji Dental College and Hospital, Davangere were enrolled for this randomized, longitudinal, and interventional study, and monitored over a period of 2 months. Subjects included 15 periodontally healthy controls (Group I: 7 men and 8 women aged 26-49 years; mean age: 32.8 &#x000b1; 6.38 years) and 30 CP patients. The CP patients were further randomly and equally divided into two groups &#x02013; Group II (nine men and six women aged 25-47 years; mean age: 35.6 &#x000b1; 5.79 years) and Group III (eight men and seven women aged 25-48 years; mean age: 35.8 &#x000b1; 7.08 years). The control group was composed of individuals who presented with good oral hygiene, no evidence of interproximal attachment loss, probing depth &#x02264;3 mm at all sites on all teeth, and no gingival swelling, redness, bleeding on probing (BOP), or tooth mobility.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The patients with periodontal problems had been diagnosed with moderate to severe chronic generalized periodontitis based on the clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop for Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It was ensured that they had teeth with 30% periodontal bone loss and &#x02265;4-mm-deep periodontal pockets.

All subjects lived in the same geographic area (Davangere city, India) and were of a middle-class socioeconomic status and had similar traditional nutrition habits. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Bapuji Dental College and Hospital, and a written informed consent was obtained from all the selected patients prior to commencement of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Periodontal treatment</title><p>At baseline, the clinical parameters were recorded for all subjects and the plasma samples were collected for assessment of ROM levels. No treatment was done after sample collection in Group I patients. In Group II patients, sample collection was followed by non-surgical periodontal treatment. This included oral hygiene instructions and scaling and root planing (SRP). The treatment consisted of an average of four 45-min sessions over 3 weeks. The SRP was performed with manual and ultrasonic instrumentation. Clinical data and plasma samples were re-evaluated at 1 and 2 months after therapy to assess the changes. In Group III patients, after the sample collection at baseline, the subjects were appointed for surgical pocket therapy. At first, oral hygiene instructions were given and SRP was done similar to that performed for Group II patients. The patients were re-evaluated at 4 weeks and periodontal flap surgery was performed in areas of persisting pocket depth. At follow-up visits of 1 and 2 months postoperatively, the clinical data and plasma samples were re-evaluated to assess the changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Clinical measurements</title><p>Clinical parameters assessed were gingival index (GI),[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] plaque index (PI),[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] sulcus bleeding index (SBI),[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL).

The plasma ROM levels measured at baseline were significantly higher in patients with CP (Group II and Group III) as compared to controls. As plasma ROM is considered to be a reliable indicator of ROS in blood,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] its increase in an otherwise healthy CP patient indicates that periodontal disease can increase the ROS levels in blood. Thus, our study establishes that there exists a positive association between periodontitis and blood ROS levels and reiterates that ROS produced in the periodontal lesion may spread to the blood stream. Previous studies performed by Akalin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Baltacioglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Tamaki <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Wei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have shown similar results.</p><p>In patients with periodontitis (Group II and Group III), the plasma ROM level was positively correlated with PD, CAL, and SBI at baseline. Increased PD and CAL are pathognomonic for periodontitis, excellent indicators of past destruction of the periodontal attachment apparatus, and can also be used to monitor the progression of periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Bleeding is one of the earliest signs of gingival inflammation and indicates active nature of the disease.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, we found that in periodontitis patients, the plasma level of ROM increased with an increase in periodontal breakdown, as reflected by PD and CAL,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the present disease activity, as mirrored by SBI. Tamaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported positive correlation of plasma ROM levels with PD, CAL, and the percentage of sites with BOP, but not with plaque level.</p><p>In our study, the CP patients were randomly assigned to either non-surgical periodontal therapy (Group II) or surgical periodontal therapy (Group III) and the therapeutic effects were assessed 1 and 2 months after treatment. In both groups, plasma ROM levels decreased significantly following periodontal therapy. Since periodontal therapy is known to decrease periodontal inflammation, it can be safely assumed that resolution of periodontal inflammation by periodontal treatment decreases plasma ROS levels and, thereby, reduces oxidative stress.</p><p>In Group II patients, non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in reduction of mean plasma ROM level at 1 and 2 months after therapy. Similar results were shown after 1 month by D&#x02019;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and after 1 and 2 months by Tamaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] But Tamaki <italic>et al</italic>. observed that 2 months post non-surgical periodontal therapy, the plasma ROM levels were similar to those found in control subjects. In our study, although there was a significant decrease in ROM levels after 2 months, the levels did not match those of the controls. Thus, it is plausible that non-surgical periodontal treatment alone was not adequate in completely reducing the periodontal inflammation and, thereby, the oxidative stress. This may be attributed to the persistence of pocket depth following SRP alone and the inability of the patients to maintain these areas, leading to incomplete resolution of periodontal inflammation and disease activity.</p><p>In Group III patients, non-surgical periodontal treatment was followed by surgical pocket therapy in areas of persisting pocket depth. The primary purpose of raising a periodontal flap is for the operator to get better accessibility and visibility, which further allows for a more thorough root surface debridement. Our results show that surgical periodontal therapy was able to reduce the clinical parameters more effectively than when only non-surgical periodontal treatment was done, indicating that in moderate to advanced CP patients, surgical periodontal treatment leads to better treatment end point. Interestingly, the plasma ROM levels after 2 months of surgical periodontal therapy matched those found in control subjects. Also, Group III showed statistically significant decrease in plasma ROM levels when compared to Group II both after 1 and 2 months. Therefore, it is reasonable to contemplate that surgical periodontal treatment was more efficient in decreasing the periodontal inflammation, and by doing so, it reduces the blood ROS levels more successfully. It is also expected that surgical periodontal therapy, by decreasing the periodontal oxidative stress, will be more effective in preventing ROS-mediated future tissue destruction.</p><p>Therefore, this study provides ample evidence that periodontitis, a common potential source of low-grade inflammation, can lead to a systemic oxidative stress state. The excessive circulating ROS thus produced can oxidize DNA, lipids, and proteins, thereby contributing to tissue damage. Animal studies have already revealed that periodontal inflammation induces oxidative tissue damage in the aorta and liver with increasing serum ROS.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] These results may well be extrapolated to humans, and so, it can be said that periodontitis-induced high oxidative stress can possibly lead to a similar tissue damage. That being said, it is conceivable that the reduction of circulating ROS by periodontal treatment offers clinical benefits in terms of reducing the risk for future systemic disease.</p><p>During the experimental period, changes in plasma ROM level associated with generic factors such as hygiene, diet, or exercise were assumed to be comparable between the treatment and control groups, which was a limitation of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To conclude, our study shows that CP patients showed higher levels of plasma ROM than periodontally healthy controls, and there exists a positive correlation between plasma ROM and clinical parameters at baseline like PD, CAL, and SBI. Also, surgical periodontal therapy was more effective in reducing the periodontal inflammation than non-surgical periodontal treatment alone and, thus, may offer additional benefits in the reduction of systemic oxidative stress. Further longitudinal studies of larger stratified populations will be required to validate the impact of periodontal disease and treatment on systemic oxidative stress.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
