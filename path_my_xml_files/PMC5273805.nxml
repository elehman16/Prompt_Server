Here, we report long-term safety and efficacy results of the 3-year follow-up to the phase 2 study extension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The 6-month core study was completed by 147 patients, of whom 143 entered the extension and took at least one dose of fingolimod. Those originally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) or 0.5&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27). During the extension, the patients taking fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;46) were switched to open-label fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg, and those originally randomized to fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) continued with open-label fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Continuous fingolimod treatment was associated with a sustained low level of MRI and relapse activity for the duration of the extension phase; 75&#x02013;100% (range across all assessment time points up to end of study) of patients remained free of Gd-enhanced T1 lesions, 88&#x02013;100% remained free of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions, and 45&#x02013;62% remained relapse-free. In patients who switched to the active treatment, a 79.5% decrease in annualized relapse rate (ARR; from 1.131 before switch to 0.232 6-months after switch) was observed in the first 6&#x000a0;months of the extension phase and thereafter remained low until the end of study (0.16&#x02013;0.31 across all assessment time points after switch up to end of study). The mean number of Gd-enhanced T1 and new/newly enlarged T2 lesions decreased up to month 9 and thereafter remained low until the end of study (0.0&#x02013;0.1 and 0.0&#x02013;0.3, respectively, across all assessment time points after switch up to end of study). Fingolimod was generally well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with the core and 6-month extension. Serious adverse events were reported in 13.3% of patients during the extension study, with the range in the continuous fingolimod and placebo-fingolimod switch groups (3.7&#x02013;21.7%) being similar to that reported in the core study for the placebo and fingolimod groups (5.3&#x02013;20.4%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Continuous fingolimod treatment over 36&#x000a0;months was associated with maintained efficacy and a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals.

Currently, it is estimated that fingolimod has been used to treat approximately 155,000 patients in both clinical trials and post-marketing settings, with a total exposure of approximately 343,000 patient-years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the phase 2 and 3 trials, conducted in predominantly Caucasian populations, fingolimod treatment led to a significant reduction in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of disease activity compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or interferon (IFN) beta-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Similarly, a 6-month, phase 2, randomized controlled trial in Japanese patients with relapsing MS (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00537082) demonstrated that fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25&#x000a0;mg significantly reduced relapse rates and MRI disease activity compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the 6-month observational extension of this study, continuous fingolimod treatment for up to 12&#x000a0;months was associated with maintained or improved efficacy and a manageable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The extension was continued until fingolimod received marketing authorization in Japan (28 November 2011). Here, we report long-term safety and efficacy results of the 3-year follow-up to the phase 2 extension study of fingolimod in Japanese patients with relapsing MS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>This was an extension of a 6-month, randomized, double-blind study comparing fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25&#x000a0;mg with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], conducted at 43 centers in Japan between 2008 and 2012. The study design, inclusion criteria and patient population have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients diagnosed with relapsing MS according to the McDonald criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were eligible to enter the study, and were randomized to fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25&#x000a0;mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions of at least three vertebral segments (a marker of neuromyelitis optica [NMO]) detected by MRI at screening were excluded. Those who completed the 6-month core study had an option to enter the extension study. In the extension phase, patients originally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to dose-blind fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25&#x000a0;mg, and patients already treated with fingolimod continued on the same dose. Subsequent review of safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] revealed a more favorable benefit-risk profile using fingolimod 0.5 than 1.25&#x000a0;mg. Consequently, all patients treated with fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg were switched to this lower dose by 22 February 2010, and the study adopted an open-label design until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Efficacy and safety endpoints</title><p>Although no primary efficacy analysis was undertaken owing to the nature of the extension study, several efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed. MRI measures, including the number of lesions (both Gd-enhanced T1 and new or newly enlarged T2) by visit and treatment, and the proportion of patients free from these lesions were assessed at screening and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36. ARR and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measurements were conducted every 3&#x000a0;months from month 6 onwards. Relapse activity (proportions of patients without relapses, time to the first confirmed relapse and ARR) was determined up to the end of the study. ARR was calculated using the total number of relapses experienced during a specific period of time adjusted to a 1-year period. Confirmed relapse was defined as new, worsening, or recurrent neurological symptoms that occurred at least 30&#x000a0;days after the onset of a preceding relapse, lasted at least 24&#x000a0;h without fever or infection and were accompanied by an increase of at least half a point on the EDSS or an increase of at least one point in two functional systems scores or of at least two points in one functional system score (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function and cognition). Confirmed disability was measured using the EDSS score; 3-month and 6-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 3-month and 6-month sustained increase from core baseline in the EDSS score, respectively, with progression defined as a 1-point increase from baseline in patients with a baseline EDSS score of 0&#x02013;5.0, or a 0.5-point increase in patients with a baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were summarized by patient group, and pregnancy outcomes were tracked. Regular monitoring of laboratory values and assessments of vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical condition and body weight were undertaken during patient visits. Additional safety assessments as specified per protocol included dermatological examinations, ophthalmic examinations, chest radiography and pulmonary function tests. Anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody test results were collected retrospectively from medical records of patients who consented to provide the data during the extension study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All patients who were randomized in the 6-month core study and received at least one dose of study drug were analyzed as the core full analysis set (FAS) in the extension study. Efficacy analyses were performed on the core FAS; all analyses were based on descriptive statistics and no inferential analysis was performed. ARR was calculated by treatment group in the core FAS. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first confirmed relapse from core baseline to end of study estimated the proportion of relapse-free patients at each time point. Data for patients with no confirmed relapse during this time and for those who dropped out or otherwise stopped treatment before a confirmed relapse occurred were all censored (i.e. the time to first onset of the confirmed relapse for these patients was set as the time in study from month 0 to the end of the study). No data imputation for drop-outs or missing values was used in this analysis.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed on the extension safety set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug in the extension period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient characteristics and fingolimod exposure</title><p>Of 147 patients who completed the core study, 143 entered the extension study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups (placebo-fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg; placebo-fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg; fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg, fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); approximately two-thirds (67.8%) of patients were female and the mean age was 35.1&#x000a0;years. The extension study was completed by 107 (74.8%) patients and 36 (25.2%) discontinued treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). AEs were the most common reason for treatment discontinuation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, [14.7%]), followed by protocol deviations (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4, [2.8%]), withdrawal of consent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, [2.1%]), administrative problems (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, [2.1%]), unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, [2.1%]) and abnormal laboratory values (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, [1.4%]). In patients who received fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25&#x000a0;mg during the core study, and continued with treatment during the extension, the median duration of fingolimod exposure was 1180 and 1070&#x000a0;days, respectively.

Absolute neutrophil and white blood cell (WBC) counts were reduced to a similar extent in the continuous and switch groups at study end, however no patient group had a neutrophil count&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L at any stage in the study and all patient groups had WBC counts that were either normal or between 1.5&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Change in mean lymphocyte count during the core and extension study (extension safety population). <italic>EoS</italic> (end of study): in this instance is the last non-missing value up to 2&#x000a0;days after the last dose date and is summarized as last assessment on study drug.

</p><p>Throughout the core and extension study, no skin malignancy was detected on dermatological examination. Neoplasms were reported in 11 patients (7.7%). Breast cancer and central nervous system lymphoma were each reported in one patient on continuous fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg. All other cases were reported as benign skin neoplasms (skin papilloma, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6; melanocytic naevus, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2; anogenital warts, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).</p><p>No deaths occurred during the extension study for up to 3&#x000a0;months after study drug discontinuation. A 42-year-old man died approximately 1&#x000a0;year after study drug discontinuation (9&#x000a0;months on fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg); cause of death was Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the brain, skin, lungs, kidneys and thyroid gland; no MS pathology was detected in this case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A second case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was reported in a 38-year old woman who received continuous fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg treatment, with a suspected relationship to the study drug medication (onset 1250&#x000a0;days on fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg). First symptoms of malignant lymphoma, identified retrospectively, were reported on 22 September 2011, 1155&#x000a0;days after the start of study medication. Following a computerized tomography scan of the head, which revealed aggravation of hydrocephalus, the patient was withdrawn from the study and the study drug medication was stopped (26 December 2011; 1250&#x000a0;days after the start of study medication). Following draining for hydrocephalus, B-cell lymphoma was confirmed on biopsy analysis (12 January 2012), and chemotherapy was started. Subsequently, multiple lesions previously observed on contrast-enhanced head MRI scan, and sites of aggregation in locations such as the right iliac bone, disappeared and the patient was discharged. During the extension, four patients receiving fingolimod (1.25&#x000a0;mg, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3; 0.5&#x000a0;mg, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) became pregnant and therefore treatment was discontinued immediately. Two of these patients chose to terminate their pregnancies, while the remaining two patients gave birth to infants who were considered healthy. One patient receiving placebo terminated pregnancy during the core study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this 3-year extension of the original 6-month core study in Japanese patients with MS, fingolimod sustained low levels of disease activity and no new safety signals were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These results are important given that genetic, metabolic, lifestyle, incidence and clinical presentation differences exist between Japanese patients with MS and individuals with MS in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The current study was designed to exclude patients with NMO on the basis of spinal MRI criteria at screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although anti-AQP4-antibody status (a more specific marker for NMO) was not used, hence it is possible that not all cases of NMO were excluded. Notably, results in a small number of patients tested retrospectively for anti-AQP4 antibodies suggested a lack of benefit of fingolimod treatment in patients who tested positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the overall efficacy and safety findings of fingolimod treatment in this population of Japanese patients with MS were similar to those seen in predominantly Caucasian populations in the original phase 3 pivotal studies and their extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>A low level of disease activity, based on all efficacy endpoints (ARR, EDSS and MRI outcomes) observed at the end of the core study were sustained until the end of the extension study in patients treated with continuous fingolimod. Reduced MRI and relapse activity were observed within the first 6&#x000a0;months in patients who switched to fingolimod at the start of the extension study, and this was sustained until the end of the study. These findings are similar to those from the 6-month extension study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], in which continuous fingolimod therapy for 12&#x000a0;months was associated with sustained reductions in relapse rates and MRI lesion activity compared with those in the core study. The current results suggest that continuous treatment with fingolimod provides long-term benefit to the patient.</p><p>Fingolimod was generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with results from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including those reported in the core and 6-month extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This was reflected in the high patient retention rate (74.8%) at the end of the 3-year study extension. The incidences of infections and cardiac AEs were low. A case of possible macular edema was unconfirmed and resolved without treatment. A single case of EBV-positive B-cell lymphoma was reported in this extension. One patient died approximately 1&#x000a0;year after study drug discontinuation (0.5&#x000a0;mg fingolimod) due to EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma but without any MS pathology, suggesting the existence of brain lymphoma before commencing fingolimod medication. Overall, the incidence of malignancy was low and similar to that in other fingolimod studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Expected elevations in liver function test enzymes and lymphopenia occurred shortly after initiation of fingolimod therapy, and levels remained stable for the duration of the extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There was a single case of NMO relapse reported as a SAE during months 7&#x02013;12 of the extension in one of four AQP4 antibody-positive patients who experienced relapses during the entire study; this case has been discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. NMO exacerbation has been reported in patients treated with MS disease-modifying therapies who were subsequently found to be anti-AQP4 antibody-positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and in whom the initial diagnosis of MS was changed to NMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As the nature of relapses in all anti-AQP4-positive patients seen after commencing fingolimod appeared to be similar to previous relapses, it is conceivable that fingolimod did not alter but rather enhanced disease activity through an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the small sample size, a consequence of the recruitment challenge associated with the low incidence of MS in Japan, a drawback of this extension study that limits conclusions regarding efficacy is the lack of a placebo-control group, and the reduction in comparator groups following the need for all patients receiving fingolimod 1.25&#x000a0;mg to switch to fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg. Nevertheless, continuous fingolimod treatment over 36&#x000a0;months was associated with maintained efficacy and a manageable safety profile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that there is a long-term benefit associated with treating Japanese patients with relapsing MS continuously with fingolimod.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional file</title><p>
