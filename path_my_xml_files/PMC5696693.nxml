The mortality of patients with sepsis is about 18%&#x02013;50% because of multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct actively rational anti-infective therapies to patients with sepsis in clinic (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In clinic, the inflammatory indexes, including the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, are usually adopted to evaluate the conditions of patients with sepsis which however, lack specificity of the early-stage diagnosis since the specificity and sensitivity of these indexes are not high (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a kind of calcitonin propeptide matter without the activity of hormone which can react to the severity of bacterial infection and its control status. As a result, the specificity and sensitivity of PCT are better than that of traditional clinical inflammatory indexes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For patients with lower respiratory infection, when the serum PCT is over 0.25&#x003bc;g/L, the bacterial infection exists (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

The early diagnosis and the antibiotic drug therapy for patients with sepsis are very important to help patients obtain the good prognosis. However, the inappropriate antibiotic therapy can often result in drug-resistance bacteria, aggravating the disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Currently, the clinical indexes, including the body temperature, etiology and blood routine, are examined to evaluate the infection conditions of patients. However, because of the long inspection time and low sensitivity and specificity of these indexes, it is necessary to adopt the index that has higher sensitivity and specificity to guide the usage of the antibiotics to patients in clinic to reduce relevant adverse reactions due to the inappropriate usage of the antibiotic (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>PCT is a new-type inflammatory index, a kind of calcitonin propeptide matter without the activity of hormone and a sepsis-induced protein. Physically, PCT is produced by Thyroid C cell, which almost cannot be detected in the serum of healthy people. However, if patients are infected by the bacteria, PCT level in the blood will be increased because PCT mainly comes from other organs except the thyroid and the bacteria factors or endotoxin can suppress the decomposition course of PCT, which is then released into the blood (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, this paper investigated the guiding effect of serum PCT on the antibiotic application to patients with sepsis to provide a reference for later clinical treatment.</p><p>Currently, the biological functions of PCT are not completely and clearly identified in clinic. Usually, PCT is known as a kind of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory matter, which plays an important role in regulating the cytokine network. PCT level will be increased rapidly after being induced. After the infection, PCT level in the serum is increased in a short time which usually can be increased within 2&#x02013;6 hours after the infection and reach to the peak value 12 hours after the infection. PCT has a good stability, which will not be affected by the environment in vitro and vivo, such as the temperature. It is also not easy to degrade and has a 24-hour half-life period. In addition, by comparing with other inflammatory mediums, the testing methods of PCT level in clinic are reliable and simple and consume less time (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). When patients were infected by the bacterial, the serum PCT level was increased significantly. However, when patients were infected by the virus or even serious virus, the serum PCT level changed or increased slightly.</p><p>The results of this paper showed that the difference of APACHE-IIscores and CRP and WBC levels had no statistical significance. The antibiotic usage time of patients in the observation group was (7.74&#x000b1;0.61) d which was (10.22&#x000b1;0.78) d shorter than that of patients in the control group. The difference had statistical significance (<italic>P=</italic>0.009). ICU stay time and hospital stays of patients in the observation group were shorter than that of patients in the control group. The difference had statistical significance. The difference in 30 day-recurrence rate and 30 day-mortality of the patients between the two groups had no statistical significance (<italic>P=</italic>0.063). The results show that the serum PCT can guide clinical physicians to evaluate the infection conditions of patients with sepsis and guide the antibiotic usage to avoid the antibiotics abuse, standardize the antibiotics use, shorten the usage time of the antibiotics, improve the conditions of patients and shorten the recovery time. However, the nutriture conditions of severe patients or old patients with sepsis are not good in the clinical study, the patients have low reactivity to the stimulation and the serum PCT level is not high. As a result, it is necessary to combine the guiding function of PCT with the clinical evaluation and the comprehensive assessments, including signs, symptoms and auxiliary examinations of patients, to decide the application of the antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The guiding effects of the serum PCT on the application of antibiotics to patients with sepsis can shorten the usage time of the antibiotics, ICU stay time and hospital stays, which will not affect the prognosis of patients and can be further applied in
