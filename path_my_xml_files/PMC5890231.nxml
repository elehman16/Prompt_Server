on the physical performance of severely burned patients. [Subjects and Methods] Forty
patients suffering from severe burn (total body surface area more than 30%) were recruited
from several outpatient clinics in Greater Cairo. Their ages ranged between 20 to 40&#x02005;years
and were randomly assigned into two equal groups: group (A), which received an aquatic
based exercise program, and group (B), which received a land-based exercise program. The
exercise program, which took place in 12 consecutive weeks, consisted of flexibility,
endurance, and lower and upper body training. Physical performance was assessed using 30
seconds chair stand test, stair climb test, 30 meter fast paced walk test, time up and go
test, 6-minute walk test and a VO2max evaluation. [Results] Significantly increase in the
30 second chair stand, 6-minute walk, 30 meter fast paced walk, stair climb, and VO2 max
tests and significantly decrease in the time up and go test in group A (aquatic based
exercise) compared with group B (a land-based exercise) at the post treatment.
[Conclusion] Twelve-week program of an aquatic program yields improvement in both physical
performance and VO2 max in patients with severe burns.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Physical performance</kwd><kwd>Aquatic therapy</kwd><kwd>Burn injuries</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Burn injuries are considered a global problem that affect a wide range of the population.
They are among the most devastating of all injuries, and the fourth most common type of
trauma worldwide following traffic accidents, falls, and interpersonal violence<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients that have lived beyond the acute
phase of a burn injury usually have extensive physical functional limitations<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also suffer from a decrease in
pulmonary function, marked prolonged skeletal muscle weakness, and low physical and
functional capacity (exercise capacity)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These factors are considered to be major obstacles preventing the burn victim from returning
to work and performing daily living activities.</p><p>Furthermore, severe burns (Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) more than &#x02265;30%) can cause
critical problems like disfiguring scarring, a decrease in muscle power, and finally
debilitating contractures to hyper metabolism, which lasts for 2&#x02013;3 years post burn. This
last problem creates a state of catabolism which leads to an increase in resting energy
expenditure, tachycardia, insulin resistance, negative muscle protein balance, decrease in
bone mass, decrease physical performance, and lastly growth delay<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To improve physical performance in burn victims, two approaches can be taken: land and
water based exercises. Although land based exercises come with a lot of benefits, and can be
performed by almost everyone, they cause a large amount of impact stress on joints and
muscles. This may result in stress fractures, injury, and soreness in the muscles, all of
which contribute to a reduction in physical activity and fitness in people. On the opposite
spectrum, water-based exercises can also be performed by a wide range of the population, and
they too are extremely beneficial. In addition to that, water has the capability of
supporting 90% of the body&#x02019;s weight, leading to greater flexibility and less impact. This is
true because the buoyancy of water eliminates the effects of gravity, thereby decreasing the
stress on muscles, weight-bearing joints, tendons, and ligaments<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, studies in healthy adults and older subjects
have shown that water exercises are effective in increasing muscle strength<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these reasons, water-based exercises
are becoming one of the main exercise regimens for a physical therapy treatment program.</p><p>Since severe burns affect the physical performance of its victim, so the aim of this study
was to compare the effects of water versus land-based exercise training on their physical
performance. The authors hypothesized that water-based exercise training in severely burned
patients would be more effective in improving physical performance and exercise capacity
than land-based exercise training or no exercise training. This is because of water&#x02019;s
properties of buoyancy and hydrostatic pressure, which is expected to improve the body&#x02019;s
physical performance in several ways, all of which will be discussed later on in the
paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, single-blind, pre&#x02013;post-test,
controlled trial. Forty male participants with chronic severe burn (TBSA more than 30%) were
recruited from several outpatient clinics in Greater Cairo. They were enrolled and assessed
for their eligibility to participate in the study. Their age ranged from 20 to 40&#x02005;years.
They were assessed and treated in labs and outpatient clinics of the Faculty of Physical
Therapy, Cairo University. After a brief orientation session about the nature of the study
and the tasks to be accomplished, they were randomly assigned into two equal groups (group
(A) and group (B)) by a blinded and an independent research assistant who opened sealed
envelopes that contained a computer generated randomization card. No subjects dropped out of
the study after randomization. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
before the baseline evaluation. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review
board at Faculty of physical therapy, Cairo University before study commencement [No:
P.T.REC/012/001522]. The study followed the Guidelines of Declaration of Helsinki on
conduction of human research. The study was conducted between December 2015 and December
2016. The inclusion criteria were participants age ranged from 20 to 40&#x02005;years old; both
gender; diagnosed with post burn of more than 30% of TBSA; had less than 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>
body mass index (BMI); and all participants were able to walk independently without walking
devices. Participants were excluded if they had central nervous system lesions or inadequate
cardiac functions; diabetic; hypertension; also limited to participants who had no
infectious or skin diseases, because aquatic therapy would be inappropriate for them.
Participants were randomly assigned into 2 equal groups, group (A), which received an
aquatic exercise program, and group (B), which received an on-land exercise program. The
exercise regimen lasted for 12 successive weeks. Both types of exercise programs (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Exercise program for both aquatic and on land training</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sections</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Focuses</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Types of exercises</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 minutes</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Warm up</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Walk, march and sidestep with variations in moving

5-minute warm-up, followed by 35 minutes of different types of exercises: flexibility,
endurance, and lower and upper body training. Finally, the session ended with a 5-minute
cool down<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical performance was assessed before and after each exercise programs. This was done
using 6 difference evaluations: VO2 max evaluation as primary outcome and (30 second chair
stand test, stair climb test, 30 meter fast paced walk, time up and go test, and finally a
6-minute walk test) as secondary outcomes. Below is a brief explanation of each of the 6
different tests: These tests were specifically chosen because they give valid and reliable
data. The 30 seconds chair test, for instance, provides a reasonably reliable and valid
indicator of lower body strength in generally active adults<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the stair climb test has good inter-rater reliability
and is adequate for clinical use to evaluate physical function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 30 meter fast paced walk test is considered to be a valid tool
to assess physical performance in patients that suffer from hip or knee osteoarthritis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the time up and go test gave
reliable data that was necessary to differentiate the participants from the healthy elderly
subjects<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 6-minute walk test has
a high test-retest reliability, and can be used to evaluate the physical performance of
adults<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, the Bruce treadmill
test is a reliable tool to measure the maximal oxygen uptake<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. VO2 max evaluation: VO2
max Cardio-respiratory fitness, which basically assesses the maximum amount of oxygen that a
person can utilize in intense exercises, was assessed using a standardized treadmill
exercise test (Modified Bruce Protocol)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients wore a nose clip and breathed
room air through a two-way valve system. After that, breath by-breath, inspired and expired
gases, flow, and volume were analyzed. Concomitantly, participants began to walk on a
treadmill at a speed of 1.7 miles/hour at a zero grade of elevation. Each stage consisted of
3-minute intervals in which the speed and treadmill incline gradually increased.</p><p>Thirty seconds chair stand test: the purpose of this test is to examine lower limb
strength. Two equipment&#x02019;s are required for this test: a timer, and a chair with a 44&#x02005;cm
straight back that is preferably armless. To perform this test, the participant must stand
up completely from their sitting position, with their hips and knees fully extended then sit
back down so that their bottom completely touches the seat. This is repeated for 30 seconds.
The number of times the subject comes to a full standing position must be counted<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While, Stair-climb field test: In this test, the subjects were required to climb up 11
floors (22 flights of stairs, ending on the 12th story) at a brisk, but even pace. Steps
taken were to be of constant rhythm throughout the whole duration of the test, and a single
step must be taken each time. The total vertical distance covered was 27.0 meters. The
measurement was based on the number of steps climbed and calculated as follows: Height of a
step=15&#x02005;cm Number of steps per flight: 8 steps (except for first flight with 12 steps)
Number of flights=22 (1 flight with 12 steps and 21 flights with 8 steps) Therefore,
vertical height of 11 floors=(15&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;12 steps) + (15&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;8 steps &#x000d7;21 flights)=180 +
2,520=2,700&#x02005;cm =27.0 meters. The subjects were informed about the test procedures prior to
their climb. They were not allowed to stop at any point during the climb or use the
side-railings for support<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally,
30 meter fast paced walk: participants were asked to walk as quickly but as safely as
possible to a mark 10&#x02005;m away, return, and repeat for a total distance of 30 meters. Subjects
are timed for this test and data is expressed as speed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Time up and go test: subjects were asked to stand up from
a chair, walk at a comfortable pace to a 3-m marked line, return to the chair, and sit down.
Time taken to complete the test was recorded to the nearest 1/100 of a second using a
stopwatch<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Finally, Six-minute walk test: The 6-min walk test is now commonly used to assess function
in patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. The 6-min walk test was carried out in
a 50 meters long corridor. Subjects were instructed to walk from end to end of the corridor
and to cover as much distance as possible in the allotted period of 6&#x02005;min. The patients were
encouraged every 30&#x02005;s and were allowed to stop and rest during the test, but were instructed
to resume walking as soon as they felt able to do so. At the beginning, at 2-min increments,
and at the end of the test, breathlessness was measured using a modified Borg scale. Oxygen
saturation was monitored with a pulse oximeter set at the fastest response<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) program version 22 for
Windows. The sample size (40 patients) was calculated to yield an 85% power and &#x003b1;=0.05.
Prior to final analysis, data were screened for normality assumption and presence of extreme
scores. This exploration was done as a pre-requisite for parametric calculation of the
analysis of differences and of relationship measures. 2 &#x000d7; 2 mixed design MANOVA was used to
compare the tested variables of interest at different tested groups and training
periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05) between subjects in both

exercise program in severely burned patients. The assessment process took place before and
after the 12 weeks of exercise program in both groups. This was done by assessing the
physical performance using the 30 seconds chair stand test, stair climb test, 30 meter fast
paced walk test, time up and go test, 6-minute walk test, and the VO2 max test.</p><p>When discussing burn injuries, the main intended outcomes of any form of physical therapy
treatment would be to reduce edema, prevent contractures by positioning and splinting, and
finally limit the loss of range of movement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the study concluded that there was an improvement
in the overall physical performance in both groups, however, group A showed a larger
significant improvement. This is true because resisted exercises, such as the ones completed
in the aquatic exercise program, increase muscle power, leading to a higher improvement
rate. In addition to that, the hydrostatic pressure of the water may have also played a
role, since it helps the participants to exercise in a more vigorous manner while at the
same time causing less strain on both the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. This
consequently leads to an enhanced venous and lymphatic return, which aids in the reduction
of extremities swelling. Furthermore, the high levels of viscosity in water aids the
participants in working with the opposite groups of muscles simultaneously, while at the
same time using the same amount of resistance. This means that the body is met with
resistance in all directions, creating a better resistance program in different muscle
groups. Water resistance reduces the speed and aimed point of motion, and thus prevents
jerky movements. This consequently decreases the risk of injury and at the same time
improves strength and endurance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Results of this study are supported by Stefanska and Zawadiska<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. They found that a swimming program resulted in
significantly higher values of maximum muscle movement, performed works, and average force,
which were all achieved by knee joint extensors<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The conclusion reached by Wadell<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> in her paper also supports the conclusion that water based are more
effective than land based exercises. Wadell<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and physical comorbidities gained greater benefits from water based exercises. These
benefits are a greater exercise capacity while experiencing less fatigue<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, in their paper about the
effect of aquatic therapy on stroke survivors regarding the muscle strength and postural
balance, Noh et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> were able to reach
the same conclusion. They concluded that aquatic therapy lead to significant improvements in
more of their tests: forward and backward weight bearing, knee flexor strength, and Berg
Balance Scale scores<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the VO2 max test, there was an improvement in both groups, however group (A)
displayed a more significant improvement than group (B). This is true because during aquatic
exercises, the hydrostatic pressure of the water has a positive effect on the chest wall by
causing resistance of respiratory muscles in all directions. This forces the individual to
inhale a greater volume of air, thereby improving their respiratory muscles. Furthermore,
water buoyancy enhances venous return, thereby increasing the cardiac output. This enhances
controlled breathing underwater, and leads to better oxygenation and a lower exercise heart
rate. Rozek et al., 2005, reached the same conclusion by proving that a 5-month cycle of an
aquatic exercise program performed by children diagnosed with scoliosis, lead to a notable
increase in the vital capacity and maximum voluntary ventilation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. Firstly, the lack of follow-up for patients in
both groups for several months&#x02019; post rehabilitation program to evaluate the long lasting
effect. Secondly, the effect of the aquatic exercise program with the participants&#x02019;
psychological parameters such as quality of life was not examined. In conclusion, this study
shows that a 12-week program with a resistive aquatic program can cause improvements in both
physical performance and VO2 max in patients with severe burns when compared with an on-land
exercise program.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Not funded.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>Authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all individuals who contributed to the completion of this work,
