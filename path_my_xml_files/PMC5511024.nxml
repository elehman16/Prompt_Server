The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of verinurad in healthy adult males.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>This was a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study. Panels of eight male subjects received a single oral dose of verinurad or placebo in either a fasted or fed state; panels of 10&#x02013;12 male subjects received ascending doses of once-daily verinurad or placebo in a fasted state for 10 days. Serial blood and urine samples were assayed for verinurad and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) reports, laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 81 adult males completed the study. Following single doses of verinurad, maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) increased in a dose-proportional manner; C<sub>max</sub> occurred at 0.5&#x02013;0.75 hours and 1.25 hours in the fasted and fed states, respectively. Food decreased AUC by 23% and C<sub>max</sub> by 37%&#x02212;53%. There was a modest accumulation of verinurad following multiple daily doses. Verinurad reduced serum urate levels by up to 62% (40 mg, single dose) and 61% (10 mg, multiple dose). The increase in urinary excretion of uric acid was greatest in the first 6 hours after dosing and was still evident &#x02265;24 hours for verinurad doses &#x02265;2 mg. Verinurad was well tolerated at all doses. No serious AEs, severe AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Single and multiple doses of verinurad were well tolerated, absorption was rapid, and exposure was dose proportional. Verinurad increased urinary uric acid elimination and resulted in sustained reductions in serum urate. These data support further clinical evaluation of once-daily verinurad as a treatment for gout.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>fractional excretion of uric acid</kwd><kwd>selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor</kwd><kwd>serum urate</kwd><kwd>urinary uric acid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic gout is a significant clinical problem, and many patients remain suboptimally treated with currently available therapies.

Subjects who had a history of kidney stones were excluded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>RDEA3170-101 was a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study. Panels of eight male subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive a single oral dose of verinurad (six subjects) or placebo (two subjects) in either a fasted (2 mg, 5 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg dose) or fed (5 mg or 20 mg dose) state. Panels of 12 male subjects were planned to receive ascending doses of once-daily verinurad (nine subjects: 1 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg doses) or placebo (three subjects) for 10 days in a fasted state. Verinurad or placebo was administered in tablet form for doses &#x02265;5 mg or as an oral solution for the 1 mg and 2 mg doses.</p><p>Subjects were confined to the research facility from 2 days before dose administration until 72 hours after the last dose on day 4 (single dose) or day 13 (multiple doses). Prior to dosing, all subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours. Under fasting conditions, no food was allowed for at least 4 hours after the administration of study medication. Under fed conditions, subjects received study medication 30 minutes after completing a standard moderate fat (approximately 30%&#x02013;40% of calories) and calorie (approximately 642&#x02013;800 calories) breakfast. Tablets were administered with approximately 240 mL of water, while administration of the oral solution was followed by enough water to give a total volume of 240 mL. Additional water was allowed as desired except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after the administration of study medication. Subjects returned for post-study assessments on day 8 (&#x000b1;1 day) following a single dose and on day 17 (&#x000b1;1 day) following multiple doses.</p><p>In the single ascending dose regimen, serial PK plasma samples were collected on day 1 up to 72 hours post dose. Urine samples (total catch) for PK/PD were collected at every 6- or 12-hour interval prior to dosing and up to 72 hours post dose. In the multiple ascending dose regimen, serial PK plasma samples were collected over 24 hours post dose on days 1, 5, and 10; additional samples were collected prior to dosing (days 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9) and up to 72 hours following the last dose. Serial PD serum and urine samples were collected on day &#x02212;1 prior to dosing and days 1, 5, and 10 for 24 hours post dose; additional samples were collected up to 72 hours following the last dose on day 10. Both plasma and urine samples were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analyzed for verinurad concentrations by Ardea Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). Serum samples were analyzed for sUA and creatinine and urine samples for uric acid and creatinine by Covance Central Laboratory Services (Indianapolis, IN, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analytical methods</title><p>For quantitative determination of verinurad, 0.040 mL aliquots of K<sub>3</sub>EDTA plasma or urine were extracted by protein precipitation (plasma) or dilution (urine) with acetonitrile containing [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>6</sub>]verinurad as internal standard. An aliquot of each plasma extract was further diluted with water, while urine samples were further diluted with injection solvent (acetonitrile:water, 1:2, v/v). Both plasma and urine samples were injected into an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, where the analytes were chromatographically separated by gradient HPLC at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min using a Zorbax-SB-C18 4.6 mm&#x000d7;50 mm, 3.5 &#x000b5;m pore column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and introduced into an API 5000 (plasma samples) or API 4000 (urine samples) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). The mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. When introduced into the mass spectrometer, the chromatographic effluent was positively ionized using Turboionspray mode and mass analysis was performed using selected reaction monitoring (unit/low resolution) for the precursor&#x02192;product ion transitions of <italic>m/z</italic> 349.1&#x02192;263.0 (verinurad) and 355.0&#x02192;264.0 ([<sup>2</sup>H<sub>6</sub>]verinurad) with a 150 ms dwell for each transition (an additional dummy ion transition was added with a 30 ms dwell time to prevent cross talk). The methods for plasma and urine were validated according to the US Food and Drug Administration Bioanalytical Method Validation guidelines (2001)<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-2077" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with a 0.100 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL lower limit of quantitation, respectively, and showed %Theoretical (% CV) during study analyses of 96.1%&#x02013;103% (4.31%&#x02013;6.98%) and 96.5%&#x02013;104% (2.09%&#x02013;4.69%), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>PK/PD assessments</title><p>PK parameters were derived using WinNonlin Professional, version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, St Louis, MO, USA). Plasma PK parameters, calculated using noncom-partmental analysis, included maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) or to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>), calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Other plasma PK parameters were apparent plasma terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), apparent total clearance, corrected by bioavailability (CL/F), and volume of distribution at equilibrium, corrected by bioavailability (V<sub>ss</sub>/F). The fraction of the verinurad dose (% dose) excreted unchanged in urine from time 0 to 24 hours post dose (fe<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) was also calculated.</p><p>The PD parameters were determined using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The maximum percent change from baseline and the time of the maximum percent change in sUA were obtained directly from the concentration versus time data. The amount of uric acid recovered in urine (Ae<sub>UR</sub>) was calculated as the urine concentration of uric acid multiplied by the urine volume. Renal clearance of uric acid (CL<sub>UR</sub>) was obtained from the amount of uric acid recovered in the urine (Ae<sub>UR</sub>) divided by plasma urate AUC over the same time interval, while CL<sub>UR</sub> divided by creatinine clearance (CrCl) &#x000d7;100 yielded the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessment</title><p>Subjects were observed during the course of the study, and any adverse events (AEs) or remedial actions were documented in the clinical report form of the subject. Rheumatology Common Toxicity Criteria (RCTC) version 2.0 was used by the investigator to assess the severity of an AE. Clinical laboratory evaluations, supine blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature were measured at specific times during the study. A physical examination and standard digital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded at screening and follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The sample size is typical for this type of study. No formal statistical power assessment was performed. Early data on PK variability suggested that this sample size is sufficient to provide reasonable characterization of the target PK parameters.</p><p>The PK and PD populations consisted of all subjects who received verinurad and had evaluable PK data and PD data, respectively. The safety population consisted of all subjects who received verinurad.</p><p>A fixed-effect model with food as a fixed effect was used to assess the effect of food on the PK of verinurad. The natural log-transformed PK parameters for the 5 mg and 20 mg single dosing groups under fed conditions were compared against those under fasted conditions. An estimate of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of the PK parameters with the corresponding 90% CI was generated.</p><p>Dose proportionality assessments were performed on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC for the single doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg using a power model:

AEs possibly related to study drug were only reported by four (11.1%) subjects in the pooled verinurad treatment group and included dizziness.</p><p>Following multiple dosing, ten AEs were reported in four (50.0%) subjects in the pooled placebo group and 40 AEs in 18 (72.0%) subjects in the pooled verinurad group. All but five AEs were mild in severity. One (12.5%) subject in the pooled placebo group reported two AEs of toothache with moderate severity. Three (12.0%) subjects in the pooled verinurad treatment group reported three AEs of moderate severity: fatigue, nausea, and nasopharyngitis. The most frequently reported AE in the pooled placebo group was headache (three [37.5%] subjects). All other AEs occurred in no more than one subject. The most common AEs reported in the pooled verinurad treatment group were headache and diarrhea (three [12.0%] subjects each). All other AEs occurred in no more than two subjects. The incidence of AEs possibly related to study drug was similar for the pooled placebo and pooled verinurad treatment groups (37.5% versus 32.0%, respectively) and included headache and diarrhea.</p><p>One subject in the single-dose 40 mg group and one subject in the multiple-dose 1 mg group experienced postdose increases in serum creatinine (sCr) &#x0003e;1.5&#x000d7; baseline value. The increase occurred 48 hours after the single dose and sCr returned to normal by the follow-up visit on day 7. The increase following multiple dosing occurred 36 hours after the dose on day 10 and sCr returned to normal at 48 hours post dose. Both events were not considered to be clinically significant by the investigator. Other individual creatinine changes were minimal and were seen in similar frequency in subjects receiving verinurad and placebo. None of the changes were reported as AEs.</p><p>Isolated changes in clinical safety laboratory parameters were observed in a small number of subjects, the majority of which were minor changes, and none were reported as AEs. There were no significant findings on physical examination or ECGs, and no treatment- or dose-related trends in vital signs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study in healthy subjects are consistent with published data on another selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor, lesinurad, where inhibition of URAT1 in the proximal tubule of the kidney increases urinary uric acid excretion and lowers sUA.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-2077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Verinurad was quickly absorbed following oral administration. Plasma exposure of verinurad increased in a dose-proportional manner over the range of doses examined. In the systemic circulation, verinurad appeared to be a high clearance drug (CL/F ranged ~30&#x02013;50 L/h) with extensive extravascular distribution. Renal excretion of verinurad is limited to only ~2%&#x02013;3% in the urine, suggesting that the majority of verinurad is likely cleared in the liver via biotransformation to metabolites. A moderate fat meal slightly delayed the absorption of a single verinurad dose and decreased verinurad AUC by 23% and C<sub>max</sub> by 37%&#x02013;53%. Modest accumulation of verinurad was observed following once-daily multiple doses.</p><p>sUA concentrations decreased in a dose-dependent manner following single and multiple once-daily dosing of verinurad over the dose range of 1&#x02013;40 mg. Food slightly enhanced the maximum sUA lowering effect by an additional 5%, despite a reduction in verinurad plasma exposure. A similar effect was observed with lesinurad,<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-2077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as food produced up to a 10% greater reduction in sUA. The sUA lowering effect of verinurad was evident for at least 24 hours post dose, although most of the increased excretion into urine occurred during the first 6 hours after dosing. The sustained lowering of sUA supports the viability of a once-daily dosing regimen.</p><p>Consistent with its mechanism of action as a selective reabsorption inhibitor of URAT1, verinurad increased Ae<sub>UR</sub> and FEUA in a dose-dependent manner following single doses. The increase in excretion of uric acid led to the observed reductions in sUA. Following repeated dosing, Ae<sub>UR</sub> was comparable to baseline values. This is due to the fact that the amount of uric acid in the serum is lower, and therefore there is less available to be filtered in the kidney and less available to be blocked in reabsorption. However, the continued inhibition of reabsorption maintains sUA at low concentrations.</p><p>Verinurad appeared to be well tolerated by healthy male subjects when given either as single or multiple daily doses in either the fed or the fasting state. The incidence of AEs was low after single doses and did not appear to be dose related. Daily oral doses of verinurad over 10 days had no apparent effect on the safety and laboratory parameters measured.</p><p>A possible limitation of this study is the exclusive inclusion of healthy male subjects, as the drug is intended for use in both male and female subjects with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Healthy male subjects are most often used in Phase I studies, with both male and female patients included in subsequent Phase II and III studies. In addition, interpretation of the effects of food on the PK of verinurad may be limited due to the use of different panels of subjects each with a small sample size.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor verinurad induces sustained, dose-dependent decreases in sUA concentration, with concomitant increases in urinary urate concentrations in healthy subjects. These data support further clinical evaluation of once-daily verinurad as a treatment for gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding was provided by Ardea Biosciences/AstraZeneca.
