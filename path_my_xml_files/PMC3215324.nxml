Glaucoma is a disease which is characterized by raised intra-ocular pressure, optic disc cupping and visual field defect. The clinical study was done on 79 patients of <italic>Kaphaja Adhimantha</italic> in 4 different groups. Group A was treated with <italic>Triphaladi Varti</italic>. Group B was treated with <italic>Nayanamrita Lauha</italic>. Group C was combined group wherein both <italic>Nayanamrita Lauha</italic> and <italic>Triphaladi Varti</italic> were given. Group D was treated with placebo eye drop (<italic>Saurastra Netra Bindu</italic>). After the enrolment of the patients for this study, signs and symptoms such as dimness of vision, heaviness in head, coloured haloes, optic disc changes, IOP and visual field changes were studied before, during and after the treatment. The study indicates that combined group showed better results as compared to other groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Adhimantha</italic></kwd><kwd>Glaucoma</kwd><kwd><italic>Nayanamrita Lauha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Triphaladi Varti</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Ayurveda</italic>, the science of life is the very foundation stone of medical knowledge in India.

Even though the disease <italic>Adhimantha</italic> has been considered as a curable disease if the treatment is given well in time otherwise the disease results in further deterioration and ultimately blindness ensues.</p><p>In this study, maximum patients (40.83%) belonged to age group of 41 to 50 years which shows that this age group is highly suspicious to develop glaucoma. Maximum patients (75.9%) were male and Hindu (85.9%). Maximum patients were labourer (48.33%) and married (95%). Maximum patients were having <italic>Vata-Pitta Prakriti</italic> (38.33%), <italic>Madhyam Sara</italic> (66.66%) and <italic>Madhyam Samhanana</italic> (64.16%). Maximum patients were having pathological optic disc cupping (91.66%) in both eyes. Most of the patients had raised intra-ocular pressure (65.0%) in right eye, (63.33%) in left eye respectively.

All these properties alleviate <italic>Kapha. Madhura Vipaka</italic> (58.82%) pacifies <italic>Vata</italic>. The dominancy of <italic>Katu</italic> and <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> along with <italic>Madhura Vipaka</italic> is in favour of alleviating symptoms like heaviness in the head, watering, itching and pain in the eyes. The <italic>Gunas</italic> present in <italic>Nayanamrita Lauha</italic> are <italic>Laghu</italic> (70.58%) and <italic>Ruksha</italic> (29.41%). These <italic>Gunas</italic> again alleviate <italic>Kapha</italic> thereby reducing the intensity of pain in the eye and head. Most of the drugs are <italic>Ushna Veerya</italic> with their <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic> properties. So the ultimate effect is on <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic> i.e. alleviation of <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic>.</p><p><italic>Triphaladi Varti</italic> contains <italic>Katu Rasa</italic> (62.5%), <italic>Laghu Guna</italic> (62.5%), <italic>Katu Vipaka</italic> (37.5%), <italic>Ushna Veerya</italic> (62.5%) and <italic>Madhura Vipaka</italic> (62.5%) along with <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic> properties (85.71%). Here the dominancy of <italic>Katu Rasa</italic> and <italic>Ushna Veerya</italic> shows their <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic> properties. The disease which is caused by vitiation of <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Vata Dosha</italic>, because of <italic>Kaphavata Shamaka</italic> properties of the drug the symptoms like watering, itching and blurring have shown improvement. <italic>Ushna Veerya</italic> and <italic>Madhura Vipaka</italic> have been observed 62.5% which act on vitiated <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> respectively.</p><p>Most of the drugs of <italic>Nayanamrita Lauha</italic> and <italic>Triphaladi Varti</italic> are anti inflammatory, CNS stimulant, anti spasmodic, smooth muscle depressant, analgesic etc. So, it has direct effect on disease pathology and relieve the symptoms. As a result of the action of the drug, it is assumed that the drug is effective in breaking down the aetiopathogenesis of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The scientific explanation of the disease alongwith its symptomatology has brought out the fact that the disease <italic>Adhimantha</italic> has similarity with glaucoma in its clinical presentation. It is one of the clinically defined conditions of the eye wherein at least more than two symptoms need to be looked for. The clinical presentation of the disease is based on symptoms like blurring of vision, pain in the eye, headache, raised intra-ocular pressure, optic disc cupping and visual field changes.</p><p>The improvement shown by combined therapy is significant. Although no significant improvement was noted in optic disc cupping, intra-ocular pressure and visual field changes because of degenerative nature of the disease. This study is one step ahead in the direction of research in this field. In fact the results observed are quite encouraging. This study has definitely laid down the foundation for the further research in this direction.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sushrut</surname><given-names>Samhita</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta Shastri</surname><given-names>Ambika</given-names></name></person-group><year>2001</year><edition>12th edition</edition><publisher-loc>Gopal Mandir Lane, Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Orientalia</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sachitra Shalakya</surname><given-names>Vigyan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhari</surname><given-names>Ravindra Nath</given-names><suffix>Dr</suffix></name></person-group><year>2002</year><edition>16th edition</edition><publisher-loc>Gopal Mandir Lane, Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Orientalia</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>System of Ophthalmology by Duke Elder</source><year>1976</year><volume>1st</volume><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Henry Kimpton</publisher-name><comment>reprint</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ashtang</surname><given-names>Hridaya</given-names></name><name><surname>Srikantha Murthy</surname><given-names>K.
