Chronic and recurrent nature of depression together with its traditionally labour-intensive treatment strategies make depression a difficult and expensive disorder to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Enhancing treament availability and efficacy is therefore critically important from both short term and long term perspectives. This is especially relevant in low-density communities such as northern and rural Alberta where traditional therapeutic interventions might be poorly accessible. Recent evidence indicates that innovative technologies such as supportive text messaging have a large potential to be a cost effective solution to improve patient compliance, improve treatment outcomes, and provide large-scale screening and patient monitoring in a wide variety of physical and mental illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The emerging mobile health technologies could therefore help improve the current therapeutic interventions for mental ilnesses such as depression.</p><p id="Par7">Mental illness and depression in particular have far reaching consequences not only to the patients and their families but also to our communities as a whole. Overall, mental illness is the most prevalent cause of disability in Canada, accountable for approximately 30% of all disability claims, 70% of total costs, and an economic loss of approximately 2.96% of GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several North American studies have indicated that approximately half of the mental illness short term disability claims are specifically attributable to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prevalence of depression among adults in Alberta is estimated as 8.4&#x02013;11.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Slomp et al. (2012) identified that approximately 5.9% of Albertans sought depression-related health services directly in 2007&#x02013;2008 with a total annual service cost amounting to $114.5 million or approximately $550 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The distribution was heavily skewed with the 1% of the most costly patients accounting for an average annual cost of $25,862 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Less than a quarter of these depressed Albertans reported that their mental health service needs were fully met, even though two thirds of them have received a provincial mental health service in the past year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In fact, recent data from the Gap Analysis of Public Mental Health and Addiction Programs (GAP-MAP) by Wild et al. indicate that, of all mental health and addiction disorders surveyed, depressed Albertans were the most likely to report unmet service needs. The most commonly cited unmet need was the lack of sufficient, accessible, and affordable counselling, which was reported by 42.4% of depressed Albertans. The GAP-MAP analysis also identified a tendency for northern Albertan residents to have higher prevalence of mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Underlying reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. Nonetheless, the current evidence suggests that despite of the potentially greater mental health needs in northern Alberta, the remote northern and rural communities in Canada have to cope only with limited access to specialised mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] as compared to average Canadians.</p><p id="Par9">Recent advances in telecomunications and information technology have inspired the development of a mobile health strategy (mHealth) which includes text messaging as a novel strategy to support and enhance health care and public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since the publication of the first health text messaging study in 2002, text messaging health research has experienced rapid growth on a global scale, yet the field is still in its early phase of development and standardization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Wireless phones are fairly ubiquitous and provide innovative opportunities for cost-effective access to large numbers of respondents with diverse demographic and social backgrounds. Mobile health technologies are particularly suitable to Alberta which has the highest wireless phone penetration in Canada at 90.1% of households (99.6% for both wireless and wireline phones) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a diverse population with a significant share of non-local, transient workforce (5.7 to 6.2% of workers are estimated to be contracted from other provinces) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and other population cohorts who are challenging to reach and follow-up using traditional mental health treatment or research methods.</p><p id="Par10">Mobile health technologies represent a convenient, expedient, and location-independent method of clinical monitoring that can be cost-effectively scaled up. These technologies also promote greater accessibility of specialized services in remote locations and offer the opportunity for enhanced non-critical care in the community. Both factors have potential for improving quality of life and treatment outcomes in patients, while containing treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These properties make mobile health technologies, such as supportive text messaging, very attractive as means for alleviating unmet health service needs, including inadequate access to counselling and the improvement of treatment outcomes in patients suffering from chronic recurrent disorders, such as depression. Although evidence on the use of text messaging in depression is limited, there is a large body of literature reporting the successful use of online therapies in depression to augment cognitive behavioural therapy, monitor treatment outcomes, and improve treatment compliance (for example of a recent meta-analysis refer to Richards et al. 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) which provides encouraging results.</p><p id="Par11">In this study, we implemented an add-on supportive text messaging service for depression, a treatment intervention with demonstrated effectiveness in prior clinical trials which targeted comorbid depression and alcohol use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our aim was to test the efficacy of using supportive text messaging as a means of improving treatment outcomes (improved mood, increased self-reported overall health, and decreased number of health service provider visits) in depressed patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par12">We conducted a single-rater blinded randomised trial of automated supportive text messages delivered through an internet application to participants&#x02019; mobile phones.

</p><p id="Par19">In all, 35 participants were allocated to the intervention group and 38 to the control group; 31 and 32 patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively, completed the study. Two patients in the intervention group and two in the control group withdrew their consent to further participate in the study before the three-month outcome assessments were due. Furthermore, two patients in the text message group and four patients in the control group could not be reached for follow-up. Those who withdrew consent for follow-up did not provide any specific explanation for their decision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Baseline procedures, randomisation and masking</title><p id="Par20">Patients undergoing initial mental health assessments at community mental health clinics were approached by their psychiatrist to consider potential participation in the trial. Eligible consenting patients completed baseline assessments which included demographic and clinical information. Baseline depression levels were measured using the Beck&#x02019;s Depression Inventory II (BDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and participants&#x02019; overall health status was assessed using the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L consists of five dimensions that are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, in addition to a visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS) which is a vertical thermometer like scale from 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health and 100 is the best imaginable health. All dimensions have five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems/unable to do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">After baseline assessment, participants were randomised using a series of random numbers generated using Excel (Microsoft, Washington, USA). Participants were assigned the next available number from the randomisation sequence by a research assistant who did not participate in either the follow-up assessments or analysis. Depending on whether the randomisation number was even or odd, participants were placed in the intervention or control group, respectively. The research assistant who performed or supervised the follow-up assessments remained blind to group allocation throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par22">Starting a day after enrolment, patients in the intervention group received twice daily unidirectional computer programmed supportive text messages for 3 months. The messages were written by cognitive behaviour therapists in partnership with patients and pre-programmed into an online software which delivered the messages at 10.00&#x000a0;h and 19.00&#x000a0;h each day. Text messages were formulated based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) principles to target mood improvement. Two different messages were sent each day with no repetition of messages throughout the 90-day period. The same messages were delivered to all patients according to the day they joined the program, with no tailoring of messages to meet individual patient needs.</p><p id="Par23">Examples of the text messages included the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">What lies behind you and what lies before you are tiny matters compared to what lies within you.

</p><p id="Par29">Patients in the control group received text messages once fortnightly thanking them for participating in the study. All study participants were encouraged to participate in the usual follow-up treatments available for patients with Major Depressive Disorder including a recommendation to self-refer for cognitive behaviour therapy either privately or with the provincial Addiction and Mental Health counselling team, attend follow-up appointments in the mental health clinics and to attend their family doctors or utilise emergency services as needed. The psychiatrists were not involved in randomising patients into either the intervention or control groups and were not involved in the follow-up assessments; procedures which were all performed by research assistants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedures at follow-up, outcome measures and hypothesis</title><p id="Par30">At 3 months following their enrolment, all participants were contacted by a blinded investigator who assisted them in completing a range of assessment tools relating to the primary and secondary outcome measures listed below. More than two thirds of participants completed follow-up assessments in-person under the guidance of the research assistant after their 3 months routine follow-up psychiatric reviews in a community mental health clinic, and the remaining participants completed their assessments with the research assistant over the phone. Those completing the assessments over the phone were evenly distributed between the intervention (7) and control (8) groups, respectively. All in-person assessments involved patients self-completing outcome scales. With the over-the-phone assessments, the research assistant read out the questionnaires to the participants for them to select or indicate applicable responses.</p><p id="Par31">Primary outcome measures was the mean changes in the BDI scores at 3 months from baseline. Our primary research hypothesis was that supportive text messages will reduce the three-month mean BDI scores by 30% compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures included the mean changes in the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L instrument scores at 3 months from baseline, self-reports of the number of times participants utilised health services - including the number of visits to Family Physicians, Psychiatrists, and other specialist physicians. This also included self-reports of the number of visits to the Emergency Department, the number of CBT/counselling sessions attended, and the number of other health services utilized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par32">Consistent with the idea that the study was a pilot trial, the research utilized data that could be elicited from participants who could be enrolled within the existing budget and time frame. We reached a sample size of 73 participants with Major Depressive Disorder which exceeds our target sample size of 60 reported in our published protocol for the depression trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS version 20 for Windows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were analysed using Chi-squared, Fisher&#x02019;s Exact, and Student&#x02019;s t-tests. Three-month BDI and EQ VAS scores were each compared between the intervention and control groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the treatment condition as the independent variable, baseline BDI or EQ VAS score as the covariate, and BDI or EQ VAS score at 3 months as the dependent variable, respectively. In each case, checks were conducted to ensure that there was no violation of the statistical assumptions of normality, linearity, homogeneity of variance, homogeneity of regression slopes, and reliable measurement of the covariate. For participants with missing follow-up data (four in the text message group and six in the control group), we imputed the last observation (baseline measures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We performed sensitivity analyses of covariance to explore the impact of imputation of data loss on the BDI or EQ VAS score at 3 months.

All of the participants were encouraged to follow through with their standard mental health treatment plan as prescribed by their Psychiatrists during the duration of the study. The patients were also not precluded or discouraged from seeking an appropriate treatment for physical health problems or urgent mental health issues as needed. Both of the primary outcome differences were statistically significant after correction for the heterogeneous baseline clinical profile of the two randomly assigned comparison groups.</p><p id="Par42">The supportive text messaging intervention did not yield statistically significant change in the secondary outcome of health services utilization - although, on average, the intervention group sought fewer services compared to the control group. As alluded by the dimensional analysis of the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L descriptive system, a larger number of intervention patients also self-reported no anxiety/depression and less severe and extreme anxiety or depression at the 3 month follow-up. The interaction of different demographic and clinical variables on the three-month BDI score was tested in our exploratory analysis but did not yield any significant findings. Our sample was too underpowered to fully explore these trends and interactions. A larger sample size could potentially shed more colour on the health otucomes and the interplay between the health care service utilization (such as the number of counselling sessions) and the supportive text messaging intervention.</p><p id="Par43">Overall, our study results indicate that supportive text messaging is a feasible and effective add-on intervention to improve treatment outcomes in depressed patients in a clinical setting in a regional health centre in northern Alberta. Supportive text messaging or similar mobile health interventions could help address the ongoing need for more assessibile mental health services for more remote or difficult to follow-up patient cohorts.</p><p id="Par44">Our overall sample exhibited generally similar characteristics compared to other depression studies and clinical guidelines: the randomly selected sample of depressed patients consisted of approximately two times as many females as males and the peak demographic cohort consisted of productive-age adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A notable difference compared to some other clinical studies are relatively high levels of post-secondary education (47%) and employment (73%) among our outpatients. Compared to other mobile health studies in depression such as Proudfoot et al. (2013), however, our sample had lower levels of post-secondary education (84%) and employment (84%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is likely due to the regional economic, social, and geographic differences in the communities and patient cohorts which were sampled in the literature which might not be comparable to our sample from the oil mining dominated municipality in northern Alberta.</p><p id="Par45">This is the first study of its kind in Alberta and one of a the first studies evaluating the clinical outcomes of supportive text messaging in depression rather than the indirect use of text messaging to promote treatment compliance or to monitor patients&#x02019; mood. The literature evidence on efficacy of supportive text messaging is relatively weak because few studies have directly measured mental health outcomes.</p><p id="Par46">Agyapong et al. (2012) have reported successful reduction in depression scores (over 51% additional improvement compared to the control group) and a trend of prolonged cumulative abstinence duration (over 11% on average) during a 3 month supportive text messaging trial in patients recovering from comorbid alcohol use disorder and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Twice-daily supportive messages in that trial were positively received by the patients, 83% of whom claimed that the motivational text messages have helped maintain abstinence and improve their mental well being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Broom et al. (2015) have demonstrated feasability of using supportive text messages as a simple, well-accepted, and inexpensive adjunct therapy to traditional counselling in low income, minority populations with post-partum depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this sample, 82% of mothers claimed the automated supportive text messages were relevant and 75% of them have forwarded them to others, although no direct measure of depressive symptom improvement compared to a control group was reported in that study. Whitton et al. (2015) used text messaging as part of a broader computer- and mobile-based internet mental health intervention, reporting that the most commonly used feature of the interactive internet mental health intervention was the use of short motivational messages, which was chosen by 38.4% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The study did not report specifically on the efficacy of the motivational text messages on the reduction of depressive symptoms other than on the rapid and sustained overall improvement observed by the combined computer and text-messaging CBT mHealth intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Text messages tended to be more highly correlated with symptom reduction than email messages - although the difference was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Text messages have been also used, for various purposes, in other depression studies: to cost-effectivly screen at-risk persons for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], to send reminders to complete psychotherapeutic homework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and to collect data on the changes in the depressive mood or other clinical variables during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Although literature describing treatment outcomes of supportive text messaging interventions in depression is limited, collateral evidence supports the high potential of mobile health strategies at all intervention stages of depression - from patient screening, through patient treatment and monitoring, to recurrence prevention. Current evidence suggests text messaging interventions are generally well-accepted by patients and might also be useful for underseved populations and in situations where traditional clinical interventions might not be practically feasible.</p><p id="Par48">The primary limitation of this study was resource constraints which led to modest respective sample sizes (with 31 and 32 patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively, completing the three-month follow-up) as well as a lack of longer term follow-up of patients to assertain if differences observed in primary outcome measures will be sustained beyound the priod of the intervention. As a result of the relatively small sample size, our study was underpowered which has limited our ability to fully explore and interpret the findings. Nonetheless, this was one of the first studies testing the efficacy of the use of supportive text messaging to improve treatment outcomes in depressed patients. A smaller sample size is common in comparable text-messaging studies in depression, ranging between 24 and 65 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The modest sample size of our study and the literature in general means that the results should be interpreted with caution until further replication. Another limitation was that, although the telecommunications provider&#x02019;s online application has features which allowed us to track if text messages had been delivered to participants cell phones, it did not allow us to confirm if participant had actually read the text messages. Future studies should consider implementing additional mHealth techniques which would enable them to objectively track how much time participants have spent reading supportive text messages if such techniques would be ethically permissible and technically feasible in their study. This would permit researchers to investigate whether the variation in the exposure could impact the intervention outcomes in a dose-dependent way which was not possible in our study. An additional limitation is that, although not statistically significant, patients in the intervention group of our study had a higher baseline mean BID score compared to patients in the control group. This means the effects of the intervention at 3 months could in part potentially be attributed to a regression to the mean.</p><p id="Par49">The major strength of this study was its robust design and conservative analysis. Our randomized controlled study followed the best clinical trial practices as outlined in Agyapong et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We have also analyzed and reported clinical outcome measures which were collected by a study-blinded research assistant. The interactions of the different variables were tested in an exploratory analysis and the results were corrected for the inherent baseline clinical heterogeneity of our randomly assigned comparison groups. Because of the robust protocol, our study is a suitable candidate for inclusion in future meta-analyses and quantitative comparisons to future randomized clinical trials. Another strength of our study was the involvement of service users in the drafting of the supportive text messages which were used in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par105">Supportive text messaging based on CBT, could potentially help alleviate the large unmet need for mental health services (such as counselling) currently reported by patients in Alberta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and other parts of Canada and beyound. Mobile health technologies can serve as force-multipliers for mental health providers to distribute inexpensive and more extensive mental health interventions to a wider spectrum of patients. Several studies examining text messaging have successfully demonstrated that mobile health technologies can be particularly useful for marginalized populations such as visible minorities, refugees, people of limited income, people of limited literacy, or culturally stigmatized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. With the location-independent advantage of mobile health technologies, this could potentially make such interventions useful for some of the population cohorts in Canada who suffer from the highest prevalences of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Implementation of text-messaging interventions has the potential for improving treatment outcomes, which in turn may decrease both the economic cost of disability and increase quality of life for patients. On a wider scale, more effective and accessible therapeutic interventions for depression could improve workplace productivity and even improve family dynamics in our communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We hope future studies will be conducted to validate our encouraging findings and explore their implications in larger clinical samples with long term follow up.
