Since population surveillance is not currently recommended for ovarian cancer, control subjects undergoing no surveillance were compared with the intervention group. The onset of ovarian cancer was delayed at a net cost of $1630 (3.5yrs) to $2509 (1.2years) for women with BRCA1/2 mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Testing allows targeted high-level surveillance for gene mutation carriers, which ensures the cost-effective use of resources and reduces cancer-related morbidity if clinical recommendations for intervention are adopted.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2005</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Note</bold></p><p>please consult PDF for full article</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
