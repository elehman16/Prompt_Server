Exclusion criteria included contact or respiratory precautions, clotting disorders, eg, due to thrombocytopenia and hemophilia, and altered mental status or inability to provide informed consent, eg, due to hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal, and dementia. Inpatients were also excluded if they required constant one-on-one supervision, eg, due to incarceration or psychosis, or if the attending physician or nurse did not approve their participation due to safety or other health concerns.

For many patients, despite common negative perceptions of being hospitalized, eg, constant noise and difficulty feeling rested, massage or music therapy resulted in reporting a positive hospital experience. Reasons for this included improved sleep quality, relaxation, and distraction from hospital distress. Environmental factors causing distress included sharing a hospital room and noise (alarms, staff, or other patients). Massage therapy was often linked to physical relaxation, while music therapy tended to yield a more healing environment.<disp-quote><p>The massage therapy sessions made me feel like I mattered in the hospital. Overall, it made me feel comfortable in the hospital, which is not easy.</p><p>My hospital experience was made more stressful because of my roommate. I have to say that the massage sessions definitely improved that aspect.</p><p>[Music therapy] just brought me to a whole other place in my head. It wasn&#x02019;t about being miserable in the hospital room. It was about getting better.</p><p>I was a little anxious in the hospital. Just your normal anxiety.

Massage therapy participants with pain reported substantial short-term reduction in pain intensity. In contrast, music therapy appeared to improve ability to cope with the pain, even if the overall intensity did not change.<disp-quote><p>Let [me] put it this way, when I was there in the hospital, the pain from my foot was a 10.

Massage or music therapy compared to usual care did not show any statistically significant differences in HCAHPS, a standardized quantitative measure of patient experience. In contrast, qualitative data from massage and music therapy participants suggest that both interventions improved their overall hospital experience, pain management, and connectedness to the massage or music therapist.</p><p>Our results were not consistent with a previous case&#x02013;control study of music therapy that found an increased likelihood of medical inpatients recommending the hospital on HCAHPS.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Additional studies of massage<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and music therapy<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have demonstrated improved patient experience using Likert satisfaction scores and the Press Ganey Inpatient Survey, respectively. This is the first study to report the impact of massage or music therapy on the &#x0201c;Pain Management&#x0201d; HCAHPS domain. While systematic reviews of massage<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and music<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> therapy suggest that these therapies effectively reduce pain, we did not see a difference between groups on the HCAHPS pain management domain. In contrast, our participants&#x02019; responses to open-ended questions reflected themes of improved pain management. For massage therapy, patients reported an immediate, albeit temporary, reduction in pain intensity. For music therapy, patients reported distraction from their pain, making the pain less bothersome.</p><p>Patient experience is complex and influenced by many aspects of care and environment. Given the complexity of patient experience, a single intervention like massage or music therapy may not be sufficient to elicit changes in HCAHPS score metrics. While increasing the dosage of either therapy (session duration and frequency) may improve patient experience, it was challenging in our environment to provide additional massage or music therapy sessions when considering therapist staffing, potential interruptions, eg, testing, rounds, related to a busy hospital environment, and relatively brief hospital stays. Furthermore, patient preference was not incorporated into choice of therapy, which may have limited the potential benefit to patient experience.</p><p>Our study had important limitations. As this was a feasibility study, a lack of quantitative findings may be due to limited statistical power. Our small sample was heterogeneous, with patients presenting with various admitting diagnoses. Previous work has shown that different health conditions are independently associated with patient experience scores.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Additionally, pain patients were a subset of randomized patients, and therefore, randomization may not have been preserved. Our trial also excluded participants who were willing to be randomized to one therapy but not the other. Lastly, our outcome assessors were not blinded to treatment allocation during phone interviews. Since it would not be possible to collect the qualitative data without knowing allocation, it would have been ideal for blinded staff to collect the HCAHPs and unblinded staff gather qualitative data. However, due to resource limitations for this small pilot study, this was not feasible.</p><p>Future work should evaluate less heterogeneous samples to try to identify subgroups that would particularly benefit.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Studies that incorporate patient preference may also be useful. Preference for a specific therapy over another may predict a more favorable response.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2164957X17735816" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Our qualitative findings suggest that massage and music therapy provided temporary, yet clinically meaningful, pain reduction which may have subsequently reduced use of pain medication. This is in contrast with our quantitative assessment of pain management, ie, HCAHPS questionnaire, which did not show any differences between massage, music therapy, and usual care. However, HCAHPS questions were assessed at a single time point (within 1 week after discharge from the hospital) and may not have captured temporary pain relief immediately following massage or music therapy sessions. Future studies should use disease or symptom-specific outcome measures at baseline and multiple time points to better characterize symptom management over the duration of hospital stay. It would also be helpful to measure a range of symptoms, eg, pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, immediately before and after sessions. Whether any reduction in pain or pain perception is associated with lower analgesic and psychotropic medication use could also be determined. More in-depth interviews in future trials may reveal additional themes relevant to improving patient experience and suggest alternative assessments or methodologies. Finally, the potential for massage or music therapists to improve the work environment and workload for the physician, nursing, and ancillary staff is yet to be tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec22-2164957X17735816"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, providing massage and music therapy in an urban safety-net inpatient setting was feasible. Preliminary findings do not suggest a quantitative impact on HCAHPS pain management, recommendation of hospital, and overall hospital rating domains. However, qualitative findings suggest benefits related to a better hospital experience, improved pain management, and connectedness to the massage or music therapist. Additional larger studies with expanded outcome measurement, eg, evaluating pain and medication use immediately before and after intervention, are needed to further assess the therapeutic effects of massage and music therapy in the inpatient setting.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-2164957X17735816"><title>Appendix 1: Massage Therapy Protocol</title><sec id="sec23-2164957X17735816"><title/><p>During their stay on the inpatient unit, patients randomized to the massage therapy group received 1 to 3 massage sessions a day with each session lasting 10 to 40&#x02009;min.
