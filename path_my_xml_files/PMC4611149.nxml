However, like deception, telling the truth is an inherently social construct, which requires consideration of another person's mental state, a phenomenon known as Theory of Mind. Using a novel ecological paradigm, we examined blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during social and simple truth telling. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 27) were randomly divided into two competing teams. Post-competition, each participant was scanned while evaluating performances from in-group and out-group members. Participants were asked to be honest and were told that their evaluations would be made public. We found increased BOLD responses in the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula and precuneus when participants were asked to tell social truths compared to simple truths about another person. At the behavioral level, participants were slower at responding to social compared to simple questions about another person. These findings suggest that telling the truth is a nuanced cognitive operation that is dependent on the degree of mentalizing. Importantly, we show that the cortical regions engaged by truth telling show a distinct pattern when the task requires social reasoning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>social reasoning</kwd><kwd>theory of mind</kwd><kwd>truth telling</kwd><kwd>social evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6084"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telling the truth is not a simple cognitive task. Honesty requires assessment of individual social situations and, in particular, consideration of another person's mental state, a phenomenon known as Theory of Mind (Frith, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Honesty about another person, in particular (and especially being brutally honest about that person), sometimes also requires us to put ourselves in that person's shoes, and to emotionally regulate ourselves accordingly&#x02014;to empathize, in other words (Decety and Jackson, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Thus, certain social situations make honesty particularly challenging: confessions of wrongdoing (Hilgendorf and Irving, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Deslauriers-Varin et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), difficult medical diagnoses (Buckman, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Fallowfield and Jenkins, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Shaw et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and statements that contradict dominant ideological or political points of view (Broun&#x000e9;us, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Anecdotally, these situations can cause us to blush, experience increased respiration, or feel our hearts beating more rapidly. The scale and scope of truth telling can be as simple as responding &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to a simple question, or as complex as admitting guilt in a criminal-legal situation. Furthermore, personal and cultural norms play a role in definitions of truth: valances attached to being honest are very different for different people and in different social situations (Bok, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Zahedi, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Thus, not only the definition of what a truth is, but also the experience of being asked to tell the truth, as well as the cognitive load <italic>of</italic> that telling, are very often mediated by social contexts: in short, humans assess complex social situations when faced with telling the truth (Sip et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>However, despite this social contingency, cognitive neuroscience studies often consider &#x0201c;truth&#x0201d; to be a clearly defined control condition. For example, some notable prior studies on neurobiological and cognitive components of deception attempted to control for social context(s), and in so doing, have taken truth conditions to be neutral baselines that can used to control for deceptive responses. Studies with more nuanced designs assumed truth as a baseline, in part, because it was not a variable of interest (Langleben et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bhatt et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); other studies disaggregated truth conditions from deception conditions on the basis that truth is a less active condition than deception (Spence et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Langleben et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Kozel et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Debey et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ito et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vartanian et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). With few exceptions (Mohamed et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Marques et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Verschuere et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hadar et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), truth telling has not been studied as a socially complex variable in recent fMRI studies. Indeed, one recent study characterizes its &#x0201c;truth/truth telling state&#x0201d; as &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; (Hu et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>: 6). While researchers have begun to treat deception within &#x0201c;a framework of social decision-making (see e.g., Abe et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Barrios et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Baumgartner et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Greene and Paxton, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bhatt et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Carri&#x000f3;n et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sip et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>)&#x0201d; (Sip et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the same cannot yet be said of truth telling. Yet, truth telling appears to meet Sip et al.'s (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) criteria for a &#x0201c;complex social interaction&#x0201d;&#x02014;in other words, it &#x0201c;involves a broad set of cognitive processes, including the ability (i) to determine the possible courses of action and to identify how they could be coordinated with the interlocutor, (ii) to weigh these available courses of action against one another, and (iii) to choose which action to perform next in the interaction&#x0201d; (Sip et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Our study began with two hypotheses: (1) we hypothesized that being asked to tell the truth engages areas of the brain that have previously been associated with mentalizing, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (Amodio and Frith, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and the insular cortex (Bernhardt and Singer, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), but only when truth telling required social reasoning compared to factual reasoning. This was based on the hypothesis that telling the truth in a social context requires predicting the mental point of view of another person and empathizing in terms of predicting the feelings of that person; (2) we hypothesized that these processes would be pronounced when telling the truth about in-group compared to out-group members. Hypothesis (1) was confirmed; hypothesis (2) was not confirmed.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we examined BOLD responses during truth telling that required complex social, inter-personal calculation, compared to truth telling about simple and impersonal physical attributes. The study design consisted of an ecological experiment that allowed us to create a realistic, yet controlled social situation among the participants. The experiment took place over 3 days. During this period, participants established team identities by competing against one another as members of two distinct choir-teams. After the competition, participants evaluated each other's singing performances in the MRI scanner. Crucially, participants believed that their evaluations would become public at a reunion luncheon, and were asked to &#x0201c;be honest&#x0201d; in their evaluations of fellow participants who had performed poorly. However, the only people who were actually evaluated were four actors, two men, and two women on each team. Participants were not informed that there were actors among them, and the actors were instructed to play the role of a participant without revealing their identities as actors. Further, the actors were instructed to be very likable, but to sing very poorly. Participants reported strong team-identification throughout the first day of the experiment. During a post-scan debriefing, nearly all participants were conscious of their answers and their revelation at the reunion luncheon. All participants believed that they were evaluating fellow participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (21 females) aged 20&#x02013;35 were recruited from local choirs in and around Aarhus, Denmark. We chose to recruit choir singers as participants for the study for two reasons: first, choir singing involves people's ability to perform individually within a collective, that is, individual singers must adjust their own voice to fit a group performance while simultaneously assessing the performance of their fellow singers. Second, as the study took place in Aarhus, Denmark, which is home to many different choirs, we found that choir singing adapted well to the social and cultural setting of the experiment. All participants completed &#x0201c;Day 1&#x0201d; of the study involving team-building. Three participants were excluded due to metal implants and one for anxiety. The remaining 23 volunteers (5 male, 18 female) participated in &#x0201c;Day 2&#x0201d; and fMRI scanning. Participants provided written informed consent as approved by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Institutional Review Board (#10084) and the Ethics Committee of the Central Denmark Region.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment included two parts that were inseparable: Day 1 consisted of an 8-h team-building behavioral experiment. Day 2 consisted of a 1-h fMRI session. Participants were led to believe that there would also be a Day 3 at a future date, in which all participants would be reunited with one another, their evaluations of each others performances would be revealed, and a winning team would be chosen.</p><p>Day 1:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Participants arrived together at the Department of Music at Aarhus University, Denmark, at 10:00 am. They gave written informed consent and were administered a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Measure (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). All participants passed the HADS and were approved by the on-team clinical psychologist (Tonks) for the experiment. The HADS measure ensured that our sample population was normal, healthy, and able to participate in a paradigm that was designed to create experimental stress.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants were then broken into two teams with equal proportions of males and females on each team.

Each condition comprised an epoch that started with a picture of the fellow participant followed by a question about her or him. A fixation cross was displayed between faces and questions with variable duration to induce a jittered inter-stimulus interval and increase design efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A <italic>social</italic> question was one that requested a subjective and evaluative opinion about the participant, e.g., &#x0201c;is Person X a poor singer?&#x0201d; A <italic>simple</italic> question did not require reasoning about the person beyond his or her physical appearance and did not put the participant's social relationships at stake for the formulation of a truthful response, e.g., &#x0201c;does Person X have brown hair?&#x0201d; The social and simple questions were formulated and validated in a separate pilot study in which 18 college-aged participants rated 40 possible questions on a social stressfulness scale from 1&#x02013;5. Each scan lasted 20 min and comprised a total of 80 randomized epochs. The subjects were required to answer &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; with their right-hand index finger or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; with their middle finger. Note that the answers were deliberately subjective and hence we took no measure of the accuracy of evaluations (a limitation that we discuss further below). The prediction that participants would give genuine or authentic responses responses was highly dependent on the ecological validity of the experimental situation that we had created. After the fMRI session, we revealed all deceptive elements of the experiment to the participants during a de-brief.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental paradigm</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-09-00553-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>fMRI acquisition</title><p>Functional images were acquired on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI Scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 32 channel RF head-coil. T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted echo planar images (EPI) consisting of 43 slices of 3 mm thickness per volume were acquired in interleaved fashion with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2.14 s, echo time (TE) = 27 ms, flip angle = 90&#x000b0;, field of view (FOV) = 192 &#x000d7; 192 mm, and in-plane resolution = 64 &#x000d7; 64. Soft cushions were used to minimize head movements. In parallel with EPI time-series, the participants' pulse and respiration were recorded using infrared pulse oximetry on the index finger and a pneumatic thoracic belt (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>fMRI data analysis</title><sec><title>Single-subject analysis</title><p>fMRI data analysis was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, revision 4667). The functional images of each subject were realigned (Friston et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1995a</xref>), spatially normalized to MNI space using the EPI template (Ashburner and Friston, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM. The time-series in each voxel was high-pass filtered at 128 s using a discrete cosine set to remove low-frequency drifts. Statistical analysis was implemented using a general linear model (Friston et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1995b</xref>). Regressors encoding the experimental design were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and fitted to the fMRI time-series. This also included a partition of no interest explaining the mere effects of visual stimuli and motor responses related to the button press. Serial correlations due to physiological noise were modeled using Nuisance Variable Regression (Lund et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), an alternative to the standard first-order autoregressive AR(1) model. Physiological oscillations that affect the hemodynamics, such as pulse (1 Hz) and respiration (0.2 Hz), are usually present in the EPI time-series in the form of aliased higher-frequency components expressed at lower frequencies due to undersampling at typical TRs of 0.5 Hz. The design matrix thus included a partition of nuisance regressors that reflected pulse and respiration in the form of their (theoretical) aliases and a partition modeling the instantaneous effect of head movement, its spin excitation history and their 2nd-order expansions (Friston et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Lund et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Group analysis</title><p>Linear contrast images were created for each subject testing for the main effects and the interaction of the 2 &#x000d7; 2 experimental conditions during the decision period when subjects responded to the question.

This was based on the intuition that telling the truth, specifically in a social context, requires predicting the mental point of view of another person and empathizing in terms of predicting the feelings of that person. We further hypothesized that these processes would be pronounced when telling the truth about in-group compared to out-group members.</p><p>In support of our first hypothesis, our findings show that formulating a response to social questions increases activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and precuneus, compared to formulating a response to simple factual questions. Activation of these regions is accompanied by significantly slower reaction times to social questions, both during in-group and out-group conditions. This indicates that being asked to tell the truth under conditions of potentially adverse social outcomes, may be associated with response inhibition, mediated by the anterior insula and prefrontal network. This activation pattern is almost identical to the pattern reported in well-controlled studies of deception. Such activation has also been associated with increased activation of areas that have been associated with mentalizing (Amodio and Frith, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), third-person perspective-taking (Vogeley et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and empathy (Bernhardt and Singer, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>We did not find any support for the second hypothesis concerning the in-group/out-group distinction in either the behavioral data or the fMRI data. We used an in-group/out-group paradigm because we hypothesized that this difference in social context would modulate the effects of social truth telling. While the hypothesized difference between in-group and out-group was not expressed in reaction times, the neuronal processes that mediate this contextual difference may have been too subtle to be revealed with BOLD fMRI or may require more statistical power, both within subjects and in terms of group sample size. This null finding will have to be rejected or replicated in future behavioral and neuroimaging studies.</p><p>In previous studies, the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex has been associated with theory of mind (Happ&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Adolphs, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), socially-complex, person-perceiving mentalizing tasks (Gallagher and Frith, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Frith and Frith, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Frith, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and inferring information about the emotional state of another person (Ochsner et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Mitchell et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Saxe and Powell, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Mitchell et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) have proposed a simulation theory in which activity in these regions may be associated with the prediction of others' states based on a subject's own experience (see also Lombardo et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Indeed, recent research has fine-tuned this account to propose a spatial mentalizing gradient in this brain area, associating the capacity to make judgments about self and others with a distributed gradient along the ventral to dorsal parts of the medial prefrontal cortex (Denny et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition, Coricelli and Nagel (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) showed that the medial prefrontal cortex is recruited by individuals using high-level reasoning (and expecting similar forms of reason from others) in a competitive context, thus supporting our suggestion that truth telling is associated with brain-areas related to complex and socially-mediated high-level cognition, and not always suitable as a control condition from which cognitively-taxing deception conditions can be disaggregated. Thus, we suggest that in conditions of socially-stressful truth telling, medial prefrontal activity may encode effects of our own choices and actions onto the thought and behavior of others. If Theory of Mind describes the capacity to attribute mentality to another, empathy is the ability to see a similarity between one's own feelings and those of another (Decety and Jackson, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This distinction is important for our study, where the design (participants assess others' poor performance, in the belief that they, too, will be the subjects of others' assessments) is sensitive to empathizing, in addition to Theory of Mind. Activation found in the anterior insula of our sample may also indicate feelings of empathy, and a sense of fellow-feeling from participants who recognize that telling an unpleasant social truth may have effects on another person, (Bernhardt and Singer, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In situations involving social truth telling, the speaker must manage, not only information about the question and content, but also the potential costs of revealing truths about another person. It has also been suggested that the medial prefrontal area is involved in planning for the future. Frith and Frith (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) suggest that activity in this area may be involved in predicting how others will think and feel, and in planning for the outcome of their experience of particular states. Our results support the interpretation that being asked to tell the truth requires an individual to take another person's perspective and to empathize in order to predict how others will think and feel.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>This study engages a new research area: socially stressful truth telling. As such, it contains several important limitations, each of which could be overcome in future experiments. First, while our experimental design is counterbalanced for perceived gender differences, there is a potential gender imbalance among our participant group (27 participants, 21 females) that may have affected the ingroup/outgroup dynamics. Our sample population was chosen from local choir singers, who are statistically more likely to be female (although choir singing remains a rare example of a competitive group activity in which make and female participants compete together). Future studies could include an equal number of male and female participates in the study. Second, because this study worked within a novel context of &#x0201c;socially stressful truth,&#x0201d; we did not have statistically&#x02013;validated question sets from which to choose. To develop our question set we ran a pilot study that consisted of a survey (completed by participants with similar demographic profiles to the final study participants) on the social-stress level of 40 questions, from which we chose the 20 most stressful questions. Future studies could benefit from our question bank and from more validated research into the range of questions that subjects in a particular group might identify as socially stressful. Third, we did not test the level of honesty among participants while they were undergoing scanning. We were interested in activation caused by <italic>being asked</italic> to tell a socially stressful truth, not in activation caused by <italic>telling</italic> a socially stressful truth. Nonetheless, follow-up studies&#x02014;particularly those that wish to focus on connections between activations caused by lying and activations caused by truth telling&#x02014;would likely incorporate new sets of questions that might be measured against a truth/deception scale and/or incorporate a set of pre and post interview questionnaires that would help to measure how truthful (or deceptive) the participant perceived themselves to be during the experimental scanning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicate that &#x0201c;truth&#x0201d; is not a simple or singular variable. We show that participants have slower reaction times and differential activation of the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and precuneus when asked to tell a social truth. Future research is needed to characterize the neuronal mechanisms that mediate various truth telling conditions, which could range from simple truth to social truth and beyond. Future studies might also take account of the potential neurobiological overlap between truth and lie conditions, which may pose a confounding effect on the isolation of either &#x0201c;truth&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;deception.&#x0201d; Our data suggests that being asked to tell a social truth may be mediated by context; and that certain kinds of truths are more consequential than other truths.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the European Neuroscience and Society Network (ENSN); the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation's University Investment Grant to MIND<italic>lab</italic>, Aarhus University; the University of Illinois Research Board, and the Center for Advanced Study and the Kinesiology and Community Health Department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
