This has been demonstrated in many studies with different situations such as postsurgical or nonsurgical conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The mechanisms of decreasing infectious complications by enteral nutrition are unknown, but it has been proposed that enteral nutrition maintains the normal gut mucosal barrier function, reducing bacterial and endotoxin translocation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and thus reduces the incidence of nosocomial infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that early enteral nutrition can decrease the duration of hospital stay for patients after surgery.</p><p>Studies of large administrative databases show that on average, patients with a diagnosis of postoperative ileus stay 5 days longer in the hospital after abdominal surgery than the patients without postoperative ileus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>However, gastrointestinal complications often limit the use of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients. A recent multi-center study found that up to 63% of patients suffered one or more gastrointestinal complications with enteral feeding; the most frequent complications were gastroparesis with high gastric residual volumes (39%), constipation (16%), diarrhea (15%), abdominal distension (13%), vomiting (12%), and regurgitation (6%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Over the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to minimize these complications and improve gastric tolerance in critically ill patients to achieve earlier discharge.</p><p>Prokinetic agents such as cisapride, metoclopramide, and erythromycin have been used to improve gastric motility, and there is no definitive evidence for the benefit of one over another.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Cisapride has a documented pro-arrhythmogenic effect. Its wide drug interactions are the most limiting factor of its use, and so, it is no longer available in some countries. Erythromycin prolongs the QT<sub>c</sub> interval and may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Also, its antibiotic effect may result in the growth of resistant microorganisms. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist and may cause extra-pyramidal reactions and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><p>Neostigmine is an acetylcholinsterase inhibitor that causes an increase in cholinergic (parasympathetic) activity in the gut wall, which is thus believed to stimulate colonic motility. There are several studies that show this effect of neostigmine practically in patients with postoperative ileus,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] intoxication with drugs which have ileus effect,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and colonic pseudo-obstruction.</p><p>The presence of massive dilatation of the colon in the absence of a mechanical obstruction is known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] It may by caused by a number of clinical conditions including trauma, major orthopedic surgery, severe medical illness, retroperitoneal pathology, metabolic imbalance, and regional anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] There are several studies reporting that neostigmine rapidly decompressed the colon in a group of patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction who had not responded to conservative treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>A bolus dose of 2 mg neostigmine is associated with bradycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and excess salivation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In 2001, Van der Spoell <italic>et al</italic>. conducted an investigation on the influence of 0.4-0.8 mg/h of neostigmine by continuous infusion in patients with colonic ileus and found that this method of administration promoted defecation in these critically ill patients without any appreciable adverse effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>We hypothesized that neostigmine may improve gastric motility by a similar mechanism as in Ogilvie's syndrome and, thereby, improve enteral feeding in critically ill patients.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neostigmine by intravenous infusion compared with placebo on tolerance to enteral feeding in critically ill patients in ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The protocol of this work was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Research Project Number 391451).

Tolerance of enteral feeding is very important and is reported immediately after vital signs of the patient in daily visits of ICU. It is because of the important effect of enteral feeding on the one of the greatest complications of hospitalization, which is &#x0201c;infection,&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] and also, its noticeable effect on the duration of hospitalization,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] which is very important economically and also a great healthy index.</p><p>Till now, there have been surgical procedures and pharmacological methods to facilitate this process and increase the tolerance of enteral feeding in patients, but each of them has their limitations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>One of the drugs that have been used in this field recently is neostigmine. Studies have reported different results about the effectiveness of neostigmine on the tolerance of enteral feeding, especially in patients in ICU.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Increased amplitude on electrogastrography was clearly demonstrated after administration of neostigmine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] But the most important effect of neostigmine that makes it the first choice for investigation in this field is its dramatic effect on recovering from pseudo-obstruction syndrome that is called Ogilvie's syndrome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the direct effect of neostigmine on the tolerance of enteral feeding in patients in ICU by the evaluation of related factors such as constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and volume of gastric lavage. Earlier, Lucey <italic>et al</italic>. investigated if neostigmine increases gastric emptying in critically ill patients, by the evaluation of gastric paracetamol absorption. In that study, it was shown that while neostigmine might have a positive effect on gastric emptying and enteral feed absorption, the results did not reach statistical significance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>Our study had a similar outcome. In our investigation, the groups matched well because there were no significant differences in the demographic data and SOFA index between them. With regard to the indices of enteral feeding tolerance, there were no significant differences between the two groups. By comparing these two studies with those on Ogilvie's syndrome, we can conclude that probably the pathophysiological mechanisms of these two settings are a little different. In other words, the gastric emptying may not be the only pathophysiological cause of gastrointestinal tolerance. On the other hand, the other effective factors on enteral tolerance, such as the last clinical underlying condition of the patient, history of underlying diseases, especially gut diseases or those affecting the gastrointestinal tract, duration and cause of being nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth) before the beginning of gavage, and any other unknown conditions, may have affected our study outcome.</p><p>Moreover, it is important to notice that two of the chief indicators of enteral intolerance, constipation and return of materials in gastric lavage, had noticeably lower incidence in the group that received neostigmine, which also had lower duration of hospitalization in the ICU, while not being statistically significant. We cannot omit this outcome simply, especially when we see that the dangerous adverse effects of neostigmine were not seen in any of the patients in the case group by this manner of administration.</p><p>One of the imitations of our study was inability to omit the effect of other drugs such as opiates and other confounding factors such as hypokalemia, which have noticeable role in gastrointestinal intolerance, especially in ICU patients. The other one was the limitation in increasing the dose of neostigmine. Maybe if our cases were younger, or more stable, they would have responded better to neostigmine, or we could have increased the dose of the drug without serious adverse effect. Matching of patients in the areas of the first diagnosis, intubation, and also ventilation state of them needs further studies to be conducted.</p><p>Of course, further evaluation of the effect of neostigmine on the tolerance of enteral feeding is a high potential subject for investigation and practical usage.</p><p>It is concluded that although neostigmine has high potential cholinergic effects, it was not significantly effective on the tolerance of enteral feeding in ICU patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are grateful to all the research assistants, especially Mr. Mehrabi, for their dedication and also to the patients who agreed to coordinate with us.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alverdy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of nutrition on gastrointestinal barrier function</article-title><source>Sem Respir Inf</source><year>1994</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>248</fpage><lpage>55</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Feliciano</surname><given-names>DV</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrassy</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>McArdle</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Booth</surname><given-names>FV</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgenstein-Wagner</surname><given-names>TB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Early enteral feeding, compared with parenteral, reduces post-operative septic complications.
