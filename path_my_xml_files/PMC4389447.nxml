including the myocardial revascularization. </p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p> To demonstrate the importance of physiotherapy in the preoperative period of
cardiac surgery in relation to the reduction of hospital stay, changes in lung
volumes and respiratory muscle strength. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> We conducted a prospective study with patients undergoing myocardial
revascularization, the Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas da Universidade Estadual Paulista
(UNESP)/Botucatu - SP. We evaluated 70 patients of both genders, aged between 40
and 75 years, subdivided into two groups: group I - 35 patients of both genders,
who received a written protocol guidance, breathing exercises and respiratory
muscle training in the preoperative period and group II - 35 patients of both
genders, who received only orientation of the ward on the day of surgery. This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of UNESP / Botucatu - SP. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Maximal inspiratory pressure in third postoperative day and fifth postoperative
day and significant difference between groups, being better for the intervention
group. Expiratory pressure was significant in fifth postoperative day in the
intervention group compared to controls. The difference of length of hospital stay
in the postoperative was found between the groups with shorter hospital stay in
the group receiving preoperative therapy. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p> Physical therapy plays an important role in the preoperative period, so that
individuals in the intervention group more readily restored the parameters
evaluated before surgery, in addition, there was a decrease in the time of the
postoperative hospital stay. Thus, it is thought the cost-effectiveness of a
program of preoperative physiotherapy.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><sec><title>Introdu&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o</title><p> Procedimentos cir&#x000fa;rgicos aumentaram progressivamente nas &#x000fa;ltimas d&#x000e9;cadas,

moments, mysticism, and fact understandable when we analyzed the noble importance of
this component for the proper functioning of the human body<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In recent decades the frequency of surgical procedures has progressively increased,
among them the myocardial revascularization (MR). Cardiovascular diseases are a serious
public health problem in Brazil<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In individuals over 70 years old it is estimated an incidence of 70% of coronary artery
disease. As the age is a determinant of coronary atherosclerosis, a growing number of
elderly people will be subjected to MR and/or other therapeutic methods<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The main risk factors that contribute to cardiac diseases are: smoking, high levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), low level of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension,
family history, lifestyle, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and alcohol intake as factors
related to atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) procedure is indicated for the treatment
of ischemic heart disease that is manifested clinically by angina and acute myocardial
infarction. The CABG surgery creates a new route for the blood flow and, is used for
making a diversion of blood to the portions of the coronary artery distal to the
obstructive atherosclerotic involvement<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>With the advancements in care of physical therapy in the preoperative period, surgical
techniques, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), techniques for myocardial protection,
anesthesia and intensive care in the post-operative period, there was a decrease in
morbidity and mortality of MR which caused the surgical indication in groups of patients
increasingly complex<sup>[<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Observing the fact that they are common pulmonary complications of CABG with CPB was
justified to carry out this research, there is great importance in properly carrying out
evaluations, guidelines and breathing exercises in the period before surgery, and
addition, observe the influence and duration of physical therapy assistance in the
preoperative period and also its behavior in the postoperative period.</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To demonstrate the importance of the role of physical therapy in the preoperative
period of cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation, in relation to the
respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary volumes and duration of hospital stay after
surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We performed a prospective clinical study, simple blind, in the period from July 2009 to
September 2011 in the ward of cardiac and thoracic surgery at Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas da
Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Botucatu-SP. We evaluated 70 patients of both
gender, age ranging from 40 to 75 years, undergoing CABG with use of CPB, randomized by
means of a computerized software (STATTREK) and delivered in a sealed envelope to the
physical therapist responsible for primary health care, subdividing into two groups:</p><p>- Group I (GI) - Thirty-five patients, undergoing physiotherapeutic intervention,
performed under supervision, once a day, during the period that preceded the surgery.
The protocol consisted of breathing exercises (breathing in time, deep breathing
followed by prolonged expiration, sustained maximal inspiration with apnea of 6 seconds,
and diaphragmatic breathing associated with the mobilization of the upper limbs) and
breathing exercises with threshold - IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Threshold - IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
Inspiratory Muscle Trainer, HealthscanProducts Inc.) at an intensity of 40% of the
initial MIP with three sets of ten repetitions, respecting two-minute intervals between
each series.</p><p>- Group II (GII) - thirty-five patients who did not undergo the physical therapy
protocol during the preoperative period, receiving only guidelines ward routine.</p><p>We included patients of both sexes, aged 40-75 years with coronary artery disease
admitted for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) MR, who agreed to
participate in the study. We excluded patients who require the use of intra-aortic
balloon, carrying pulmonary pathology, musculoskeletal impairment and severe
neurological surgery performed without CPB, emergency surgery, homodynamic instability,
and any event that threatens the integrity of patient or the fidelity of the measures
analyzed.</p><sec><title>Delimitation</title><p>All patients were evaluated by the same evaluator (preoperative period - PRE), third
postoperative (3PO) and fifth postoperative days (5PO), as well as received
physiotherapeutical treatment, according to their needs in the postoperative period
by physical therapy team in the hospital and only Group I received physiotherapy in
the preoperative period.</p><p>The variables evaluated were: body mass index (BMI) - criterion for obesity was a BMI
&#x0003e; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, smoking (patients who smoke or have smoked up to 30 days
before surgery and for former smokers those with a prior history, 30 days ago) as
well as the time of surgery, CPB, anoxia, IOT (defined by the sum between the
anesthesia time and the time that the patient remained with the endotracheal tube in
the intensive care unit - ICU), VM (IOT time defined by the time of ventilator
disconnection (when the patient was placed in spontaneous ventilation in the T-tube),
ICU stay (when the patient arrived in the intensive care unit until discharged to the
ward bed) and length of stay in the OP (obtained from the time that the patient
arrived in the ICU of the Cardio chest until the time of discharge.) All these data
were obtained by means of the daily developments of medical and nursing staff.</p><p>The assessment of respiratory muscle strength was obtained by measurement of
inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal voluntary expiratory (MEP) in the preoperative
period (PRE), 3PO and 5PO using analog manometer Commercial Medical<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> brand
spread over -120 to 120 cmH<sub>2</sub>O equipped with adapter buccal and nasal
forceps according to the technique described by Nephew et al. (2008). The MIP
measurement was performed from residual volume, and MEP was obtained from total lung
capacity. Three measurements were taken technically satisfactory, and if there were
more than 20% difference between the measurements, a fourth and even fifth
measurement would be performed, being always considered the highest value obtained.
The MIP was performed for evaluation of inspiratory muscle strength in three
different stages of the study (Pre, 3PO and 5PO), as well as to adjust the training
load (40% MIP) using the Threshold - IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Threshold - IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
inspiratory Muscle Trainer, HealthscanProducts Inc.). A small hole about one
millimeter (mm) was performed to prevent occlusion of the glottis and influence of
the buccinator muscles during MIP maneuver<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Mark Wright 8 display with 35 mm (FERRARIS) in PRE moments, 3PO and 5PO were used to
prevent lung volumes. The minute volume was obtained with the patient breathing for a
minute for a mouth connected to the spirometer. Tidal volume was obtained indirectly
by the relationship between the respiratory rate and minute volume (MV/FR), the two
volumes measured in milliliters (ml) and respiratory rate was measured in cycles per
minute (cpm) and obtained by direct observation of respiratory cycles during the
evaluation of the minute volume<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures/treatment</title><p>Patients allocated to the GI protocol underwent preoperative physiotherapy consisting
of breathing exercises (breathing in time, deep breath and then exhaling long,
sustained maximal inspiration with a 6-second apnea, diaphragmatic breathing
associated with mobilization of the upper limb, with three series out of ten for each
breathing exercise) and breathing exercises with the device Threshold -
IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. We conducted three sets of ten repetitions with an interval of
two minutes each repetition, once a day for every day of hospitalization in the PRE,
with a load of 40% of the initial MIP, obtained by manovacuometry<sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The GII patients received only guidelines ward routine before surgery, but
postoperatively, both groups performed physical therapy as needed by staff
physiotherapy service.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample should be made with at least 26 patients who were randomly divided into
two study groups (with physical therapy preoperatively and control patients who did
not receive preoperative physiotherapy). We considered the level of significance of
5% and a test power in the order of 80% for a minimum difference in the order of
two.</p><p>The comparison between the groups for age and body mass index (BMI) was performed by
Wilcoxon test for independent samples. The smoking variable was analyzed using
Goldman to compare proportions within and among multinomial populations. The
perfusion, anoxia, mechanical ventilation, anesthesia, surgery, ICU and postoperative
hospital stay were obtained in minutes and analyzed by Student's t test or the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. MIP, MEP, TV, MV and FR were assessed by Friedman
tests for comparison of the moments in each group and Mann Whitney test to compare
groups at each time, adopting a significance level of 5% probability of rejecting
null hypothesis.</p><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Estadual
Paulista (UNESP)/Faculty of Medicine of Botucatu (registration number 236/2009,
protocol 3223) and all patients signed an informed consent form.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Seventy patients were divided into two groups, Group I composed of 35 patients (12

that performing preoperative physiotherapy is more effective in reducing respiratory
complications in patients with moderate or higher risk than those whose risk was
low.</p><p>In the present study, we observed no significant difference between the subjects of
Group I and Group II as the characteristics (age, BMI, smoking and number of co
morbidities), which suggests that the study subjects in both groups were
homogeneous.</p><p>In the study by Leguisamo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>,
with 86 patients undergoing CABG, divided into two groups: the intervention group (44
patients) who were assessed and received physiotherapeutic guidance at least 15 days
before surgery. The control group received routine care on the day of
hospitalization.</p><p>The average MIP between groups showed neither significant difference in the preoperative
period nor in the 1PO and 6PO.</p><p>In the present study it was observed that there was no significant difference between
groups to measure MIP in the preoperative period, but now in times of 3PO and 5PO
significant difference between groups was found. Similarly, no significant difference in
the amount of MEP preoperatively in the 3PO and between groups. However in 5PO, there
was significant difference between the groups with the best values of the group that
performed physical therapy before surgery.</p><p>Barros et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> evaluated the MIP
and MEP in the preoperative period, the first day after surgery and in 38 patients
undergoing CABG with CPB who were divided into two groups: 23 patients in group I
(respiratory muscle training) and 15 in group II (control). Group I received
conventional physiotherapy over respiratory muscle training and Group II the
conventional physiotherapy. The authors found that the values obtained for MIP and MEP
in hospital discharge were higher in group I.</p><p>There was no decrease in maximal respiratory pressures, transdiaphragmatic pressure and
diaphragm pressure, indicating weakness of respiratory muscle strength<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Agreeing with the authors cited above, we observed in the present study, after cardiac
surgery, MIP values in GI and GII which decreased in 3PO, however the value of MIP in
5PO increase was observed for GI values compared to those in PRE and 3PO since the GII
values remained stable in 3PO. The authors noted the drop in MEP in 3PO in both groups,
however, in 5PO MEP has increased in GI. Regarding PRE and 3PO in GII no return value
was observed in PRE.</p><p>Arc&#x000ea;ncio et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> conducted a study
with 30 patients, aged 50 years-old and candidates for CABG and / or heart valve,
dividing into two groups. Intervention group comprised 15 patients who underwent at
least a two weeks inspiratory muscle training using incentive spirometry ("Threshold -
IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) with 40% charge of the MIP and control group with 15 patients who
received only general guidelines. The authors compared the spirometric values before and
after training and showed no significant difference in the values of MIP and
MEP<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Elias et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> studied 42 patients
aged 18 to 75 years-old with coronary artery disease, in the pre-and postoperative
period, divided into two groups. Intervention group received TMR with Threshold -
IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and control group received only guidelines. The TMR both pre and
post-operative period consisted of three sets of 10 inspiratory exercises once a day for
three consecutive days. It was observed that after cardiac surgery there was a
significant reduction in MIP and MEP in both groups.</p><p>Morsch et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> conducted a study to
evaluate 108 patients undergoing elective CABG surgery from April 2006 to February 2007
(preoperatively and postoperatively).</p><p>The average values of MIP in the preoperative period were significantly decreased
compared to 6 days after the surgery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The authors also
observed a significant decrease in the values of MEP obtained on the 6<sup>th</sup>
postoperative day compared to the preoperative period (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Patients with respiratory muscle weakness have higher risk of postoperative pulmonary
complications. The respiratory muscle training in the pre-operative may prevent
pulmonary complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. There may be a reduction of all lung
volumes resulting from factors such as diaphragmatic dysfunction, pain, absence of deep
breaths, pulmonary changes and ribcage. The functional residual capacity (FRC) decreases
because of the reduction of both the residual volume (RV) and expiratory reserve volume.
The ventilation is affected by VC reduction by approximately 20%, and the increase in
FR<sup>(22-24)</sup>. The sum of these factors cause changes in the mechanics of
respiration, which leads to a shallow breathing pattern of decreased lung
volume<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Patients undergoing CABG develop mostly PO pulmonary dysfunction with a significant
reduction in lung volumes, impairments in respiratory function, decreased lung
compliance and increased work of breathing. The reduction in lung volumes and capacities
contributes to changes in gas exchange, resulting in hypoxemia<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the VM showed significant difference regarding the groups I and II in the
preoperative period but not significant between groups in 3PO. Likewise, the mean value
of the VM for the GI 5PO, there was no significant difference in the GII. The mean value
of VC in PRE in GI was significant, as the mean value of the VC in GII patients, however
in GI and GII we observed in 5PO and 3PO that there was no significant difference. It
was observed in GI at different times that the increase of VM will be very likely due to
increased FR, since the current VC remained without many changes between different
times.</p><p>Barros et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> demonstrated a
significant decrease in lung volumes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the
postoperative period.</p><p>Carvalho et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> observed a
decrease in the values of minute volume and tidal volume measured on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
postoperative day, however, these values showed gradual improvement returning to the
values obtained at baseline (preoperative period) at the time of hospital discharge.</p><p>In a study, Guizilini et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>
evaluated 30 patients with a mean age of 56 years and divided into two groups, group A
(n=15) without CPB and group B (n=15) with CPB. All patients underwent pulmonary
function. In both groups, there was a decrease in FVC until the fifth postoperative day
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Regarding the respiratory rate in the present study, we can verify that there was an
increase in both groups, with a higher peak on the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day and
decreased on the 6<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, but the respiratory rate did not
return to the preoperative values, Carvalho et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> already mentioned above that they concluded in their studies
that the mean respiratory frequency had a significant increase between pre and
2<sup>nd</sup> PO, 3<sup>rd</sup> PO, decreasing on the 4<sup>th</sup> postoperative
day and increased again on the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day and decreased in
hospital discharge, but patients did not return to the preoperative values.</p><p>According to the results obtained in this study, we can affirm that there was no
significant difference between the groups regarding the time variables: anesthesia,
surgery, perfusion, anoxia, mechanical ventilation, intubation. This suggests that the
groups were quite homogeneous. As for the time of postoperative hospital stay, there was
a decrease of approximately 25 hours, comparing patients who underwent physical therapy
before surgery with patients who did not.</p><p>In contrast to the findings of this study, Patman et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> performed a randomized study of 236 patients to
evaluate the effects of physical therapy interventions performed early versus only
started after extubation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and no significant
differences were found in the time of intubation, ICU stay and length of hospital stay
between the groups.</p><p>However, Celli et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> conducted a
study with 172 patients and showed a decrease in length of hospital stay in the group
that had received guidelines breathing exercises (9.6&#x000b1;3.2 days) compared to the control
group (13&#x000b1;5 days).</p><p>Corroborating these findings, as well as those obtained in the present study, Leguisamo
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> performed a prospective
study to evaluate the effectiveness of a physiotherapy program start in the preoperative
period in reducing the length of hospital stay and showed a significant reduction in
length of hospital stay for the intervention group compared to the control group
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>These data suggest that physical therapy initiated before surgery can improve conditions
of patients, reestablishing early respiratory pressures, reducing the length of stay and
decreased hospital costs for the period of hospitalization.</p><sec><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The major limitation was the short period of time that patients received preoperative
physiotherapy; however, we understand that physiotherapeutic treatment had a
relevance even in a short period, so the study may add knowledge of response to
therapy performed during intraoperative CABG surgery.</p><p>Not performing spirometry can be mentioned as a limitation on the analysis of
ventilation parameters, however, due to the conditions offered by our service, we
could not perform this evaluation.</p><p>On the other hand, the results showed that even with limited time monitoring in the
preoperative period and respiratory variables obtained only by respirometry and
manometry in physical therapy in the preoperative period, proved to be beneficial for
patients undergoing surgery CABG.</p><p>We understand that the results may open up new avenues of future research related to
the role of physiotherapy in preoperative myocardial revascularization, in addition,
further studies should be conducted using tools such as spirometry, to assess and
quantify the volume and lung capacity more accurately.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The physical therapy has an important role in the preoperative period, restoring greater
readiness ventilatory parameters of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting
