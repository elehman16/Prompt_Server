Neutrophils are the key cells involved in the series of events, which includes release of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS include oxygen-derived free radicals, such as superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Varieties of these molecules appear in the inflamed tissues and are capable of damaging lipids, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid, ultimately leading to tissue destruction. This oxidative stress phenomenon is believed in part to be responsible for the inflammatory conditions affecting the periodontium, manifesting as gingivitis and periodontitis.</p><p>Antioxidants are groups of substances that are able to prevent the oxidation of substrate by these ROS, thereby offering protection. Currently, there is growing interest in the linkage between antioxidants and periodontal disease. A significant antioxidant enzyme within mammalian tissues is superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Superoxide dismutase has also been localized within the human periodontal ligament and may represent an important defense mechanism within gingival cells against superoxide release.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Na <italic>et al</italic>. found markedly increased levels of Mn&#x02013;superoxide dismutase in inflamed gingival tissue compared with healthy gingiva indicating superoxide dismutase activity increases with the progression of inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The thiol antioxidants are reduced glutathione, glutaredoxin, and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine. Thiols are part of the intraprotein structure and exist in equilibrium with the disulfide group. They prevent the irreversible unfolding of the protein structure due to oxidative stress. Chapple observed that the detection of a low molecular weight thiol in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is an important defense mechanism against unwanted ROS-mediated damage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>However, reports on the relationship between antioxidant status and periodontitis have not been consistent. Moore <italic>et al</italic>. observed no difference in the amount of total antioxidants in the saliva of periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of intrinsic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase enzyme and thiol, in the periodontal environment, their variation in different stages of periodontal disease and how nonsurgical treatment can have an impact on the antioxidant profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients referred to the outpatient department of Periodontics at the Manipal College of Dental Sciences in Manipal, India, for treatment, were considered for participation in the study. An informed consent was obtained from those willing to participate in the study. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained by the Kasturba Hospital Ethical Committee at Manipal in India prior to the commencement of the study.</p><p>Seventy healthy volunteers were selected for the study, which included 39 males and 31 females, within the age range of 20&#x02013;55 years. The periodontal status of the subjects was determined by measuring the Plaque Index (PI) (Silness and Loe, 1964),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Gingival Index (GI) (Loe and Silness, 1963)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>], pocket probing depths, and clinical attachment levels. The subjects were categorized based on the following criteria: periodontally healthy patients had no attachment loss, no probing depths more than 3 mm at any site, and GI score of less than 1. Subjects with gingivitis had a GI score &#x0003e; 1, probing depth &#x0003c; 4 mm, and absence of bone loss radiographically. Periodontitis was considered if at least two nonadjacent sites per quadrant with probing pocket depth &#x0003e; 5 mm were present and demonstrated radiographic bone loss. Following clinical examination, data were recorded and patients were allocated into different groups. Twenty-four patients were categorized as having gingivitis, 23 patients were diagnosed as having periodontitis and 23 patients were periodontally healthy subjects. The periodontitis group was further classified based on the clinical attachment loss as mild (1&#x02013;2 mm), moderate (3&#x02013;4 mm), and severe (&#x02265;5 mm) subgroups.</p><p>Patients who were on anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial therapy, or mouth rinses within the past 3 months, previous or current smokers, pregnant and lactating women, and those on dietary supplements were excluded from the study.</p><p>Initially, salivary samples were collected from the patients, followed by sampling of the GCF. Subsequent to sampling, thorough scaling and root planing (wherever necessary) was performed and the patients were given appropriate oral hygiene instructions. Patients were recalled 15 days post-treatment for reassessment of biochemical and clinical parameters. Salivary and GCF samples were obtained and stored till analysis. The antioxidant concentrations were analyzed using spectrophotometric assay.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sampling of Saliva</title><p>Whole saliva was collected in glass beakers and transferred into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 503 &#x000d7; g at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 min.

The strips were inserted into the pockets until a slight resistance was felt and held in the sulci for 30 s with delicate care to avoid irritation of pocket/sulcus epithelium. Any paper contaminated with blood was discarded and collection was repeated in another point. To ensure sufficient assay sensitivity, 12 strips were used for each arch.

In a previous study, patients with chronic periodontitis were reported to show high levels of lipid peroxidation in the GCF, indicating destruction of tissue by ROS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>It was observed that the superoxide dismutase activity and thiol antioxidant concentration significantly improved following therapy in all the patient groups, suggesting a positive response to nonsurgical therapy. Therefore, treatment of periodontal disease reduces oxidative stress by a concomitant reduction in inflammatory load by enhancing antioxidant levels, irrespective of the medium, GCF or saliva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The healthy control group also showed improvement indicating that a minimal level of inflammation must have been present since it is rare that an individual will have &#x0201c;pristine&#x0201d; gingiva. There was an increase of the antioxidants&#x02019; concentration post-treatment showing a definite link between even minor levels of inflammation and sensitivity of the antioxidant system. According to Ghezzi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] even minimal levels of oxidative stress are perceived and the protective antioxidant mechanism is set into action, which is essential for the maintenance of the structural integrity of proteins. This may explain the increased concentration observed post-treatment in the present study.</p><p>In the present study, superoxide dismutase presented higher levels in the GCF compartment than in saliva indicating its protective role in this environment. Previous reports indicate that the activity of this enzyme is very low in the extracellular compartments compared with the tissue-related environments and has very less biologic relevance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] but in spite of this, saliva still showed variation in periodontal disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The varied response of superoxide dismutase in the GCF and saliva may also be attributed to the fact that superoxide dismutase has differential expression and distribution of its isoforms in tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Hence, superoxide dismutase activity in GCF may therefore be representative of inflammatory changes in the periodontal environment. GCF has previously been suggested to be the most appropriate fluid to sample when investigating periodontal status, because it passes through the tissues and accumulates biomarkers of tissue events.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The levels of thiol antioxidant, in contrast, were similar in GCF and salivary compartments.</p><p>Superoxide dismutase in GCF was observed in reduced quantities in the gingivitis and periodontitis groups compared with the healthy group but improves considerably after treatment in all the groups. It was also observed that thiol concentration was lesser in the gingivitis and periodontitis groups compared with the healthy group. These findings are in accordance with the reported literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The lower concentrations of thiol antioxidants in the periodontitis group can be attributed to the presence of periodontopathic pathogens that readily degrade them to form hydrogen sulfide, which can be toxic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>In the GCF, superoxide dismutase concentration was seen to be considerably elevated in mild and moderate periodontitis patients as compared to sites with severe periodontitis. The state of disease activity within the pockets in these subjects may be a contributory factor in the increased utilization of superoxide leading to an exhaustion of local antioxidants. It may be construed that in deep pockets, nonsurgical treatment alone may not reduce the inflammatory load sufficiently to enhance the antioxidant status. Deeper pockets will require surgical intervention to completely eliminate the reservoirs of inflammation. This has also been recognized by Ellis <italic>et al</italic>. in 1998 who observed that pockets with probing depths more than 6 mm had a significant depletion of superoxide dismutase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>In the periodontitis group, the thiol antioxidants in GCF showed improvement in mild and moderate as well as severe periodontitis subgroups after treatment. This may be due to thiol antioxidants coordinating many biologic responses to inflammation and immunity. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. found that within periodontitis subjects, glutathione peroxidase levels correlated negatively with pocket depth and attachment loss and increased post-therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It has also been stated that while therapy does not fully restore reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations in GCF, it does restore the redox balance [Reduced glutathione or gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycine (GSH) to oxidized glutathione or glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio], suggesting that the abnormal redox balance arises secondary to oxidative stress resulting from periodontal inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>Reduced amounts of salivary thiol levels were observed in the gingivitis and periodontitis groups compared with the healthy group. A comparable decrease was evident in severe subgroup of periodontitis, which was greater than in the mild and moderate subgroups. However, no differences were noted between groups. Chapple <italic>et al</italic>. in 1997 noted a similar observation where salivary total antioxidant capacity was reduced in periodontitis cases compared with controls.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>Treatment resulted in increase in salivary thiol concentrations in gingivitis and periodontitis groups and the periodontitis subgroups, which was statistically significant within groups but not between groups. Similar observations were made by Tsai <italic>et al</italic>. who found that salivary glutathione concentrations were significantly reduced in periodontitis subjects relative to controls and that treatment increased glutathione concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The present clinical trial was conducted over a short period of time to assess the effect of nonsurgical therapy alone. However, more definitive results may be obtained with longer periods of follow up as well as by the institution of surgical modality of treatment, in cases of periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Oxidative stress is gaining increased relevance in relation to the inflammatory process and it is highlighted as one of the major reasons for manifestation of disease.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Antioxidant concentration was seen to be in progressively decreasing quantities from healthy subjects to patients with gingivitis and periodontitis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased severity of periodontitis was also associated with gradual decrease in antioxidant concentration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The two groups of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and thiol showed improvement in &#x0201c;healthy,&#x0201d; gingivitis and periodontitis groups following nonsurgical therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Concentration of the two antioxidants within the mild and moderate as well as severe subgroups also improved post-treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decrease in inflammatory component was associated with an increase in the antioxidant profile.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Superoxide dismutase was seen to be in higher concentrations in GCF than in saliva.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Thiol antioxidant showed similar profiles in the GCF and saliva.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>It can therefore be construed that nonsurgical treatment by itself can bring about a significant improvement in periodontal health as demonstrated by heightened antioxidant levels in the gingival crevice and salivary compartments. The findings of the study restate the importance of continued monitoring of patients with supportive periodontal therapy as enhanced antioxidant status was evident in the apparently &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; group as well. There are limited studies focusing on the antioxidant profile following nonsurgical treatment. Hence, the information obtained from this study may provide scope for use of external antioxidant therapy in the management of periodontitis, especially among those patients refractory to conventional treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the postgraduates and faculty of the department of Biochemistry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India for their help throughout the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Canacki</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Cicek</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Canacki</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reactive oxygen species and human inflammatory periodontal diseases</article-title><source>Biochemistry (Mosc)</source><year>2005</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>619</fpage><lpage>28</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16038603</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fridovich</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub>-), Superoxide dismutases and related matters</article-title><source>J Biol Chem</source><year>1997</year><volume>272</volume><fpage>515</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacoby</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The electron microscopic immunolocalization of a copper&#x02013;zinc superoxide dismutase in association with collagen fibers of periodontal soft tissues</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1991</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>413</fpage><lpage>20</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1920007</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>OS</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Expression of Superoxide dismutase isoforms in inflamed gingiva</article-title><source>J Korean Acad Periodontol</source><year>2006</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>97</fpage><lpage>112</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chapple</surname><given-names>IL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of free radicals and antioxidants in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory periodontal diseases</article-title><source>Mol Pathol</source><year>1996</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>55</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Calder</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice-Evans</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antioxidant activity of saliva and periodontal disease</article-title><source>Free Radic Res</source><year>1994</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>417</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7834056</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal Disease in Pregnancy.
