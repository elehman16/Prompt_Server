This good result may be due to sufficient permeation of the cryoprotectants into the ovarian tissue and equilibration with stepwise cryopreservation can improve the success of cryopreserving follicles in various stages of development.</p><p>Vitrification is a useful technique which has recently been applied for cryopersavation of ovarian tissues because this method has minimal change in morphology and ultrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A disadvantage of the vitrification procedure, however, is the necessity of high cryoprotectant concentrations, which can cause cell damage because of their toxicity.</p><p>This adverse effects can be limited by cryopreservation strategy such as the use of a combination of vitrification solutions, each at a relatively low concentration, and therefore promoting dehydration by the increasing stepwise of solution and the inclusion of non-permeating solution in the vitrifying mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the main challenge is to achieve the optimum composition for a cryoprotectant with low biologic toxicity level which helps to vitrificaton cooling.</p><p>The results of previous study, reported that vitrification of mouse ovarian tissue using a combination of EG and sucrose achieving better results than using only EG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The use of macromalcule such as disaccharides in cryopersavation method could help to prevent ice crystal formation and facilitate cryoprotectant penetration.</p><p>In this study, two type of degeneration was observed after vitrifying/thawing of ovarian tissue. The most predominant degeneration type was characterized by the disruption of intercellular contacts among innermost granulosa cells and the oocyte. Communication between oocyte and granulosa cells is necessary for endocytotic way and to the zona pellucida formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This type of degeneration was observed most often in secondary follicles of all vitrified groups, although observed in CV7 group at very low rates.</p><p>The other type of degeneration was characterized by shrinkage of the oocyte, disarrangement of granulosa cells and cytoplasmic vacuolization. This kind of degeneration was observed with great frequency in secondary follicles of ovarian tissue vitrified in single cryoprotectant.</p><p>Ultrsractural assessment of tissue samples gives much more detailed information about structural cryodamage of the cell than histological examination. Our ultrastructural studies showed that after freezing-thawing of ovaries in CV7 group, no noticeable changes occurred in the organelles of oocytes and follicular cells. The integrity of cell organelles was well preserved.</p><p>The mitochondrial organization, cytoskeletal arrangement and vacuolization are necessary key for cryopreservation assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The mitochondria are very important to the energy producing, metabolic activation and regulating cell survival. In the ovaries vitrified by single cryoprotectant, we showed that elongated and swollen mitochondria consistently present in all the follicular developmental stages, suggesting that the mitochondria were going through an apoptosis process. Wherever Green and Reed demonstrated the mitochondria alternations are the central regulator of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The movement of mitochondria within different areas of the cell is mediated by cytoskeletal network of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Reduction of cytoskeletal observed in vitrified oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, actin filament are the cytoskeletal core of microvili, are very sensitive to cryopreservation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The vacuolization and lipid droplets distribution is a sign of degeneration and shrinkage of oocyte after vitrifying/thawing of ovarian tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], these vacuole may represent altered mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ultrastractural analysis showed that the vitrification of ovarian tissue by single cryoprotectant characterized by lipid droplets and vacuole accumulation in the cytoplasm of secondary follicles. These alternations could be due to inadequate dehydration or concentration of cryoprotectant agents, resulted to the ice formation and damaged the organelle of granulosa cells and oocyte.</p><p>Our histological and ultrastractural analysis showed that secondary follicles are susceptible to cryoprotectant than the primordial and primary follicles. In agreement with Choi J et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], after vitrifying/thawing the least damage was observed in the primordial follicle due to small size, absence of the zona pellucida and less metabolically active.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggested that the double cryoprotectant in stepwise increasing concentration used in the present study may be appropriate for ovarian tissue vitrification. This method facilitated the exchange of water by cryoprotectant, therefore protect ovarian tissue from cryodamage and can be used to improve fertility among cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors report no competing interest.
