continue to show the importance of commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract in
stimulating and directing the immune system. The interest in modulating commensal bacteria
flora with pre- and probiotics to prevent and treat food allergy has multiplied in recent
years. We recently studied 230 infants with atopic dermatitis and suspected cow&#x02019;s milk
allergy. The infants were randomly allocated to groups which received
<italic>Lactobacillus</italic> GG (LGG), a mixture of four probiotic strains (MIX) or
placebo for 4 weeks. We inferred that probiotics induce systemically detectable low-grade
inflammation, which may explain the clinical effects and the secretion pattern of
cytokines induced by PBMC. To study the ability of probiotics to prevent allergy in
children, we recruited 1223 pregnant women carrying fetuses at increased risk of allergy
for a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Mothers used a mixture of four probiotic
bacteria or a placebo from the 36th week of gestation. Their infants received the same
probiotics plus prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides for 6 months. At the 2-year follow-up,
a total of 925 infants participated. The cumulative incidence of allergic disease did not
differ significantly between the synbiotic and the placebo group. However, synbiotics
significantly reduced eczema. The preventive effect of synbiotics was more pronounced
against IgE-associated diseases. At the 5 year follow-up, 891(88%) of the 1018
intention-to-treat infants attended. In the probiotic and placebo groups, frequencies of
allergic symptoms and IgE-associated allergic disease and sensitization were similar, and
the frequencies of eczema did not differ between the groups. Atopic eczema, allergic
rhinitis and asthma appeared equal frequency in the groups. However, less IgE-associated
allergic disease occurred in the cesarean-delivered infants given probiotics. In
cesarean-delivered childen, we noticed a delayed rise in bifidobacteria recovery in
placebo-treated children which was corrected by pro- and prebiotic supplementation.
Indications from studies of feces and blood at the age 6 months suggest that probiotics
may enhance both inflammation and immune defence of the gut. The probiotic treatment
further stimulated maturation of the immune system since the infants given probiotics
showed increased resistance to respiratory infections and improved vaccine antibody
responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Probiotics</kwd><kwd>Prebiotics</kwd><kwd>Synbiotics</kwd><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> strain GG</kwd><kwd>Allergic diseases</kwd><kwd>Cow&#x02019;s milk allergy</kwd><kwd>Double-blind placebo-controlled trial</kwd><kwd>SCORAD index</kwd><kwd>Skin prick tests</kwd><kwd>IgE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The prevalence of allergic diseases in children has increased markedly in the past few
decades. According to several published studies in Finland, the total prevalence of allergic
symptoms during childhood has risen 8-fold from 1950 to 1995. In 1950, 5% of children had some
type of allergic symptom while recent studies report a prevalence of 40% [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, an increase has taken place in all developed
highly hygienic countries. In 1976 Canadian paediatrician Gerrard concluded that the increase
in allergic diseases is the price to be paid for the relative freedom from diseases due to
viruses, bacteria and helminths in infancy and early childhood [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The so-called hygiene hypothesis was formulated later by Strachan [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Based on the lower prevalence of allergy in families
with large numbers of children than in small sibships, he proposed that high prevalence of
infections in large families stimulates more Th1 cells, reciprocally inciting the Th2
population [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemiologic studies show that a
particularly high prevalence of infections such as hepatitis A in the gastrointestinal tract,
is associated with lower prevalence of allergies [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
Several environmental factors encountered in central European farms during infancy have
resulted in the lower prevalence of allergic diseases and sensitization in children [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the defect in the stimulation of Th1 cells in
the development of allergic diseases in the same environment and the prevalence of autoimmune
diseases has increased in a similar manner [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both
arms of effector T cells have been shown to be regulated by T regulatory cells and these cell
populations play an important role in the development of autoimmunity, self tolerance and
allergic diseases [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Stimulation by the huge and active commensal bacterial flora in the intestine during early
life is important in directing the development of regulatory T cells and tolerance. Their
action is probably mediated by the innate immune system. The sterile gut of the newborn is
gradually colonized by environmental bacteria. Vaginally born infants acquire the microbiota
having the strongest association with mother&#x02019;s colon [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cesarean section delays colonization by <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>,
<italic>Lactobacilli</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Later, the type of feeding
influences the initial colonization [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Human milk
oligosaccharides promote the growth and activity of <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and
<italic>Lactobacilli</italic> [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which more
abundantly colonize breast-fed than formula-fed infants [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In unhygienic environments, the commensal gut flora has a high diversity and a
high turnover rate [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such conditions, related to
decreased risk of allergy, provide continuous exposure to an extensive array of bacteria in
drinking water and in the soil and constantly stimulate the immune system [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Several associations exist between commensal microbiota and the development of allergic
diseases during childhood. In Estonia, at the time of this study, there was a low prevalence
of allergy, and the microbiota of healthy infants was different from that of infants in
Sweden, a country with a high prevalence of allergy [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In prospective studies, early fecal samples of infants who go on to develop
allergies, compared to those who remain healthy, grew less <italic>Enterococci</italic>,
<italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, and more
<italic>Clostridia</italic> and <italic>Staphylococci</italic> [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the feces of 5 year-old Estonian children, those with allergic
diseases had fewer common <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> than those without allergy, while
<italic>Clostridia</italic> was more common in allergic children [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Japanese infants developing early allergy have different
<italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> species compared to non-allergic infants; in particular,
they have an adult type of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> (<italic>catenulatum</italic>)
which has been described as appearing earlier than in other populations [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In an experimental animal model of food allergy, the gut microbiota
and its stimulatory action on innate immune system by toll-like receptors (TLR), particularly
TLR4, is of paramount importance. In germ-free mice food tolerance does not develop, but is
inducible after colonisation of the intestine [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
Mice susceptible to food allergies have a mutation in TLR4, blocking its signalling [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Altering the intestinal microbiota of an individual is a potential treatment for allergic
symptoms as well as for the prevention of the development of allergies. Probiotic bacteria are
&#x0201c;live micro-organisms, which administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the
host&#x0201d; [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They are a heterogeneous group of bacteria
with specific biological activities. <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Streptococci</italic> strains are most commonly
selected from among human microbiota or dairy-product starters.
<italic>Lactobacilli,</italic>
<italic>Bifidobacteria,</italic> and
<italic>Propionibacteria</italic> belong to the lactic acid bacteria group.</p><p>Probiotics may directly affect the immune system of the host or change the microbiota of the
host; and in that way may either prevent or ameliorate allergies. Prebiotics are indigestible
substances that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/ or the
activity of a limited number of bacterial strains established in the gut; thereby having an
impact on allergies. The term synbiotics may be used for a combination of these pre- and
probiotics, and combination preparations have been used in the treatment and prevention of
allergic diseases.</p><sec id="s1"><title>TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC DISEASES</title><p>Ten randomized clinical trials have compared the effect of probiotics with that of a
placebo preparation in infants and children with eczema (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The first study by Majamaa and Isolauri [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported the effect of <italic>Lactobacillus
rhamnosus</italic> strain GG (LGG) in the treatment of eczema in 42 infants referred to a
hospital for suspected cow&#x02019;s milk allergy (CMA). LGG was given open-label for one month to
11 breast-feeding mothers or directly to 15 infants receiving extensively hydrolyzed formula
(EHF). In the control group delete, 16 infants received only EHF. In the final analysis, 37
of 42 infants undergoing a positive cow&#x02019;s milk challenge after the intervention were
included. Among these 37, the SCORAD index [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]
improved significantly in the 13 formula-fed infants receiving LGG and in the 10 breast-fed
infants whose mothers received LGG. In the 14 control infants, the index remained unchanged.
However, at 2 months the eczema was healed in both study groups. Isolauri&#x02019;s study included
27 infants suffering from eczema during exclusive breast-feeding. Nine were weaned onto EHF,
9 infants onto the same formula with added LGG, and 9 infants received the formula with
added <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> Bb12. After 2 months, infants receiving the
probiotic-containing formula showed less severe eczema, whereas in the placebo group no
improvement was observed. Six months later, eczema had improved in all infants, with no
difference in incidence between the study groups [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Rosenfedlt et al. [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] studied 43 children aged 1 to
13 with eczema, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover setting with a combination
of 2 strains of bacteria (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A
significantly greater proportion (56%) of patients experienced improvement after active
treatment than after placebo (15%). A greater decrease in SCORAD score was seen in patients
with atopic constitution after probiotic treatment than after placebo.</p><p>We invited infants below the age of 12 months with eczema and suspicion of CMA to
participate in a double-blind placebo controlled study evaluating the effects of two
probiotic treatments. Of the 230 participants, 80 received LGG, 76 a mixture of 4 bacteria
strains and 74 placebo preparation for 4 weeks [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
All were put on an EHF and effective topical care was advised at the beginning of the study.
Patients&#x02019; SCORAD was evaluated before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment and again after
4 weeks on EHF. At that time eczema was healed to the extent that a double-blind placebo
controlled CM challenge (DBPC) test could be done; it was positive in 120. The reduction of
SCORAD scores were comparable across the study groups: whether they had CMA or not, did not
have an effect. IgE sensitization was studied by skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE
concentrations (Pharmacia CAP system); 136 were sensitized. The treatments had significantly
different effects if the infants had IgE sensitization; among them LGG gave superior results
compared to placebo (p=0.036) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG), a mixture of 4 probiotic strains

(SCORAD&#x0003e;30). A large percentage of the patients had received antibiotics during treatment
and their number differed in the treatment groups. When they were eliminated, the effect of
LGG was more pronounced among patients with IgE-associated diseases and SCORAD &#x0003e;30
(p=0.008). Fecal samples proved that colonization with the supplemented probiotics was
successful. Total counts of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> increased in the probiotic groups,
but decreased in the placebo group.</p><p>Of the 10 published studies on the treatment of childhood eczema with probiotics, in 3 no
effect was seen. These studies had the lowest proportion of patients with IgE sensitization
(<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the remaining 7, the positive
effect was associated with those sensitization, while the role of food allergy did not play
any role in the success of the treatment. Probiotics have smaller effects on respiratory
allergies in children. In a small preliminary study on the combined effect of probiotics and
laser acupuncture a change in the peak flow variability was demonstrated in the treatment
group, while the need of medication or quality of life were not changed [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A probiotic strain in fermented milk given for 12
months to 2-5 year-old children did not improve their asthma symptoms [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>PREVENTION OF ATOPIC DISEASE IN CHILDREN</title><p>The first study to examine the possibility of preventing allergy in high risk infants
investigated 159 mothers with a high-risk child. The pregnant mothers were randomly
allocated to two groups, one of which received LGG 4 weeks before delivery and after
delivery during breastfeeding. LGG was given infants only when they started formula feeding.
LGG was given up to the age of 6 months and 57% of the infants received LGG directly. At the
age of 2, the cumulative incidence of eczema in the LGG group was 23%, and in the placebo
group was 46%. The relative risk for developing eczema was significantly lower in the LGG
group (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Table 1</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="bifidus-30-119-t001"/></table-wrap>
<table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Table 2</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="bifidus-30-119-t002"/></table-wrap>) [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At the age of 4, 107 infants
attended a follow-up examination. The cumulative incidence of eczema was 26% in the LGG
group and 44% in the placebo group [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the
relative risk for the development of eczema at age of 4 remained significantly reduced
(<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). An equal number of children in each
group had respiratory allergic symptoms, and prevalence of IgE sensitization was similar at
both the ages of 2 and 4. Seventy-three percent of the children attended the 7-year
follow-up. The cumulative incidence of eczema remained significantly lower in the LGG group,
43% vs. 66%. Positive SPT tests were detected in 32% of the children with no difference
between the groups. The incidence of allergic airway diseases was low and similar in both
the study groups [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Kopp et al. replicated the
above study by giving LGG or placebo to 105 pregnant mothers of high-risk infants for 4 to 6
weeks before delivery and to their infants for 6 months. At the age of 2, they found similar
incidences of eczema (28% vs. 27%) and of IgE sensitization, but LGG was associated with an
increased rate of recurrent wheezing episodes (26% vs. 9%) [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 223 pregnant women carrying
fetuses at increased risk of allergy [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The
mothers recieved a mixture of 4 probiotic bacteria (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) or placebo from their 36th week of gestation. Their infants were given
the same probiotics. The infants also received prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides, 0.8 g/day
for 6 months. The strains given to the probiotic group were cultivated from feces.
Significantly higher fecal counts for all <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and
<italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> were found in the probiotic group than in the controls at
the age of 6 months. The presence of probiotic strains in the feces was transient, and no
differences in the colonization patterns were seen at 2 years.</p><p>A total of 925 infants participated in the 2-year follow-up. The cumulative incidence of
allergic diseases (food allergy, eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis) did not differ
significantly between the probiotic (32%) and the placebo (35%) groups, and IgE
sensitization was not affected. However, compared to the placebo group, the probiotic group
showed a reduction in all atopic (IgE-associated) diseases as assessed by SPT or specific
IgE &#x0003e; 0.7 kU/l diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval for the cumulative incidence of

less frequently in the probiotic (26%) than in the placebo group (32%). The preventive
effect of the probiotics was more pronounced against atopic (IgE-associated) eczema, the
incidence of which in the probiotic group (12%) was significantly lower than in the placebo
group (18%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>At the age of 5, 891 (88%) infants attended the follow-up examination [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The frequencies of allergic and IgE-associated
allergic disease and sensitization in the probiotic and placebo groups were similar: 52.6
vs. 54.9%, 29.5 vs. 26.6% and 41.3% in both, respectively. Also, there were no differences
in the cumulative incidences of eczema (39.3 vs. 43.3%), atopic eczema (24.0 vs. 25.1%),
allergic rhinitis (20.7 vs. 19.1%) and asthma (13.0 vs. 14.1%) between the groups. Among the
148 children delivered by cesarean section, those who received probiotics had a lower
frequency of IgE-associated allergic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.

30.4%), and the prevalence of IgE antibodies to food allergens was significantly reduced (5%
vs. 25%) [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We could also demonstrate that among
the same infants the synbiotic preparation normalized the delayed development of
<italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> of the group. At the age of 6 months, the recovery of
<italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> from faeces of placebo group was 57%, while the probiotic
group had the same 100% recovery as did both vaginally born groups.</p><p>Altogether, the synbiotic preparation to infants was safe and was not associated with any
adverse symptoms such as abdominal pains, diarrhea or excessive crying. The groups had
identical growth [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in fact the administration of
synbiotics conferred some advantages: fewer antibiotic treatments before the age of 6
months, respiratory infections between 6 to 24 months [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, the proportion of infants given probiotics who showed t
protective IgG titres to <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b was higher at the
age of 6 months [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Although 9 studies have been published on the potential of probiotics to prevent allergic
diseases in childhood (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), only one,
Kalliomaki&#x02019;s study, was fully successful, while four studies reported no significant effect.
The four others reported partial success, either in a subgroup of patients, at some time
point as in our studies, or only one bacterial strain being effective. One firm conclusion
is that one should not make meta-analysis on the use of various types of probiotic bacteria
in the prevention of allergy; only those using the exactly same strains and protocols may be
compared. Both in the prevention as in treatment different strains of probiotic bacteria
have quite different effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>MODE OF ACTION OF PROBIOTICS</title><p>Several studies have described immunologic effects of probiotics on human cells or on
experimental animals. However, the majority provide no information relevant to human
<italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Effects of probiotic bacteria on isolated human cells
do not reflect conditions in the intestine, where contact with bacteria takes place only
with epithelial cells and with extensions of dendritic cells [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>According to Majamaa and Isolauri, probiotics may reduce inflammation in the intestine
[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The inflammatory cytokine,
tumor-necrosis-factor-&#x003b1; (TNF- &#x003b1;), content was reduced in the fecal extracts from patients
receiving LGG, while no change took place in the extracts from controls [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Probiotics have been suggested to act by reducing
the permeability of the intestine [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In a
double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, probiotic treatment resulted in a lower
ratio of lactulose/ mannitol in the urine [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We,
however, did not find any change in intestinal permeability during the treatment of infants
with eczema with either LGG or a combination of probiotic strains [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>We found no difference in the TNF-&#x003b1; content in the feces of patients receiving either
probiotics or placebo [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. LGG treatment resulted in
a greater increase in concentration of IgA after a positive CM challenge test of
IgE-mediated CM allergic infants than that in controls [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the prevention study, we discovered that high fecal IgA concentrations at
the age of 6 months was associated with protection from atopic (IgE-associated) diseases by
the age of 2 years. Probiotics associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory
markers, fecal &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin and calprotectin, and tended to augment fecal IgA
concentrations [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We therefore infer that in the
intestine, probiotics may enhance both the inflammation and immune defence of the gut.</p><p>When we studied the secretion of various cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) before and after treatment with probiotics and placebo, the secretion of interferon-&#x003b3;
(IFN-&#x003b3;) was significantly lower in IgE-mediated CMA than in infants without CMA [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Treatment with LGG resulted in a significant
increase in the ability of PBMC to secrete IFN- &#x003b3; among patients with atopic eczema, the
same group which benefited clinically from the treatment [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The same increase was observed for IFN- &#x003b3; responses to mitogens and
staphylococcal enterotoxin B(SEB) in infants with eczema given <italic>Lactobacillus
fermentum</italic> VRI 003 [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Both in the treatment and prevention studies, we found evidence that probiotics give rise
to low grade inflammation, which is probably associated with the healing/protective actions
of the probiotics. During treatment of eczema with LGG, we found a significant increase in
the blood concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in infants with IgE-associated eczema
showing a favorable clinical effect. The LGG treatment affected the serum concentration of
IL-6, which was significantly increased in the group showing significantly increased CRP.
IL-6 may induce the secretion of CRP in the liver. In infants at high risk of allergy, the
mixture of probiotics was associated with an increase in CRP at the age of 6 months; they
also had higher IL-10 levels. Furthermore, they had higher levels of serum IgA and IgE
levels than those given placebo [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We, therefore,
infer that probiotics induce low-grade inflammation characterized by increases in CRP, total
IgA, total IgE and IL-10 levels. These changes closely resemble those seen in helminth
infections which are associated with induction of regulatory mechanisms and reduced
incidence of allergy [<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Commensal microbiota and their recognition by toll-like receptors (TLR) are important in
host defence, in directing specific immune responses of the gut, and in the development of
food allergies in experimental animals [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Probiotic strains have the ability to adhere to gut
epithelial cells, which may express TLRs [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and
stimulate these cells to produce cytokines. Extensions of dendritic cells in the intestinal
lumen function in the development of immune responses in the gut [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These cells may be stimulated by probiotic bacteria. <italic>In
vitro</italic>, isolated myeloid dendritic cells express TLR-2 and may be stimulated by
LGG to express inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We thus
infer that stimulation of innate immunity may be the cause of the observed inflammatory
signs and beneficial clinical effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Studies using probiotics to treat and prevent allergy have shown promising, though highly
variable results. Clearly the major variable between the studies has been the use of
different bacterial strains; only results using the same strain and similar protocol are
comparable.</p><p>We believe that the concept is of administering probiotics to treat and prevent allergy is
valid:since the intestines of newborns and also older infants may be transiently colonized
with bacteria given orally. These bacteria have an effect on the immune system of the
recipient and also have clinical effects. Probiotics have been effective in the treatment of
eczema in infants, though the results are modest. Regarding prevention, we saw the most
long-lasting results in the subgroup of children born by cesarean section. In that event we
can introduce probiotics to the intestine with low counts of bacteria to achieve higher
counts of given strains. However, in all studies to date, the colonization achieved by given
strains has been transient.</p><p>In attempts to prevent allergy in high-risk infants the results suggest that the
intervention should start for mothers before delivery to make sure that the birth canal of
the mother is colonized by probiotics. Whether both infants and mother should continue
probiotics after birth is an open question, since giving probiotics directly to infants is
proven to result in colonization.</p><p>Finding the most efficient strain of probiotics is a big challenge. <italic>In
vitro</italic> studies may not simulate conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>, though some
qualities of probiotic bacteria may be found in such studies. Experimental animals have a
gut microbial flora, which e.g. in mice has less than 50% DNA identity with human
microbiota. Therefore, much caution is needed in extending the interpretation of results
from experimental animal studies to humans. Even in human experiments, we do not know what
type of immune reaction will result from the ingestion of probiotics and need to prove their
effect in allergy treatment and prevention. For more efficient and long-lasting effects we
need more potent and long-lasting stimulation of the mucosal immune system. Maybe the
intervention has to continue life-long, its type has to be changed or boosted at intervals.
Challenges to find a safe and efficient intervention for the primary prevention of allergies
are great.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Siltanen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kajosaari</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Poussa</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Saarinen</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Savilahti</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>
