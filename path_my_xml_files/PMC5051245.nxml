It is prevalent not only in the developing countries including India but also in the developed world.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In India, it kills two persons every three minutes, nearly 1000 every day.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Treatment of TB consists of multiple drugs of which pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important constituent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Its coadministration with other drugs led to a one-third reduction in the duration of therapy, i.e. 6 months short-course chemotherapy and two-third reduction in relapses of TB cases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma (or serum) urate concentration 6.8 mg/dl.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The risk of developing gouty arthritis or urolithiasis increases with higher urate levels.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Many drugs are known to induce hyperuricemia including PZA.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Usually, serum uric acid levels return to normal after withdrawal of the offending drug. Nevertheless, it can be tried that antitubercular therapy (ATT) can be continued without stopping PZA and decreasing the serum urate levels with the help of serum uric acid-lowering drugs. Two classes of urate-lowering drugs currently available are uricosuric agents and xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Probenecid inhibits tubular secretion of rifampicin. PZA and ethambutol may interfere with uricosuric action of probenecid, so probenecid cannot be used concurrently with these drugs for lowering serum uric acid level.</p><p>Therefore, allopurinol and febuxostat seem to be possible candidates to be used as uric acid-lowering agents in tubercular patients. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is generally a safe, effective, and well-tolerated drug. Rarely, life-threatening rashes and/or severe multisystem allopurinol hypersensitive syndrome are encountered.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Febuxostat is a newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor without such adverse effects. Febuxostat is not indicated in the secondary hyperuricemia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Review of literature revealed that no studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch&#x02013;Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, it is not recommended for use in these patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, an initiative was taken to use febuxostat in the treatment of drug-induced hyperuricemia and to compare it with another drug allopurinol of the same category. Hence, this study was undertaken with the aim of reducing PZA-induced hyperuricemia with the help of urate-lowering drugs and comparing the efficacy and adverse effects of allopurinol with febuxostat for the same purpose in patients taking ATT. This study also compared the costs of the two drugs, which is one of the important parameters for patients&#x02019; compliance, especially in developing countries like India.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching institute of Rajasthan after taking approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Data were collected in the approved pro forma after taking written consent of the patient.</p><p>All the sputum-positive tubercular patients aged between 18 and 65 years of either sex without history of any osteoarthritic condition and intake of any other hyperuricemic drugs were included in the study in whom standard four-drug ATT was given. Patients having hepatic dysfunction, history of renal calculi, pregnant, and lactating females were excluded from this study.</p><p>Serum uric acid level was monitored at 0<sup>th</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> week of ATT. Patients whose uric acid level was found to be increased at 2<sup>nd</sup> week were finally recruited in the study. Ninety patients who developed hyperuricemia due to ATT were divided randomly into three groups (Group A, Group B, and Group C) of thirty patients each. Group A was treated with febuxostat and Group B with allopurinol at a daily dose of 40 and 300 mg, respectively. Group C was kept as control.

However, when values at 8<sup>th</sup> week were compared with baseline (at 0<sup>th</sup> week) values, the difference was still significant which suggests that drugs were able to decrease serum uric acid level but could not attain the baseline level.

Serum uric acid level increased in spite of taking febuxostat in one patient but responded to allopurinol. One patient developed hypersensitivity to allopurinol (developed itching and rashes after taking the drug which subsided after stopping it).

PZA is an important constituent of ATT but at times forcing its withdrawal due to hyperuricemia.</p><p>In this study, an attempt was made to continue ATT without withdrawing PZA with the help of adding drugs which decrease synthesis of uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase enzyme. A number of previous studies including three randomized controlled trials have been conducted to compare the two drugs in patients of gout and hyperuricemia, and results were in favor of febuxostat.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Results of our study suggested that it was possible to continue PZA in the patients with the help of these drugs. Both drugs were found to be equally efficacious in lowering the serum uric acid levels possibly the reason for same efficacy might be the same mechanism of action of inhibiting the synthesis of uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] According to Singal <italic>et al</italic>. study, febuxostat is a great addition to the armamentarium for gout management particularly in patients in whom allopurinol has failed because of either lack of efficacy or due to adverse events because of intolerance to allopurinol.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Moreover, a committee of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence concluded that although febuxostat is found to be more effective than fixed-dose (300 mg) allopurinol, it had not been found to be clinically more efficacious or cost-effective than allopurinol. However, the committee recommended febuxostat for people who are intolerant of allopurinol.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Numbers of adverse events encountered across both the treatment groups were same with both the drugs.

No response with either of the two drugs can also be explained because of variation in response due to individual variation in metabolizing the drugs. Possibility of poor patient compliance cannot be neglected. Perhaps, the patient has not taken the drug and giving false history.</p><p>Overall cost of treatment with two drugs was almost same with negligible difference. Favorable point for using febuxostat could be that it requires only once-daily administration resulting in better patient compliance.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Moreover, overall incidence of adverse effects is also few with febuxostat according to previous studies as compare to allopurinol. As stated earlier that a committee of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence also concluded that it had not been shown to be clinically more efficacious or cost effective than allopurinol and recommended febuxostat for people who are intolerant of allopurinol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study concludes that both allopurinol and febuxostat were equally efficacious in lowering PZA induced raised serum uric acid level in tubercular patients, and it was possible to continue ATT without withdrawing PZA in patients who developed hyperuricemia due to it.
