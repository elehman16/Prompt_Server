<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The declaration of competing interests is now the norm for research published in medical journals, with awareness of the potential for such interests to influence findings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A systematic review of empirical data on the attitudes of academic and clinical researchers toward financial ties revealed concern about the impact of financial competing interests on the choice, conduct and publication of research, however, ties to industry were considered more acceptable when not directly related to the research, disclosure of ties was upfront and study results were openly published.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This is supported by work demonstrating lower perceived methodological rigour, credibility and likelihood to act on findings of an industry-initiated trial or a funded trial or where a principal investigator has multiple competing interests.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>We previously conducted two randomised controlled trials, which demonstrated that financial competing interests significantly affected readers' perceptions of the credibility of published medical research.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Chaudhry <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> used one research paper and compared the effect of a competing interest statement of &#x02018;none declared&#x02019; with a financial statement that the authors were employees of a pharmaceutical company and potentially held stock options in the company. Schroter <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> used two research papers and three different types of competing interest statement: no competing interests (&#x02018;none declared&#x02019;), financial interests (authors were employees of a company and potentially held stock options in the company) and research grant funding (the author was a recipient of funding for studentships and research grants from a company). A third trial, published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</italic>, sent abstracts describing trials of hypothetical drugs to internists and found that respondents assigned less credibility to trials funded by industry, as compared with the same trials reporting National Institutes of Health funding or no funding support.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Less attention has focused on the role of competing interests in clinical education articles, which are intended to guide patient care. These articles do not aim to present raw data, but often use variable and less rigorous methods to search and select from the literature, and comprise the author's own interpretation of such selected literature. Thus, author biases in these articles may be more pervasive yet less visible to general medical readers than those in research papers. Concerned by this, in 2015 the <italic>British Medical Journal (The BMJ)</italic> introduced a &#x02018;zero tolerance&#x02019; policy for its clinical editorials and some education articles, whereby authors of these articles must not have any relevant financial ties to industry.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In contrast, the <italic>NEJM</italic> has recently published an editorial by its editor-in-chief and a three-part series questioning the need for stringent policies of competing interests, suggesting that many policies have led to a loss of trust and may &#x02018;prevent the dissemination of expertise, thwart productive collaborations, or dissuade patients from taking effective drugs&#x02019;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref> This marks a significant departure from the 1990s when the <italic>NEJM</italic> first introduced a policy to reject anyone with competing interests from writing editorial or review articles.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The argument at the time was that such policies &#x02018;do not assume that most physicians or researchers let financial gain influence their judgement. They assume only that it is often difficult if not impossible to distinguish cases in which financial gain does have improper influence from those in which it does not&#x02019;.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>However, little is known about how authors' competing interests affect readers' trust in education articles. Building on our previous studies using research articles, we will conduct a randomised controlled trial to test the effects of a range of common competing interest statements in educational articles on readers' (practising doctors') interest in an article, their confidence in an article's conclusions, its perceived importance and their likeliness to change practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This will be a randomised controlled trial of practising doctors who are members of the British Medical Association (BMA) and residents in the UK. The BMA has &#x0223c;163&#x02005;558 UK members, representing &#x0223c;65% of all doctors in the UK. This includes 11&#x02005;044 retired doctors and 20&#x02005;889 students who are not practicing. Ninety per cent of all BMA members are sent a copy of the print version of <italic>The BMJ</italic> each week, and all have full online access to the journal (of which 87% of members have web accounts).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>We will generate a random sample of 2040 BMA members (680 general practitioners (GPs), 680 hospital consultants and 680 junior doctors) and send them a personalised email invitation from <italic>The BMJ's</italic> editor-in-chief to take part in a research project. We will use an incentive to encourage participation. Recruitment started on 14 November 2015. If we do not receive enough responses, we will email a large random sample of BMA members and ask for volunteers to take part in a research project before assigning them to a group. To avoid biasing participants' responses, details of the study objectives and design will not be given to participants, but we will communicate our findings to participants.</p><p>The email invitation will include a link to one of two Clinical Reviews and a link to a short questionnaire on SurveyMonkey. Study participants will be asked to read the article and then complete a short questionnaire. Consent to take part will be assumed by completion of the study questionnaire. Members of <italic>The BMJ's</italic> Ethics Committee reviewed the study protocol and did not have substantive ethical concerns.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria</title><p>We will include practising doctors in the UK who receive <italic>The BMJ</italic> and exclude BMA members who have opted out of receiving a free copy of <italic>The BMJ</italic>, public health doctors, consultant oral/dental surgeons, retired doctors and student members. We will also exclude doctors listed as doing private practice as, due to the way the data about specialty and grade are stored, this is necessary to ensure compliance with our other exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>We will use shortened and modified versions of two Clinical Reviews previously published by <italic>The BMJ</italic>. These are reviews of two conditions commonly seen by doctors, requiring treatment by drugs, and familiar to all clinical specialties. Permission to modify and use the articles has been obtained from the original authors. We will use two Clinical Reviews to help make the findings generalisable beyond a single clinical topic. Each of the two Clinical Reviews will have four permutations differing only in the competing interests statement (from no competing interests to a range of financial interests) for the last of the three authors (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). All competing interest statements will appear at the end of the article's main text, just before the references. We will use the same fictional author names and the same fictional institutional affiliations for all versions of the Clinical Reviews. We will use a fictional pharmaceutical company name and use the same company for all permutations with a competing interest. The company name will not be mentioned in the main text of the Clinical Reviews.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Importance of the article,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interest in the article,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Likeliness to change practice on the basis of the article.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis and sample size rationale</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sample size justification</title><p>To have 90% power to detect a one-unit difference on the 10-point &#x02018;confidence&#x02019; scale between the differing competing interest statement groups, 121 readers are needed in each of the four competing interest statement groups, based on a simple Student's t test with an estimated SD of 2, with a two-sided 1% significance level to provide some adjustment for multiple testing between the four competing interest statements. However, as differences between the results for the two Clinical Reviews are considered important to quantify, a total of 968 readers will be required to account for the 8 permutations. Assuming a response rate of around 50% based on previous <italic>The BMJ</italic> trials of similar design, at least 1936 readers need to be invited to take part.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Accordingly, for each of the 8 groups, 255 readers (85 GPs, 85 consultants and 85 junior doctors) will be invited to take part.</p><p>We have assumed that a one-unit difference on the 10-point scale is important on the basis that a 0.5-unit difference was important in our previous studies using a 5-point scale.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Similarly, the observed SD for the 5-point scale was &#x0223c;1, and hence we have assumed that, for a 10-point scale, the SD will be twice as large.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Assuming that the data follow a reasonable quasi-normal distribution, a factorial analysis of variance (with competing interest statement and Clinical Review type as the two factors) will be carried out to assess their impact on level of confidence. In addition, the effect of doctor type (GP, consultant or junior doctor), gender, age and the number of years since qualification will be assessed using an appropriate analysis of covariance model. Similar analyses will be carried out for the secondary outcome measures of importance, interest and likeliness to change practice.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Analysis of non-responders</title><p>Non-responders will be compared with responders in terms of age, gender, doctor type (GP, consultant hospital and junior doctor) and number of years since qualification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Potential study limitations</title><p>This study has potential limitations. Participants will know that they are taking part in a research project and their responses might not reflect the way they typically evaluate an article. They will also be asked to read an article that they might not usually read, which might not be relevant to their practice. However, both articles will be on common conditions, and the task will not require them to have in-depth knowledge of the topic. Response rates for surveys with doctors are often low.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, in both of our previous studies, we achieved response rates of 59%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This study has a similar sampling frame to the previous studies, but the survey is electronic rather than postal and we do not know if this will influence the response rate or if those who respond will differ from those who do not respond. If the response rate is too low, we will invite a large number of BMA members to volunteer to take part before assigning them to a group. We will exclude doctors doing private practice, so we cannot generalise the results beyond practising National Health Service doctors.
