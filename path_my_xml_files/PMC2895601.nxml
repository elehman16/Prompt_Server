Strategies to optimise responses to vaccination in the elderly include using an adjuvanted vaccine or using an intradermal vaccination route. The immunogenicity of an intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine was compared with that of an adjuvanted vaccine in the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Elderly volunteers (age &#x02265; 65 years) were randomised to receive a single dose of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine: either a split-virion vaccine containing 15 &#x003bc;g haemagglutinin [HA]/strain/0.1-ml dose administered intradermally, or a subunit vaccine (15 &#x003bc;g HA/strain/0.5-ml dose) adjuvanted with MF59C.1 and administered intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken before and 21 &#x000b1; 3 days post-vaccination. Anti-HA antibody titres were assessed using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) methods. We aimed to show that the intradermal vaccine was non-inferior to the adjuvanted vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 795 participants were enrolled (intradermal vaccine n = 398; adjuvanted vaccine n = 397). Non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine was demonstrated for the A/H1N1 and B strains, but not for the A/H3N2 strain (upper bound of the 95% CI = 1.53) using the HI method, and for all three strains by the SRH method. A <italic>post-hoc </italic>analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline antibody titres demonstrated the non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine by HI and SRH methods for all three strains. Both vaccines were, in general, well tolerated; the incidence of injection-site reactions was higher for the intradermal (70.1%) than the adjuvanted vaccine (33.8%) but these reactions were mild and of short duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The immunogenicity and safety of the intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly was comparable with that of the adjuvanted vaccine. Intradermal vaccination to target the immune properties of the skin appears to be an appropriate strategy to address the challenge of declining immune responses in the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00554333.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The influenza A and B viruses are common respiratory pathogens, with estimated annual global attack rates of 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Seasonal influenza can be a severe disease. It has been estimated that in Europe between 40,000 and 220,000 excess deaths per year can be attributed to influenza, depending on the pathogenicity of the circulating virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Seasonal influenza affects all age groups, but the highest incidence of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality is seen in children aged 0-23 months and in adults over 65 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the USA, influenza-associated deaths range between 30 and 150 per 100,000 individuals aged over 65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and it is estimated that ~90% of deaths due to seasonal influenza occur among people aged &#x02265; 65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Annual vaccination continues to be the primary preventive measure against seasonal influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccination of people at high risk of severe influenza or associated complications, including elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The seasonal influenza vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing influenza-like illness confirmed by laboratory tests and influenza-associated morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the immune response to the vaccine is lower in the elderly than in younger healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], due to a decline in immune function with age ('immunosenescence') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>To compensate for the effects of immunosenescence, vaccines for elderly people must be adapted to optimise the immune responses to vaccination. Several approaches have been investigated, including use of an adjuvant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], increasing the doses of antigens (e.g. 60 &#x003bc;g haemagglutinin [HA] of each component compared with the standard 15-&#x003bc;g dose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and using new routes of administration. Several studies have looked at ways to improve immune responses to vaccination by delivering vaccine via the intradermal route rather than the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The dermis has several unique properties that allow generation of powerful immune responses. In particular, it contains resident and blood-derived dendritic cells. These have an important role in the capture and presentation of antigens to the cells of the adaptive immune system; it also has a rich supply of blood and lymphatic vessels, allowing circulation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Studies with vaccines against a number of diseases such as hepatitis B and rabies have demonstrated that intradermal delivery can be an effective alternative route for vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Intanza<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>15 &#x003bc;g (also known in some countries as IDflu<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>15 &#x003bc;g) is the first intradermal influenza vaccine to be licensed for use in elderly people (&#x0003e;60 years of age); it received marketing authorisation in the European Union in 2009 for use in adults 60 years of age or older. Consistent with the WHO recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccines, it contains each of one A/H1N1 strain, one A/H3N2 strain, and one B strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clinical studies in elderly people have shown that Intanza 15 &#x003bc;g is more immunogenic than the standard intramuscular vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The present study was the first to compare the immunogenicity of this intradermal vaccine with that of a licensed adjuvanted influenza vaccine that was also developed to increase immune responses in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that Intanza 15 &#x003bc;g is at least as immunogenic for the three virus strains as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine delivered via the intramuscular route in elderly volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval of the study protocol</title><p>The study was approved by ethics committees in participating countries (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes, France; Ethics Committee of Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen, Belgium), and also by the French Health Products Safety Agency (Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise de S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; Sanitaire des Produits de Sant&#x000e9;, AFSSaPS) in France and by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Federaal Agentschap voor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten, FAGG) in Belgium.

The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: NCT00554333.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This phase-III, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study was carried out in adults aged 65 years or older who were recruited at three centres in Belgium and seven centres in France between October and December 2007. Participants attended the study centre on two occasions. At visit 1, participants who were eligible for inclusion were randomised to receive intradermal vaccine or an adjuvanted intramuscular influenza vaccine. Investigators were provided with a masked randomised list generated using a 1:1 ratio based on balanced permuted blocks stratified by centre. A pre-vaccination blood sample was taken and a single dose of allocated vaccine given. At visit 2, which was scheduled 21 &#x000b1; 3 days post-vaccination, a second blood sample was taken for assessment of immunogenicity and collection of vaccine safety data.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Individuals were invited to participate by the investigators via a phone call, an invitation letter, or during a consultation. Participants aged 65 years or older were eligible for enrolment in the study provided they met none of the exclusion criteria: acute febrile illness (oral temperature &#x02265; 37.5&#x000b0;C); systemic hypersensitivity to egg or chicken proteins or any of the vaccine constituents; thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination; and unstable chronic illness (defined as illness requiring hospitalisation or a clinically significant change in medication in the previous 12 weeks). Individuals were also excluded if they had: congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; received treatment with immunosuppressive therapy within the previous 6 months or long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids; received blood or blood-derived products in the previous 3 months. Additional exclusion criteria were: current abuse of alcohol or drug addiction; any vaccination within the previous 4 weeks or planned vaccination within the 4 weeks after the first vaccination; seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous 6 months; or previous seasonal influenza vaccination by the intradermal route.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccines</title><p>Both vaccines were formulated according to the WHO recommendations for the 2007-2008 Northern Hemisphere influenza season: A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)-like strain; A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like strain; and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like strain.</p><p>The intradermal vaccine (Intanza<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>15 &#x003bc;g; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) is an inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine containing 15 &#x003bc;g HA/strain per 0.1-ml dose, all propagated in fertilised hen's eggs. The manufacturing process is based on that used for the intramuscular seasonal vaccine, with an additional concentration step to obtain a lower volume for intradermal use. The vaccine was administered in the deltoid region using a pre-filled intradermal micro-needle injection system (Becton Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The adjuvanted vaccine (Addigrip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Fluad<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l., Origgio, Italy) is a subunit (HA and neuraminidase) influenza vaccine containing 15 &#x003bc;g HA/strain per 0.5-ml dose, all propagated in fertilised hen's eggs and adjuvanted with the squalene-based adjuvant MF59C.1. The vaccine was administered by injection into the deltoid muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunogenicity assessment</title><p>Consistent with previous studies of this intradermal vaccine, the primary immunogenicity endpoints were anti-HA antibody titres (geometric mean titre) for the three strains on day 21 post-vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Antibody titres were determined for each strain before and 21 days after vaccination by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This was carried out in accordance with standard procedures at sanofi pasteur in which the antibody titre is the highest reciprocal dilution that induced complete inhibition of haemagglutination (1/dilution [1/dil]). The secondary endpoints were anti-HA antibody titres for the three strains assessed using the single radial haemolysis (SRH) method, in which anti-HA antibody titres are measured in square millimetres (mm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. SRH assays were performed by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, Hertfordshire, UK). HI and SRH assays are recognised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the assessment of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The other secondary endpoints were anti-HA individual titre ratios (geometric mean titre ratio [GMTR], day 21/day 0) determined using the HI and SRH methods, the post-vaccination seroprotection rate (defined as the percentage of patients with anti-HA titre &#x02265; 40 [1/dil] or &#x02265; 25 mm<sup>2 </sup>for the HI and SRH methods, respectively), and seroconversion or significant increase rate on day 21 according to HI and SRH methods. For the HI method, seroconversion was defined as post-vaccination anti-HA titre &#x02265; 40 (1/dil) for subjects with a pre-vaccination titre &#x0003c; 10 (1/dil) and a significant increase was defined as &#x02265; fourfold increase in anti-HA titre for subjects with a pre-vaccination titre &#x02265; 10 (1/dil). For the SRH method, seroconversion was defined as a post-vaccination anti-HA titre &#x02265; 25 mm<sup>2 </sup>for subjects with a pre-vaccination titre &#x02264; 4 mm<sup>2</sup>, and a significant increase was defined as &#x02265; 1.5-fold increase from pre-to post-vaccination for subjects with a pre-vaccination titre &#x0003e; 4 mm<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Compliance with EMA criteria (as defined for annual re-licensure trials) for the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people for both the HI and SRH methods was also assessed: a GMTR &#x0003e;2, a seroprotection rate &#x02265; 60%, and a rate of seroconversion or significant titre increase &#x02265; 30% using either test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Participants used diary cards to record details of solicited injection-site reactions (pain, erythema, swelling, induration, ecchymosis, pruritus) and solicited systemic reactions (fever [rectal equivalent temperature &#x02265; 38.0&#x000b0;C], headache, malaise, myalgia, shivering) occurring within 7 days of vaccination. Participants also recorded unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events occurring within 21 days of vaccination.

One participant in the adjuvanted vaccine group withdrew consent. After the second study visit, blood samples for analysis of immunogenicity were available for 395 participants in each group.

The two vaccines induced similar levels of anti-HA antibodies as assessed by the SRH method. Non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine compared with the adjuvanted vaccine was demonstrated for the A/H1N1 and B strains with the HI method and for all three strains with the SRH method. Both vaccines satisfied the EMA immunogenicity criteria for influenza vaccines in the elderly. Both vaccines were developed to address the challenge of immunosenescence. The aim of the adjuvant in the seasonal influenza vaccine is to increase the immunogenicity in elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], whereas this intradermal vaccine reaches the same goal by reliably delivering the vaccine into the rich immune environment of the dermis a using a micro-needle injection system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The HI assay is the most widely used for surveillance of the influenza virus and for assessing responses to vaccines in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The HI and SRH methods provide serological correlates of protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and are recognised by the EMA for the evaluation of influenza vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The good agreement between the results from the HI and SRH tests for the A strains reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was also observed in the present study because the results from both tests were comparable for the A strains for both vaccines. Results from the SRH assay satisfied all three EMA immunogenicity criteria for both vaccines, whereas the HI assay results satisfied only the GMTR criterion, confirming the higher sensitivity of the SRH assay for influenza B strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Due to the epidemiology of influenza and vaccination programmes in industrialised countries, few elderly people are seronegative to circulating seasonal influenza antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Beyer et al. demonstrated that pre-vaccination antibody titres can have an important influence on the results of immunogenicity studies with influenza vaccines (e.g. underestimation of antibody responses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. They proposed that post-vaccination results should be adjusted according to individual pre-vaccination titres so as to provide a more informative measure of serological responses to influenza vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the present study, baseline GMTs for all strains (but particularly the A/H3N2 strain) were slightly lower in the intradermal vaccine group than in the adjuvanted vaccine group. Although the A/H3N2 strain failed to meet the criterion for non-inferiority when assessed by the HI method in the primary analysis, the <italic>post</italic>-<italic>hoc </italic>covariance analysis to adjust for pre-vaccination anti-HA titres demonstrated that the intradermal vaccine was non-inferior to the adjuvanted vaccine for all three virus strains assessed by the HI method.</p><p>In general, the intradermal and adjuvanted vaccines were well tolerated, with comparable proportions of participants reporting solicited systemic reactions in the two groups. The two vaccines were also comparable according to the EMA criteria for the safety of influenza vaccines. The micro-needle injection system used to deliver Intanza 15 &#x003bc;g has advantages over the adjuvanted vaccine from the perspective of local safety. The needle penetrates only 1.5 mm into the skin, so the risk of damage to nerves or veins inherent with intramuscular injection is eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The increased rate of injection-site erythema compared with intramuscular vaccination has been reported in studies with this intradermal vaccine in elderly volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The injection of vaccine just below the skin surface means that local reactions are more readily and more frequently visible than after injection of vaccine deeper into the muscle even if the symptoms ere mainly mild and of short duration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Importantly, injection-site reactions in the intradermal group were not associated with a higher incidence or severity of injection-site pain, and most reactions lasted for &#x02264; 3 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that the immunogenicity and safety of a new intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine for use in the elderly, Intanza 15 &#x003bc;g, is largely comparable with that of the adjuvanted vaccine that has been licensed for use in elderly people in Europe for several years. Thus, intradermal vaccination to target the immune properties of the skin appears to be an appropriate strategy to address the challenge of declining immune responses in the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PVD declared that he acts as chief and principal investigator for clinical trials conducted on behalf of the University of Antwerp, for which the University obtains research grants from vaccine manufacturers; speaker's fees for presentations on vaccines are paid directly to an educational fund held by the University of Antwerp.</p><p>RA declared no competing interests</p><p>FK declared no competing interests</p><p>AF, PR, SIS and ST declared that they work for Sanofi Pasteur MSD who commercialise the seasonal intradermal vaccine</p><p>GM and EL declared that they worked for Sanofi Pasteur MSD who commercialise the seasonal intradermal vaccine at the time the clinical trial was performed and the results analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have critically reviewed the drafts and have read and approved the final manuscript.
