As a complementary vector control measure, ITC could be used to address outdoor transmission of malaria, particularly among mobile and migrant populations and night-time workers such as rubber tappers, who may be beyond the reach of core interventions. However, more information is required on acceptability and preferences of target groups towards ITC to understand whether it could be a viable strategy in Myanmar.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cluster-randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority crossover trial was performed to determine acceptability of ITC versus identical, untreated clothing (NTC) among migrant rubber tappers. The study took place between January and May 2015 with 234 participants in 16 clusters in Thanbyuzayat Township, Mon State, Myanmar. Participants were randomly assigned to the order of clothing distribution and followed up at 2, 4 and 6&#x000a0;week intervals. Acceptability was assessed through structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. A cluster-level non-inferiority analysis was conducted using STATA, while qualitative data were digitally recorded, transcribed and content-analysed to identify patterns and themes, and managed thematically in Excel 2010<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Acceptability of both types of clothing was high. ITC was deduced to be non-inferior to NTC for seven out of eight indicators regarding perceptions (looks nice, is durable, is pleasant to wear for nighttime work, reduces mosquito bites, would recommend the clothing, would buy the clothing, like the clothing overall). A high proportion of respondents reported that the clothing reduced mosquito bites (ITC-98%; NTC-94%). Clothing was worn regularly (about 11 times in the previous two weeks). The most common reasons for not wearing the clothing every night were that it was being washed or dried, or the participant did not go to work.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The high level of acceptability suggests that ITC could be an appropriate strategy for personal protection amongst migrant rubber tappers in outdoor transmission settings in Myanmar. However, more research is needed into the feasibility and protective efficacy of ITC before it can be considered for wider roll-out.</p><p>

The country accounts for over 70 per cent of cases in the GMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and reported 152,195 confirmed cases in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With the recent scale-up of malaria prevention and control measures, there has been a visible decline in malaria morbidity from 11.2 cases per 1000 population in 2005 to 4.1 per 1000 population in 2014, and a corresponding decline in mortality from 1707 to 92 deaths, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Malaria infection is now largely concentrated among hard-to-reach and other risk groups, including mobile and migrant populations, forest-goers and outdoor night-time workers (including rubber tappers), who are exposed to outdoor biting vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The current core interventions for malaria prevention and control in Myanmar comprise long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), indoor residual spraying (IRS), early diagnosis and treatment and behaviour change activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Myanmar&#x02019;s transmission reduction programme relies almost entirely on achieving coverage with LLIN applied indoors and continuing reliance on bed nets alone will have variable impact on transmission, according to the habits of mosquitoes and humans. Recent data on insecticide resistance from the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) show high sensitivity to the pyrethroid insecticides used on LLIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The risk of exposure to outdoor transmission of malaria is increased by taking part in outdoor night-time activities such as forest-going, mining and plantation-related activities, where people are not covered by core interventions (such as bed nets and IRS) and may also have more limited access to preventative measures. In Myanmar, rubber tapping is a key resource sector and attracts a large migrant workforce. Rubber tapping takes place throughout the night, coinciding with peak biting times of <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> and <italic>Anopheles minimus</italic>, the primary vectors in Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and providing the opportunity for host&#x02013;vector interactions.</p><p>Alternative vector control measures are needed where people are beyond the reach of core interventions. Several complementary measures to LLIN have been put forward with outdoor transmission in mind, including spatial and topical repellents, toxic sugar baits and insecticide-treated hammock nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, current tools such as topical repellents have had limited impact at the community level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that topical repellents are not protective against falciparum or vivax malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is thought that these tools are vulnerable to failure due to the behavioural change required; adherence to topical repellents is difficult as it requires regular re-application every few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and maintenance of an intensive distribution scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A strategy such as insecticide-treated clothing (ITC) may be more successful, given that individuals are already accustomed to wearing long clothing for night-time outdoor work (Muhammad Shafique, personal communication, 2013); [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To date, use of ITC has been mostly limited to military, wildlife, wetland and park workers and outdoor recreational markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is substantial evidence that ITC and treated-materials can prevent arthropod biting (including mosquitoes, ticks, chiggers), and vector borne diseases such as leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Wearing permethrin-ITC has been shown to reduce <italic>Aedes</italic> biting rates by more than ninety per cent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For malaria prevention, results have ranged from showing no demonstrated reduction in incidence in Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to up to 64% reduction in Afghanistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and 69% reduction or more in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, none of these studies have systematically investigated acceptability and preference of ITC, which is important for uptake, targeted distribution and sustainability of the strategy, and may be a factor in the wide variability in results.</p><p>A recent study in Thailand showed high acceptability for insecticide-treated school uniforms for dengue prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but so far, preference and acceptability of ITC has not been evaluated among high risk groups for malaria prevention. Given these differences (settings, population, disease), it will be important to assess users&#x02019; perceptions and acceptability of ITC among the mobile, migrant rubber tapper population in Myanmar.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was thus to investigate preference and acceptability of ITC for malaria prevention among migrant rubber tappers in a malaria endemic area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in Wae Kha Mi Rural Health Centre (RHC), located in Thanbyuzayat Township, Mon State, southeastern Myanmar (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Wae Kha Mi RHC catchment area had a population of approximately 16,041 in 2015 with annual malaria parasite incidence (API) of 7.6 per thousand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The landscape is characterized by forested foothills and plains which are dominated by rubber plantations, and which attract a large number of seasonal migrant workers for work. A scoping visit to Wae Kha Mi conducted in 2013 provided basic information on the study area, population and community practices and preferences for the study (Muhammad Shafique, pers. comm., 2013).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Map showing region of study area</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2017_1737_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Mon State has a tropical climate and temperate weather, due to its location near the sea and in the low latitude zone. In the state capital of Mawlamyine, the average temperature in January is 25.6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and in April is 29.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, with annual rainfall of 4826&#x000a0;mm. Rain is especially heavy in July and August.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Vector ecology in Mon State</title><p>
<italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> is a widespread species in Mon state and is especially found in forest and forested foot hill areas. In the nearby township of Mudon, approximately 40&#x000a0;km north of Thanbyuzayat, <italic>An. minimus</italic> and <italic>Anopheles maculatus</italic> were also found, but their numbers were low compared to <italic>An. dirus</italic> which was collected throughout the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> appears to be responsible for perennial malaria transmission in the Mudon community especially in the post-monsoon months (i.e. September and October). Malaria incidence showed two distinct peaks corresponding to the months of June to July (peak monsoon season) and December to February (cool and dry season). Rubber tapping season is from November to May during the dry season, and ceases during the monsoon season, which is characterized by the outward migration of some workers. Shaded domestic wells provide excellent breeding habitats for <italic>An. dirus</italic> in Mudon area, contributing to high larval and pupal density during the rainy season, and low numbers during the cool-dry season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This ecological adaptation in human settlements and shaded habitats may contribute to outdoor transmission among rubber tappers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>A two-arm non-inferiority, cluster-randomized, double-blind crossover trial was conducted to determine whether acceptability of ITC was non-inferior to non-treated clothing (NTC). Participants and data collectors were blinded to the intervention. The study used mixed methods; quantitative components comprised a household survey and three structured questionnaires, and qualitative components comprised focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI). All study tools were developed in English, translated to Burmese and back translated for quality control. The study reported here was conducted from January to May 2015, during the dry season.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sampling framework</title><p>A cluster was defined as a discernible group of houses within a large rubber plantation (&#x02265;12 households), or a cluster of households in contiguous rubber plantations. Clusters were selected from household listings of all rubber plantations in the entire study area. After an initial baseline survey with all households identified in the study area, social mapping was used to define clusters according to the geographical positions of the plantations, numbers of households and numbers of rubber tappers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cluster size varied from 6 to 20 households and the number of eligible participants in each cluster varied from 10 to 37. Clusters were randomly allocated to the two study arms. Because of the variability in cluster size, the female participants were only randomly selected for enrolment by probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. For the male participants&#x02019; enrolment, all the eligible participants were enrolled except for in three clusters whose size allowed random selection.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Different types of households in the study area; stilted, longhouse style lodging, and free-standing thatched houses on stilts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2017_1737_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

To determine this, participants were asked to rate the clothing (yes/no) against a number of acceptability indicators which were designed to measure perceptions towards the clothing&#x02019;s aesthetic characteristics and practical attributes, and their willingness to recommend or buy it (clothing looks nice; clothing is pleasant to wear for night-time work clothing is durable; clothing is easy to clean; clothing reduces mosquito bites; would recommend clothing; would buy clothing if available in the market; overall, like the clothing).

However, many requested the clothing to be provided free-of-charge, given their limited disposable income after purchasing other necessities such as food and work supplies. Participants, plantation owners and managers also said they had been affected by falling global rubber prices (since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008), which impacted on their job security and the amount they would be willing or able to spend.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;We can spend about 4000-5000 kyats [on the clothing] at the most.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Participants&#x02019; suggestions for improvement</title><p>The qualitative component allowed for further exploration of participants&#x02019; perceptions and suggestions for improvement to the clothing and the ITC strategy. Key suggestions included developing promotional and educational messages and delivering these through mass media channels, such as billboards and the radio; ensuring access for rubber tappers by distributing ITC in rural areas and through health centres and shops, and regularly at key intervals throughout the year, such as the start of the rubber season and when mosquito density is highest. Participants also commented on the difficulty of correct sizing, and suggested taking measurements before clothing distribution, designing clothes to be &#x02018;free size&#x02019;, or treating their own clothing with insecticide. Promoting two types of clothing (thick and thin) was also suggested to improve adherence year-round, in the cool and the dry seasons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial showed that among a migrant rubber tapping population in Mon State, acceptability of ITC was non-inferior to NTC. The high acceptability for both types of clothing in this trial was reflected in the strong adherence to the intervention, participants&#x02019; willingness to buy and recommend the clothing, and high ratings given for the acceptability indicators. Importantly, the clothing was also perceived to have a function in personal protection against mosquito bites.</p><sec id="Sec49"><title>Mosquito prevention and personal protection</title><p>The low use of traditional preventive measures such as LLIN at baseline, coupled with the prevalence of modified methods, such as mosquito coils tucked into a headband or belt buckle during night-time work, illustrates the perceived need for personal protection in the rubber plantation. A large percentage of participants (96%) believed that the distributed clothing prevented mosquito bites, and many cited this reason to explain why they wore the clothing regularly, including at other times of the day. A few participants commented that wearing the distributed clothing eliminated the need to use other or current protection methods, and highlighted the practical advantages, including a positive impact on their productivity and health. These findings suggest that ITC could suitably and acceptably fill a gap in personal protection for this outdoor occupational risk group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Willingness to recommend the clothing to family and friends</title><p>A high proportion of participants (98% wearing ITC; 100% wearing NTC) were willing to recommend the clothing to family and friends and this remained constant over the course of the trial (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The qualitative findings also revealed there to be demand in the community for clothing that can provide personal protection or health benefits. The participant who explained how his friends had been eager to buy the clothing for themselves after hearing him advocate about it, is one striking example of the power of word-of-mouth in small communities. Identifying individuals who are influential and can act as role models within the community through a positive deviance approach has been shown to have promise in malaria control and elimination settings in the GMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Future trials or ITC distribution schemes should seek to harness these individuals and utilize community mobilization approaches to ensure sustainability of the strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Willingness to buy the clothing and cost considerations</title><p>Most of the participants (93% wearing ITC; 91% wearing NTC) said they would be willing to buy the clothing if it was available in the market, and many supported this by citing the health benefits. However, in general, participants expressed reservations about cost, suggesting that free distribution would be preferable given their limited discretionary income. Similar reservations about payment (despite willingness to recommend) were also reported in a study on acceptability of insecticide-treated school uniforms in Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and are a potential obstacle to feasibility. Subsidization schemes and costing mechanisms to address the gap between willingness and ability to pay were recommended in a supply and demand analysis conducted as part of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and have been put forward in other trials of insecticide-treated materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Further details on cost of ITC and potential financing mechanisms will be discussed in an upcoming paper (Jeffrey Hii, personal communication, 2016).</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Participants&#x02019; preferences and suggestions for improvement</title><p>Participants suggested that a pullover or &#x02018;free-size&#x02019; outfit, with trousers and made of long, loose-fitting material in dark colours would be preferred, to ensure comfort and swift movement at work, hide stains and provide protection against mosquitoes, scratches and other nuisances in the rubber forest. The main reasons for not wearing the clothing related to size, temperature and the frequent need to wash, and for these reasons participants recommended distributing multiple sets of season-appropriate attire. Similar issues with bed nets were voiced by workers in rubber plantation sites in Mon State and Tanintharyi region, who reported sleeping outside of the net on occasion due to the hot weather and work and behavioural factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The existence of specific clothing preferences identified among the rubber tappers in this study illustrates the need for tailored approaches when introducing a novel tool such as ITC. While the insecticidal activity and effectiveness of ITC is essential to its function as a personal protective measure, it may not be enough to ensure uptake. From a social perspective we must consider what aesthetic and practical characteristics of clothing people want and care about, to ensure they wear it (or don&#x02019;t object to wearing it), and recognize that these preferences may vary between individuals and populations. In this trial, the scoping assessment performed in 2013 (Muhammad Shafique, personal communication, 2013) provided initial information on working habits and preferred clothing style, colour and material which enabled appropriate clothing to be selected for the intervention according to the target group&#x02019;s preferences and may be one explanation for why observed levels of acceptability were so high. ITC should be designed to match closely with individuals&#x02019; preferences or current clothing style in order to facilitate its adoption. The study revealed that participants considered the treated clothing to be non-inferior to (&#x02018;no worse than&#x02019;) otherwise identical, untreated clothing, with the additional benefit of being able to prevent mosquito bites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Feasibility</title><p>Worth considering is whether the additional cost and time required for conducting community consultations be sufficiently justified by the increase in uptake of ITC, and whether this is realistic and achievable within the timeline of malaria elimination by 2030 in the GMS. Such tailored approaches can be highly labour-intensive and costly, particularly in a malaria elimination setting (where funding inevitably declines after successes in control). Another potential barrier to feasibility of the ITC strategy among this particular target group is the relatively short lifetime of rubber tapping clothing (due to heavy staining), meaning that multiple sets would be required per person throughout a season. This factor makes it increasingly challenging to find a cost-effective strategy, or to justify tailoring and treating clothing with long-lasting methods, when the clothing itself may only last up to one month in the field. Further research into the optimal treatment method for use in rural settings and at the community and individual level is recommended, and has also been suggested elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, if employers can be encouraged to provide and promote insecticide-treated uniforms for their workers, this strategy may be successful among specific occupational groups, assuming supportive financing mechanisms are available. Plantation management should be engaged to determine whether there is any potential for their support in subsidizing or purchasing ITC for their workers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Seasonal and entomological factors</title><p>An ancillary study (not shown) was conducted from September&#x02013;October 2015 to investigate the influence of seasonality on the findings and the hypothesis that greater acceptability of ITC over NTC might be apparent during the post-monsoon season, when mosquito density was expected to be higher. Based on entomological laboratory observations, no evidence was found supporting this (paper in preparation).</p><p>However, the authors suggest that future studies should be conducted during the wet or post-monsoon seasons and in areas with high reported mosquito density to explore this potential effect in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Limitations</title><sec id="Sec560"><title>Acceptability</title><p>Acceptability: It is not possible to determine whether the highly positive acceptability indicators are representative of real-life settings. Monitoring markers of acceptability over a longer time course (outside of trial conditions) is needed, as these have been shown to wane with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Acceptability may also be inflated during a period of initial exposure to a new intervention, or through response or social desirability bias during a trial, which could have implications for the feasibility (and ethics?) of taking an intervention to scale in the long-term. Future research should also seek to determine whether participants would opt to wear or purchase ITC in instances where it is not given to them, as this would help to elucidate its true perceived value, however this was beyond the scope of the study and would likely require accompanying behavioural change interventions to be realistically evaluated in this setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Time intervals</title><p>The time between the first and second follow-up visit was two weeks longer than scheduled due to public holidays and unavailability of local gatekeepers, which may have introduced recall bias in responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Study population</title><p>Due to falling global rubber prices, fewer rubber plantations were open and the migrant rubber tapper population was smaller than anticipated. In order to reach the sample size, which had been based on an earlier scoping assessment, PPS sampling was used, with random selection of all females and random selection of males in 3 out of 16 clusters (in the other clusters, all eligible males were enrolled). Also, given that the study was conducted with migrant rubber tappers, caution should be taken before generalizing the findings to other groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec58"><title>Non-inferiority analysis</title><p>Due to a different design, the third follow-up was excluded from the non-inferiority analysis as it was not possible to compare results between rounds. The non-inferiority analysis is therefore only reflective of the first and second follow-ups. The small sample size led to wide confidence intervals in the non-inferiority analysis and also meant that conclusions could not be drawn on superiority of one type of clothing to the other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec59"><title>Recommendations</title><p>In the first instance, key recommendations are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Conduct further research into bio-efficacy and the optimal treatment method for ITC, particularly for use by rural populations, taking into account lifetime of the clothing, and practical factors such as washing and drying methods.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explore ways to overcome existing barriers relating to cost, through costing mechanisms, such as subsidization strategies, or modifications to the ITC product.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Providing communities with personal protective tools that take into account their practices and preferences and are tailored to purpose (e.g. protection specifically during rubber tapping) are needed to target the gaps which traditional core measures cannot reach. This is particularly important in pre-elimination settings such as Myanmar where a targeted approach is required. The high level of acceptability in this study suggests that ITC could be a suitable strategy for personal protection among rubber tappers in outdoor transmission settings (in Myanmar), however more research is needed into cost-effectiveness and potential financing mechanisms, access as well as efficacy and effectiveness of ITC in field settings (see upcoming paper [Jeffrey Hii, personal communication, 2016]), before ITC can be considered for wider roll-out.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHW</term><def><p>community health worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHS</term><def><p>demographic and health survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGD</term><def><p>focus group discussion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMS</term><def><p>P Greater Mekong Sub-region</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDI</term><def><p>in-depth interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRS</term><def><p>indoor residual spraying</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITC</term><def><p>insecticide-treated clothing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLIN</term><def><p>long-lasting insecticidal net</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMCP</term><def><p>National Malaria Control Programme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMK</term><def><p>Myanmar kyat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMP</term><def><p>mobile and migrant populations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOH</term><def><p>Ministry of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTC</term><def><p>non-treated clothing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPS</term><def><p>probability proportional to size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RHC</term><def><p>rural health centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBCC</term><def><p>social and behaviour change communication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JH and ARF participated in the conception of study design.
