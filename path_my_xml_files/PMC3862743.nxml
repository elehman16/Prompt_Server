Baseline and endpoint mean item scores were determined for subgroups defined by age (6&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;12, 18&#x02013;39, and 40&#x02013;55 years) and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The baseline mean item scores were generally numerically similar for all age-by-sex subgroups.

In longitudinal studies, as participants mature, symptoms of inattention (IA) appear to persist, while symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity (H/I) are more likely to diminish.<xref rid="b6-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In line with such findings, other studies have found rates of H/I symptoms to be age related<xref rid="b9-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; in one investigation of adult ADHD, <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition&#x02013;Text Revision</italic> (DSM-IV-TR)&#x02013; defined symptoms reported by more than 90% of subjects were consistent with IA, or a combined subtype, while only 2% reported predominantly H/I-type symptoms.<xref rid="b10-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Results of a recent survey of data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication and a large managed health care plan found a greater persistence of childhood IA vs H/I symptoms in adults with ADHD.<xref rid="b12-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, these apparent age-related differences in symptom presentation may reflect an issue with diagnostic criteria rather than an actual change.

These prompts enhance the ability of patients and raters to identify adult symptoms and can be inserted into symptom rating scales, such as the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV).<xref rid="b9-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>ADHD symptom presentation also varies by sex; thus, school-aged girls with ADHD are diagnosed more often with the predominantly IA subtype than are boys with ADHD.<xref rid="b19-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In one investigation, the IA subtype accounted for 34% of ADHD cases in girls vs 22% of cases in boys.<xref rid="b21-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In adults, it is unclear whether this subtype pattern holds true. Although women and men appear equally likely to be diagnosed with ADHD and the majority receive a diagnosis of combined type, it is unclear whether subtype expression differs by sex and whether the higher proportion of IA subtype seen in female children holds for adult women.<xref rid="b22-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Again, the degree to which such findings reflect limitations of the current DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, sampling bias, or true symptom differences/similarities among women and men with ADHD is not known. Another limitation may be the agreement or concordance of rating between patient self-assessment of symptoms and informant assessment for both current adult symptoms and prior childhood symptoms.

Treatment endpoint was defined as the last postrandomization treatment week for which a valid ADHD-RS-IV score was obtained.

For this analysis, participants were dichotomized into male and female subgroups and were further divided according to age: 6 to 9 years, 10 to 12 years, 18 to 39 years, and 40 to 55 years. The subgroups of those aged 6 to 9 years and 10 to 12 years were chosen to differentiate childhood from the period of transition to adolescence; similarly, the adult subgroups, aged 18 to 39 years and 40 to 55 years, were chosen to differentiate young adulthood from middle age. Individual ADHD-RS-IV item scores with standard deviations (SD) at baseline and endpoint were assessed by these age-by-sex subgroups. For the purposes of these analyses, the results were collapsed across the LDX dose groups.

In addition to the previous findings above, the rationale for not pursuing comparative statistical analysis involved a consideration of several factors, including: prior commentary<xref rid="b40-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> recommending against comparative statistical analysis of post hoc subgroup data sets; the small number of participants in many of the subgroups in the current study; the large number of analyses that would be required; and the lack of statistical power in the current analyses. The value of the current analysis was judged to be derived from examining the sex and age patterns for the ADHD symptom item analysis; to illustrate IA and H/I symptoms, showing the &#x0201c;pattern&#x0201d; of symptom involvement; and the relative improvement across the items.</p><p>The symptom item profiles were assessed before and after treatment with the long-acting stimulant LDX, to assess the similarities and differences in the profile of treatment-related changes in symptom severity. The baseline pretreatment ADHD-RS-IV mean item scores were numerically similar, regardless of age-by-sex subgroup, with the IA mean item scores tending to be numerically higher (more severe) than the H/I mean item scores, particularly among older adult participants. Overall, the endpoint ADHD-RS-IV mean item scores were numerically decreased with active treatment in both children and adults. The age-by-sex subgroup analysis showed that both IA and H/I symptoms decreased with active treatment among all subgroups examined, albeit with considerable variability. The greater variability, as shown by wider SDs, for some age-by-sex subgroups at either baseline or endpoint, especially for some subgroups receiving placebo, is likely to have been related to the smaller subgroup sizes since all the placebo groups had smaller sample sizes than the active treatment groups; smaller sample sizes decrease the precision of data and the ability to determine statistical relevance. With regard to baseline pretreatment symptom presentation, all age-by-sex subgroups generally exhibited broadly similar patterns and levels of symptom severity: for most age-by-sex subgroups, at baseline, IA mean item scores tended to be slightly numerically higher (ie, more severe) than were the H/I mean item scores, and this was more pronounced among older participants. It is unclear whether in the current post hoc analysis, the lack of definitive sex-related differences in symptom presentation in children was due to the exclusion from the present trial of individuals with the predominantly IA subtype, as this may be seen more often in females. Consequently, these findings may differ from previous research because those earlier efforts reflect a more symptomatically homogeneous sample that includes the predominantly IA subtype. Nevertheless, the current findings are in agreement with those of Sobanski et al,<xref rid="b23-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> who found the IA and H/I subtypes in roughly equal proportions of clinic-referred adult men and women with ADHD, which suggests that the present analysis may accurately reflect symptom presentation in men and women.</p><p>However, the current findings support prior research indicating age-related differences in symptom presentation at baseline, with older participants showing more pronounced IA symptoms relative to H/I symptoms. Our findings are in line with previous findings suggesting that H/I symptoms tend to decrease with increasing age while IA symptoms are more constant with increasing age.<xref rid="b6-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, it is worth noting that while this and previous studies suggest differences in symptom presentation according to patient age, it is not clear whether these are related to real differences in the presence and severity of symptoms or are related to different forms of symptom expression between younger and older individuals.<xref rid="b9-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Some researchers have argued that reported decreases in H/I may reflect changing manifestations not captured by the DSM-IV-TR criteria, rather than the true resolution of H/I symptoms.<xref rid="b9-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> With maturation, hyperactivity may begin to manifest as inner restlessness, feeling uncomfortable sitting for lengthy periods, or being unwilling to wait in line.<xref rid="b13-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Impulsivity may manifest as increased frustration or explosive emotional episodes.<xref rid="b14-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In line with these arguments, in a 5-year longitudinal study (mean baseline age of ~13 years), there was poor diagnostic stability for the major DSM-IV ADHD subtypes.<xref rid="b8-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The highest rates of stability were observed for the combined subtype (24%), while the lowest rate (11%) was observed for the predominantly H/I subtype. It seems possible that such instability may, at least in part, reflect an issue with the diagnostic criteria, rather than an actual change in ADHD subtype. Questions surrounding the changing profile of symptom manifestation during development are apparent from the lack of developmentally appropriate descriptions of the defining symptoms for individuals who are in transition from early childhood to middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood,<xref rid="b9-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> in the DSM-IV-TR. The revised criteria for the DSM-5 (completed in 2013) may help to resolve these challenges in the diagnosis of ADHD in older patients. A recently published study<xref rid="b12-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> of large community-based (National Comorbidity Survey Replication) and managed health care populations has corroborated the previously mentioned finding of Millstein et al<xref rid="b10-ndt-10-001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and also documented increased IA vs H/I symptom loading in adults with ADHD.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Several important limitations of the present post hoc analyses warrant consideration. The studies were not prospectively powered to detect differences among the subgroups examined; some sample sizes, especially in the placebo subgroups, were small, resulting in substantial variability in some of the baseline ADHD-RS-IV item scores and in the difference scores for LDX vs placebo. This was generally manifested by larger SDs for item scores and may have accounted for some of the variability between participants in the LDX or placebo groups at baseline. No tests of internal consistency, reliability, or factor analyses were performed, as this post hoc analysis was not intended to validate the ADHD-RS scale. Caution should be considered in generalizing the results to the overall ADHD population in light of a potential selection bias due to exclusion of the IA subtype in the pediatric trial. As well, the baseline severity requirements of ADHD-RS-IV total score &#x02265;28 may have masked differences that occur in the general population of ADHD patients; females, as well as older children and adults, have been noted to express more IA symptomatology vs that of H/I. Importantly, since the pediatric trials explicitly excluded participants diagnosed with the predominantly IA subtype, this potentially limits the ability to detect differential effects of participant variables and treatment on the IA symptom clusters. These were exploratory, post hoc analyses, so groups were not matched and data analysis was limited to descriptive statistical comparisons. Formal hypothesis testing was not performed. Certain aspects of the previous child and adult studies limit the ability to generalize the findings to clinical situations, including use of forced-dose titration designs, relatively short treatment duration (4 weeks), exclusion of adolescent participants (aged 13 to 17 years), and enrollment of clinic-referred participants with moderate to severe ADHD symptoms.</p><p>In conclusion, these post hoc subgroup analyses suggest that the presentation of individual DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms, for those with combined or H/I subtype ADHD, was generally similar regardless of participants&#x02019; sex, but with older children and adults tending to exhibit more severe IA than H/I symptoms. Moreover, the endpoint ADHD-RS-IV items mean scores were generally numerically lower after active treatment for most IA and H/I symptom items in most of the age-by-sex subgroups, suggesting that ADHD symptoms are broadly responsive to effective treatment. The current findings add to the growing literature surrounding age- and sex-related differences in ADHD symptom presentation and treatment response, and this continues to be an important area in need of further research.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The clinical research was funded by the sponsor, Shire Development LLC.
