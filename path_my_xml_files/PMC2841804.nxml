HRQL can be measured in patients with COPD either by disease-specific tools that have been specifically designed for use in patients with respiratory system disorders or by generic HRQL tools that can be used across populations with a variety of medical conditions. The Arabic-translated CRQ-SAS is a new tool for assessment of Arabic-speaking patients with chronic respiratory diseases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic respiratory disease questionnaire - self - administered standardized format</kwd><kwd>pulmonary rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>quality of life
</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation leading to reduced ventilatory capacity and is associated with shortness of breath. Patients with severe airflow limitation and those who experience repeated acute exacerbations usually suffer from impaired quality of life, reduced exercise capacity, and increased risk of re-admission. Interventions designed to hasten recovery and improve symptoms after admission to hospital may lead to reduced use of healthcare in future and real improvement in quality of life and functional ability in breathless and vulnerable patients with COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>Several publications have reviewed results of PR investigation and concluded that there is substantial evidence that PR improves exercise capacity and shortness of breath.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>In patients with COPD, HRQL may be particularly valuable in PR assessment. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs with accompanying lectures and different teaching methods for patients with pulmonary disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] In these studies, the effects of PR on HRQL have used disease-specific questionnaires designed for patients with COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] These tools make it difficult to compare outcomes in studies of patients with COPD to those with other nonpulmonary disorders and some require administration by a trained interviewer. Also, the effects of early PR of outpatients in the acute recovery phase after hospital admission for acute exacerbations of COPD have poorly been studied.</p><p>This study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of scheduled early (two months post- discharge from acute exacerbation) home-based PR program with outpatient supervision every two weeks including exercise training and lecture series on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD. We also investigated the first use and utility of the Arabic-translated Short Form-36 (SF-36), a questionnaire designed to assess generic quality of life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] in a brief and comprehensive manner, to assess HRQL following PR and to compare that with another specific tool, the Arabic-translated Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>Design: Randomized clinical trial in a group of Arabic- speaking COPD patients.</p><p>Local institutional ethics approval was obtained before commencing the study and all enrolled patients gave written informed consent. Between July 2008 and March 2009, we recruited 39 patients admitted to the Chest Department in a tertiary hospital with moderate to severe COPD according to GOLD 2007[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] criteria for diagnosis of COPD.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were: Arabic as the first language, age over 40 years, living within local district and ability to complete the CRQ within one session.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Patients unable to read or write, patients with locomotors problems, cognitive impairment, ischemic heart disease, aortic valve disease, cancer or lung diseases other than COPD were excluded.</p><p>The first group of patients consisted of 25 patients. In these patients we pilot tested the CRQ formats during the translation and adaptation process after stabilization of their acute illness and before their discharge. During admission period all patients received standard treatment, including nebulized bronchodilators, oxygen, oral or intravenous antibiotics, noninvasive ventilation (if required), and a one to two week course of oral prednisolone (30-40 mg daily). Patients were discharged on optimal medical treatment and received standard follow-up every two week outpatient appointments with a pulmonary specialist.</p><p>Before discharge from hospital, patients were randomly allocated to one of the two groups: Group (1) included 25 patients who underwent early pulmonary rehabilitation program as scheduled in addition to medical treatment (rehabilitation group) and group (2) included 14 COPD patients who did not undergo rehabilitation, but were kept on usual medical care for COPD as indicated (control group).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Pulmonary rehabilitation program</title><p>This study was accomplished in four phases; planning, assessment, implementation and evaluation of COPD patients. The applied post discharge program was based on the assessment phase, review of related literature,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] available resources, and patients' culture and traditions. The objectives of the model were stated. Proper teaching, learning and training aids were developed and methods of evaluation were specified. Detailed contents of the program are summarized as follow:</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Health education and lecture series</title><p>During the hospitalization period, after stabilization of the medical condition of the enrolled COPD patients, and before their discharge, enrolled patients were interviewed four times for about one hour each. The healthy lifestyle lectures included information about normal lung anatomy and physiology, disease pathology, pulmonary medications, oxygen therapy, avoiding environmental irritants, and prevention and management of respiratory infections. Information about the disease, nutrition, proper use of inhalation therapy and general preventive measures were explained. We developed a booklet to present information in a simple way using drawings. The booklet was given to the patients and used as a reminder to support teaching and practicing at home.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Exercise training</title><p>Before discharge, and after primary assessment measures, patients were taught to perform these exercises and instructed to do them every other day at home over a period of two months. These exercises included:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Respiratory muscle training e.g. diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip breathing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Endurance training (aerobic training e.g. walking and cycling).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Strength training and isolated muscle strength training: Upper-extremity training was performed by repetitively raising and lowering a dowel from the height of the waist to the height of the shoulders (using an interval-training regimen with repetitive periods of exercise and rest as tolerated by the patient). Six to 10 upper-body and lower-body strength exercises were used based on demonstrated weakness and fatigue in each individual subject. Stretching of hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, shoulders, neck, and lower back was performed after each exercise session.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Baseline assessment and measures of outcome</title><p>We made baseline assessments in the 24-hour period before patients were discharged from hospital and assigned to the intervention. These measurements were repeated after two months from patients' allocation and discharge. We measured exercise capacity by the six minutes walk test. We developed and used the Arabic-version of chronic respiratory disease questionnaire-self-administered standardized format (CRQ-SAS). CRQ is a well validated tool to assess patients with COPD and often used outcome measures in pulmonary rehabilitation studies, to measure disease specific health status. We measured generic health status with the short form, 36 item questionnaire for medical outcomes (SF-36). Baseline PFTs were also measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>A six-minute walk test</title><p>During the 6-MWD test, an index of functional capacity, subjects were asked to walk as far as they could in six minutes. As advised in the ATS statement 2002,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] the test was performed on a continuous rectangular hospital corridor. The patient was encouraged during the test with one of three standardized phrases used by specialized nurses every minute. If the patient was receiving oxygen therapy, the nurse carried the oxygen. The test was performed twice to eliminate any potential learning effect. Walks were conducted on the same day, with at least a 30 minutes rest period between tests. The second of the two walk distances walked was measured to the nearest meter and recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Measures for quality of life</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>The Arabic-translated CRQ-SAS</title><p>The CRQ is a self-administered questionnaire developed by Guyatt[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] measuring both physical and emotional aspects of chronic respiratory disease. It is divided into the four domains of fatigue, emotional function, mastery and dyspnea. Patients are to answer each of the 20 questions on a seven-point scale expressing the degree of disability from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). The questions on the dyspnea domain are individualized, in that, patients identify five important daily activities, and report their degree of dyspnea on those activities. Higher total score and sub scores on categories indicate better health related quality of life. A change in the score (calculated by dividing the overall score by the number of items) of 0.5 on the seven-point scale, reflects a clinical significant small change. A change of 1.0 reflects a moderate change and a difference of 1.5 represents a large change.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Use of the CRQ, authored by Drs. Gordon Guyatt and Holger Sch&#x000fc;nemann was made under license from McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Translation and instrument development</title><p>We followed a sequential forward and backward translation approach. Two translators independently translated the English self-administered CRQ (CRQ-SA) into Arabic. On agreement on first version, we then pilot tested this version on five patients to identify difficulties in understanding. In addition, we tested various possible wordings of items, answer choices and instructions if the translation team considered more than one possible version. A translator with experience in biomedical sciences but unaware of the original English CRQ performed a back translation of the Arabic CRQ formats into the source language (English). A team of McMaster University investigators compared the back translation with the English CRQ to check for conceptual discrepancies. The translation team discussed comments from these patients and finally decided on any modifications.</p><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Arabic-translated medical outcomes study - 36-item short form MOS (SF-36) quality of life scale</title><p>The SF-36 incorporates 36 items and yields eight separate sub scales.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] The validated Arabic version of the questionnaire has been used in evaluation of QOL in patients with different chronic diseases,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] but never in the evaluation of Arabic- speaking COPD patients. The questionnaire include questions related to physical functioning (10), social functioning (two), role limitations due to physical problems (four), role limitations relating to emotional problems (three), mental health (five), vitality (energy/fatigue - four), pain (two), general health perceptions (five), and change in health (one). Each sub scale score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the most desirable score. The SF-36 required about 10 minutes of the patient's time and was administered during the initial patient evaluation prior to the start of pulmonary rehabilitation and at the end of 3 weeks during the final visit with the patient.</p><p>Both questionnaires on quality of life were used twice; at the beginning and end of the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Spirometry</title><p>Spirometry was performed using computerized Sensor Medicus Corporation Machine (CAT No. 752609, SER 54065). A standard method for test performance and interpretation was used as recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced expiratory flow (FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>) and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC were measured. The results were then expressed as percentage of predicated normal values for each subject after adjustment for age, sex and height.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind patients or assessors.

Despite optimal medical treatment during hospital admission, patients at discharge take considerable time to recover to baseline levels of physical functioning and health status. Previous studies have shown that up to 25% of patients after acute exacerbations do not fully recover to baseline peak flow at three months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] and that the recovery period in health status is long even in patients who do not have further exacerbations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] Our data indicates that patients can safely participate in a supervised, home-based PR program shortly after an exacerbation and that such a program speeds up recovery from the debilitating effects of a hospital admission. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effects of early PR on exercise capacity and health status are considerably great.</p><p>A few studies investigated exercise training after an acute exacerbation of COPD. Man <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of three- month PR program on an outpatient basis and the likelihood of financial benefit to the health service.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Early PR, compared with usual care, led to significant improvement in median incremental shuttle walk distance, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, CRQ the mental component of the SF-36 score. Also, Behnke <italic>et al</italic>. looked at the effects of an initial, 10-day, inpatient training program, followed by six months of supervised home training, compared with usual care, in patients admitted for an acute exacerbation of COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] They showed improvement in six-minute walking distance and sum scores on the questionnaire on chronic respiratory disease at three months and six months after training compared with control. However, such a program would not be viable in terms of manpower or finance. In contrast, especially in a low income country, two months scheduled home-based PR program with outpatient supervision every two weeks is a more realistic option to save healthcare resources. Previous data support the cost effectiveness of home-based PR program and the likelihood of improvement in the functional status and quality of life that would in turn have positive impact on health service.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Six-minute walk test</title><p>In patients with chronic lung disease, the minimal clinically important improvement in 6MWD has been reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>] to be 54 m.

The mean difference in walk distance between the rehabilitation group compared to usual care control group was (58.15 &#x000b1; 11.23).</p><p>Several factors may influence the 6MWD in healthy individuals and in COPD patients.

This apparently short distance might be attributed to the facts mentioned above and the facts that enrolled patients were at advanced stage of their illness, many of them were in grade III or IV, and they were just coming out of an acute exacerbation of their chronic illness. Also, at time of enrolment, 69.2% had respiratory failure and 35.9% had decompensate cor pulmonale which might be additional two factors contributing to the short distance achieved by patients with chronic illness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT40">40</xref>] Also, the end point of assessment of the patients was by the end of two months from enrolment, and possibly this outcome might has been differed if we applied the program for longer period or if the patients were assessed at multiple/longer terms. Moreover, as we mentioned above, we had no control over the level of intensity of the exercise practiced at home, where some of the patients practiced lower intensity exercise regimens that might had an effect on the overall mean six-minute walk distance of others who practiced in higher intensity.

The standardized dyspnea domains produce higher cross-sectional correlations than the individualized dyspnea domains. This finding is important because it indicates that the standardized CRQ dyspnea domain allows for better discrimination between different degrees of COPD severity. Also, the SF-36 addressed physical ability. Thus, we believe that the use of both questionnaires in our study broadened the content validity of the quantitative aspect of the QOL assessment.

These small improvements may have been because psychosocial improvements may take longer to be appreciated than physical improvements in PR participants. Also, on comparing the two questionnaires, the key difference between them was that the CRQ asked the individual to measure fear, panic and anxiety when short of breath, as well as the individual's sense of control and confidence over COPD. In contrast, the SF-36 had no questions that related to dyspnea, panic or gaining control. It is likely that the questionnaire could not detect these changes, which may account for the relative lack of responsiveness of the mental health summary component of the SF-36.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Spirometry</title><p>Despite that FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>% of predicted, FVC and FVC% of predicted improved slightly in group 1 following the two-month rehabilitation program, this improvement was significant for FVC and FVC% predicted but not statistically significant for FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>% of predicted.

The 6MWD is a simple, inexpensive, reliable and safe test to assess physical and functional capabilities among COPD patients. HRQL can be measured in patients with COPD either by disease-specific tools that have been specifically designed for use in patients with respiratory system disorders or by generic HRQL tools that can be used across populations with a variety of medical conditions allowing comparison of the results of pulmonary rehabilitation to therapeutic interventions in patients with other medical disorders.</p><p>Larger randomized studies are required to determine translation of benefits of early pulmonary rehabilitation into improved health economics.
