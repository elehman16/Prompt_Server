All adult patients admitted to the neurosurgical ICU after intracranial surgery with delayed extubation were screened for study eligibility. Delayed extubation was defined as the patient not extubated in the operating room at completion of the surgery The exclusion criteria included: age under 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; emergency operation; reoperation within 72 hours; operations related to the medulla oblongata; preoperative consciousness disorders (GCS&#x02264;14), epilepsy, dysphagia, or cough reflex impairment; unrecovered consciousness or spontaneous breathing within 2 hours after end of surgery; concomitant cardiovascular problems, including second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block; heart rate (HR) &#x0003c;50 beats per minute; systolic blood pressure (BP) &#x0003c;90 mm Hg or the need for continuous infusions of a vasopressor; refusal to participate; and enrollment in other trials.

Patients and all study personnel except for the investigative pharmacist were blind to the treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Two hours after end of surgery, the intervention group received a continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (Ai Bei Ning; Jiang Su Heng Rui Medicine Co. Ltd, Jiangsu Province, China) at a dose of 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. The control group received a maintenance infusion of normal saline at a volume and rate equal to that of the intervention group. The allocated intervention was terminated at 30 minutes after extubation or a maximum of 24 hours on the study infusion protocol.</p><p>The level of sedation was assessed by bedside nurses using the Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which ranged from 1 (unarousable) to 7 (dangerous agitation) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Routine SAS evaluation was incorporated into clinical practice in our ICU for &#x0003e;1 year before the start of this study.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The assessment of SAS was performed every hour or as needed after the infusion of experimental agents. The target level of sedation was set at a SAS score of 3 to 4. If the patient exhibited agitation (SAS score of 5 to 7), an ICU physician was consulted, and the causes of agitation were investigated (eg, pain, hypoxia, hypotension, or endotracheal tube obstruction). A rescue bolus of propofol (0.5 mg/kg) was given as needed. If agitation was not eliminated, then a continuous infusion of propofol (20 mg/mL) was started and titrated to reach an SAS of 3 to 4. Pain was treated using bolus of fentanyl in 0.05 mg increments on an as-needed basis. For cases in which the SAS score was &#x02264;2 (arouses to physical stimuli but does not communicate or follow commands), the trial intervention was stopped urgently. Other criteria for urgent stop included bradycardia (HR&#x0003c;50 beats/min after a 0.25 mg bolus of atropine), hypotension (systolic BP&#x0003c;90 mm Hg after infusion of 250 mL hydroxyethyl starch for 30 min), hypoxemia (pulse oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>]&#x0003c;90%), or neurological complications (cerebral hemorrhage, infarction or brain edema diagnosed by computed tomography).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Sedation Agitation Scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ana-29-132-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Weaning from mechanical ventilation and endotracheal extubation was performed according to our local extubation protocol.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> An ICU physician evaluated the patient using an extubation screening checklist, which included assessments of consciousness, respiration, and circulation status, muscle strength recovery, gag reflex, and swallowing function.

We hypothesized that the mean percentage of time in optimal sedation would increase to 95% after the use of dexmedetomidine.

Analgesia with dexmedetomidine is mediated primarily through an interaction at &#x003b1;-2a within the spinal cord, where drug activity attenuates nociceptive signal transduction. The actual mechanism of action appears to involve an interaction with opioid receptors, and although dexmedetomidine alone has been documented to reduce pain, the effect when given jointly with opioids may be additive or synergistic.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> All these advantages allow dexmedetomidine to be used after craniotomy.</p><p>Data reflecting the present study at our institution revealed that emergence agitation is common for the first day after major elective intracranial surgery, with approximately 29.3% of patients in the control group exhibiting agitation at some point during their hospitalization.

Patients in the dexmedetomidine group received less rescue fentanyl than in the control group.</p><p>All sedatives have cardiovascular adverse effects. Bradycardia and hypotension were most common with dexmedetomidine, found in up to 10% of cases.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine may result from both peripheral and central mechanisms. Dexmedetomidine is the pharmacologically active dextroisomer of medetomidine.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The stimulation of &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptors by dexmedetomidine in the pontine LC results in decreased firing of LC neurons secondary to their hyperpolarization. This drug also has a sympatholytic effect by decreasing the concentration of norepinephrine, which subsequently decreases the BP and the HR.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Bradycardia and hypotension were shown to be dose dependent, with no remarkable detrimental effect on cardiac function.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> However, the risk of bradycardia was significantly higher in studies that used both a loading dose and high maintenance doses (&#x0003e;0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) than in studies that did not use both.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> To avoid cardiovascular adverse effects, we performed continuous infusion (0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) without the use of a loading dose. In the present study, bradycardia was reported in 4 of 75 dexmedetomidine patients (5.3%) versus 0 control patients (0%); hypotension was observed in 6 dexmedetomidine patients (8%) and in 1 control patient (1.3%).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine also can prevent hyperdynamic responses during extubation without causing significant respiratory depression, allowing comfortable and high-quality recovery after intracranial neurosurgery.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Dexmedetomidine attenuated the increases in HR and BP after extubation and improved extubation conditions but did not prolong recovery in patients presenting for craniotomy. In the present study, the hemodynamic parameters in the dexmedetomidine group were significantly stable during extubation compared with the control group. No significant difference in SpO<sub>2</sub> during extubation was observed between the 2 groups.</p><p>The present study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. First, we selected a constant dexmedetomidine infusion rate of 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, without adjusting the dose according to the individual&#x02019;s ability to metabolize this drug. Therefore, the incidence of side effects increased. With a study design in which the caregiver was permitted to titrate the dexmedetomidine dose, further improvements in hemodynamic stability might be observed. Second, another possible limitation of the present study was the relatively small number of patients analyzed. Regarding sample size, this study was powered to detect differences in sedation and, thus, could not definitively detect differences in safety. Third, we assessed sedation from a caregiver&#x02019;s perspective. Future studies should also include the patient&#x02019;s perspective concerning the quality of sedation. Fourth, the study&#x02019;s findings cannot account for lesion location.</p><p>In summary, as a new sedative and analgesic drug, dexmedetomidine may be an effective agent for prophylactic sedation and analgesia in patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy. Dexmedetomidine can increase the mean percentage of time under optimal sedation and reduce the frequency of agitation and the degree of pain in patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy surgery. The infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) does not produce respiratory depression, but may increase the incidence of bradycardia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by Beijing Health Bureau (No: 2009-3-28).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nemergut</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Durieux</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Missaghi</surname><given-names>NB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
