AR is characterized by sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasal hypersensitivity, and signs of invasion of nasal mucosa by inflammatory cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] AR includes seasonal AR (SAR), perennial AR (PAR), and PAR with seasonal exacerbations. Prevalence of AR varies from population to population, but on an average, it can affect 25% to 35% of people.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>] It has a relevant impact on society because of its high prevalence, association with an impaired quality of life, and the presence of co-morbidities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">3</xref>] Because of the substantial medical care expenditure, the total burden of this disease goes beyond impairment of physical and social functioning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>]</p><p>Symptoms are produced by inflammatory mediators that are released upon activation of mast cells by antigen-IgE interaction. Histamine is the primary mediator involved in the pathophysiology and this explains the prominent role of histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists in the treatment of AR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">6</xref>] Recent studies have proved that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is also an important mediator of AR. PAF causes vasodilatation and an increase in vascular permeability that may contribute to the appearance of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">8</xref>] PAF and histamine are known to complement each other <italic>in vivo</italic>; histamine is a mediator of early response, being released from preformed reservoirs in mast cells, whereas PAF is mainly synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">3</xref>] Results from other studies indicate that CC chemokines, including monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), and eotaxin, may play an important role in inducing the selective recruitment of eosinophils and basophils to the allergic inflammatory site. CC chemokines are also known as histamine releasing factors. It is proved that histamine enhances transcription of CC chemokines from nasal mucosa which leads to further induction of histamine release. This cyclic cascade may cause prolonged allergic inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">9</xref>] The complexity of the disease and the multiple pathways involved offer many targets for drug treatment, but dual blockade of two important mediators (histamine and PAF) is likely to be a more effective treatment strategy for AR.</p><p>Two new generation H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists, olopatadine and rupatadine, are known as dual blockers. Olopatadine hydrochloride is a selective histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist possessing inhibitory effects on PAF and on the release of inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotriene and thromboxane from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes and eosinophils. Olopatadine was shown to be highly useful for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, and conjunctivitis in double-blind clinical trials. Olopatadine treatment has been claimed to lead to a great reduction of nasal obstruction than other drugs of the same category.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">10</xref>] Rupatadine fumarate is a selective non-sedating and long-acting oral histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist that has also been shown to have PAF antagonist activity. It is indicated for use in SAR, PAR, and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients aged 12 years or more. It has a fast onset of action, producing rapid symptomatic relief, and it also has an extended duration of clinical activity which allows once-daily administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">12</xref>]</p><p>Though individually olopatadine and rupatadine are efficacious in AR, additional pharmacodynamic activities of these drugs found in some studies indicate a likelihood of differences between these two drugs. The unique effect of rupatadine on interleukins (IL-6, IL-8) and olopatadine on leucotrienes (LTs), tromboxane A2 (TXA2), tachykinin, CC chemokines, leucocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) expression has prompted us to design the present study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">16</xref>] So this study was conducted to compare the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine and rupatadine in patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis in terms of improvement in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)/Adolescent Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (AdolRQLQ) scoring, serum IgE level, total and differential count of leucocytes, and reported adverse drug reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Seventy patients of SAR attending the department of ear, nose and throat (ENT), Prathima Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagunur, Karimnagar, were enrolled for this study. The study population included patients of either sex, aged between 12-60 years suffering from SAR (a type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction mediated by specific IgE antibody to a seasonal allergen leading to mucosal inflammation characterized by sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal blockage) with a past history of SAR (requiring treatment) of 6 months or longer and had documented positive allergy skin test during the previous year. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: Use of concomitant medication(s) that could affect the efficacy of candidate drugs; any existing medical or surgical condition that could affect the metabolism of drugs under study; clinically significant nasal disease (other than SAR) or significant nasal structural abnormalities including nasal polyps; clinically relevant respiratory tract malformations; recent nasal biopsy (within 2 months); nasal trauma; nasal surgery; atrophic rhinitis; rhinitis medicamentosa (within 2 months); or active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, routine use of b-agonists, or both; patients with known hypersensitivity to antihistaminics; patients with a history of respiratory tract infection or disorder within 2 weeks of the first visit or a respiratory tract infection during first visit; patients who has used antibiotics for acute conditions within 2 weeks of the first visit, or were treated with systemic corticosteroids within 2 months of study initiation, or were treated with topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1% hydrocortisone for dermatological conditions within 1 month of study initiation.

An increasing understanding of the pathomechanisms in the last few decades has revealed the potentiality of the new generation antihistaminics with dual blocking property in the treatment of AR. Rupatadine and olopatadine have already known to be effective in AR in several clinical trials, but this is the pilot study to compare their efficacy and safety and thus to choose the better agent.</p><p>This out-door based study has been conducted in a tertiary care center on a population which is homogenous with minimum ethnic variation. As most of the patients gave history of the disease for at least two consecutive seasons when rhinitis aggravates, we have chosen the winter months for conducting this study.</p><p>The association between eosinophils and allergic disease has been known for many years. The effector functions of eosinophils appear to be derived primarily from release of lipid mediators and proteins, including cytokines and granule proteins. Any allergic condition usually affects the percentage of eosinophil and its absolute count and probably that is the reason why the effects of the drugs have not been directly reflected on TLC and neutrophil count. Increase in eosinophil count is the hallmark of late phases of allergic rhinitis and olopatadine has shown a superior control on this hematological parameter in comparison to rupatadine. Atopic individuals can have IgE levels raised up to 10 times the normal value. On exposure to a nasal allergen, circulating IgE levels increases and remains elevated 2 weeks after the initial provocation. As allergic rhinitis is an IgE mediated immunological response, treatment with olopatadine proved to be better than rupatadine by reducing IgE level significantly.</p><p>The primary goal of treating SAR patients is to give symptomatic relief. So a significant decrease in TNSS has prognostic importance and olopatadine was found to have edge over rupatadine. As AR is a condition that markedly affects quality of life, ensuring a decent quality of life and reduction of RQLQ score is mandatory. In this study, olopatadine has been proved to be superior to rupatadine by decreasing RQLQ score significantly.</p><p>Rupatadine and olopatadine both are known to be dual blockers i.e. other than their antihistaminic property, they can antagonize PAF also and that is the reason why both the drugs are highly effective in AR. The difference in their efficacy is due to their varied pharmacodynamic effects. Rupatadine has a high H<sub>1</sub> receptor binding affinity which allows the molecule to inhibit the histamine-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production using concentrations that are below the plasma levels reached at therapeutic dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">22</xref>] Similarly, olopatadine has additional pharmacological actions which are beneficial in the treatment of AR. The probable superiority of olopatadine may be attributed to the following findings in previous studies: (1) Olopatadine can reduce the amount of cell-associated PAF by 52.8%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">10</xref>] (2) Olopatadine suppresses LTs and TXA2 release and PAF formation by reducing arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids, probably through interference with phospholipase A2 (PLA2).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">13</xref>] (3) Miyake <italic>et al</italic>., reported that olopatadine inhibited the release of peptide LTs from human eosinophils.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">13</xref>] (4) Olopatadine inhibited the histamine-enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and E-selectin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">23</xref>] (5) Olopatadine inhibited histamine-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration in cultured guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">20</xref>] (6) Olopatadine also antagonized histamine induced phosphoinositide turnover in cultured human conjunctival epithelial cells, human corneal fibroblast and transformed human trabecular meshwork cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">26</xref>] (7) Olopatadine inhibited antigen-induced histamine release from sensitized rat peritoneal exudate cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">27</xref>] (8) Olopatadine also inhibited anti-human IgE-induced histamine release from human conjunctival tryptase/chymase-containing mast cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">27</xref>] (9) Olopatadine showed inhibitory effects on tachykinin release from sensory nerve endings in isolated guinea pig bronchi and <italic>in vivo</italic> various experimental allergic models.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">14</xref>] (10) Olopatadine inhibited the release of CC chemokine production in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">15</xref>] (11) Olopatadine dose-dependently repressed the IL-5-induced expressions of CD11a/CD18 (Leukocyte Function-associated Antigen-1: LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) on rat peritoneal eosinophils suggesting that olopatadine may inhibit antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration through repression of LFA-1 and Mac-1 expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">16</xref>] (12) Olopatadine has been shown to suppress the activity of S100A12 which is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, and exerts multiple proinflammatory activities including chemotaxis for monocytes and neutrophils.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">28</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>From the analysis of present comparative clinical study between olopatadine and rupatadine, we can conclude that olopatadine is a better choice in seasonal allergic rhinitis in comparison to rupatadine due to its better efficacy and safety profile. Non-blinding being its limitation, the findings of this exploratory pilot study can be confirmed by multicentric, randomized, double-blind large population studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The authors would like to express heartfelt thanks to Elizabeth F.
