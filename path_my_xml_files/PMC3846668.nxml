Although many patients regain a basic locomotor pattern, one study has reported that only 7% of patients discharged from rehabilitation are able to walk safely in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A further study suggests that as many as 50% of stroke patients discharged into the community will fall and that a large proportion of these falls will occur during manoeuvres in which the basic walking pattern needs to be adapted, such as in turning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent studies have postulated that impairments in gait which persist after stroke, such as diminished speed, asymmetries in step lengths and gait phase durations, may have an underlying impoverished ability to adapt the gait pattern as required to mobilize independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Hence, the incidence of falls after stroke may be due to impaired ability to flexibly adapt an already impoverished coordination pattern during straight walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in order to turn, step over an obstacle, target a safe foot-placement, or alter speed as needed for independent community ambulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Current approaches to rehabilitation of gait following stroke are varied, based on different models of motor physiology and disease recovery, but most share targeting motor impairments during straight walking only as opposed to adaptive walking ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overall, evidence indicates that current rehabilitation approaches have only modest effects on impairment and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, new more effective treatments need to be developed and tested within robust, early phase studies. Treatments should be supported by a sound theoretical basis; specifically, by an understanding of the mechanisms which cause gait deficits and proposed treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Evidence from the motor learning literature indicates that effective neurorehabilitation requires task-specific practice that should be varied, intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and driven by a combination of extrinsic movement goals and implicit knowledge of movement control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent synthesis of existing evidence further suggests that task-specific practice of walking which targets restoration of gait coordination patterns (temporal and spatial symmetry) may be beneficial in improving overall walking function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The goal of normalizing walking patterns, particularly symmetry, is controversial given enduring neuromuscular asymmetries after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, meta-analysis indicates that interventions that show most promise for improvements in walking function (task-specific locomotor practice and auditory cueing) both involve repetition of a more normative gait pattern, while the least beneficial (ankle-foot orthoses/functional electrical stimulation and exercise) do not explicitly practice a normative gait pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The findings from the systematic examination of the evidence base lend support to the notion that repeated exposure to normalized movement patterns could bring about positive changes in motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and support the development of interventions that enable patients to undertake intensive practice of functional tasks in a manner that drives an optimised movement pattern.</p><p>Rehabilitation approaches identified as showing the most promise for eliciting normalized gait coordination patterns utilised auditory cues as extrinsic movement goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While there are good indications that stroke survivors are able to adjust gait coordination in response to auditory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], some studies have shown that visual cues may be more effective in triggering gait adjustments in healthy participants walking straight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Current understanding of motor control of locomotion indicates that visual information comprises one of the most important and salient sources of information used during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and that stroke survivors have been reported to become more dependent on vision to maintain dynamic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Paradigms involving walking in response to visual cues have recently begun to be used to investigate functional walking tasks, including turning and obstacle avoidance, in various patient populations, both overground and on a treadmill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Despite numerous small experimental studies reporting the potential efficacy of using visual cues to enhance gait function, to date, there have been no robust clinical trials of these interventions that we are aware of.</p><p>Based on the current understanding of motor control of walking and stroke rehabilitation, we hypothesize that visual cues would be more effective in triggering gait recovery and adaptability following stroke than interventions not including visual cues. It is hypothesized that anticipated improvements to functional gait may be derived from task-specific practice of regulating changes in the relation between the base of support and the centre of mass occurring when step widths and lengths change, which is crucial for dynamic balance control.</p><p>The study reported here comprises an early phase pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aiming to examine the feasibility of a trial comparing task-specific locomotor practice incorporating visual cues to usual care rehabilitation, which does not include visual cues. Specifically, the study aims to:</p><p>1. Characterise participants who are included and excluded into the trial from four NHS trusts in the West Midlands.</p><p>2. Provide an estimation of recruitment rates to the trial across the multiple sites.</p><p>3. Estimate the adherence of participants allocated to the visual cue training (VCT) to the prescribed dose.</p><p>4. Present the completeness of proposed outcome data.</p><p>5. Calculate sample sizes for a subsequent definitive trial, based on measured changes in performance for usual care and VCT intervention groups.</p><p>6.

In T-VCT, a force-instrumented treadmill (CMill, Forcelink, NL, USA) will be used to illuminate footfall targets at specified locations 2&#x02013;3 steps in advance, in line with current knowledge of gaze behaviour during locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] according to gait event detection of the ongoing gait cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In O-VCT, therapists will manually place footfall target at specified locations, according to the baseline gait assessment, along an overground walkway.</p><p>Both VCT interventions are designed to target the essential control and functional requirements of walking, namely (1) speed, (2) symmetry (equality of step length), and (3) adaptability to behavioural goals of the participant and environmental constraints, including abilities for turning and shortening, lengthening or narrowing (e.g., tandem walking) of steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The potential efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of both O-VCT and T-VCT treatment modalities are being investigated because some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have indicated support for mechanically aided rehabilitation approaches due to the capacity to deliver high dosage and high intensity training protocols incorporating motor learning and motor control theoretical perspectives. However, the efficacy of electromechanically aided walking practice has not been established and so they are not often offered as part of current practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>There will be three treatment arms all of which share the same frequency, duration and intensity in terms of encouraging therapists to maintain equal session durations and same intensity of continuous walking. Participants will receive walking practice for one hour, 2 times per week, for 8 weeks duration. The target exercise capacity is 20 minutes of continuous, independent walking, with symmetrical step length. A resource usage log will record all other aspects of therapy such as occupational therapy, for which participants are referred and will continue to receive, irrespective of treatment allocation.</p><p>O-VCT and UC will be delivered in four participating hospital settings embedded within current service provision. Only one specialized treadmill (CMill, Forcelink, NL, USA) for T-VCT is available to the study and so the feasibility of this treatment is being assessed through treatment delivery at one regional treatment site (within a mean 11 mile radius of participating NHS sites delivering O-VCT and UC treatment arms) at the University of Birmingham. Patients recruited from the participating hospitals will travel to the University to receive this arm of training if they are randomised to it. This is not additional travel, but in lieu of their normal transfer to hospital for treatment. This model of a regional treatment centre is in line with the provision of other specialist rehabilitation services such as functional electrical stimulation falls efficacy scale and gait assessment in this part of the UK.</p><p>Treating therapists will receive training and a detailed treatment manual to promote consistency between therapists and sites. Adherence to the intervention by therapists will be assessed during their involvement in the trial by A. Wimperis and K. Hollands through video observation at weeks 2 and 6 of each therapists&#x02019; first treatment period. Further training for the therapist will be provided, if necessary, to improve compliance with treatment protocols. The involvement of different therapists and different sites promotes generalizability, providing multiple viewpoints regarding the treatment and its feasibility for delivery across different modes of service provision.</p></sec><sec><title>VCT interventions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)</title><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Illustration of training target placement for O-VCT and T-VCT.

Patients are presented with stepping targets (white rectangles, 8 cm deep &#x000d7; 40 cm wide (which adhere to the walkway in O-VCT or are illuminated on the treadmill belt in T-VCT) along a 5 m long walkway (O-VCT), or 3 m treadmill belt (T-VCT), to which they must aim to step on. In both VCT treatment arms, stepping targets can be seen at least two steps in advance in accordance with visuo-motor control literature indicating where healthy adults typically look while walking to targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The width of the stepping targets corresponds to half of the width of the walkway, allowing for self-selected width of stepping such that medial stabilisation strategies are not constrained while patients are being challenged to alter step length and speed. The depth of the targets corresponds to the variability in step length reported in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Participants are instructed to step on the targets with any part of the foot. Thus, the depth of the targets has been selected such that they should only be missed if the error in footfall location is greater than usual variability. The location of the stepping targets is predetermined according to goals for 10% increments in improved symmetry and altered as treatment progresses to increase intensity. The location of targets is calculated and prescribed to treating clinicians by the research assessor following baseline overground gait assessment and prior to the start of training. Prescribed targets for progressing speed (beyond 0.4 m/s or 0.8 m/sfor the moderate and severely impaired, respectively) will also be provided according to 10% increments to baseline measures. Participants are allowed to use a walking aid and prescribed ankle/foot orthoses or to grasp the therapist&#x02019;s hand, wall or handrail for safety. Stepping towards increasingly symmetrical targets is practiced at increasing walking speed as treatment progresses (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Adaptability practice</title><p>Stepping targets are placed to elicit step adjustments similar to that required in environments with clutter or situations requiring alterations to foot-placement or direction. Targets are located along the walkway/treadmill belt to elicit lengthening, shortening (&#x000b1;25% of baseline step lengths) and narrowing of paretic and non-paretic steps. In the T-VCT treatment arm, illuminated targets shift to elicit step alterations at varying times in the ongoing gait cycle and obstacles are presented in red and white stripes to be avoided (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>e). Thus with the exception of obstacle avoidance in T-VCT and the ability to practice changes to walking in time-critical manner, the number and magnitude of each type of step alteration are the same across both VCT treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Turning practice</title><p>Turning is performed by walking between targets located 1 m apart alternately on the left and to the right of the walkway/treadmill belt. Participants are instructed to &#x02018;turn to walk between the obstacles&#x02019; in such a fashion as to slalom their way across the walkway/treadmill belt. In O-VCT, once the end of the path is reached, participants practice a 180&#x000b0; turn using a horizontal marker to cue foot placement according to a two-step turn seen in healthy adults, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Participants then slalom their way back down the path.</p><p>Each session will consist of 5 min each of warm up and stretching, 20&#x02013;30 min (plus 10 min for rests as required) overground walking practice training programme and a 5 min cool-down. Each of the components of walking ability (symmetry, adaptability and turning) is practiced in blocks at increasing speed as treatment intensity progresses. Thus, walking is practiced in accordance with current recommendations of motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], i.e., with many repetitions with increasing intensity, variation of parameters, in response to external demands and using implicitly known (visuo-motor) control of the gait cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Treatment will progress in phases layering practice of walking speed, symmetry, adaptability and turning in bouts of practice, as detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Participants will continue to the next treatment phase even in cases where goals have not been met.</p><p>Walking speed in the O-VCT arm will be monitored and progressed by timing walks, with therapists&#x02019; use of a stopwatch, and feedback to the participant. T-VCT treatment will be delivered by an experienced, HPC registered research therapist. The CMill uses an assessment of each footfall to determine the timing and location of visual cues projected as light targets shone 2&#x02013;3 steps ahead on the treadmill. The location of visual cues and progression of treatment will therefore be pre-programmed according to baseline gait parameters in the same manner as for the O-VCT treatment. A safety harness is worn at all times during T-VCT treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Usual care</title><p>The purposes of the UC group are to provide (1) a task-specific-based intervention that does not include use of visual cues specifically designed to influence quality or adaptability of gait; (2) an equal number of interactions and time spent with a physical therapist to minimize any potential for bias due to differential exposure and minimize the risk for differential loss to follow-up; and (3) a credible training program so that the participants would consider themselves involved in meaningful therapy activity. UC is standard NHS physiotherapy, broadly defined as a task-specific-based intervention that may involve walking overground or on a treadmill; components of gait (such as weight shifting or initiation); exercises aimed at improving upper or lower extremity strength; balance and coordination; prescription of assistive devices (such as orthotics or walking aides). UC may involve any standard equipment or objects such as cones or beanbags, which may be incorporated into walking practice for functional use, e.g., picking up. These objects will not be used specifically as visual cues for foot placement, symmetry or timing of gait, or by way of aiming to avoid or hit targets. The content of UC treatment will be captured by a treatment log for the purpose of capturing UC physiotherapy specifically used to influence walking. Therapists complete the log by ticking relevant categories for environment, aids and equipment used, activities undertaken, facilitation and feedback provided, and duration of each treatment session.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome measures for this early phase trial focus upon the feasibility and safety of treatment. In order to determine whether a large late phase trial is warranted, we are investigating recruitment, participation, compliance, and safety of the interventions. Outcome measures therefore include:</p><p>1. The numbers of patients willing to be recruited into both control and VCT groups.</p><p>2. The willingness of physiotherapists at each collaborating site to enrol patients, i.e., the number of potentially eligible participants referred to the study.</p><p>3. The numbers of patients who do not complete the allocated treatment, thus dropping out of the study, and the reasons for dropping out.</p><p>4. Completeness of outcome data, i.e., percentage of patients with no missing values in outcome assessments.</p><p>5. Number and type of adverse events that can be directly attributed to the project intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Potential for efficacy will be assessed through measures reflecting the primary aims of the intervention, i.e., speed and symmetry, turning ability, and adaptability of walking.</p><p>Primary measures of walking ability:</p><p>1. Gait speed: Proportion of participants achieving a gait speed of 0.4 m/s and 0.8 m/s, measured during a 10 m walk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Perry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have shown that these gait speed classifications correspond to walking abilities in the community, with a gait speed of &#x0003c;0.4 m/s for household walkers, 0.4&#x02013;0.8 m/s for limited community walkers, and &#x0003e;0.8 m/s for community walkers. It has been demonstrated that progressing from one of these classifications to the next correlates with improvement in physical functioning and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and these categories also correspond with changes in the functional ambulation category, a categorical scale rating level of skill in functional ambulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>2. Symmetry and turning ability: Time taken (s) and number of steps to complete a 180&#x000b0; turn will be measured on the GaitRite instrumented walkway. Time taken to turn will be calculated as the difference (in time) between the first footfall over a line (tape mark) on the pressure sensitive walkway delineating where to turn and the first footfall over the line on the return walk. Longer time to turn and increased number of steps to turn have all been identified as performance measures which may be indicative of difficulty turning and increased falls risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Additionally, spatial-temporal gait parameters will be measured during walking over the GaitRite to quantify symmetry of left and right steps. Stepping strategies during turning will be measured through gait parameters calculated by GaitRite software including step width, step length (relative to line of progression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and single support time during turning steps.</p><p>3. Adaptability of gait: The number of times participants fail to hit stepping targets arranged to cue varying (baseline step length &#x000b1;30% and medial) foot placements on the overground walkway (as previously described and illustrated in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A target is classified as missed if the participant is visually observed to be unable to place the whole foot accurately on the target independently and safely (according to visual inspection). The assessor documents the number of targets missed in three consecutive passes of the walkway (a total of 48 targets including three attempts of each step adjustment on each side) as well as time taken to complete each pass of the walkway and a score for the level of supervision or assistance required.</p><p>We will further explore the relationship between gait impairments and activity level measures of independence of functional walking in the community. Therefore, the following secondary outcome measures are included:</p><p>&#x02022;The timed up and go test has previously been shown to have good test-retest reliability in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The time taken with a stopwatch will be used to test ability to walk and turn in the context of this standardised test of everyday functional mobility.</p><p>&#x02022;Fugl-Meyer assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] will be used to assess changes in motor and sensory impairment.</p><p>&#x02022;Berg balance scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] will be used to capture any effects of interventions on balance.</p><p>&#x02022;Overall independence of mobility in the community setting will be rated using the functional ambulation category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022;Falls efficacy scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] will be used to assess changes in confidence to walk without falling, which may be expected as a result of practice of adaptable walking.</p><p>&#x02022;SF-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This is a short-form health survey with only 12 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores, including physical functioning, and social, emotional, mental and general health, and has been included to measure effects on broader quality of life (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Assessment schedule and measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Outcome measure</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Clinical status</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>baseline</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Post-intervention (8 weeks post-randomisation)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Follow-up (3 months post-randomisation)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stroke date and lesion location<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Demographics<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sheffield screening test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mini mental state examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Premorbid modified Rankin Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Visual attention &#x02013;

A cost-consequence analysis will be undertaken presenting all costs and outcomes in a disaggregated form for each trial arm. Within the economic evaluation, alongside a larger trial, a cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis are proposed to determine the cost per unit reduction in impairment, and cost per QALY gained (using the SF-6D derived from SF-12 responses).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment of safety and adverse event monitoring</title><p>The risk of serious or adverse events from taking part in the study is considered low; however, as with conventional gait rehabilitation, there is a small possibility of injury as a result of a fall. No special safety assessments are planned. Clinicians will be advised that participant safety is paramount. Walking will be practiced within limits considered by the therapist to be safe at the time and targets for treatment progression will only be used as a guideline. In addition to the compliance of standard NHS reporting procedures, adverse events, including falls, will be reported immediately to the study coordinating centre via email using an adverse event form and then quarterly to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC). Adverse events will be reviewed immediately by the treating therapist and the research therapist to determine the severity, cause and likelihood of recurrence. Training will be discontinued if the treating therapist or research therapist deems continuation unsafe.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approvals and data monitoring</title><p>Ethical approval has been granted by the NRES Committee West Midlands (11/WM/0167).

In accordance with the suggested need for studies in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], this early phase trial will test the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of two novel approaches which offer repetitive task-specific practice of walking in response to visually cued external demands designed to exploit implicitly known visuo-motor control of the gait cycle. Results will indicate potential response (e.g., a confidence interval indicating if, and which of the VCT interventions has the potential to be superior to the UC) to walking practice incorporating visual cues, stepping adaptability and turning practice in contrast to UC in community-dwelling stroke survivors.</p><p>For clinicians, this research will help to define an evidence-based protocol for VCT within routine practice, which is targeted towards increased speed, improved spatial symmetry and dynamic gait control during adaptations to step length and turning.
