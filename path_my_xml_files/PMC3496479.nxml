Lynch syndrome gene carriers are recommended to undergo regular endoscopic surveillance of their colon. This surveillance is preferably carried out by colonoscopy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] in order to detect adenomas or less frequently early stages of colon cancer. It is important that the complete colonic mucosa can be inspected, especially the proximal colon, since most tumors in Lynch syndrome develop in this part of the colon. For inspection, a meticulously clean colon is therefore a prerequisite. Various colon-cleansing solutions have been studied in the past. Of these, a polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG) is routinely prescribed for bowel cleansing, but it is often poorly tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sodium phosphate (NaP) may be an effective alternative, and is often better tolerated because of the small amount of liquid intake. However, it has other disadvantages like acute phosphate nephropathy and should be used with caution by at risk individuals and not be prescribed to patients with cardial and/or renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In these earlier studies it was often not clear if the study participants underwent a surveillance colonoscopy previously, nor was information about special patient groups available. The aim of this study was to randomly compare the effects of preparation on bowel cleansing with PEG or NaP and to evaluate the acceptance of the two solutions by Lynch syndrome gene carriers who used PEG as colon cleansing in the past.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>This single blinded study was carried out at the department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in a Dutch University hospital. During 1&#x000a0;year, Lynch syndrome gene carriers, who were scheduled for a surveillance colonoscopy, were asked to participate in the study. They were enrolled in a surveillance colonoscopy program and underwent at least one colonoscopy previously at which they used PEG as preparation on bowel cleansing. Patients with a history of colonic surgery were excluded. All procedures took place in the afternoon. Participants were randomly and single-blindly assigned to either PEG (Norgine bv, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) or NaP (Ferring, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands).</p><p>Lynch syndrome gene carriers are generally healthy persons without physical and medical restrictions to use NaP.</p><p>Patients who were assigned to the PEG-group were given a special dietary prescription. 2&#x000a0;days before colonoscopy only lightly digestible products will be consumed and at the day before colonoscopy only fluid products. In addition, at the day before colonoscopy they had to use 15 gram magnesium sulfate and 10&#x000a0;mg bisacodyl (both orally) (Boehringer Ingelheim, Alkmaar, the Netherlands). At the day of colonoscopy patients had to use 4 litres PEG or at least enough until the stool is clear. PEG was not given as a split-dose. Patients who were assigned to the NaP group used a lightly digestible breakfast and lunch at the day before colonoscopy, as prescribed in the instructions for use. After lunch at the day before colonoscopy, they consumed only clear fluids, at least 3 litres until the colonoscopy. In the evening before colonoscopy 45&#x000a0;ml of NaP had to be taken. Three hours before colonoscopy another 45&#x000a0;ml of NaP had to be used. Informed consent was obtained and the study was approved by the local Medical Ethical Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Instruments</title><p>The quality of bowel cleansing was assessed for each segment of the colon (descending, transverse and ascending colon and the coecum) and graded as excellent (no fecal matter), good (small amounts of thin, liquid fecal matter; easy to remove), fair (moderate amounts of thick liquid fecal matter; difficult to remove) and poor (large amounts of thick liquid or solid fecal matter; not to remove) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Cleansing grading score by the endoscopist</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Excellent</td><td align="left">No fecal matter in the colon</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Good</td><td align="left">Small amounts of thin, liquid fecal matter in the colon; easy to remove</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fair</td><td align="left">Moderate amounts of thick liquid fecal matter in the colon; difficult to remove</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Poor</td><td align="left">Large amounts of thick liquid or solid fecal matter in the colon; unable to remove</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>During the day of preparation before colonoscopy and 1&#x000a0;week after colonoscopy, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their experiences with the dietary pattern, potential interference with daily activities, tolerance and side effects of the bowel preparation and the taste of the liquid.

The endoscopist (blinded for the way of bowel cleansing) filled out a report about the effectiveness of bowel cleansing and the duration of the introduction time and the time of the whole colonoscopy ranked as 12.5&#x000a0;min or less, 12.5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;min, 25&#x02013;37.5&#x000a0;min and more than 37.5&#x000a0;min. The endoscopy nurse (also blinded for the way of bowel cleansing) filled out a report about the observation of signs of pain during colonoscopy. The pain score was ranked on a visual analog score from 1 to 5 as no pain (1); mild pain (2); moderate pain (3); severe pain and more sedation is necessary (4) and interrupted colonoscopy because of very severe pain (5).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were collected and entered into an electronic database.

The remaining 116 patients (M/F 58/58, mean age 50&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;30 years) were included in the analysis. Fifty-three patients received PEG and 63 NaP. Twenty-three (20%) participants underwent one colonoscopy in the past, 59 (51%) underwent 2-5 colonoscopies, 31 (27%) had 6-10 colonoscopies and 3 (2%) patients underwent more than 10 colonoscopies (median 3).</p><p>In only one patient the special diet at the day before colonoscopy interfered with daily activities (0.6%). Eighty four percent of all patients did not mention any or only little problems at the day before the colonoscopy. At the day of colonoscopy the preparation with the laxative interfered with their daily activities in nineteen patients (16%). Twenty patients using PEG (38%) found the preparation almost intolerable in contrast to seven (11%) patients using NaP (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) before colonoscopy. A week after colonoscopy 24 (45%) patients using PEG and 47 (75%) of those using NaP evaluated the preparation as tolerable (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). Twenty-two (42%) patients using PEG and 11 (17.5%) using NaP mentioned the preparation as neutral (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). At least seven (13%) patients using PEG (four of them evaluated the preparation as more difficult afterwards) and five (8%) patients using NaP) (the same five patients who communicated this before) evaluated the preparation as intolerable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most commonly mentioned side effects of the preparation were nausea, abdominal cramps and flatulence; these side effects were mentioned in the instructions of PEG and NaP.

The majority of patients (80%) received midazolam as sedation during the colonoscopy. During the colonoscopy the endoscopy nurse observed pain on a visual analog score in 73 (33 PEG and 40 NaP) of all patients (47%); of them 17 (15%) suffered from a lot of pain (6 PEG and 11 NaP).

For an optimal detection of colonic neoplasia a clean colon is very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To achieve a clean colon, compliance with the bowel preparation regimen is necessary. The most commonly used bowel cleansing solutions are often burdensome to patients because of the large amounts of fluids and their bad taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To our knowledge no information is available about the experience of bowel preparation in Lynch patients in a regular colonoscopy program.

Moreover, in the ascending colon the quality of bowel cleansing was significantly more poor in the NaP group (11% vs. 2%).

This is in accordance with some earlier studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but the most important observation was a significantly more clean proximal part of the colon with PEG preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This last finding is important with regards to the afore-mentioned high risk of neoplasia in the proximal colon in Lynch syndrome.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study relating to bowel cleansing in Lynch gene carriers. Although this study was conducted in a small group of gene carriers, who visited the outpatient clinic in one hospital, we conclude that bowel preparation, in this representive group of Lynch gene carriers, is not optimal with both preparations. In the proximal part of the colon PEG seems to clean the mucosa better than NaP. These findings suggest that for optimal (proximal) bowel cleansing in Lynch syndrome PEG is a better option than NaP. The efficacy of bowel cleansing should always be more important than patient preferences in determining the choice of bowel preparation. Maybe other reasons than taste and amount of cleansing liquid are of influence at patients&#x02019; acceptability for bowel cleansing. So it seems mandatory that in patients at high risk of (proximal) colon cancer, better cleaning regimes as well as patients&#x02019; acceptance should be developed and investigated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all patients who filled in the questionnaires and Mrs. Dr. Margriet Moret-Hartman for her support in statistical procedures.</p><sec
