All patients consented to participation in the study after a thorough informed consent procedure. Sixty-five patients (106 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective study from June 2007 to January 2009. Patients with a diagnosis of OAG were considered eligible for this study if they were newly discovered on no previous medication (primary group of 41 eyes [group 1]), or had confirmed glaucoma poorly controlled on medications, or requesting a decrease number of medications (adjunctive group of 65 eyes [group 2]).</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they had evidence of glaucoma other than OAG (angle closure, inflammatory, or neovascular) in the study eye, were younger than 18 years, had any ocular condition in the study eye that hindered adequate visualization and treatment of the TM, (4) had prior glaucoma surgery in the study eye.</p><p>Preoperative assessment included ophthalmic examination Snellen visual acuity, IOP measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometry, slit-lamp examination and gonioscopy, and funduscopy with evaluation of cup:disc ratio and pallor. At least two preoperative IOP readings were taken within 2 weeks before the laser treatment was performed. The average of the preoperative IOP was used as the baseline IOP. Visual field testing was performed for all patients to confirm the diagnosis. A drop of miotic (pilocarpine nitrate 2%) and brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (Alphagan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) were installed in the eye before laser treatment to assist in visualization of TM and to prevent IOP spikes.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgery</title><p>The procedure was performed with topical benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4% for anesthesia. With the patient seated at the laser slit-lamp system, a Goldmann three-mirror goniolens or Latina lens was placed on the eye with methylcellulose 1%. Patients were treated with the Ellex, SOLO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SLT laser (Ellex Medical Pty. Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) a frequency-doubled q-switched Nd: YAG laser emitting at 532 nm with a pulse duration of 3 nsec and a spot size of 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, coupled to a slit-lamp delivery system. A low-power helium&#x02013;neon laser served as an aiming beam to provide easy targeting of the treatment area. The laser is capable of delivering pulse energies ranging from 0.2 to 1.7 mJ. Treatment began at 0.4 mJ and was titrated according to the response. If cavitation bubbles appeared the laser energy was reduced by 0.1 mJ until only a few bubbles formed and treatment was continued at this energy level. If no cavitation bubble was observed, the pulse energy was increased by 0.1 mJ until bubble formation and then decreased as described above. Higher energy was required for the treatment of the superior, less pigmented angle. Approximately 100 adjacent, but nonoverlapping, laser spots were placed over 360&#x000b0; of the TM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Postoperative follow-up</title><p>Immediately after the laser treatment, prednisolone acetate (1%) drops were administered once in the treated eye then three times daily for 3 days. Alphagan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> eye drops were also used to control postoperative IOP spikes. The IOP in the treated eye was assessed and recorded 1 hour after surgery. The same preoperative antiglaucoma medication regimen was continued until the second postoperative visit (1 week). Patients were evaluated at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. At each visit, the visual acuity and IOP were measured, and slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment was performed. Fundus examination and gonioscopy were repeated after 4 weeks of follow-up. A repeat visual field was performed every 6 months postoperatively. All major and minor complications and complaints were recorded and treated appropriately.</p><p>All ophthalmic medications were recorded before surgery and at each subsequent visit. Gradual reduction of antiglaucoma medications was initiated 1 week following the procedure, after ensuring an adequate pressure drop. Combined therapy was considered two medications and each medication was decreased separately. Medically necessary medication changes were made at the physician's discretion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are described are range, mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) as appropriate. Comparison of IOP over the study period was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple comparisons <italic>post hoc</italic> for the two groups. Comparison of the number medications was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with multiple comparisons <italic>post hoc</italic> for the two groups. A probability value (<italic>P</italic>-value) less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This outcome is very similar to our results of 69-70% of patients achieving 20% or more reduction in IOP. Latina <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> reported the greatest reduction in IOP occurred on the first postoperative day (30.2%) and by 26 weeks, the average IOP reduction (in percent) from baseline for the entire cohort was 18.7% (4.6 mmHg).

SLT addresses the problems of compliance in patients being a one-time procedure. It is repeatable with no damage to the ultrastructure of the trabecular meshwork.

There is a tendency of the IOP lowering effect to wane over time hence, regular follow-up is required.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
