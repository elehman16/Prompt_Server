The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of tofacitinib on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eligible patients (&#x02265;18 years of age) with a diagnosis of active UC (total Mayo score of 6-12 points and moderately-to-severely active disease on sigmoidoscopy) were randomized in a 2:2:2:3:3 ratio to receive oral tofacitinib 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or placebo twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks. PROs were assessed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient-Reported Treatment Impact (IBD PRTI) survey.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At Week 8, mean IBDQ total scores had improved relative to baseline across all five treatment groups (baseline range 123.2-134.5; Week 8 range 149.6-175.4). Improvement from baseline was significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) for tofacitinib 15 mg BID versus placebo. For tofacitinib 15 mg BID, most patients reported satisfaction or extreme satisfaction, definite preference for tofacitinib, and definite willingness to use tofacitinib again on the IBD PRTI at week 8. Patients achieving endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopy score of 0) had significantly higher IBDQ scores and favorable PRTI scores than those not achieving endoscopic remission.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Short-term treatment with tofacitinib BID was associated with dose-dependent improvement in health-related quality of life and patient preferences for tofacitinib.

Current medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) are only effective in a proportion of patients and for patients who fail to respond, surgery is often necessary. A study of Canadian patients with UC calculated approximately one-tenth of patients will have a colectomy within 10 years of diagnosis and one-sixth within 20 years of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a novel, oral small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is being investigated for use in several inflammatory diseases, including UC. In kinase assays, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signaling by receptors associated with JAK3 and JAK1 while it demonstrates reduced inhibition for JAK2- and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)-associated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. JAKs mediate signal transduction activity by the surface receptors for multiple cytokines. Importantly, tofacitinib directly inhibits signaling for an important subset of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These cytokines are integral to lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of their signaling may result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In an 8-week Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with moderately-to-severely active UC (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00787202), treatment with tofacitinib was associated with a significant dose-dependent improvement in clinical response and clinical remission compared with placebo. Definitions of remission and response have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) represent an integral and increasingly important aspect of drug development as a complementary measure of efficacy because they represent direct measures of patient-perceived benefit. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) has been used in many trials and is generally accepted as providing valuable additional information regarding the efficacy of treatment for patients with UC. The outcome can be measured in absolute terms (e.g., severity of a symptom, sign, or state of the disease) or as a change from a previous measure. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient-Reported Treatment Impact (IBD PRTI) survey asks about patient&#x02019;s overall satisfaction with their current treatment and overall willingness to initiate and continue the treatment versus their previous treatment.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of tofacitinib on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient preferences for tofacitinib, we report for the first time a distinct set of PROs from the 8-week Phase II RCT. We further report on the relationship between the PROs of the IBDQ and the IBD PRTI. The relationship between these PROs and the Mayo score-based clinical and endoscopic outcomes were also analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years of age and had a diagnosis of UC for &#x02265;3 months before study entry, had active disease defined by a Mayo score of 6-12 points (in which scores range from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicating more severe disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and moderately-to-severely active disease on sigmoidoscopy. Patients could receive oral mesalamine and/or oral corticosteroids at a stable dose of &#x02264;30 mg per day of prednisone equivalence. Exclusion criteria, permitted medications, and prohibited concomitant medications have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This 8-week, multicenter, Phase II RCT was conducted at 51 centers in 17 countries between January 2009 and September 2010. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:2:2:3:3 ratio to receive oral tofacitinib at doses of 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or placebo administered twice daily (BID). Patients were treated for 8 weeks and followed for a further 4 weeks. The randomization process and primary efficacy and safety evaluations have previously been described in full [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>PRO instruments</title><p>PROs were assessed by the IBDQ and the 3-item IBD PRTI (Version 2) survey. These PROs were pre-defined secondary efficacy measures in the study protocol. The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated instrument for measuring disease-specific HRQoL in patients with IBD, including UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The IBDQ comprises 32 items which are grouped into four domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. The four domains are scored as follows: bowel symptoms, 10 to 70; systemic symptoms, 5 to 35; emotional function, 12 to 84; and social function: 5 to 35. With 1 to 7 points for each item, the total score on this index ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IBDQ response has been defined as an increase in IBDQ total score of &#x02265;16 points from baseline, and remission has been defined as a total IBDQ score of &#x02265;170 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The IBDQ was self-completed by patients at baseline (Day 1) and at Week 8.</p><p>The IBD PRTI survey (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) comprises three individual questions concerning patient satisfaction with study treatment, patient preference for study drug over prior treatment (this question on subject preference for study medication is prefaced by a simple question about previous treatments for IBD in order to place the preference question into context), and patient willingness to reuse the study treatment again. Each of the three questions (the fourth question on previous treatment was for information only) was scored on a 5-point scale. Patients completed the survey at the end of the study (Week 8), or at early withdrawal from the study. The IBD PRTI is a measure for assessing patient satisfaction, patient preferences for study treatments, and willingness to use treatment again. The utility of assessing these concepts within clinical trials has been demonstrated by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], disease activity of patients with UC was measured using the Mayo scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The full Mayo system consists of four subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 points, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Total scores per patient range from 0 to 12 points. The four subscores are: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy, and physician global assessment. Clinical response was defined as a decrease in Mayo score from baseline of &#x02265;3 points and &#x02265;30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of &#x02265;1 point or an absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1. Clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score of &#x02264;2 points, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, and endoscopic remission was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. The partial Mayo score is a non-invasive outcome measure based on three of the four full Mayo subscores and lacks the endoscopy findings subscore; therefore, it is based on a scale of 0 to 9.</p><p>During the trial, the total Mayo score was assessed at baseline and Week 8 and the partial Mayo score was assessed at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 8.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pre-specified</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase II study was based on the total Mayo score clinical response at Week 8. The IBDQ, IBD PRTI, and partial Mayo score we report were pre-specified secondary efficacy analyses.</p><p>The analysis of clinical response and clinical remission at Week 8 was performed using a maximal efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) model with treatment group as a factor and a term included for prior anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Patients with data missing for reasons other than insufficient response to therapy or an adverse event related to UC were excluded from the analysis. All IBDQ data for the four domains and total score were summarized by time post-dose for each dose. The Week 8 change from baseline for each dose was analyzed using an analysis of covariance that allowed for variation due to dose group and baseline value. The individual IBD PRTI items were scored separately. Missing IBDQ and IBD PRTI data were not replaced.</p><p>The full analysis set (FAS) was the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses and included all randomized patients who had either withdrawn as a treatment failure or had completed at least 1 week of dosing and had at least one valid Mayo score during the active double-blind phase of the study. The intention-to-treat population analysis classified all patients with missing Week 8 data as non-responders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Post-Hoc analyses</title><p>We performed a series of supplemental (post-hoc) calculations using all available data (by pooling all treatment groups) to evaluate relationships between the IBDQ, the Mayo scale (full and partial),the Mayo endoscopy subscore, and the IBD PRTI survey. No imputation of missing data was performed.</p><p>Relationships between the IBDQ and the Mayo scores were examined using a repeated measures longitudinal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Mayo score was used as a continuous predictor in the modeling. By doing so, the linear relationship was effectively imposed between the outcome and predictor. In another series of models, considered as sensitivity analyses, the Mayo score was used as a categorical predictor. This approach did not impose any functional relationship between the predictor and outcome. If a linear or approximately linear relationship was realized between the IBDQ and the Mayo score, the Mayo score as a continuous predictor would be more sensitive and more easily interpretable. The relationship between the IBD PRTI score and the Mayo score at Week 8 was examined using a regression model. In one set of models, the Mayo score was a continuous predictor and in another set, the Mayo score was a categorical predictor.</p><p>Pearson correlations between IBDQ score and Mayo score, and between IBD PRTI and Mayo score, were calculated.

A total of 157 of the 194 patients (80.9%) completed the study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

The results showed that short-term treatment with tofacitinib was associated with statistically significant improvement in HRQoL and patient preferences for the study medication compared with placebo. Improvements in HRQoL were dose-dependent and, at the maximum dose of tofacitinib examined (15 mg BID), the adjusted mean change in IBDQ total score between baseline and Week 8 was statistically significantly greater compared with placebo. These results support the clinical efficacy data reported previously from this Phase II study, whereby patients with moderately-to-severely active UC treated with tofacitinib were more likely to achieve clinical response and remission, and endoscopic response and remission, than those receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our results are consistent with significant improvements in PROs for patients treated with tofacitinib reported from RCTs in other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Relationship between PROs and the Mayo scores</title><p>The observed approximately linear relationship between the PROs of the IBDQ and the IBD PRTI with the Mayo scoring system for assessing clinical response demonstrated the clinical relevance of the IBDQ and the IBD PRTI in patients with moderately-to-severely active UC. Interestingly, we also observed statistically significant moderate to large correlations between the two domains of Mayo score being considered as PROs, namely stool frequency and rectal bleeding, and the IBDQ bowel domain subscore. Relationships between Mayo scores and both PRO measurements were stable, in the right direction (reflecting benefit to the patient), and approximately linear. Disease severity is reportedly the most important factor influencing HRQoL in patients with UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the results we report provide quantitative evidence that reducing the signs and symptoms of UC with tofacitinib treatment improves patients&#x02019; HRQoL. These results also prove the responsiveness of IBDQ score and PRTI items to therapeutic interventions. The relationships also provide an estimate of the magnitude of improvement; for example, a 1-point change on the total Mayo score corresponded, on average, to a change (improvement) of 8.0 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) points in the total IBDQ score. Furthermore, our results also suggest mucosal healing should be a therapeutic objective in patients with UC as patients achieving endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0) had significantly different IBDQ and IBD PRTI component scores compared with patients with persistent endoscopic disease activity.</p><p>Our results further support the use of PROs for assessment of drug efficacy. However, the low specificity of the IBDQ at the individual level to identify patients achieving remission defined by the Mayo score, indicate that PROs could be used as complementary endpoints to endoscopic or composite (clinical and endoscopic) scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>IBD PRTI</title><p>Patient choice of treatment is a central feature of IBD healthcare, and the IBD PRTI survey was specifically designed to determine a patient&#x02019;s treatment preference. We are not aware of any existing IBD instrument/tool that captures the important outcome of patient preference, and as such, the IBD PRTI may have a future role as a useful indicator of patient preference. We believe the trial we report is the first trial in patients with UC to incorporate this particular PRO and it was interesting to observe the approximate linear associations of the IBDQ with the Mayo scoring system were also replicated by the associations of the IBD PRTI survey with the Mayo scoring system. The development of novel PRO tools for investigating UC is warranted because current outcomes capture only a portion of the impact of the disease on patients&#x02019; lives and may not accurately measure a patient&#x02019;s experience with UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The limitations of our analyses are that they were based on a relatively small sample size from a single clinical trial that focused on patients with moderately-to-severely active disease. Also, the duration of the study was short, and the long-term benefit of tofacitinib on PROs remains to be evaluated. Future analyses from larger ongoing Phase III RCTs in UC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01470612, NCT01458574, NCT01465763, and NCT01458951) will be performed to corroborate and expand our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Short-term treatment with tofacitinib was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent improvement in HRQoL and patient preference for the study medication.
