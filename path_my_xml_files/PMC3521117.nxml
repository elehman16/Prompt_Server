The secondary objectives of this study included assessment of the effectiveness of duloxetine and additional measures of safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This phase IV, open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted at multiple clinical practice sites in Korea between August 2009 and April 2011. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and with Good Clinical Practice guidelines in Korea. Institutional ethics approval was obtained before the study commenced. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients (or their representatives) gave voluntary, signed informed consent before any study-related procedures or administration of the study drug.

The study was divided into 4 study periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): study period I, screening; study period II, 1-week initial dosing period; study period III, 7-week therapy period; and study period IV, optional tapering period. At Week 0, patients were randomized, by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive voice response system, to 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The treatment groups were (i) 30 mg QD with food, (ii) 60 mg QD with food, (iii) 30 mg QD without food, and (iv) 60 mg QD without food. Patients in the without food groups were instructed not to take duloxetine within an hour of eating. At Week 1, all patients were switched to duloxetine 60 mg QD. During the 7-week therapy period, duloxetine was taken without regard to food and assessment visits occurred at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. At the discretion of the investigator, patients could receive 30 mg QD duloxetine for 7 to 14 days before discontinuation at the end of the study (Week 10). Primary and secondary outcome measures and additional safety evaluations were assessed during the initial dosing period and the therapy period (from Week 0 to Week 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was item 112 (nausea) of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry adverse event scale (AMDP-5).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> Mean nausea severity was assessed and time to onset and resolution of nausea were calculated. The secondary outcome effectiveness measures were improvement in HAMD<sub>17</sub> total score, subscores and individual items, the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale. Response was defined as a &#x02265;50% reduction in HAMD<sub>17</sub> total score from Week 0 to Week 8. Remission was defined as a HAMD<sub>17</sub> total score of &#x02264;7. Treatment adherence, as defined by the number of capsules taken versus the number of capsules prescribed, was also assessed. Patients were considered to be adherent if, for a particular visit, 80% to 120% of prescribed capsules were taken. Additional safety evaluations included the following: AMDP-5 gastric events score [mean of items 112 and 113 (vomiting)]; AMDP-5 common adverse events score [items 111 (dry mouth)+115 (constipation)+118 (dizziness)+105 (drowsiness)+122 (increased perspiration)+106 (decreased appetite)+mean items 101 to 104 (insomnia)+gastric events score]; individual AMDP-5 items; the frequency and nature of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); vital signs; concomitant medications; and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) score (which was only completed when the investigator suspected that an adverse event represented a suicidal thought or behavior).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective included the graphical (non-model based) assessment of the relative severity of nausea. A sample size of 240 patients, allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the 4 treatment groups, was considered sufficient for graphical assessment and provided adequate power for secondary objectives.</p><p>All analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population (ITT; all randomized patients, regardless of treatment or protocol deviations). A 2-tailed &#x003b1; level of 0.05 was specified. All appropriate baseline data, safety data, and effectiveness data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Unadjusted mean nausea scores and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed for the primary analysis. A supporting factorial analysis using analysis of convariance (ANCOVA) was also performed with fixed effect terms for baseline score, investigator, age, gender, dose group, food group, and dose-by-food group interaction.</p><p>The time-to-onset/resolution of nausea was calculated using a life test model producing Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank tests. Treatment differences for the secondary outcomes were assessed by least squares (LS) mean change from baseline using a mixed-effects model with repeated measures (MMRM). Each MMRM included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment group, site, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and gender, and the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score, baseline score-by-visit interaction, and age. The proportion of patients achieving response or remission, or reporting an adverse event were compared using Fisher's exact test. Baseline body mass index (BMI) scores were split into thirds to form the BMI subgroups. All analyses were conducted using SAS&#x000ae; Version 9.1.3 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Participant flow through the study</title><p>A total of 311 patients were screened for the study. Of these, 249 patients were randomized (ITT population), 235 (94.4%) completed the initial dosing period, and 137 (55.0%) completed the therapy period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). There were 137/249 (55.0%) patients who had at least 1 protocol violation during the study. The reasons for protocol violation included inclusion/exclusion criteria violations (46/249, 18.5%), prohibited concomitant medications (47/249, 18.9%), adherence violations (57/249, 22.9%), and violations that were specific to the study (51/249, 20.5%). The most common reason for discontinuation from the study was adverse events (59/249, 23.7%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal disorders (37/249, 14.9%), specifically nausea (33/249, 13.3%), and nervous system disorders (14/249, 5.6%), including sedation, headache, dizziness, and tremor.</p></sec><sec><title>Demography and baseline clinical characteristics</title><p>Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar among the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Patients were predominantly female (177/249, 71.1%), had a median age of 46.5 years (minimum 20, maximum 79 years), and had their first episode of major depressive disorder about 2 years before enrolling in the study. Patients had a mean HAMD<sub>17</sub> total score of 21.6, a median CGI-Severity score of 4.0, and little nausea [AMDP-5 item 112 (nausea) median score of 0, mean score of 0.2].</p><p>Of note, there were differences between groups (lower incidence in the groups without food, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) for pre-existing metabolism and nutrition disorders, including decreased appetite and hyperlipidemia, but subsequent sensitivity analyses indicated that this variable did not affect the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Nausea incidence and severity</title><p>During the initial dosing period, 59.6% (140/235) of patients experienced nausea of any severity. During this period, nausea was significantly less severe for patients who received 30 mg duloxetine (fixed effect of dose, p=0.003), regardless of food intake (fixed effect of food, p=0.555; food-by-dose interaction, p=0.570) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The mean severity of nausea (AMDP-5 item 112 score) was 0.9 and 0.8 for patients in the 30 mg duloxetine groups and 1.4 and 1.2 for patients in the 60 mg duloxetine groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, top left panel). In addition, a higher proportion of patients experienced none or mild nausea in the 30 mg duloxetine groups (about 80%) than in the 60 mg duloxetine groups (about 55%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom left panel).</p><p>During the therapy period (Week 1 to Week 8), 39.5% (68/172) of patients experienced nausea of any severity. During this period, the mean severity of nausea (AMDP-5 item 112 score) was &#x02264;0.7 for all groups, regardless of the dose or food intake received during the initial dosing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, top right panel). In addition, the proportion of patients who experienced moderate or severe nausea was low (&#x0003c;20%) in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom right panel).</p><p>In all groups, the severity of nausea was highest during the initial dosing period (Week 1) and declined throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). By Week 4, the mean severity of nausea was similar to baseline levels and remained low until the end of the therapy period (Week 8). The median time to onset of nausea was longer for 30 mg duloxetine groups than for 60 mg duloxetine groups (30 mg with food, 7 days; 30 mg without food, 6 days; 60 mg with food, 2 days; 60 mg without food, 1 day). For patients who experienced nausea, the median time to resolution of nausea was 8 days (95% CI, 7 to 10 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of patient age on nausea</title><p>The incidence and severity of nausea did not appear to be influenced by the age of the patients. The mean age of patients who completed the study (n=137) was 47.5 years and the mean age of patients who discontinued the study because of nausea (n=33) was 47.7 years. In addition, patient age did not appear to influence the change in nausea that patients experienced from Week 0 to Week 1 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of patient BMI on nausea</title><p>The incidence and severity of nausea was influenced by the BMI of the patients. Patients in each BMI subgroup had similar rates of severity of nausea during the initial dosing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the rates of discontinuation because of nausea were higher in the lowest (13/78; 17%) and middle BMI subgroup (13/79, 16%) than in the highest BMI subgroup (5/78, 6%). Mean BMI was similar for males (23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and females (23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>AMDP-5 scores</title><p>For the AMDP-5 gastric events and common adverse events scores, 30 mg duloxetine was better tolerated than 60 mg duloxetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

The most common TEAEs reported were from the system organ classes of gastrointestinal disorders (178/249, 71.5%) and nervous system disorders (94/249, 37.8%). The most common TEAEs reported were nausea (145/249, 58.2%), decreased appetite (46/249, 18.5%), dry mouth (41/249, 16.5%), constipation (39/249, 15.7%), and headache (33/249, 13.3%). Most patients (185/249, 74.3%) reported a TEAE during the study that was considered by the investigator to be related to duloxetine.</p><p>There were few differences between groups regarding the nature or frequency of TEAEs. Of note, we observed a difference in the incidence of vomiting between the two 30 mg groups (3.2% with food versus 12.5% without food; p=0.096), however it is uncertain if this was caused by a protective effect of food [the incidence of vomiting in the 60 mg groups was 11.9% (with food) and 14.3% (without food)].</p><p>Few patients (4/249; 1.6%) reported a SAE during the study. Although there were no instances of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or related events from any patients within the study as measured by adverse events and the C-SSRS (data not shown), there was 1 death during the study (in the 30 mg with food group) due to suicide. Other SAEs included diarrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease, muscle injury, road traffic accident, lipoma, and ovarian cyst. All SAEs were considered by the investigator to not be related to duloxetine.</p><p>There were no notable changes in vital signs for any patients during the study (data not shown). Concomitant medications were taken by most patients (187/249, 75.1%) during the study, at similar rates for each group. The most common concomitant medications were alprazolam (40/249, 16.1%; for anxiety), lorazepam (70/249, 28.1%; for anxiety), and zolpidem (58/249, 23.3%; for insomnia). Emetogenic medication (with capacity to induce vomiting) was taken by 77/249 (30.9%) patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This is the first randomized clinical trial located in Korea to investigate the effect of different duloxetine dosing strategies on nausea in patients with major depressive disorder. Gastrointestinal tolerability to duloxetine (based on nausea severity and vomiting incidence) was improved in Korean patients who received a low dose (30 mg QD) compared with a high dose (60 mg QD) during the first week of treatment, regardless of food intake.</p><p>In this study, a lower starting dose of duloxetine decreased the incidence and severity of nausea, which is in agreement with findings from other studies. For example, Mallinckrodt et al. found that the incidence of nausea was lower for patients on a dose of 20 mg twice daily compared with patients on a dose of 60 mg QD (16.4% versus 37.8% respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> In addition, Dunner et al. found that the incidence of nausea during the first week of treatment was significantly lower for patients on a dose of 30 mg QD compared with patients on a dose of 60 mg QD (16.4% vs. 32.9%, respectively; p=0.03).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> However, in contrast to Whitmyer et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> who found that the severity of nausea was lower when duloxetine was taken with food than without food (p=0.01, regardless of dose), the intake of food with duloxetine during the first week of treatment in this study did not influence the incidence or severity of nausea. As the clinical trial described in Whitmyer et al. was conducted with patients in the United States, the majority of whom were white, it is possible that the difference in the effect of food intake may have been influenced by the differences in diet between the United States and Korea, other differences related to ethnicity, or differences in patient characteristics such as BMI.</p><p>The overall incidence of nausea in this study (58.2% by adverse event) was higher than the incidence reported in blinded studies with patients from East Asia (37.1%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> or Caucasian patients (29.7%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>; 14.4% pooled population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This difference in the incidence of nausea may be because of a decrease in tolerability to duloxetine in the patients from Korea enrolled in the current study. However, it is possible that a higher rate of nausea was reported because the study was focused on nausea. This may also explain why discontinuation because of nausea in the current study was higher (13.3%) than expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></p><p>The age of the patients in this study did not influence the incidence of nausea or the proportion of patients who discontinued because of nausea. This finding is supported by a pooled analysis of patients treated with duloxetine that found no difference in the incidence of nausea between patients less than or greater than 65 years of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> However, the current study did find that patients with a higher baseline BMI were less likely to discontinue from the study because of nausea, which has not been reported previously. There is a possibility that the discontinuation rates may reflect patient self-perception of body image and the subsequent reaction to nausea. For example, patients with a high BMI may be more accepting of any potential weight loss associated with nausea and therefore will not discontinue from the treatment. However, these findings are a result of a posthoc subgroup analysis and, therefore, interpretation of the results is limited and should be verified by additional analyses and prospective studies.</p><p>Duloxetine was effective (based on change in HAMD<sub>17</sub> score) at the end of the study (after 8 weeks of treatment), regardless of the dosing strategy patients received during the first week of treatment, which is in agreement with effectiveness findings from other studies using an initial dosing strategy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> In addition, the rates of response and remission that were observed (48.9% and 37.0%, respectively) are somewhat similar to studies conducted in East Asian (60.5% and 49.2%; 60 mg QD for 8 weeks)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> and Caucasian (65% and 43%; 60 mg QD for 9 weeks)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> populations. These findings should reassure clinicians that a low initial dose, which may reduce nausea when patients are most susceptible, does not have a negative effect on the 8-week effectiveness of duloxetine.</p><p>The strength of the study was that it was randomized and conducted in a Korean-only population. Therefore, the findings are relevant to clinical practice in Korea. In addition, conducting the study in a mostly homogeneous population overcomes any differences that may occur in the response to treatment for depression or mental illness because of ethnicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> However, this study is limited mainly by the large number of protocol violations, which resulted from early trial difficulties and issues with trial management. Other limitations that may have biased the outcomes were that the dose and primary endpoint were not blinded, the food intake was not specified to patients, food and medication intake were not recorded by patients, the use of emetogenic medications, and the study was focused on nausea and gastrointestinal effects by using a solicited adverse events scale, which may have sensitized patients and physicians to nausea. The open-label design meant that both patients and investigators were aware of the dose regimen and that nausea was the study's primary endpoint. Expectation bias can occur in an open-label study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> when patients may err in reporting and measuring data towards an expected outcome, in this case nausea.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that Korean patients with major depressive disorder who require duloxetine treatment should be given a dose of 30 mg QD, with or without food, for the first week of treatment, followed by 60 mg QD for the course of therapy. In addition, to prevent discontinuation because of nausea, clinicians are recommended to highlight to Korean patients with a low BMI that nausea is generally mild to moderate and is likely to resolve in just over a week.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company.
