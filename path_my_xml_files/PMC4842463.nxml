conventional treatment on symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with severe morphological
degeneration. [Subjects] Sixty-six patients with severe radiographic knee osteoarthritis
were enrolled. [Methods] Participants were separated into two groups: in one group
patients conducted physical exercise under supervision; while in the other group they were
treated by conventional clinical methods for one year. Participants filled out two types
of questionnaires; the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure and the Pain Disability
Assessment Scale at baseline and one year following enrollment in the study. Two-way
repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine the effects over time and by
group for a total of 43 participants; consisting of an exercise group (n=20) and a
clinical group (n=23) excluding 23 dropouts. [Results] Analysis did not show a significant
time-course effect or interaction between time-course and the groups in both
questionnaires. On the other hand, there were significant group effects in both
questionnaires with an advantage in the exercise group. [Conclusion] These results
indicate that patients with knee osteoarthritis under supervised exercise conditions are
more likely to maintain a better clinical outcome at one-year follow-up, despite the
severe morphological degeneration in their knees.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Physical exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common problem causing knee pain and physical
disabilities in the elderly<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
prevalence of knee OA is known to increase with age not only in Japan but also in various
countries, meaning it is an important social issue around the world<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, Research
on Osteoarthritis Against Disability (ROAD) studies in Japan revealed an association between
knee pain and joint space narrowing in men, while women tended to have knee pain even
without radiographic knee OA. In general, a progression of radiographic change is thought to
be a crucial indicator for assessing the severity of knee OA<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is a
widespread belief of inconsistency between clinical symptoms and radiographic severity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are various factors associated with the symptoms of knee OA. For instance, Sun et al.
reported that the serum IL-15 levels independently and positively correlated with pain
severity but not KL grades in OA patients and, therefore, joint inflammation might play a
key role, reflected by the severity of the symptoms<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The OA Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines for management of knee OA
established by several orthopedic associations in each country<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, recommend physical exercises as a core treatment method. Indeed,
some articles revealed that aerobic exercise and resistance training decreased serum levels
of inflammatory mediators<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Also, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis study recently reported a significant concordance
between knee pain and radiographic knee OA by Kellgren and Lawrence grades<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although this study implies a decreased
efficacy of physical exercises for progressive knee OA, there is little evidence indicating
the effectiveness of physical exercise in cases of severe radiographic knee OA.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we tried to investigate the efficacy of supervised physical
exercise for the symptoms in patients with knee OA by separating them into two groups: one
group consisting of patients conducting supervised physical exercise; and the other treated
by conventional clinical methods. For our results, we used both the Japanese Knee
Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and the
Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The JKOM has been established to assess the activity of daily life
as well as pain and stiffness deriving from patients with knee OA in Japan. Furthermore, we
also evaluated the pain related disabilities in patients with severe knee OA using the PDAS
because previous reports indicated that knee pain was subject to vary within months and
weeks irrespective of radiographic severity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This prospective study was conducted longitudinally for one year to confirm the mid-term
efficacy of each treatment method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Aichi Medical
University (No.12-101).</p><p>Patients with knee pain, confirmed with radiographic knee OA with a face of grade 3 or
above according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading system were eligible for this study.
Eligibility criteria included patients older than 50&#x02005;years and without total knee
arthroplasty in either knee. We recruited participants who were interested in this study,
which investigated knee-related health conditions using a specific questionnaire. We
enrolled sixty-six subjects into this study. We divided subjects into one of two different
groups based on their knee care. We defined subjects in one group (n=26) as doing exercise
for at least one year or more at a physical fitness center in Aichi Medical University
regardless of whether they were receiving other forms of treatment or not (exercise group).
We defined subjects in the other group (n=40) as treated at an orthopedic clinic in Aichi
Medical University without using any physical fitness center (clinical group). Accordingly,
what treatment subjects received was already decided, and, therefore, it was hard to change
the arm. As a result, this study was a non-randomized clinical trial.</p><p>Before investigating their status, each subject was fully informed by an investigator: 1)
on the content of this study and 2) that all personal information of the subject would be
kept confidential.</p><p>After investigating their demographic backgrounds (age, gender), subjects received a
radiographic examination of both knees by the posterior-anterior view at standing position
to confirm radiographic severity. These radiographs were assessed by at least two orthopedic
physicians according to the K-L grading system that uses the following grades: 0, normal; 1,
possible osteophytes only; 2, definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing; 3,
moderate osteophytes and/or definite joint space narrowing; and 4, large osteophytes, severe
joint space narrowing, and/or bony sclerosis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Substantially, each radiographic score was decided according to the
higher K-L grade of either side.</p><p>Participants also filled out two types of questionnaires, the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis
Measure (JKOM)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and the Pain Disability
Assessment Scale (PDAS) to assess their knee pain and pain-related disabilities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.The JKOM consists of a pain rating based
on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and scores for a subscale of four symptoms based on a
disease-specific questionnaire addressing four dimensions: &#x02018;pain/stiffness&#x02019;, &#x02018;condition in
daily life&#x02019;, &#x02018;general conditions&#x02019; and &#x02018;health conditions&#x02019;, with 8, 10, 5 and 2 questions,
respectively<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Questions are rated on
an ordinal scale of 0&#x02013;4, with higher scores indicating a symptom or medical condition of
higher severity. The four symptom subscales can be scored separately or combined to
represent the aggregated total symptoms. On the other hand, the PDAS is a scale for
measuring lifestyle disabilities of patients with chronic pain. Higher scores (on a scale of
0 to 60 points) indicate greater degrees of lifestyle disability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After one-year follow-up, three patients in the exercise group and 17 patients in the
clinical group were excluded as they had dropped out of the study. Reasons for dropout were
different for each participant and included receiving total knee arthroplasty (one subject),
seeking other treatments, and unknown reasons. Accordingly, we collected data for this
research study from 43 patients in total, of which 20 patients were from the exercise group
and 23 patients were from the clinical group</p><p>Voluntary-based supervised exercise consisted of a complex program such as land-based
aerobic activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> (e.g. cycling),
stretching<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, muscle strengthening
(e.g. quadriceps and hamstrings strengthening)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and aqua-based exercise (e.g. water walking)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> in our fitness center. We adjusted these exercise programs
for each individual under the supervision of a physical therapist. For instance, subjects
were instructed on knee stretching based on our stretching technique that could stretch the
target muscle without decreasing muscle strength<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects used muscle strengthening exercises with some machines
for both quadriceps and hamstrings, however when the subject complained of knee pain during
the exercise, the magnitude of leg load was regulated according to the severity of the
symptoms to prevent an aggravation of symptoms or subjects were instructed to only isometric
quadriceps contraction<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, when
the subject had knee swelling, only water walking was advised as aerobic exercise by a
therapist without cycling or treadmill walking. An exercise session was approximately 90 to
120 minutes divided by several breaks for each subject adjusted by endurance. Although the
frequency of exercise was different for each subject according to their convenience,
everyone exercised one to three times in a week but at least once a week in our fitness
center. Seven participants in the exercise group regularly received intra-articular
hyaluronic acid injections in other clinics once a month.</p><p>By contrast, conventional treatment in the clinic included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. Patient consultations were
usually conducted once or twice a month for each subject.</p><p>At baseline, we compared demographic and morphological parameters among the groups, for age
using the Mann-Whitney U test and for gender and K-L grades using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.
Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the effects
over time and by group on the JKOM score and PDAS score with a Scheff&#x000e9; post-hoc comparison.
Subsequently, four symptom subscales of JKOM were evaluated to examine separate effects of
each treatment using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We preformed all analyses with SPSS
software (version 20.0&#x02005;J; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We considered p&#x0003c; 0.05 as
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference in the epidemiological background (age p=0.57, gender

supervised exercise have the potential to maintain better clinical outcomes at one-year
follow-up, despite severe morphological degeneration in their knees. Physical exercise is
recommended<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> as a core treatment for
knee OA. However, evidence on the efficacy of physical exercise for severe knee OA is
limited to short-term studies as previous studies were short-term; usually conducted as a
patient waited for total knee joint replacement<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The consensus on the non-surgical management of knee OA includes stepwise treatment options
such as voluntary-based physical exercise, education for weight control, physiotherapy,
analgesic drugs such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and intra-articular injection of steroids
and hyaluronic acids<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In cases where
this fails, total joint replacement with follow-up rehabilitation should be conducted. On
the other hand, the present study showed that there was a significant difference between the
exercise group and the clinical group regarding the clinical outcomes at one-year follow-up
with an advantage in the exercise group. This result indicates that treatment methods for
severe knee OA may be an important factor preventing knee arthroplasty in the future,
although several studies have indicated that the proportion of knees with a KL grade of 3 or
4 exceeded 95% in patients scheduled for knee joint replacement<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our study also documented that supervised physical exercise particularly improved general
conditions and health conditions but not the pain/stiffness condition in the JKOM score. We
believe that the former finding offers useful insight into patients with severe radiographic
knee OA to prolong the life of native knees regardless of pain and functional decline,
although these effects might derive from not only an exercise but also a self-care
motivation. However, the latter result and decline in the pain-subscale in the clinical
group may be associated with previous descriptions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, although our exercise
program included land-based aerobic activities, muscle strength, and aqua-based exercises,
based on much evidence in the literature<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,
we found that it had limited efficacy on pain in knees suffering from severe degeneration.
This may indicate that chronic morphological degeneration may have the effect of decreasing
the regenerative capacity in local tissues<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We have to consider several limitations of this study. First, the present study was a
non-randomized trial. In particular, the motivational component for one&#x02019;s health such as the
ability of self-efficacy was not excluded, although self-efficacy is an important factor for
keeping in sound condition even if people have chronic pain. In our study, the participants
in the exercise group were probably highly motivated to take care of themselves. In
contrast, although the subjects in the clinical group were instructed to follow voluntary
home exercises in accordance with their physician&#x02019;s guidelines, we speculate that most did
not carry them out with a passive treatable attitude. We could not determine the causes of
participant dropout, but we speculate that a difference in the dropout rate between the
exercise group (13%) and the clinical group (46%) derived from the difference in their
self-care motivation. Certainly, there was a significant difference in PDAS scores among the
groups at the beginning of this study. Hence, we think that the motivational component has
influenced the results of this study. Secondly, we saw many patients in the clinical group
drop out of the study. As several studies have reported elsewhere, evidence on the
effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-surgical approaches for severe knee OA are
limited to the short-term. In contrast, longitudinal studies are scarce. We think this is
because knee arthroplasty can lead to an early solution to knee problems<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore long-term studies in severe knee
OA are difficult. Excluding cases in which the patient wants to keep their native knees and
self-care motivation bias will exist as long as we examine the long-term effects of physical
exercise for severe knee OA. Moreover, most of the patients with severe knee OA are elderly
people, and they usually have many disorders, not only in the knee. Hence, general problems
among elderly patients might be the reason they drop out of longitudinal studies. Thirdly,
although there was no statistical difference between the exercise group and the clinical
group regarding their radiological severities, the rate of mild degeneration (grade
3&#x0003e;grade 4) was higher in the exercise group than in the clinical group. Comparative
analysis between the groups at baseline showed that this might affect the main results of
this study. Therefore, we believe further studies need to be conducted to confirm the effect
