[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The prevalence of HF is projected to increase by 25% by 2030 compared to 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and approximately 10% of an unselected group of HF patients could be eligible for biventricular pacing (BiV), [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] thus indicating a likely future increase in CRT utilization.</p><p>Although the majority of correctly selected patients respond favorably to CRT, 25&#x02013;30% show little or no improvement after device implantation. To increase response rates, resources have focused on programming optimization, particularly atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) timing intervals. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, few studies have examined the optimal basal atrial pacing rate and its impact on long-term outcome in CRT patients. Increasing pacing rates in BiV mode have demonstrated positive acute hemodynamic effects (e.g., decreased filling pressure and increased cardiac output). [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, an increased atrial basal pacing rate and HR (heart rate) could prove to be favorable in HF patients with chronotropic incompetence (attenuated HR response to exercise),[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which is associated with increased cardiac and all-cause mortality. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In contrast, beta-blocking therapy appears to be associated with better outcomes in terms of death and transplantation in CRT patients,[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which aligns with the beneficial effect of a lower HR in HF patients without CRT. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Moreover, the &#x0201c;Dual Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator Trial&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] tested whether the dual-chamber pacing (DDDR-70) mode could improve hemodynamics and reduce major cardiac adverse events (MACE) compared to ventricular back-up pacing (VVI-40). Surprisingly, the trial showed an increase in the composite endpoint in the pacing group; however, the results were not directly comparable with the CRT population due to the lack of left ventricular pacing. Therefore, the optimal basal atrial pacing rate in CRT patients remains poorly defined.</p><p>The aim of this randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot trial was to investigate the impact of 60-bpm (DDD-60) to 80-bpm (DDD-80) basal atrial pacing rates on autonomic nerve function in CRT patients, as assessed by (i) microneurography and NT-proBNP, (ii) cardiopulmonary exercise tests and (iii) self-perceived quality of life (QoL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study population</title><p>Fifteen patients were included in the study from the 18<sup>th</sup> of August 2011&#x02014;5<sup>th</sup> of January 2013; 3 patients withdrew (1 due to throat cancer, 2 due to long commuting distances), leaving 12 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had had a CRT device implanted (the initial indications were in accordance with European guidelines) [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] at least 6 months prior to study inclusion. The steering committee decided to restrict inclusion to non-ischemic CRT patients to assess any potential risk before decision on inclusion of ischemic CRT patients. The patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II (n = 7) or III (n = 5), with mean a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 38%&#x000b1;10. The patients were required to be in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable as well as to demonstrate biventricular pacing &#x0003e; 90% of the time and to be undergoing optimal medical treatment for HF, with no changes in medications during the past 3 months. All patients were considered to be CRT responders based on either NYHA or LVEF improvements. Patients were excluded if they were NYHA I, unable to perform the exercise test (e.g., diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe arthritis), diagnosed with cancer, had plasma creatinine levels &#x0003e; 200 micromoles per liter, or were admitted for decompensated HF or acute coronary syndrome in the preceding 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics</title><p>All participating patients provided informed written consent before study participation.

In addition, the patients completed two separate self-perceived QoL questionnaires and performed cardiopulmonary bicycle tests; sympathetic nerve activity was assessed using microneurography (MSNA), and the CRT device was interrogated and finally reprogrammed to the opposite pacing rate or to baseline settings at the final visit. MSNA and bicycle tests were performed on two separate days at each phase to avoid exercise-induced elevated sympathetic activity. The CRT settings were blinded to the attending physician, and the patients were unaware of the study assignment sequence.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>QoL questionnaire</title><p>HF patients are compromised by an array of symptoms, including dyspnea, limited physical activity, and fatigue. Furthermore, increased medication intake and the possible side effects of those medications, as well as the progressive loss of self-reliance and recurrent hospitalization, all affect and impact QoL. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We administered two distinct questionnaires (the Minnesota Living with HF [LIfHE] questionnaire and Medical Outcome Survey Short Form SF-36]) [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to fully comprehend changes in the signs and symptoms of HF, physical and sexual activity, and psychological and socioeconomic conditions. LIfHE is a well-validated and popular tool used to assess QoL in HF patients; it contains 21 questions designed to measure the above-mentioned factors. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] SF-36 is comprised of 36 items, which are subdivided into 8 health dimensions (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health). The scores are transformed into a 0&#x02013;100 scale, with each question equally weighted. High scores indicate less restraint, and lower scores indicate more restraint.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Device settings and programming</title><p>In this study, the time between implantation of the CRT device and randomization averaged 20.8 &#x000b1; 10.7 months. Eleven patients had St. Jude devices, and one patient had a Medtronic device. The majority of patients were in DDD (n = 10) and DDD-R (n = 2) mode. Two highly experienced technicians managed the device settings and ensured optimal programming, but they were not otherwise involved in this study. The device was randomly programmed to a basal pacing rate of 60 bmp in the first phase and 80 bmp in the second phase or vice versa. Atrioventricular and interventricular delays were programmed according to the local electrophysiologist&#x02019;s discretion, and these settings were not changed during the study.</p><p>Device transcripts were obtained at each phase to register the levels of atrial and ventricular sensing, pacing, BiV pacing (%), and HR histograms.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>A symptom-limiting bicycle (Ergoline, Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Germany) exercise test was performed to measure maximum work capacity and oxygen consumption at each phase. The HR and 12-lead electrocardiogram were recorded continuously, and blood pressure was recorded every 2 minutes. The initial workload was set to 25 Watts (W) and increased by 25 W every 2 minutes until exhaustion, at a rate of 60&#x02013;70 revolutions per minute. During the test, the patients inspired room air through a low-resistance mouthpiece, with the nostrils tightly blocked. The expired oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures were measured (using the breath-by-breath method) with a gas analyzer (Innocor, Innovision Aps, Glamsbjerg, Denmark). Calibration procedures were performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s specification immediately before the tests, and the following parameters were measured: peak oxygen consumption (pVO<sub>2</sub>), which was defined as the highest VO<sub>2</sub> (averaged over a 20-30-second period) achieved at maximal effort; respiratory exchange ratio (peak VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> = RER); peak minute ventilation&#x02014;carbon dioxide relationship (pVE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope), which was derived using least-squares linear regression (y = mx + b; m = slope) after entering the data into a spreadsheet (Excel; Microsoft); [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and maximal workload (Watt<sub>max</sub>), which was defined as the highest workload maintained for a minimum of 45 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity measured with microneurography</title><p>Resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) recordings were obtained for all patients at both pacing rates; all patients were studied using the same set-up and were placed in the semi-recumbent position after they had rested for a minimum of 30 minutes. Tungsten microelectrodes (Iowa Bioengineering) were inserted into the common peroneal nerve just below the knee (typically the left peroneal nerve). The correct position of the microelectrode tip is within close proximity to the post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve fiber bundles that innervate the vascular smooth muscle of the peroneal muscle or anterior tibial muscle vascular beds. These bundles are typically located close to the motor neurons innervating the same muscle group and close to the afferent nerves from these muscle groups. Intraneural stimulation was used to locate the microelectrode position by searching for muscle twitching and by testing muscle activation by tapping the muscle belly to engage the muscle stretch receptors. The firing of the sympathetic fibers was then recorded in the resting leg by pre-amplifying the signals (x1000) and by filtering (bandwidth 700&#x02013;2000 Hz, half cut-off filters), rectifying and integrating the signals with a time-constant of 0.1 second and then further amplifying the signals (x95.5) (Iowa Bioengineering). The resulting integrated neurograms were then studied, and only the recordings with bursts that reached a signal:noise ratio of at least 3:1 were accepted for analysis. A minimum of 10 minutes was allowed for the recording and for the patient to settle after manipulating the needle; the subsequent 10 minutes of MSNA were used for the analysis. All data were analog-digital converted and saved for later analysis (ADInstruments, LabChart 7.0). The analysis was performed using macro-programming in LabChart in a manner in which all cardiac cycles were tested for significant sympathetic activity, and sympathetic bursts were counted if the amplitude and area under the curve (method: Integral relative to Baseline) [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reached certain predetermined levels that were normalized to the noise level. The validity of these semi-automated analyses were tested by an experienced microneurographer (MS) who was blinded to the macro-result and who compared the results to manual scoring; on average, differences of less than 10% were found for the 6 conditions (3 patients) tested.</p><p>MSNA bursts are strictly synchronized to the cardiac cycle by the arterial baroreflex. Thus, arterial baroreceptors are unloaded to the extent to which they allow sympathetic outflow from the brainstem only during diastole. For every heart beat (and every diastole), only one integrated sympathetic burst can occur, but MSNA bursts do not occur with all heart beats (the cycles in which the diastolic pressure is too high to unload the baroreceptors are not followed by a sympathetic burst). In the present study, we manipulated the HR and therefore also manipulated the maximum possible MSNA burst frequency. For this reason, the MSNA burst frequency (bursts/minute) and the MSNA burst incidence were analyzed after being normalized to the HR (bursts/100 RR).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Standard echocardiography was performed according to the European Association of Echocardiography guidelines.

We found no beneficial or detrimental effects of 80 bpm in terms of the NT-proBNP levels, peak oxygen uptake, or exercise duration compared to 60 bpm. However, we found a significant drop in sympathetic activity, as measured by bursts/100 RR, in the 80-bpm study period, which represented a large decrease in the levels of sympathetic activity, as measured by the effect size. Yet, we failed to demonstrate any significant decrease in bursts/min. Interestingly, the patients reported higher scores (indicating less limitation) in the QoL surveys in some health dimensions during the 60-bpm study period. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a series of direct measurements of the sympathetic nervous system in CRT patients, with varying atrial pacing rates in an intermediate 3-month time period.</p><p>St&#x000e5;hlberg et al. observed that short-term increased atrial pacing (80 bpm vs. 60 bpm), significantly decreases the average estimated pulmonary artery diastolic, right ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, and increases cardiac output. However, the same parameters appeared to increase during the 2-week, 80-bpm period, raising concerns for the long-term effects of HR elevation. Furthermore, in accord with our study, no significant changes were observed in the BNP levels or in the 6-minute walk test results between the 80-bpm and 60-bpm study periods. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The absence of clinical effects may be attributed to subtle changes that occur but cannot be detected by usual clinical tests. In a newly published paper, by the same author group, on the acute effects of increasing CRT pacing rates on hemodynamic control and MSNA a very similar combination of changes were reported. During 10 minutes of increased pacing rates (from 50 to 90-bpm) a decreased MSNA burst incidence of 44% was reported (about 35% decrease with the step from 70 to 90-bpm). [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Recently, in an elegantly designed trial (PEGASUS) [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], 1,309 heart failure patients with newly implanted CRT devices were randomized to a DDD-40, DDDR-40 or DDD-70 group and followed for 10.5 months. No significant differences were observed in the composite clinical endpoint of all-cause mortality, HF events, NYHA functional class, or patient global self-assessments between the different basal pacing rates. A direct comparison between our study and PEGASUS is difficult because of dissimilar endpoints, and data regarding BNP and working capacity (pVO<sub>2</sub>) is yet to be published from PEGASUS. However, in contrast to our study, the mean HR difference in the PEGASUS trial was only 2&#x02013;3 bpm. Moreover, the percent atrial pacing was only 43% during DDD-70, while it was greater than 82% during our 80-bpm study period. It could be speculated that a greater difference in HR and atrial pacing, and perhaps a longer follow-up period, are needed to generate a difference in clinical outcome.</p><p>It has been well established that elevated sympathetic activity is typical [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and is well correlated to symptoms, progression and poor prognosis for heart failure,[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and elevated values have been associated with heart failure mortality by Barretto et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Previously, Kuniyoshi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Hamdan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] have demonstrated, using MSNA, that sympathetic activity decreases after CRT device implantation. With the lower sympathetic tone at 80 bpm, our data suggest that a further increase in the basal atrial pacing rate could prove to be beneficial for heart failure patients undergoing CRT therapy.</p><p>The exact mechanisms behind the lower sympathetic tone during a higher atrial basal pacing rate are not known. Nonetheless, results from previous short-term biventricular pacing studies [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] indicate that an arterial baroreceptor-reflex-mediated sympathoinhibition is associated with higher pacing rates. This finding is partly derived from the decreased pulmonary arterial resistance and total peripheral resistance, thus facilitating an afterload reduction. We did not encounter any changes in blood pressure, which could indicate that any changes were subtle and not measurable by our equipment and could indicate a high risk of statistical type II error due to the small number of patients. Other studies have confirmed that reducing cardiac filling pressure lowers norepinephrine spill over [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in HF patients, which is then mirrored by decreased sympathetic activity, as measured by MSNA. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Thus, the diminished sympathetic activity during the 80-bpm study period could also be the result of lower cardiac filling pressure. A decrease in cardiac filling pressures would be expected to result in lower NT-proBNP values, which was not observed in the current study, thereby questioning lower filling pressures as an explanation for the decrease in MSNA.</p><p>DeMazumder et al. recently demonstrated that cholinergic signaling is highly up-regulated in the failing LV, and moreover, differential remodeling of cholinergic signaling is important for the return of sympathovagal stability by CRT. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Whether this novel mechanism can influence muscle sympathetic activity is unknown, but nonetheless suggests that future studies evaluating CRT treatment should implement parasympathetic measurements.</p><p>We emphasize that we did not achieve significant difference between the two study periods in burst frequency (MSNA per minute). However, this was anticipated due to manipulation of HR and the fact that MSNA is strictly linked to the cardiac cycle by the arterial baroreflex. The incidence of MSNA bursts is strongly related to the afferent input from the baroreceptors. Thus, sympathetic outflow from the brainstem only occurs in conjunction with diastole and only with those diastoles, which do not activate baroreceptors. This has led to the prevailing view that MSNA burst incidence is an indication of the level of central sympathetic outflow. Burst frequency is usually considered to illustrate the degree of activity reaching the effector organs, whereas Burst incidence reflects central control in the sense that it illustrates the relative amount of cardiac cycles filled with MSNA bursts [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p><p>Another major concern is falling stroke volumes (SV) with elevated pacing rates. However, the hemodynamic changes suggest that cardiac output is maintained and, in some instances, increased (likely due to increased contractility and decreased filling pressures). These mechanisms seem to be in place up to at least 100&#x02013;120 bpm, whereas there is a shift toward sympathoexcitation at higher pacing rates. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>BNP is a valuable parameter for monitoring the effects of CRT in HF patients,[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and prior studies have shown the importance of post-CRT BNP levels in predicting HF events and death. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] Furthermore, Brenyo et al. established that the pattern of BNP change from baseline to 1 year is an independent predictor of subsequent clinical response. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] We did not encounter a significant increase in BNP levels during the two study periods, which indicates that a basal rate of 80 bpm is not harmful. However, the long-term effects of a higher basal rate beyond three months are unknown.</p><p>It was anticipated that many of our patients would not achieve a RER&#x0003e;1.1 (an indicator of an adequately performed test), because evidence suggests that nearly 50% of HF patients are unable to reach this target. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Recent data suggest that results below the target RER do not invalidate the key parameters of pVO<sub>2</sub> and the pVE/CO<sub>2</sub> slope; in contrast, these measurements remain as strong prognostic variables, irrespective of RER. Furthermore, the pVE/CO<sub>2</sub> slope is considered to be an effort-independent variable and seems to be superior to pVO<sub>2</sub> as a prognostic variable. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We observed an increase in pVO<sub>2</sub> and a decrease in the pVE/CO<sub>2</sub> slope from 60 bpm to 80 bpm; however, these observations were marginal and not significant. The measured range of pVO<sub>2</sub> in our study is comparable to those of previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] performed in similar patient populations. Furthermore, the baseline values of pVO<sub>2</sub> and of the pVE/CO<sub>2</sub> slope indicate improved exercise tolerance in our study; thus, it is not surprising that exercise capacity did not improve. Likewise, larger trials [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138124.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] conducted in CRT patients with NYHA II, with integrated power to detect changes in exercise capacity (pVO<sub>2</sub>, workload, etc.), have also been unable to demonstrate a significant improvement in these parameters despite clear improvements in cardiac structure and function. Additionally, a follow-up period of 3 months may not be sufficient to detect exercise improvement. However, the lack of statistical power cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the absence of a significant increase in pVO<sub>2</sub> or decrease in the pVE/CO<sub>2</sub> slope.</p><p>The LIfHE questionnaire did not reveal any differences between the 60- and 80-bpm study periods, thus indicating no adverse or beneficial effect of increased atrial pacing on QoL. As stated earlier, SF-36 is comprised of 36 items, which are subdivided into 8 health dimensions. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The study population reported higher (better) scores in only two of the 8 health dimensions during the 60-bmp compared to the 80-bmp study period: &#x0201c;bodily pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;component score of mental health&#x0201d;. This result is surprising because no verbal notification of increased bodily pain or lower mental health were conveyed during or after the 80-bpm period examinations. Moreover, no patient reported any discomfort that resulted in premature discontinuation during the 80-bpm period, and the calculated effect sizes revealed only a medium-level change in these parameters. One possible explanation for less &#x0201c;bodily pain&#x0201d; at 60 bpm could be a lower sensation of palpitation and a frequency closer to the physiological level. In addition, constantly increased HRs might manifest as enhanced bodily excitement/tension/stress and irritation, which might result in lower &#x0201c;mental health&#x0201d; comfort. A recent meta-analysis revealed that patients with NYHA I-II did not enjoy the same improvements in QoL as patients with NYHA III-IV when comparing CRT only with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The majority of our patients were in NYHA class II, and perhaps they already had relatively high baseline scores that were offset by manipulating their pacemaker settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations</title><p>This pilot study has several limitations. First, we only obtained a modest increase in the mean HR (i.e., 9 bpm) during the &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; pacing period. This result was a consequence of a relatively high intrinsic HR, which increased the mean HR during DDD-60 pacing. One may think that more separation in the HR measurements would have resulted in a more pronounced difference between the two intervals.</p><p>Second, our data are based on constant AV delays and might not apply to different AV delays. However, Scharf et al. demonstrated that longer AV delays, unlike traditional pacemakers, were required to obtain optimal cardiac output with increasing HR when using CRT devices. Thus, we may have observed greater decreased sympathetic activity with dynamic or prolonged AV delays. However, a prolonged AV-delay carries the risk of loss of BiV pacing due to intrinsic conduction. Third, this study lacked norepinephrine measurements; however, a strong correlation with MSNA exists. [<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] MSNA provides a more direct and accurate measurement of central sympathetic activity compared to catecholamine dosage or HR variability (not possible to perform due to dependence on intrinsic and normal sinus rhythm). In addition, the small number of participants in this study prevents firm conclusions, particularly when no differences were observed; however, the prospective randomized crossover design and 3-month follow-up provides greater validity and power to this study. Despite the intention to blind patients to their pacing rates, the possibility of detecting the actual pacing rate by sensation or home monitoring cannot be excluded. Moreover, our results apply only to the rates of 60 bpm and 80 bpm and cannot simply be extracted to higher basal atrial pacing rates. Furthermore, no NYHA IV patients were included in this study. Therefore, the results may not be applicable to populations with more severe disease. Yet, with the expansion of CRT to patients with mild HF,[<xref rid="pone.0138124.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] this study is still relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A modest increase in the atrial pacing rate for 3 months in non-ischemic CRT patients appears to decrease sympathetic tone (burst incidence only), as directly measured by MSNA.
