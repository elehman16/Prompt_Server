Due to short duration of local anesthetic, opioids have been added, so that even small doses can provide profound analgesia of good duration with few side effects. Both butorphanol, a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid and tramadol hydrochloride a moderately potent opioid agonist have been used for this purpose separately in few studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> We carried a study to compare the effectiveness of butorphanol and tramadol as postoperative analgesics when given epidurally.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted on 60 patients of age 18-60 years of ASA grade I and II undergoing lower limb surgeries after attaining approval from hospital ethics committee. Patients with neurological disorders, bleeding tendency, sepsis, spinal deformity, suffering from asthma, cardiac, respiratory, renal, hepatic and CNS diseases and hypersensitivity to local anesthetics or study drugs were excluded from the study.</p><p>After taking informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to one of the two groups of 30 patients each. The study was done in double blind manner by making 60 coded slips. The person performing the procedure and carrying out the observation was blinded to drug solution injected. The drug solution was prepared in two separate syringes of 10 ml and 20 ml. Detailed preanaesthetic checkup was done a day prior to surgery and patient kept fasting for 6-8 hours. Patients were explained about linear visual analogue score (VAS) using a 11 centimeter line, where 0 denoted &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; while 10 &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;. On day of surgery tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg orally was given 2 hours prior to surgery and patients were reassessed in the preanaesthetic room.</p><p>In operation theatre intravenous line with ringer's s lactate was started and all the patients were preloaded at rate of 10 ml per kg over 15-20 minutes. Readings of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were taken as baseline.</p><p>After positioning the patients and taking all aseptic precautions epidural needle was introduced and space identified using loss of resistance to air technique. Epidural catheter was inserted. All patients were given spinal anaesthesia for the surgical procedure one space lower than the insertion site of epidural catheter using 25G spinal needle and 2.5-3ml of heavy bupivacaine 0.5% was given. Sensory and motor effect was checked.</p><p>At the end of surgical procedure sensory level and motor effects were determined. When VAS for pain reached 4, then bolus from 10 ml syringe was given to all the patients depending upon groups. Patients in Group I (n=30) received 2 mg of inj. butorphanol dissolved in 9 ml of normal saline (total volume 10 ml) epidurally. For top up 2 mg inj. butorphanol was dissolved in 19 ml of normal saline (total volume 20 ml) and 10 ml of this solution was given for each top up. Patients of Group II (n=30) were given 100 mg of inj. tramadol dissolved in 8 ml of normal saline (total volume 10 ml) epidurally. For top up 100 mg of inj. tramadol was dissolved in 18 ml of normal saline (total volume 20ml) and 10 ml of this solution was given as top up.</p><p>For the rest of postoperative period, patients were given top up doses from 20 ml syringe on having pain of VAS&#x0003e;4. In case more doses were required the supervisor provided additional doses filled in 20 ml syringe according to the group.</p><p>Patients were assessed at half-hourly intervals for first two hours then at 4, 8, 12, 24 hours after giving first dose of epidural opioid for the following variables <bold>A</bold>. Visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-no pain, 1-3-mild pain, 4-7-moderate pain, 8-10-severe pain. <bold>B</bold>. Sedation score'0 = Fully awake, 1 = Slightly drowsy, 2 = Asleep but easily arousable, 3 = Fully asleep but arousable, 4 = Fully asleep and not arousable. <bold>C</bold>. HR and BP. <bold>D</bold>. Monitoring of respiratory rate (RR) and SpO2. <bold>E</bold>. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, retention of urine, pruritis and respiratory depression.</p><p>Timing of incremental doses, interval between injections and total dose given in 24 hours were recorded. If analgesia was found inadequate even after two consecutive epidural doses given 20-30 minutes apart, patients were given diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscularly as rescue analgesia.</p><p>At the end of the study decoding of groups was done and all values expressed as mean+standard deviation (SD) range ; a p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results were analyzed using SPSS11.5 software. The student's t-test was used for testing the significance of hemodynamic variables, post operative pain score and duration of analgesia between the groups. The chi-square test was used to test the demographic variables, number of epidural dosages required over 24 hrs and the post operative side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The two groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, sensory level achieved during spinal anaesthesia and du-ration of surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Combined spinal epidural anaesthesia finds a common place for perioperative management of orthopaedic surgery. It combines the advantages of both spinal and epidural technique by initially providing an intense sensory and motor block of rapid onset. After the surgical procedure and regression of spinal analgesia, the epidural catheter can be used to provide post operative pain relief.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>Opioids acting on spinal cord receptors provide distinct advantage over its systemic administration for better quality of analgesia, lower sedation scores, preservation of physiological function and improved outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Our study shows that tramadol had a longer duration of analgesia when compared to butorphanol for postoperative epidural analgesia. Abboud TK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> and Dhimar A et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> found an analgesia lasting 5.53+0.86 hours and 8 hours respectively with epidural butorphanol. Sayyid S et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and Rathie P et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> in their study on epidural tramadol (100 mg) for postoperative pain relief found the duration of analgesia to be 4.5&#x000b1;3.1 hours and 10.26+2.73 hours respectively. These results were different from our study may be because of the difference in the type of surgery or may be due to addition of local anaesthetic agents to the study drug.</p><p>The significant decrease observed in mean pulse rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the baseline readings seen in both the groups which could be due to increased initial values because of pain (VAS -4) and reduced significantly after effective analgesic action of the drugs.</p><p>Comparison of VAS scores at various time interval in both the groups showed that butorphanol was able to relieve pain in much better way than tramadol upto 8 hours after which pain releif was similar. Palacios Q et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> found decreased VAS with epidural butorphanol similar to ours, whereas Rawal H et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> had decreased VAS scores with epidural tramadol 100 mg compared to our study.</p><p>Main side effects seen during the study were nausea, vomiting with tramadol and mild sedation in butorphanol group which was considered desirable rather than a side effect in our patients.</p><p>Thus we conclude that both butorphanol and tramadol were effective for postoperative analgesia when used epidurally in patients undergoing lower limb surgery. Butorphanol although has shorter duration of analgesia but better pain relief compared to tramadol. It also caused less nausea and vomiting and slight sedation which was rather desirable. Whereas with tramadol longer duration of analgesia with no sedation, more nausea and vomiting was observed. Authors suggest that more prospective studies are required to in order to recommend any drug as useful adjunct for enhancing post operative analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
