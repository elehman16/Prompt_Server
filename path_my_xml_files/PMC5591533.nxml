It accounts for 1&#x02013;3% of all general practitioner (GP) consultations and the majority of women (93%) are prescribed antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This strategy is poorly directed at women with proven infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although women with dipstick-negative symptoms show evidence of shortened illness duration following empirical antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Urine is now the most commonly received specimen in microbiological laboratories, but more than 20% of isolates are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% are resistant to amoxicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent studies have documented a worse prognosis and higher treatment costs for women with UTI with antibiotic-resistant organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and antibiotic resistance in urine isolates is linked to prior antibiotic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, limited data from trials suggest that uncomplicated UTIs have a good long-term prognosis, with low risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Urinary symptoms usually settle 3&#x02013;4 days after consultation but a shortened illness is experienced by women prescribed antibiotics in the absence of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So, antibiotics do provide some relief from the distressing symptoms of UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but it is still unclear how best to target them or whether alternative symptomatic treatments might reduce reliance on antibiotics.</p><p id="Par26">The delayed antibiotic prescription strategy results in a substantial reduction in antibiotic prescribing rates in respiratory illness and has gained credence as a rational approach to management endorsed by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In respiratory illness it is considered to be a more effective way to modify consultation behaviour than patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been shown to be acceptable to women with cystitis but with only a modest reduction in antibiotic use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, it is unlikely to be widely adopted without an alternative treatment to relieve the symptoms of infection. Two potential candidates have been identified to provide such relief from symptoms. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a herbal product with traditional use in UTI in women which, if successful, could facilitate the adoption of the delayed strategy and further reduce antibiotic use in UTI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background to alternative treatments</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NSAIDs</title><p id="Par27">In one small study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80) women with clinically suspected urinary infection were randomised to treatment with antibiotics or ibuprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It was reported that ibuprofen provided similar levels of symptom relief to antibiotics (although this did not reach statistical significance in this small study) but, as would be expected, a larger proportion of women in the ibuprofen group required rescue antibiotics (33% versus 18%). A follow-up, fully powered trial has subsequently confirmed a substantial (66%) reduction in antibiotic use (94/241 ibuprofen versus 283/243 antibiotic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], although symptom burden was greater in the ibuprofen group: 70% symptom-free after 1 week with ibuprofen compared to 82% in the antibiotic group. This suggests that NSAIDs could reduce antibiotic use at the expense of poorer symptom relief.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Herbal product</title><p id="Par28">Herbal products for the relief of urinary symptoms are widely available over-the-counter (OTC) with a traditional-use licence, although they have never been subjected to rigorous efficacy studies. The leaf extract of <italic>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</italic> (uva-ursi or bearberry) has been approved for use for urinary tract inflammation by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices and is available on prescription in Germany for this indication. It is reported to have diuretic, urinary antiseptic, astringent and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The extract constituents include flavonoids, iridoids, hydroquinone glycosides (mainly arbutin), tannins and terpenoids. In-vitro studies have demonstrated antibacterial activity against a variety of organisms including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the most prevalent urinary pathogen. The antimicrobial action has been attributed to the hydroquinone derivatives, especially arbutin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Uva-ursi is widely available OTC in the UK and there is preliminary evidence suggesting that it provides symptom relief when used in acute UTI. One study of 309 women found that those recommended to use Uvacin (an OTC preparation including uva-ursi) experienced shorter illness duration, although the numbers who subsequently reported use of the product was low (14% with advice to use versus 1% with no advice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is also some limited evidence that the prophylactic use of UVA-E, containing an aqueous/alcoholic extract of uva-ursi leaves and <italic>Taraxacum offinale</italic> (dandelion) root (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57) is effective for women with recurrent UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Main research question</title><p id="Par30">The main study has two primary aims to assess the impact on UTI symptom severity of:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par31">Uva-ursi compared to placebo, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Advice to take ibuprofen compared to no such advice</p></list-item></list>

In-depth semistructured telephone interviews will be conducted amongst 20&#x02013;30 women who have taken part in the trial or who were approached but not randomised, and amongst 10&#x02013;15 GPs from the same GP practices. Participants will be given an invitation letter, a PIS and a Consent Form to be signed and returned to the researcher, who will contact them about a month, but no more than 3 months, after taking part (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> for the PIS and IC Forms).

Participants are all provided with a prescription for rescue medication and are able to self-determine when to collect the prescription depending on symptom burden and whether to continue or stop the study medication(s).</p><p id="Par69">Most adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions that occur in this trial, whether serious or not, are anticipated to be expected treatment-related toxicities due to the trial medication. The assignment of the causality will be made by the primary care physician responsible for the participant. A pre-existing condition will not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens by at least one Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade during the trial.</p><p id="Par70">A major concern over the withholding of antibiotics is the potential for progressive infection and upper UTI. There are, however, limited data regarding the absolute risk of upper tract infection following lower tract infection in women. In a meta-analysis of placebo versus antibiotic trials, antibiotics were more effective than placebo but associated with more adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the two trials that reported the incidence of pyelonephritis, the range in those treated with antibiotics was 0&#x02013;0.15% and in those treated with placebo 0.4&#x02013;2.6% (not significant). In the recent trial of ibuprofen versus antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] the number of episodes of pyelonephritis was five in the placebo arm compared to one in the antibiotic arm although none required hospital admission. A similar trend was noted for worsening symptoms and febrile UTIs. Episodes of suspected upper UTI will be reported and all AEs will be recorded from the time that the patients signs the Consent Form until 4 weeks after randomisation.</p><p id="Par71">Notification of adverse events will be through one of three mechanisms: (1) all participants will carry a trial card with relevant telephone numbers to call should an AE occur, (2) GP practices will notify the study team of any AE reported to the practice and (3) AE information will be collected at notes review after 3 months.</p><p id="Par72">Due to the low risk of the IMP treatments and that any emergency clinical decisions would be unaffected by knowledge of the treatment group, a normal-working-hours unblinding service will be provided.</p><p id="Par73">Participants are also free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason.</p><p id="Par74">All AEs that may be related to the study will be recorded on the Adverse Events Form and sent to the SCTU within 1 month of the form being due. As adults on average see their GP approximately five times per year for a variety of routine and unscheduled appointments (e.g. for medication review, self-limiting minor illnesses and long-term conditions unrelated to urinary infection), many medical encounters are of no relevance to the study. Events that will be reported include any judged by the principal investigator at the site to be possibly related to the study. In particular, all medical encounters related to the following medical areas or symptoms will be recorded in the Adverse Events Form:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par75">Abdominal symptoms: any events relating to abdominal discomfort or other symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">Urine infection: any events relating to UTI</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">Medication: any events relating to study medication</p></list-item></list>

The SAE/SUSAR Form asks for nature of event, date of onset, severity, corrective therapies given, outcome and causality (i.e. unrelated, unlikely, possible, probably, definitely) as per standard reporting procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Power calculation and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par80">In our previous study, the severity of frequency symptoms at 2&#x02013;4 days was 2.15 (SD 1.18) in the immediate antibiotic group and 2.11 (mean difference &#x02212;0.04, CI &#x02212;0.47 to 0.40) in the delayed antibiotic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The clinically significant change in symptom severity based on previous consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the previous UTI study would be a difference of 1 severity point in every two women, that is a mean severity difference of 0.5. In order to estimate the required sample size a power calculation was carried out using NQuery 3.0 with a two-sided significance level of 5% (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) and power of 90% (beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1) based on a two-group <italic>t</italic> test of equal means. For the 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design, to detect a mean severity difference of 0.5 with SD 1.18 requires a sample of 60 per group, or 75 per group, so 300 in total allowing for 20% loss to follow-up.</p><p id="Par81">An important secondary outcome is the proportion of participants who use antibiotics. In our previous study we achieved a reduction from 90% in the immediate antibiotic group to 77% 41/53 in the delayed group (without additional symptom relief). Thus, in this study we would anticipate the &#x02018;placebo/no advice to take ibuprofen arm&#x02019; to experience 77% uptake of antibiotic. In a study comparing NSAID to antibiotic for UTI, only 33% of the NSAID group required rescue antibiotics so potentially this intervention may reduce antibiotic uptake to as little as 30%. A clinically significant reduction in antibiotic use would be 17% (i.e. from 77% to 60%) and would require a total sample of 65.5 per group or 262 in total, 328 allowing for 20% loss to follow-up (82 per group) for 80% power with a two-sided significance level of 5%, based on a chi-squared test of equal proportions.</p><p id="Par82">In order to achieve at least 90% power for the primary endpoint and allowing 20% loss to follow-up, the trial requires four groups of 82 patients. If the loss to follow-up is higher than anticipated and increases to 30%, a total of 376 patients (94 per group) will be required. The trial is not powered for any interaction between factorial groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par83">All analyses will be performed on a full intention-to-treat basis, that is, all patients randomised will be included, and all patients will be analysed according to their allocated group whatever treatment they receive.</p><p id="Par84">For the primary analyses, descriptive statistics will be obtained for the randomisation groups to characterise recruited patients and assess baseline comparability.

Logistic regression will be used to analyse the dichotomous outcomes (antibiotic use, re-consultation in 1 month with UTI and re-consultation with UTI from notes review in the next 12 months). Negative binomial regression will be used to analyse duration of moderately bad symptoms. All analyses will be adjusted for the factorial design and, if necessary, for potential confounding variables, e.g. use of antibiotics.</p><p id="Par86">For each outcome the following pairwise comparisons will be examined by calculating a 95% CI for the difference/odds ratio/incidence rate ratio:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par87">Uva-ursi versus no uva-ursi: group 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;group 3 patients versus group 2&#x02009;+&#x02009;group 4 patients</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par88">Advice to take ibuprofen versus no advice to take ibuprofen: group 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;group 2 patients versus group 3&#x02009;+&#x02009;group 4 patients</p></list-item></list>

The open, pragmatic arm of the trial also builds on existing research into symptom relief of uncomplicated UTI with ibuprofen, whereby two thirds of women (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;248) with mild to moderate symptoms recovered without the need for antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It will provide clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of using ibuprofen and a traditional herbal medicine uva-ursi, either singularly or in combination for the relief of the distressing symptoms of UTI in women, one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. The NSAID has known anti-inflammatory properties, and uva-ursi has demonstrated antibacterial properties against <italic>E. coli</italic> both in vitro as well as in urine samples of healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par93">The diary format has been previously validated and shown to be sensitive to change for other acute infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By using this method it will allow the impact of the intervention on symptom severity and on the duration of symptoms to be investigated.</p><p id="Par94">Should the main outcome of the trial be positive, the qualitative element of the study will provide insights into any reservations that patients and practitioners may have about accepting a recommendation/prescription for ibuprofen and/or uva-ursi, with delayed prescribing of antibiotics, which in turn will inform implementation of the findings. The finding will be disseminated by publication and presentation at conferences.
