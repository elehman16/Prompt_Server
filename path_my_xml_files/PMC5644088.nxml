Women are especially at risk of being exposed. Effective community based interventions to reduce the SHS in households targeting women is scarce. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a multi-component intervention on household SHS exposure among Sri Lankan women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Thirty clusters of 25 women (aged 18&#x02013;65) from 750 households were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Women in the intervention group were exposed to activities which focused on improving knowledge on the health effects of SHS, attitudes towards SHS exposure, right to a smoke-free living and women empowerment against smoking. The duration of the intervention was six months. The comparison group received no intervention. The primary outcome of interest was self-reported SHS exposure in the household within 7&#x000a0;days prior to data collection. The secondary outcomes were exposure in the past 30&#x000a0;days, knowledge of the health risks of exposure, attitudes towards exposure, right to smoke-free living, women empowerment against smoking, and smoking inside the homes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Final assessment was in 329 (89.6%) in the intervention group and 309 (85.8%) in the comparison group.

At least 250 of such chemicals are known to be harmful, with hydrogen <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000686192&#x00026;version=Patient&#x00026;language=English">cyanide</ext-link>, carbon monoxide, and ammonia being a few examples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory illness, including lung cancer and nasal cancer among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The Tobacco and Alcohol Act, No. 27 of 2006, practiced presently in Sri Lanka, has provisions for smoke free environments in health care facilities, all educational facilities, all governmental facilities, as well as in indoor private offices and workplaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, Sri Lanka became a signatory to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in September 2003 and ratified the same in November 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It, thus, obligates the country to implement its article 8, &#x02018;protection from exposure to SHS&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, anti-smoking law in Sri Lanka does not cover smoking inside homes. Thus, additional measures are required to protect non-smokers, particularly women and children, from SHS exposure. Women not having the power to ban smoking in their own homes is also a discrimination against them. Despite an obligation to conventions to protect women against SHS, specific legislation to control tobacco use inside homes is not likely to be imposed in Sri Lanka because of complex social and cultural issues. De-normalizing tobacco use and normalizing smoke-free homes are therefore more likely solution, which has to be realized from the grassroots level. Such measures would also ensure non-smoking women&#x02019;s rights to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Sri Lanka records very low rates of current tobacco smoking among women (0.1%) compared to males (29.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Women inhale SHS in their homes due to tobacco use of males. Exposure to SHS remains a significant problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in Sri Lanka despite the recent laws prohibiting tobacco smoking in public places. Though the previous studies show a decline of the prevalence of exposure to SHS (within 7&#x000a0;days) at home from 21.1% in 2006 to 10.8% in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the latest non-communicable diseases, risk factor survey in 2015 indicates that 21.6% of females of 18&#x02013;69&#x000a0;years were exposed to SHS at home during a 30&#x000a0;day period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The community based initiatives and interventions to develop smoke free homes have been conducted in many countries, with mixed success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has been shown that the intervention programmes when implemented along with population-based strategies (such as public education campaigns on SHS in homes, laws enforcing 100% smoke-free public places and workplace initiatives for smoke free homes) are more effective than individually carried out programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Numerous calls for action on women and tobacco have highlighted the need for intervention on SHS exposure among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but the studies on community based interventions are limited from lower middle and lower income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

A quasi experimental study from India to develop smoke free homes was found to be effective following a six month multiple intervention period targeting women and community leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another quasi experimental study to increase the number of smoke free homes in Pakistan had attempted multiple activities in school and community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results revealed that smoke-free homes increased from 43% (95%CI 37.4&#x02013;48.2) to 85% (95%CI 80.9&#x02013;89.2) following three months of intervention. A similar attempt in the United Kingdom also found a significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) increase in smoke free homes from 35% at baseline to 68% six months of the post-implementation of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Multiple strategies and activities integrated with each other and at different levels (individual level, family level, community level, institutional level and policy level) are more effective in health promotion interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We could not find any community based Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) on SHS reduction at home among women in lower and lower middle income countries. The interventional studies to reduce exposure to SHS at home have not been reported from Sri Lanka.</p><p id="Par18">Exposure to SHS can be measured objectively using biomarkers such as saliva or urinary cotinine or environmental indoor measurement of tobacco smoke constituents such as air nicotine or particulate matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Questionnaire was the most commonly used method to assess SHS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the most commonly used indicator to ascertain the exposure was the presence of smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between self reported SHS exposure and urinary cotinine level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this backdrop, the objective of the present study was to implement and evaluate an intervention comprising multiple interventional activities to reduce household exposure to SHS among women. The hypothesis of this study was whether multiple interventions would be effective to reduce household exposure to SHS among women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">The present study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, implemented and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and its extension to cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

The field staff who provide services to adults by means of home visits or in clinics/offices were chosen based on their opportunities to interact with the women to provide the knowledge. The health staff included MOH, PHM, Public Health Inspectors, and non-health staff included Grama Niladari, Samurdi Officer, Social Service Officer and health volunteers. Additionally, the training was aimed at gaining support of the officers for a larger research. We used adult training methods such as lecture discussion, group work, group discussion, role play, experience sharing sessions in the workshop. A video developed by the Ministry of Health on health effects of SHS was also shown to them. The Principle Investigator conducted the training workshops along with a legal officer for a non-governmental organization called Alcohol and Drug Information Centre who deals against tobacco and alcohol.<break/>
<bold><italic>Individual and group health education sessions for women.</italic></bold>
<break/>Intervention was in the form of individual and interactive small group health education sessions. Two trained volunteers were selected from each cluster in a GN division and were trained to deliver the health education sessions. Selected volunteers were the active members of the mother support group, which is a strong volunteer organization to strengthen the community level health promotion activities in Sri Lanka. Each volunteer was asked to visit the half of the households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] of the group of women selected from a GN division for the intervention. Intervention was done with the PHM who was also trained to deliver the intervention as described earlier. The volunteers organized small group discussions with the women and invited the area PHM. The area PHM initiated discussion on family wellbeing as an entry point in the discussion and thereafter conducted the discussion to identify the problems faced by the women in relation to being exposed to SHS. Women were educated how to apply avoidance behaviour when exposure to SHS, such as walking away from SHS, showing displeasure against exposure to SHS. Identified problems were prioritized and the two-trained volunteers with inputs from the women and the area PHM developed a problem and solution tree. Special attention was given to educate women on health effects of exposure to SHS and the right to smoke free living. Leaflets and stickers were distributed among women. They were persuaded to implement 100% smoke free environment in their homes. The women were guided to decide how they could reduce exposure to SHS, as applicable to their own home. Modalities like demonstration, role-playing, storytelling and sharing experience were used to educate and motivate them to initiate activities. Each group discussion lasted for about one and a half hours. The two health volunteers noted down the interventional activities selected by women. Those included discussions with their spouses on health effects of passive smoking, SHS exposure avoidance behaviour, and display stickers on &#x0201c;this house is tobacco smoke free&#x0201d;. In addition, women themselves initiated some activities, which were not directly related to SHS reduction, but improved family well-being by strengthening family bond. They were household money management, home gardening, proper garbage disposal, hygienically safe kitchen, family dinners and religious activities, etc.<break/>When women became empowered by creating changes within their own home, they visited neighborhood homes too, to explore the possibility of spreading the results to the community away from the household. Initially PHM and the volunteers motivated them, later they themselves disseminated the results to the community. Some community level activities initiated by the women were evident, though not formally assessed. In most instances, other family members (children, husband and parents) and volunteers also made an effort to get the neighboring households involved.<break/>Initially, the volunteers visited the allocated houses once in a fortnight and gradually reduced the visits when the activities were established. The volunteers&#x02019; arranged group meetings with the women in the selected households once a month in the first three months, followed by once in every one and a half months.<break/>
<bold><italic>Distribution of educational materials</italic></bold>
<break/>Education materials (posters, leaflets and short video clips) were also distributed to community clinic centers, local shops, religious centers, preschools, and schools in the selected GN divisions.<break/>
<bold><italic>School based intervention to train the</italic></bold>
<bold>schoolchildren to be change agents</bold>
<break/>The objective of the school-based intervention was to improve students&#x02019; knowledge of health effects of exposure to SHS and the right to smoke free living and to use them as change agents to educate their mothers/women in their households and declare smoke free homes. The schoolchildren in grades 8&#x02013;10 of six secondary schools in the intervention GN divisions were selected for this purpose. The Public Health Inspectors who received the training as a part of the same intervention delivered two 45&#x000a0;min sessions over two days. The duration of these sessions is consistent with regular school lessons. Teaching methods included active learning activities such as lecture discussions, role-playing and storytelling. All programs were delivered to students in their usual classroom setting, during school hours. In addition, all the students in six schools were invited to participate in a poster competition to promote the message &#x0201c;right to smoke free living&#x0201d;.</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

The questionnaire and the checklist were completed by the data collectors who were not involved in the intervention by doing the household visits, before the intervention and after the intervention. To ensure that women could honestly provide their responses, women were pre-informed about the confidential nature of their responses. The questionnaire was given first and then the observational checklist was completed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Fidelity</title><p id="Par36">The health volunteers in terms of how much of the intended intervention was actually delivered, assessed the fidelity of the intervention.

Between group and within group comparisons were done using parametric and non-parametric tests (Paired t test, Independent t test, Chi-Square test, McNemar test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test). Comparison of the basic characteristics of the completers and non-completers were also tested.</p><p id="Par38">The primary outcome indicator, the proportion of women with recent exposure to SHS at home was estimated by taking the number of women who report anyone smoking tobacco (cigarette bidi / cigars) inside the household within last 7&#x000a0;days in the presence of these women as the numerator and all the women in the study group as the denominator. This proportion was estimated for both intervention and control groups prior to and after the interventions. Secondary outcome of exposure to SHS was analyzed using the same numerator and denominator, but with the number of women exposed within last 30&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par39">The secondary outcome of knowledge of women on the health risk of exposure to SHS was assessed using questions with <italic>yes</italic>, <italic>no</italic> or <italic>do not know</italic> responses. Using a scoring system, each woman was awarded one point for each correct answer while incorrect, blank and do not know the answers were awarded zero points. The total score for this scale ranged from 0 to 13, with a higher score representing a greater knowledge. Attitude of women towards exposure to SHS, right to smoke free living and women empowerment against smoking were also assessed using relevant statements in a five point Likert scale format, with responses ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic> with middle neutral. The scoring system used was assigned a score of 0&#x02013;4 for each statement in which a score of zero was assigned to <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and a score of four for <italic>strongly agree</italic> with other responses for positively worded items, and a reverse scoring system for negatively worded items. Scores were summed to obtain a total score for attitude of women towards exposure to SHS, attitude on the right to smoke free living and attitude on women empowerment that ranged from 0 to 20, 0&#x02013;12 and 0&#x02013;16 respectively. The median scores for knowledge of women on the health risk of exposure to SHS, attitude of woman&#x02019;s exposure to SHS, right to smoke free living and women empowerment against smoking were calculated for both intervention and control groups prior to and after the interventions. In analysis, the scores for the knowledge, attitude towards exposure to SHS, right to smoke free living, women empowerment were tested for normality of distribution using one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p><p id="Par40">The secondary outcome of observed evidence on smoking inside houses was assessed using the checklist mentioned above. Presence of at least two out of the six was considered as evidence of smoking inside the house. The proportion of houses with or without evidence of smoking was compared using Chi Square test and Mc Nemar tests. Cluster analysis was also conducted between intervention and control group before and after the intervention. The differences in the pre and post results of the primary and secondary outcomes of the intervention and control groups were compared and assessed for statistical significance. A value of 0.05 or less was considered as statistically significant. A significant improvement of the outcome in the intervention in comparison to the control group was taken as an evidence of effectiveness of the multi-component intervention activities to reduce household exposure to SHS among women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Results</title><p id="Par41">The Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>&#x000a0;shows the study flow diagram showing the number of clusters and participants at each phase of the trial, according to the CONSORT statement 2010 for cluster randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2017_4820_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Furthermore, knowledge of the health risks of exposure to SHS, attitude of women towards exposure to SHS, right to smoke free living and women empowerment against smoking had significantly improved among women in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. A significant reduction of the proportion of houses with observed evidence of smoking was evident among those exposed to SHS in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. A significant difference was also observed at follow-up between intervention and control clusters in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. The present study is unique in that multi-component intervention activities were targeted through existing resources. All these can be taken as evidence of success to reduce household exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke among women directly and indirectly at individual, family, community and institutional level. The use of existing health resources will ensure sustainability as well as the acceptability of the intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first community based behavioral study among women on household exposure to SHS to use a cluster-randomized design conducted and analysed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This study design eliminated the problem of contamination, which is important for an intervention that has a strong social component. The study design incorporated a highly conservative data analysis strategy to account for clustering effect by comparing cluster summaries in addition to analysing individual values. This study had a high participation rate and low attrition.</p><p id="Par51">The present study applied health belief model, social cognitive theory and existing community based SHS interventions to design the intervention. Intervention strategies identified by previous smoke free home interventions were also guided by the health belief model and the social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The theories helped to understand the causal paths that would affect the intervention. Therefore, the intervention model focused on perceptions of women, empowering them by disseminating to them the knowledge of passive smoking and cancer and other illnesses, and the skills to interact with smokers in their presence.</p><p id="Par52">The present study did not find a significant difference between completers and non-completers except the occupational status of the participants. A significant proportion of women among non-completers were employed compared to completers (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). If one is considering that being employed is likely to be associated with inputs related to adverse effects of exposures to SHS, having a higher proportion of non-completers in the intervention group strengthen the study results attributing it to the interventional activities.</p><p id="Par53">Our results strengthen and extend findings from previous interventions on the initiatives of smoke free homes. Previous interventions done in neighboring countries (India and Pakistan) concluded significant improvement in smoke free home development three to six months of multiple interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study done in UK also concluded positive results following six month intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The present study adds to the evidence of multiple activities at different levels to reduce the risk of exposure to SHS in a lower-middle income country, where the resources are scarce for community-based interventions.</p><p id="Par54">We consider that the results of the study can be generalized to the communities with similar socio-demographic characteristics for the present study. However, several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. The critical limit of the study is the lack of an objective measure (e.g., salivary cotinine levels) to validate self-reported exposure to SHS. Such laboratory-based measurements are not available for research purposes in Sri Lanka. Recall bias in the 30-day measure could have caused the controls less likely to recall the exposure than the cases. This could have affected the study by the overestimation of the differences of the post intervention SHS exposure between the groups. Having realized the possibility of recall bias with the 30-day measure, we used also the 7-day measure. In addition, we included secondary outcomes (knowledge, attitude, right to smoke free living, women empowerment) to supplement the evidence of the primary outcome. Observational checklist was also included to overcome the limitation of self-reports and recall bias. However, self-reports have been demonstrated to be accurate provided confidentially is assured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In addition, previous studies have shown a strong correlation between levels of self-reported smoking restrictions and exposure to SHS measured by cotinine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">In keeping with the principles of research, the same questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention by interviewers. However, this could potentially introduce a bias (i.e., social desirability bias) in terms of responses about the subjective SHS exposure or knowledge and attitudes related to SHS in the houses in the post-intervention interview. The responders of the intervention group may have inclined to give what they perceive as socially acceptable answers, as they have been recently (within 6&#x000a0;months) involved in the multiple activities of the project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This could have caused an overestimate of the differences in the outcomes shown in the study. There is consistent population-level evidence that a smoke-free home is associated with increased smoking cessation and decreased cigarette consumption in adult smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In the present study, the prevalence of smoking and smoking consumption in the households of the study subjects was not assessed. The present study has six-month intervention and observation period, and the long-term effect of this programme is unclear.</p><p id="Par56">This research ascertained the impact of described multi-component intervention activities as a whole and did not assess the relative importance among the different intervention activities. Considering the importance of this information, it is suggested that future research on this subject should be designed to identify one single intervention that can make an impact.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par57">This six-month cluster randomized trial on the impact of multi-component intervention activities to reduce household exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke among women in Sri Lanka showed that they were effective in reducing exposure of the women to SHS at households. The study has established the feasibility of multi-component intervention activities in a lower-middle income South Asian setting. Scaling up the interventions will require assessment of cost effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Further research should investigate the influence of reduction of SHS at household on smoking cessation among adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
