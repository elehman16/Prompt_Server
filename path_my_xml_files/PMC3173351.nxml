So far no randomised study has published any results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>DILALA is a Scandinavian, randomised trial, comparing laparoscopic lavage (LL) to the traditional Hartmann's Procedure (HP). Primary endpoint is the number of re-operations within 12 months. Secondary endpoints consist of mortality, quality of life (QoL), re-admission, health economy assessment and permanent stoma. Patients are included when surgery is required. A laparoscopy is performed and if Hinchey grade III is diagnosed the patient is included and randomised 1:1, to either LL or HP. Patients undergoing LL receive &#x0003e; 3L of saline intraperitoneally, placement of pelvic drain and continued antibiotics. Follow-up is scheduled 6-12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. A QoL-form is filled out on discharge, 6- and 12 months. Inclusion is set to 80 patients (40+40).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HP is associated with a high rate of complication. Not only does the primary operation entail complications, but also subsequent surgery is associated with a high morbidity. Thus the combined risk of treatment for the patient is high.

It is classified by severity according to the Hinchey grading scale, where I and II represent contained abscesses, and III and IV are cases with perforated colon and purulent (III) or faecal (IV) leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The traditional treatment for the Hinchey III and IV has been open surgery with resection of the affected segment, blind closure of the distal resection line and a diverting colostomy i.e. Hartmann's procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Another option is resection with primary anastomosis of the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A retrospective study at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg studied all patients (n = 106) admitted and operated for complicated diverticulitis between 2003 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Eighteen percent underwent at least one re-operation during their first admission, and the mean length of hospital stay was 17 (1-111) days. Mortality was 6%, not different from similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The number of complications indicated considerable suffering, morbidity and resource consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Only 56% of patients operated with Hartmann's procedure later underwent surgery for stoma reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other studies have shown that the reversal of Hartmann's Procedure alone has a morbidity rate of 20% (3-39) and mortality of 1-6%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Several recently published reports suggest a new principle for the treatment of perforated diverticulitis, consisting of laparoscopy, lavage and drainage without colon resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. One prospective study including 92 patients with laparoscopic lavage showed morbidity and mortality rates of 4% and 3%, respectively. No re-intervention was needed. Eighty-nine patients recovered without morbidity and resumed oral intake after 2 days (1-9) and were discharged after 8 days (7-19)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Janson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have shown that laparoscopic resection for colon cancer results in a higher quality of life compared to open surgery, and although there is little evidence indicating laparoscopy being more cost-effective than open surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a recent Health Technology Assessment suggests that there are economical benefits to lavage of perforated purulent diverticulitis, due to decreased surgical measures and shorter length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With this in consideration there are several factors in favour of the new treatment, laparoscopy and lavage.</p><p>Randomised studies are required before laparoscopic lavage can be proven to be the therapy of choice in perforated diverticulitis Hinchey grade III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Patients randomised to the HP with planned stoma reversal are scheduled to have a follow-up at least 6-12 weeks following this procedure, regardless of the earlier follow-up plan from the primary operation. All patients undergo colonoscopy, computer tomography colonography or double contrast barium enema, within 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Health Related Quality of Life</title><p>All patients are asked to fill out a quality of life form on the day of discharge, 6 months and 12 months.

In our retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] we found that 40% of the patients were re-operated for the same disease within a year, many of which were stoma reversals. To be able to detect a reduction from 40% to 10% in reoperations, each group must include at least 32 patients. The calculation is based on a binomial approximation, 80% power and a level of significance of 5%. In view of the relatively complicated flow chart for the trial and that all procedures are emergency surgery; the inclusion is set to 80 randomised patients (40 + 40).</p><p>Randomisation to blocks was generated using the Analysis Tool Pack in Excel, by the trial statistician. For each participating centre one block of 10 is sent at a time. The package consists of 10 closed envelopes, with numbers 1-10 on the outside, to be opened in sequence as the randomizations occur.</p></sec><sec><title>Participating Hospitals</title><p>All participating centres are hospitals with emergency rooms and where abdominal surgery is performed.</p><p>The participating hospitals thus far are Sahlgrenska University Hospital, NU Hospital Organisation, &#x000d6;rebro University Hospital, Sk&#x000f6;vde Hospital/KSS, Alings&#x000e5;s Hospital, Central Hospital Karlstad, Herlev University Hospital, Roskilde University Hospital and Odense University Hospital. Six additional hospitals are in the process of becoming a participating institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Danish (Protocol nr. H-4-2009-088) and the Swedish (EPN/G&#x000f6;teborg Dnr 378-09) ethics committees. In the Danish participating centres, the surgeon must receive informed consent from the patient.</p><p>In the Swedish participating centres, the surgeon can include the patient after informing a relative, if the patient's awareness is compromised by a septic condition.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Perforated diverticulitis requiring surgery is a potentially lethal condition with high risks regarding morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although surgical techniques as well as results have developed considerably since Hartmann's Procedure was presented in 1921 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], no significant changes in operative approach have been proven superior, for perforated diverticulitis Hinchey grade III-IV. Not only is the primary procedure associated with complications, but so is the reversal procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus the combined risk of treatment for the patient is high. Diverticular disease is in general a condition associated with a considerable resource consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], especially as the severity and quantity of complications lead to increased costs. It would therefore be beneficial for both patient and society if an alternative surgical technique could be introduced to minimise re-operations, re-admissions and permanent stomas. The recently described technique of laparoscopic lavage as treatment for perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis (Hinchey III) could be such an alternative treatment modality, but it remains to be validated in randomised trials. At present we are aware of at least three more randomised trials, the Scandiv study based at Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Akershus University Hospital, Oslo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the Ladies trial based at Department of Surgery, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and the LapLAND study based at St. Vincent's University Hospital in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the DILALA trial is to evaluate if laparoscopic lavage is a safe, minimally invasive method for patients with perforated diverticulitis Hinchey grade III, resulting in fewer re-operations, decreased morbidity, mortality, costs and increased quality of life. Inclusion started February 1<sup>st </sup>2010 and by March 2011 eight hospitals had included patients, another three hospitals had gone through the steps to start inclusion.</p><p>The inclusion period is intended to be concluded by 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Acronym and Abbrevations</title><p>Diverticulitis Laparoscopic Lavage vs. Resection: DILALA; Laparoscopic lavage: LL; Hartmann's Procedure: HP; Quality of life: QoL; Clinical record forms: CRF</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EH is the principal investigator, has initiated the trial, been part of the planning of the trial, as well as the protocol writing committee.
