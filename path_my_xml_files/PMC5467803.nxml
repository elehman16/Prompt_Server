One strategy has been using 3TC/ FTC monotherapy (3TC/FTC), which in the presence of the M184V resistance mutation, does not suppress viral replication nor select for additional drug resistance mutations, and reduces viral fitness with limited side effects. P1094 compared the immunologic outcome of continuing failing cART vs. switching to 3TC/FTC as a &#x0201c;bridging strategy&#x0201d; to subsequent suppressive cART for non-adherent YLHIV with pre-existing M184V resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><p>Participants with documented nonadherence, M184V mutation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count &#x02265;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and VF (HIV-1 plasma RNA &#x02265;400 copies/mL (2.6 log<sub>10</sub> HIV-1 RNA) were enrolled and randomized to continue failing cART vs. switch to 3TC/FTC. The primary endpoint (time to &#x02265;30% CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell decline or development of CDC class C events) at 28-weeks were assessed by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves in an intent-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-three perinatally acquired YLHIV participants (16 continuing cART and 17 3TC/FTC) enrolled in the study. The median age, entry CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count, and viral load were 15 years (Inter-quartile range (IQR) 14&#x02013;20), 472 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 384&#x02013;651), and 4.0 log<sub>10</sub>HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (IQR 3.2&#x02013;4.5), respectively. Five participants, all in the 3TC/FTC arm, reached the primary endpoint for absolute CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell decline (p = 0.02, exact log-rank test comparing monotherapy to cART). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of probability of primary endpoint on 3TC/FTC at 28 weeks was 0.41 (standard error 0.14). There were no CDC class C events or deaths and no statistically significant difference in frequencies of adverse events between the arms.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Non-adherent participants randomized to 3TC/FTC were more likely than those maintained on failing cART to experience a confirmed decline in CD4+ count of &#x02265;30%. Although this study suffers from limitations of small sample size and premature discontinuation, the randomized comparison to continuing failing cART indicates that 3TC/FTC provides inferior protection from immunologic deterioration for non-adherent youth with M184V resistance. Better alternatives to 3TC/FTC such as ART with higher barriers to resistance and novel adherence and treatment strategies for nonadherent youth are urgently needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01338025">NCT01338025</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1AI068632</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1AI068616</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1AI106716</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K23 AI084549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8449-222X</contrib-id><name><surname>Agwu</surname><given-names>Allison L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Overall support for the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network (IMPAACT) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Numbers UM1AI068632 (IMPAACT LOC), UM1AI068616 (IMPAACT SDMC) and UM1AI106716 (IMPAACT LC), with co-funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).

However, it is estimated that up to 40% of pediatric and adolescent patients who initiate a new regimen fail on that regimen within the first 1&#x02013;2 years [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], primarily due to nonadherence. This suboptimal adherence, with viremia in the presence of continued drug pressure at suboptimal levels, results in development of resistant quasispecies and viral escape. Nonadherence with resultant viremia affects 30&#x02013;40% of children and youth with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PA-HIV) on cART[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and is likely due to multiple causes (treatment fatigue, pill burden, desire for normalcy, depression, transition of the responsibility of medication administration from the caregiver to the child) that may function independently or in concert[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Antiretroviral management in the setting of poor adherence in children and youth living with HIV is increasingly challenging for providers. A balance must be struck between the need to continue cART to maintain immunologic integrity and the desire to simplify the therapeutic regimen, foster optimal adherence, and minimize development of resistance, while awaiting for youth to mature and develop better adherence. To improve adherence, multiple strategies have been tested (e.g., cell phone reminders, counseling, MEMS caps, G-tube placement, directly observed therapy, financial incentives), yet no gold standard has emerged [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, during the time providers are working to improve adherence, nonadherence frequently continues with the attendant risk of accumulation of ARV drug resistance and reduction of future treatment options. The question of what to do with the cART while working on adherence remains a centrally important one in the management of persistently nonadherent children and youth living with PA-HIV in need of therapy and there are no consensus guidelines about how this should be managed. Switching to a new regimen in the setting of nonadherence, particularly, when nonadherence is unrelated to side effects, may lead to development of resistance to the new regimen. Discontinuation of cART is generally avoided in patients who meet treatment criteria, in light of data from the SMART study that highlights the increased morbidity risk secondary to HIV-related and non-related clinical events with treatment discontinuation[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Bridging strategies, without resistance consequences, could provide time for intensive efforts to improve adherence, which might improve the chance that these patients would succeed on a subsequent cART regimen. One such strategy is lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) monotherapy. The rationale for this strategy is as follows: 1) 3TC or FTC are components of the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of most first line cART regimens, 2) 3TC and FTC have minimal side effects, 3) the M184V resistance mutation, resulting in high-level drug resistance to both 3TC and FTC, develops rapidly in the setting of nonadherence and is present in many treatment-experienced children and adolescents with PA-HIV [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 4) the M184V resistant mutation reduces viral fitness, and has been associated with a reduction in viral load of approximately 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> c/mL[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and 5) it does not confer significant cross-resistance to other NRTIs and increases susceptibility of HIV to other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs [e.g., tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), zidovudine (AZT)][<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Participants assigned to the monotherapy arm (Arm B) received either 3TC or FTC (the choice of 3TC or FTC was left to the provider) and discontinued other ART. Sites were expected to provide and document adherence support measures (per their standard of care) during the study. The target sample size of 344 was chosen to provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.15 between study arms in proportions of participants with immunologic deterioration using a log-rank test with a 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.05.

Four (67%) of the six participants on cART with viral load data for week 24/28 had decreases in log viral load of more than 0.5, while none of the six participants on 3TC/FTC did (p = 0.06, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.)</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Immunology and immune activation</title><p>Biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation were assessed for participants in the 3TC/FTC arm followed at domestic sites with available samples.

In this multi-site study of YLHIV with persistent virologic failure on cART, those who were randomized to 3TC/FTC monotherapy were significantly more likely to experience &#x02265;30% decline in absolute CD4+ T cell count over 28 weeks compared with those maintained on failing cART. The change from baseline in markers of inflammation and immune activation did not differ between the two groups. Immune correlates at baseline were not different between those who did and did not experience immunologic decline in the 3TC/FTC arm, though this was performed on a limited sample size.</p><p>A prior study of adults with relatively robust baseline median CD4+ T cell counts of 570 (IQR 466&#x02013;636) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> compared 3TC monotherapy to discontinuation of cART and found that the monotherapy strategy was superior to cART discontinuation [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Specifically, participants with lower CD4+ T cell counts were more likely to have clinical deterioration than those at higher CD4+ T cell counts. We were unable to conduct an analysis of higher vs. lower CD4+ T cell counts at entry on clinical deterioration due to both a limited sample size and the majority of our participants having CD4 + T cell counts &#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Others have shown that withdrawing the NRTIs as opposed to interrupting PIs or NNRTIs in a failing regimen may have the greatest impact on immune decline, a different approach than was used in our study [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that the use of the comparison cART group on PI-based regimens may have led to the dramatically different outcomes between the two study arms. Opravil et al studied 26 clinically stable, significantly pre-treated adults (median age 43 years; median CD4+ T cell count of 432 [IQR 378&#x02013;540] cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) who were switched in an uncontrolled, one-armed study from a failing (VL&#x0003e; than 400 copies/mL) cART regimen to 3TC monotherapy[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The proportion of patients reaching the clinical endpoint of a &#x02265; 30% decline in CD4+ T cell count or a CD4+ T cell count &#x0003c;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> at 24, 36, and 48 weeks was 36%, 57%, and 70%, respectively. When the investigators analyzed the participants stratified by the failing regimen at baseline (PI vs. reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-based cART (NNRTI or NRTI)), 81% of participants on PI-based cART vs. 40% of participants on RTI-based cART reached the clinical endpoint, despite similar baseline CD4+ T cell counts and other characteristics. The decline in absolute CD4+ T cell was not statistically different between the two groups, however, patients who were initially on PI-based cART had greater increases in the viral replication capacity, perhaps due to outgrowth of viral strains lacking PI resistance mutations detected on resistance testing in the absence of ART pressure. The authors concluded that 3TC monotherapy may be considered as a short-term strategy for &#x0201c;selected&#x0201d; patients failing RTI-based cART, but not PI-based regimens due to concern for increased viral fitness and greater likelihood of CD4+ T cell decline. Our study is unable to look at differences between PI vs. RTI-based cART as NNRTI-based regimens were excluded. Given the known lower barrier to resistance in NNRTI-based regimens and the possibility of rapid accumulation of resistance in the setting of continued nonadherence, we did not feel that it was ethical to randomize participants to continue NNRTI-based regimens in setting of continued nonadherence.</p><p>During our study, participants in the continuing cART arm had declines in their viral loads, while those in the 3TC/FTC arm had increases in their viral loads, though the difference between arms was not statistically significant. It is possible that participation in a clinical trial with close monitoring, frequent interactions, and incentives may have resulted in greater adherence over the study period. Indeed fewer participants in both arms reported missed doses at the end of the study compared to baseline, suggesting that the frequent visits and/or other study interventions with the site&#x02019;s ongoing adherence work led to improvements in adherence even in these patients with a history of persistently poor adherence. Although there was no difference between the two arms in terms of adherence, it is possible that improved, though suboptimal adherence to a potentially more active regimen in the cART arm would result in better viral load responses[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Data from observational pediatric studies of 3TC/FTC monotherapy[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have supported 3TC/FTC monotherapy as a strategy that can be used to bridge patients during periods of nonadherence[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Country level guidelines, including those in South Africa and previously, the U.S., listed this strategy as one that could be employed[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based partly on the findings from P1094 which were presented in abstract form at the 2014 Pediatric Virology Meeting in Melbourne, Australia, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#x02019; Guidelines, classified NRTI monotherapy regimens, including 3TC/FTC, as &#x0201c;not recommended as a treatment strategy for children failing non-suppressive ART&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In other countries, particularly settings with limited antiretroviral options, such as South Africa, this strategy continues to be used although clinicians do have limited access to third line drugs[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178075.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The study findings are specific to 3TC/FTC monotherapy, and are not meant to be extrapolated to other monotherapy bridging or simplification strategies. There have been studies of other monotherapy strategies (e.g., PI monotherapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or atazanavir/ritonavir) that have demonstrated the ability to maintain immunologic integrity, however, these strategies have been employed in the setting of virologic suppression or simplification of multi-agent ART with simplification[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This study was not designed to compare 3TC/FTC monotherapy to other simplified strategies and therefore cannot provide evidence for how 3TC/FTC monotherapy would compare to those strategies.</p><p>The P1094 study has several important strengths. Specifically, it was a randomized controlled study conducted through a highly experienced network, with standardized comprehensive measurements, including immunology and immune activation. Further, the participants were from multiple sites in the U.S., South America, and Thailand. The participants had a wide range of CD4+ T cell counts and were failing on contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens. The study findings must be interpreted with some important study limitations in mind. First, the early closure due to slow accrual resulted in a small sample size, leaving the study under-powered to make certain comparisons and conclusions. Further, ARV drug exposure (e.g., drug levels) were not collected to corroborate self-reported adherence. A relatively healthy population participated with median initial CD4+ T cell counts &#x0003e; 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, therefore, we cannot generalize to those with lower baseline CD4+ T cell counts. However, one would anticipate, as was seen in the Castagna study[<xref rid="pone.0178075.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], that such a strategy would be even more deleterious in that population with less CD4+ T cell reserve. Limited conclusions can be drawn regarding immune activation and inflammation as a limited proportion of the participants had available data. Due to the early closure, we do not have resistance data. As some clinicians may choose 3TC/FTC monotherapy with its decreased risk of accumulating resistance as a strategy for managing youth with adherence difficulties, the lack of resistance data limits our ability to analyze for differential acquisition of resistance mutations between the two study arms. Lastly, the participants in the study may not be representative of all PHIV youth and therefore our study findings may not be generalizable to all populations of PHIV children and youth.</p><p>The findings of this first randomized controlled trial to evaluate 3TC/FTC monotherapy vs. continuing failing cART, do not support the use of 3TC/FTC monotherapy as a strategy to address nonadherence in patients failing cART, particularly in settings such as the U.S., where there are other options available, even in the setting of drug resistance. Clinicians will need to continue to assess the specific barriers and options for their young patients who are failing cART and struggling with adherence in order to make the best care decisions with and for their patients; the poor immunologic outcomes observed with 3TC/FTC monotherapy should be factored into those decisions. In all settings, the focus needs to be on increasing the availability of ARV regimens that have high barriers to resistance, low pill burden, and are available in suitable formulations and durably sustainable delivery mechanisms for youth. High priorities include fixed dose combination formulations for second and third line regimens, long-acting, injectable, and other novel cART delivery systems, as well as innovative ways of delivering care and enhancing adherence, particularly for youth, given their challenges with medication adherence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178075.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178075.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178075.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178075.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178075.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline immune characteristics on 3TC/FTC monotherapy arm by immunologic deterioration.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178075.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178075.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline immune activation of 3TC/FTC monotherapy arm by immunologic deterioration.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178075.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Overall support for the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Numbers UM1AI068632 (IMPAACT LOC), UM1AI068616 (IMPAACT SDMC) and UM1AI106716 (IMPAACT LC), with co-funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
