A bovine-human reassortant pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (BRV-PV) targeting the globally most common strains was developed in India and tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled end-point driven Phase III efficacy clinical trial implemented at six sites across India. Infants 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks of age were randomized (1:1) to receive three oral doses of BRV-PV or placebo at 6, 10, and 14&#x000a0;weeks of age along with routine vaccines. Home visit surveillance was conducted to detect severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE) and safety outcomes until the children reached two years of age. A total of 3749 infants received BRV-PV while 3751 received placebo. At the time of the primary end-point (when the minimum number of cases needed for analysis were accrued) the vaccine efficacy against SRVGE was 36% (95% CI 11.7, 53.6, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0067) in the per protocol (PP) analysis, and 41.9% (95% CI 21.1, 57.3, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0005) in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis. Vaccine efficacy over the entire follow-up period (until children reached two years of age) was 39.5% (95% CI 26.7, 50, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) in the PP analysis and 38.8% (95% CI, 26.4, 49, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) in the ITT analysis. Vaccine efficacy against the very severe rotavirus cases (VSRVGE, Vesikari score&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;16) was 60.5% (95% CI 17.7, 81, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0131) at the time of the primary analysis and 54.7% (95% CI 29.7, 70.8, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0004) for the complete follow-period in the PP population. The incidence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events were similar in both the vaccine and placebo groups. Likewise, the number of intussusceptions and deaths were similar between both groups. Thus, BRV-PV is an effective, well tolerated and safe vaccine in Indian infants.

In India alone, it is estimated that 11.37 million episodes of rotavirus gastroenteritis occur every year, requiring 3.27 million outpatient visits and 872,000 inpatient admissions <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Currently two rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix and RotaTeq) are licensed internationally and are World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A third vaccine (ROTAVAC) was recently licensed in India <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Despite this, there remains an overwhelming need for cost-effective and safe rotavirus vaccines for the countries that need them the most.</p><p>Using indigenous manufacturing technology at Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd (SIIPL), a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (BRV-PV) was developed from five Bovine (UK) X Human Rotavirus Reassortant strains (serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9) received from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Initial studies on a quadrivalent formulation of the G1, G2, G3, and G4 reassortants conducted in the US and Finland demonstrated that they are safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, and efficacious <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Three clinical studies (one Phase I and two Phase II) were conducted with the BRV-PV in India. The vaccine was found safe and immunogenic in these studies, and the immunogenicity results were similar to those reported for the licensed vaccines in India <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We conducted a large Phase III study to assess the clinical efficacy of the vaccine in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE) and expand on the safety observations made in the earlier trials. This paper gives results from the complete analysis of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><p>The trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, endpoint-driven study to assess the efficacy and safety of the BRV-PV in healthy Indian Infants. Subjects were followed from the time of vaccination until 2&#x000a0;years of age for efficacy and safety outcomes. During this period, there were 8 visits by subjects to the study clinics, in addition to active surveillance consisting of weekly home visits by the field workers (FWs) to detect, characterize and collect stool specimens from all occurring episodes of gastroenteritis (GE). The study was initiated in May 2014 and conducted at clinical sites across six cities in India (Pune, Kolkata, Sewagram, Delhi, Manipal, and Jammu). The results presented in this paper represent all the safety data gathered for the vaccine, as well as efficacy data collected when the primary efficacy endpoint was met and efficacy data for the entire follow-up, i.e., through 2&#x000a0;years of age. The subjects were randomized to receive three oral doses of BRV-PV or placebo at 6, 10, and 14&#x000a0;weeks of age along with the routine DTP-HB-Hib and oral polio vaccines. There was no restriction on breastfeeding around the time of vaccination. The parents were provided with mobile phones to ensure prompt contact with the study team in case the infants had gastroenteritis or any other illness. The parents were also given a diarrhoea diary card (DDC) to capture signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis including diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever, instructed in its completion, and provided with a digital thermometer to monitor body temperature. Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more watery or looser than normal stools within 24&#x000a0;h. Parents were instructed to notify the study team on the onset of diarrhoea, complete the DDC and collect a stool sample in containers provided to them. The FWs visited the families of all subjects with GE and reviewed the DDCs; GE cases were evaluated for dehydration based on the WHO criteria <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> by trained FWs or study physicians. Sick subjects received prompt medical care by study physicians and by the referral hospitals. Visits continued on alternate days until the GE episode resolved to ensure the wellbeing of the child as well as&#x000a0;appropriate data capture on the DDC. A GE episode was considered resolved when the child was free from diarrhoea for at least 5 consecutive days.</p><p>The information from the DDC was used to grade the GE episodes as per the Vesikari Scoring System <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. An episode of GE with a score of &#x02265;11 was classified as &#x02018;severe&#x02019; and constituted an endpoint for the primary analysis. Episodes with a &#x02265;16 score were classified as &#x02018;very severe,&#x02019; 7&#x02013;10 as &#x02018;moderate,&#x02019; and less than 7&#x000a0;as &#x02018;mild&#x02019; GE.</p><p>Stool samples were tested at the Welcome Trust Research Laboratory, Christian Medical College, Vellore for rotavirus by a validated ELISA assay <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Rotaviruses detected in stool samples were further characterised for genotypes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If an ELISA positive sample was found un-typable for both VP7 and VP4 genes, the sample was tested for VP6 gene by PCR. If the VP6 was negative in RT-PCR, the result of the ELISA was considered false positive. If the VP6 was positive, nucleotide sequencing was attempted in order to complete the genotyping. All of the tests were conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards.</p><p>A case of SRVGE constituted a clinical endpoint for the primary analysis of the study. For children experiencing more than one episode of SRVGE, only the first episode was counted towards the primary endpoint.</p><p>This was an event-driven study in which the primary analysis was assessment of efficacy against SRVGE occurring after 14&#x000a0;days from the last dose among subjects who received all 3 doses. This primary analysis was to take place when at least 122 cases of SRVGE were accrued or when all the subjects reached 2&#x000a0;years of age, whichever was earlier. This report provides vaccine efficacy data collected up to 11 October 2015, when 155 cases had accrued (primary analysis), as well as&#x000a0;a full 2-years of efficacy data (complete analysis).</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Safety assessment</title><p>The enrolled subjects were followed for safety outcomes through 2&#x000a0;years of age, including severe unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and the occurrence of intussusception. Close monitoring for post-vaccination safety was conducted in a sub-cohort of 1009 infants (reactogenicity cohort). Parents of children in this reactogenicity cohort were given a post-immunization diary card (PIDC) to record solicited reactions (diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, decreased activity level, and irritability) daily for 7&#x000a0;days post vaccination. To ensure compliance, FWs made home visits on Day 3 (+2) after each vaccination, when the PIDC was reviewed and the parents were questioned about unsolicited events. An additional home visit was made on Day 7 (&#x02212;1 to +2) to review and collect the PIDC. Infants in the reactogenicity cohort were closely monitored until 28&#x000a0;days after the third investigational product dose and all unsolicited AEs of any severity grade were documented.</p><p>A protocol safety review team (PSRT) comprised by physicians from SIIPL, PATH, and DiagnoSearch Pvt Ltd (the contract research organization supporting the study) continuously monitored the safety findings in the study. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of independent physicians and biostatistician provided additional oversight on the study subjects&#x02019; safety.</p><p>Surveillance for intussusception was maintained throughout the study. Study physicians were trained to identify warning signs and ensure prompt evaluation and treatment as indicated. All potential cases were reviewed by an independent intussusception adjudication committee (IAC) that included a paediatric surgeon, a paediatrician, and a radiologist. Cases determined by the IAC as meeting criteria for Level 1 of diagnostic certainty according to the Brighton Collaboration definition of intussusception <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were reported as intussusception.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Study vaccines</title><p>The BRV-PV is a live attenuated pentavalent rotavirus vaccine containing five single gene substitution reassortants between human strains G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 and the bovine UK strain. The viruses were grown in VERO cells at a titre of &#x02265;10<sup>5.6</sup>&#x000a0;FFU/serotype/dose. The vaccine was formulated as&#x000a0;a lyophilized powder containing5% sucrose and glycine as stabilizer.

Randomization was stratified by sites and a block size of 6 was used to ensure 1:1 balance within each site. The assignments were provided to the sites by a validated interactive web response system (IWRS). After obtaining consent, a unique subject identification code (Subject ID) was allocated to each subject through IWRS and a corresponding study vaccine kit was used for that subject.</p><p>Each kit contained one vial of lyophilized vaccine/placebo, one vial of diluent, one vial adapter and one 5&#x000a0;mL syringe for vaccine reconstitution. For reconstitution, the adapter was fixed to the syringe and the syringe/adapter was connected to the diluent vial. By pulling the plunger back, diluent was aspirated into the syringe. The assembly was removed from diluent vial and was connected to the vaccine/placebo vial. The entire content of the syringe was injected into the vial. By pulling the plunger back, 2.5&#x000a0;mL of reconstituted solution was aspirated from vial into the syringe. Then the syringe was removed from the adapter and was ready for administration. The vaccine was used within one hour of reconstitution though the reconstituted vaccine is stable for 24&#x000a0;h at 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and at room temperature and for 3&#x000a0;h at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. If the subject drooled or spit the product, the dose was not repeated. If a subject vomited within 5&#x000a0;min after study vaccination, or if the kit was damaged, a backup kit was allocated to the subject through the IWRS system.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Study participants</title><p>The study was conducted at six urban/semi-urban/rural study sites across India that represent different climatic, geographical, and sociocultural environments. The subjects were 6- to 8-week-old healthy infants whose parents gave written informed consent and who were residents of the study area. Infants with ongoing diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, or any acute disease were temporarily excluded. Other key exclusion criteria were: significant malnutrition (weight-for-height Z score &#x02264; &#x02212;3 SD, median) <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; any systemic disorder; congenital abdominal disorder; history of persistent diarrhoea, intussusception, or abdominal surgery; suspected immune compromised status; allergy to any components of the study vaccines; or known major congenital defect. If a study subject suffered from an immediate hypersensitivity reaction following vaccination, significant illness, underwent major surgery, had a protocol violation, or received licensed rotavirus vaccine prior to receipt of all study doses, the infant did not receive subsequent vaccination, though the safety follow up continued.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Immunological assays</title><p>A sub-cohort of 219 randomly selected infants from among those enrolled early in the study (immunogenicity cohort) was examined for IgA seroresponses against rotavirus and neutralizing antibody responses against the three poliovirus vaccine serotypes. Serum samples from these infants were obtained just before vaccination and 4&#x000a0;weeks after the third vaccine dose. A seroresponse for rotavirus was defined as &#x02265;3-fold increase in IgA titre between post-vaccination and pre-vaccination sera. The IgA was analysed at the Welcome Trust Research Laboratory, Christian Medical College laboratory in Vellore by a conventional ELISA assay using rotavirus-infected cell culture lysate <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Under the assumptions of 50% true vaccine efficacy (95% CI lower bound 10%), attack rate of SRVGE of 2.5%, and drop-out rate of 15%, 7500 infants were required to achieve statistical power of 90%. The point estimate of the vaccine efficacy (VE) for SRVGE, i.e., (1-Hazard Ratio of the vaccine group, relative to the placebo group)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;100%, and the 95% CI were calculated using the Cox Proportionate Hazards model. The World Wald Test based on the Cox model was calculated at a 1-sided level of 0.025 (this test rejects H&#x02080; if and only if the 2-sided 95% CI for VE lies above 10%). A successful outcome for the vaccine was defined as lower bound of two sided 95% CI more than 10%, thus demonstrating efficacy of the vaccine.</p><p>Two efficacy populations were analysed. The Per Protocol (PP) population included all subjects who received all three doses of study vaccine/placebo as per the randomization by 32&#x000a0;weeks of age and were free from any major protocol deviation. The RVGE endpoints in this population were counted from 14&#x000a0;days after the third vaccination. The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included all randomized subjects receiving at least one vaccine/placebo dose (including those receiving an incorrect product). Primary endpoints in this population were counted from the time of the first vaccination. The safety population included all the enrolled subjects.</p><p>The PP population was the dataset for the primary efficacy analysis. Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested on both the PP population and the ITT population and included: VE against RVGE of any severity, VE against SRVGE in the first year of life, VE against SRVGE over the entire follow-up period, VE against SRVGE associated with rotavirus serotypes included in the vaccine, VE against SRVGE with hospitalization (&#x02265;24&#x000a0;h), VE against SRVGE with dehydration (defined as per WHO criteria <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>), and vaccine impact on the incidence of SRVGE. An additional post hoc analysis of vaccine efficacy against very severe RVGE (VSRVGE) was conducted on the subset of cases with a Vesikari score &#x02265;16.</p><p>Safety endpoints were analysed for all infants enrolled (safety population). They included: immediate AEs within 30&#x000a0;min of each vaccination; severe unsolicited AEs; SAEs; GE events; death; and intussusceptions. In addition, solicited AEs within 7&#x000a0;days of each vaccination and unsolicited AEs of any grade until 28&#x000a0;days after last vaccination were examined in the reactogenicity cohort of infants. Exact p values were computed for solicited AEs and selected unsolicited AEs. All safety endpoints were presented in numbers and percentages. Gender was presented in percentages while age, weight, and length were presented with mean, median, and standard deviation. All analyses were performed using SAS&#x000ae; version 9.2.</p><p>For the immunological assays, the number and percentage (%) of subjects with seroresponses to rotavirus and polio serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are presented by study arm along with two-sided exact 95% CI based on the Clopper-Pearson method. Seroconversion for rotavirus vaccine was defined as percentage of subjects with &#x02265;3-fold increase in rotavirus IgA titres at Day 28 (&#x000b1;7&#x000a0;days) post dose 3 with respect to baseline values. Seroconversion for polio antibodies was defined as&#x000a0;(a) for participants seronegative at the baseline time point, neutralizing antibody titres &#x0003e;1:8; and (b) for participants seropositive at the baseline time point, neutralizing antibody titres that are &#x02265;4-fold higher than the expected titre of maternal antibodies based on the pre-vaccination titre declining with a half-life of 28&#x000a0;days.

These efficacy levels were maintained through the second year of life, with an overall efficacy of 39.5% against SRVGE and 22.6% against RVGE of any severity. All of the pre-established secondary efficacy endpoints confirmed these findings as well as the ITT analyses. The vaccine prevented 42.5% of hospitalizations due to SRVGE in the primary analysis, and 35.1% over the full 2-year follow-up (ITT analysis). This has great significance in countries like India where access to medical care is often difficult. Another significant finding was that BRV-PV prevented more than 50% of very severe rotavirus infections, which represent the highest risk of dehydration, hospitalization, and death. This was shown both, at the time of the primary analysis as well as at the completion of the follow-p through two years.</p><p>RotaTeq and Rotarix have shown high levels of efficacy in developed countries, ranging from 98% (95% CI 88&#x02013;100) in the United States and Finland <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> to 85% (95% CI42-97) in Finland alone <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

ROTAVAC, the only other rotavirus vaccine tested for efficacy in India, showed an efficacy of 53.6% (95% CI 35.0&#x02013;66.9) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Our results with BRV-PV in India are in line with these results. A recent study conducted in Niger with the same BRV-PV and under a design similar to that of our study, showed 66.7% efficacy against SRVGE and 78.8% against VSRVGE <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Differences in the population, the epidemiology of the disease, age at the time of SRVGE, and treatment practices may account for the observed difference in efficacy of BRV-PV between the two studies.</p><p>The reasons for the lower efficacy figures between developed and resource-limited countries have not been completely elucidated, however they may include high levels of transplacentally transmitted antibodies in the child gut, malnutrition, breast feeding, interfering gut flora, and co-infections, all common in resource-limited countries <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Of interest, the efficacy of RotaTeq against very severe, potentially life-threatening RVGE was 40.7% (95% CI 3.3&#x02013;64.2) in Africa <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and 70% (95% CI 31.8, 88.3) in Asia <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The corresponding figure for BRV-PV was 60.5% (95% CI 17.7, 81.0) in the period up to the primary analysis, when the children averaged 12.4&#x000a0;months of age and 52.9% for the entire 2-year follow-up period. The corresponding figures for ROTAVAC in India was 54.4% (95% CI 18.3&#x02013;82.6) at the time of primary analysis <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and 57.2% (95% CI 0.3 to 81.9) for the entire 2-year follow-up period <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. At the other end of the severity spectrum, it is well known that even in developed countries RV vaccine efficacy is lower against less severe GE episodes; in our study, the efficacy of BRV-PV against RVGE of any severity at the time of the primary analysis (28% in the PP analysis, 35% in the ITT analysis) was in line with similar analysis for RotaTeq in Africa (30.5%) <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, ROTAVAC in India (36.4%) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, Rotarix in Malawi (34.7%) <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and BRV-PV in Niger (34.5%) <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The equivalent analysis for the entire follow-up period revealed an efficacy of 22.6% in the PP analysis and 24.2% in the ITT analysis, which is also in line with the results of observed with other vaccines.</p><p>Comparison of efficacy levels across trials of different rotavirus vaccines is challenging given the multiple variables involved (e.g., trial design, data collection, populations, disease epidemiology, burden of GE, associated interventions, etc.). An important factor to take into account in such comparisons is the type of surveillance applied to detect GE episodes. For example, in the RotaTeq studies in Africa where surveillance was passive (cases were detected when brought to medical facilities), a larger percentage of cases were of greater severity (61.6% of the cases were &#x02265;11 with the Vesikari score) than those in this trial (43% of the cases scored &#x02265;11). As noted above, vaccine efficacy estimates are typically higher for the cases of greater severity within the same study.</p><p>Another factor that affects comparisons of data across trials is the indiscriminate use of the Vesikari score whose application may differ widely across studies, and even across sites within a given study. There are seven scoring parameters included in the system: diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, dehydration, duration of diarrhoea, duration of vomiting, and treatment (rehydration and hospitalization) <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. While evaluation of the first six parameters would appear to be objective, evaluation of the treatment parameter can vary greatly among health care providers. In our study, in which we were very cautious with respect to participant safety, we instituted oral rehydration therapy immediately at the onset of diarrhoea, a practice that may have influenced the course of the episode and thus lowered the potential score. Also, hospitalization and intravenous rehydration may have happened in some non-severe cases which might have inflated scores resulting in reduced vaccine efficacy for SRVGE. To avoid the potential biases introduced by these practices in the future, there is a need for more objective ways to assess disease severity in GE clinical trials, especially before interventions are started.</p><p>BRV-PV consists of G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 serotypes, and our study found that G1, G2, G3, G9, and G12 were responsible for about 90% of the SRVGE in the study population, indicating that the vaccine can induce broad protection. This finding is important for potential use of the vaccine globally.</p><p>The BRV-PV was well tolerated when given together with DTP-HB-Hib and oral polio vaccines. The incidence of immediate solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and deaths were similarly distributed in both the groups. The incidence of irritability was higher in the vaccine group, though this may be an incidental finding.</p><p>The only SAEs for which the vaccine was assessed by site investigators as causally related to study products were 12 cases of gastroenteritis that occurred within 7&#x000a0;days post-vaccination. Of these, 7 were in the BRV-PV group and 5 were in the placebo group. Incidentally, of these 12, only one tested positive while 11 tested negative for rotavirus antigen in stool by ELISA, thus making it unlikely that the illnesses were caused by the vaccine. Genotyping analysis of the single rotavirus positive case revealed it not to be the vaccine strain.</p><p>In some settings, post-marketing surveillance of the currently available rotavirus vaccines has detected a small increased risk of intussusception of about 1&#x02013;2/100,000 infants vaccinated <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In our study, no cases of intussusception occurred within 28&#x000a0;days of vaccinations. The incidence was also similar in BRV-PV and placebo groups.

However, at the time of study launch, no licensed rotavirus vaccines that had undergone efficacy testing in India were available, and rotavirus vaccines were not yet a part of the routine immunization programme. Moreover, we maintained a high safety network in the study to ensure prompt and free treatment in case of any medical events.
