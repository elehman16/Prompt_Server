However, the benefit profiles of rhTM have not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to explore whether patients with greater disease severity, determined according to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, would experience treatment benefit from rhTM administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a <italic>post hoc</italic>, subgroup analysis of a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in three Japanese tertiary referral hospitals. Patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) who required ventilator management were included. We stratified patients into several strata according to disease severity, determined by APACHE II and SOFA scores, using classification and regression trees for survival data. Intervention effects, expressed as hazard ratios (HR), were analyzed using Cox regression analysis adjusted for a propensity model to detect subgroup heterogeneity of the effects of rhTM on in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants were 162 patients with sepsis-induced DIC; 68 of these patients received rhTM and 94 did not. After adjusting for imbalances, rhTM administration was significantly associated with reduced mortality in high-risk patients (APACHE II: 24 to 29; HR: 0.281; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.093 to 0.850; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025).

Anticoagulant therapies are therefore expected to be beneficial in the treatment of severe sepsis. Numerous large clinical trials using anticoagulant agents, such as recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], tissue factor pathway inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and antithrombin (AT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have been conducted over the past 10&#x000a0;years to evaluate mortality benefit for patients with severe sepsis. While these trials failed to reduce 28-day mortality for all patients with severe sepsis, some subgroup analyses have been conducted to identify patient groups who could benefit from anticoagulant therapy. Consequently, anticoagulant therapies might only be effective for patients with severe sepsis involving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and high risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Thrombomodulin is a thrombin receptor present on the endothelial cell surface and plays an important role in the regulation of intravascular coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) is widely used in the treatment of DIC in Japan. In a previous study, we demonstrated that rhTM may have a significant beneficial effect on mortality in mechanically ventilated adult patients with sepsis-induced DIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, the safety and efficacy of rhTM was demonstrated, with promising evidence of efficacy, in a phase IIb randomized controlled trial and is currently under evaluation in a phase III trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While the subgroup analysis of the phase IIb trial suggested that patients with respiratory or cardiac dysfunction and coagulopathy characterized by prothrombin time&#x02013;International Normalized Ratios &#x0003e;1.4 at baseline could benefit from rhTM administration, the benefit profiles have not been thoroughly elucidated.</p><p>This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of rhTM treatment in sepsis-induced DIC according to disease severity defined by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>This investigation was a <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analysis of a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in three Japanese tertiary referral hospitals between January 2006 and June 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were as follows: infection known or suspected on the basis of clinical data at study entry, two or more signs of systemic inflammation with the presence of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, hematologic dysfunction (platelet count &#x0003c;80,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), and the need for mechanical ventilation to stabilize the patient&#x02019;s general condition. All patients fulfilled the criteria for the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The exclusion criteria were as follows: fatal or life-threatening bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary); history of cerebrovascular disorder (cerebral bleeding or infarction) within 1&#x000a0;year; age &#x02264;15&#x000a0;years; history of hypersensitivity to protein preparations or unfractionated heparin; pregnancy or breastfeeding; and fulminant hepatitis, decompensated liver cirrhosis, or other serious liver disorder.</p><p>Participants were 162 patients with sepsis-induced DIC who were categorized into one of two groups: the rhTM group, comprising 68 patients who received rhTM; or the control group, comprising 94 patients who received no rhTM. In our retrospective study, there was no predefined protocol regarding definite indications for rhTM treatment. For patients with severe sepsis fulfilling the criteria for DIC, rhTM was used at the discretion of the attending physician. In the rhTM group, rhTM was mainly administered intravenously at a dose of 0.06&#x000a0;mg/kg/day, and infusion continued for 6&#x000a0;days. All patients were treated according to the strategy described in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We did not administer rhAPC to either group, because it had not been approved for the treatment of severe sepsis in Japan.</p><p>This study followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Osaka General Medical Center, and the board waived the need for informed consent for retrospective studies such as this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Baseline characteristics, including demographic information and data concerning preexisting conditions, organ function/failure, infection, and pertinent medications, were recorded. The variables used to assess comparability between the two groups were age, sex, APACHE II score, SOFA score, number of dysfunctional organs, infection site, and positive blood culture rate.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. We also recorded complications including the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respiratory tract hemorrhage, and minor transfusions. Minor transfusion was defined as the administration of 4 units of red blood cells or more within two consecutive days for up to 14&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify a subset of patients with high benefit profiles for rhTM treatment. Classification and regression trees for survival data (survival CART) were used to classify patients according to disease severity determined by APACHE II, SOFA, and JAAM DIC scores. Survival CART analysis for APACHE II scores revealed that the first split point at which to partition mortality risk for patients without rhTM treatment was an APACHE II score of 30, and the second split points were APACHE II scores of 24 for all subsets of patients (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The intervention effects of rhTM treatment were therefore estimated in three subsets.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The propensity score for receiving rhTM was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and included 15 independent variables, as described in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], comprising age, sex, illness severity (APACHE II score, SOFA score, number of dysfunctional organs, and positive blood culture), JAAM DIC score, respiratory dysfunction, time from severe sepsis onset to study entry (defined according to a 48-hour cutoff point), a past medical history of severe conditions (diabetes mellitus and immunosuppressive therapy), source of infection, and therapeutic interventions (heparin administration, AT administration, or emergency operations).

The results of this study provide evidence that rhTM improved mortality in a high-risk subset (APACHE II score&#x02009;=&#x02009;24 to 29) of patients with sepsis-induced DIC. The current analysis also indicates that patients in the moderate-risk subset (APACHE II score &#x0003c;24) may not have benefited from rhTM administration. Similar tendencies, with respect to mortality benefit, have been evaluated in analyses of other anticoagulant therapies. The subgroup analysis of the Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis trial suggested increasing absolute and relative risk reduction in rhAPC treatment with greater risk of death, using higher APACHE II scores (&#x02265;25) and greater incidence of organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, AT treatment improved mortality in patients with severe sepsis and a predicted mortality of 30 to 60% in the KyberSept trial subgroup analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These previous analyses suggest that anticoagulant therapies may only be effective for patients with severe sepsis involving a high risk of death.</p><p>Why are anticoagulant therapies for severe sepsis only effective for patients with a high risk of death? Generally, it is difficult to determine the survival benefit of a particular lifesaving therapy in a set of patients with a low risk of mortality. This may be one of the reasons why rhTM administration does not reduce the mortality risk in patients who are not at high risk in the first place. On the other hand, these results are congruent with recent pathophysiological findings concerning the innate immune response. Under certain circumstances, thrombosis is considered to play a major physiological role, which is specifically named immunothrombosis, in immune defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, aberrant or uncontrolled activation of immunothrombosis is likely to constitute a key event in the development of thrombotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In patients in the moderate-risk subset, rhTM could have inhibited host-defensive thrombosis, which helps to capture and ensnare pathogens circulating in the blood, and therefore failed to improve mortality. In contrast, immunothrombosis could have been aberrantly activated and proved detrimental to the host in patients in the high-risk and very-high-risk subsets, which may have improved mortality.</p><p>Although several DIC criteria have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], whether one criterion performs better than others in detecting patients who require anticoagulant therapies has not been elucidated. In a double-blind randomized controlled phase IIb study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], mortality benefit was not observed in patients with ISTH overt DIC. In addition, in the current analysis there was no statistically significant correlation between ISTH DIC scores and mortality; however, mortality benefit was observed with rhTM in DIC patients with JAAM DIC scores of 8.</p><p>Bleeding was the most significant adverse event associated with rhTM administration, as well as other anticoagulant agents. Indeed, there were more bleeding events with activated protein C and AT relative to a placebo in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Rates of bleeding events were reassessed with respect to illness severity based on APACHE II scores, and there was no increase in bleeding-related adverse events in illness of any severity. However, the subsets were too small to allow observation of adverse effects.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations to our study, which were mentioned in the original paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The study was not a randomized controlled trial. The relatively long time span of the study could have been associated with the introduction of therapeutic measures that influenced the outcome independently of rhTM. With the study being retrospective, the treatment intervention being examined was not standardized (for example, dose and durations of rhTM administration), and the baseline characteristics were different between the two groups. In the present study, we developed a propensity score approach to cope with the nonrandomization. The combination of these limitations might cause multiple unmeasured variables to account for the outcome differences observed in this study. Also, as this study involved subgroup analysis, we cannot deny the potential of accidental false positive results. Some interventions against sepsis such as rhAPC failed to show a mortality benefit in subsequent large randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although the patients were highly selected according to the positive data of subgroup analysis in previous trials. The study was also prone to false negative results due to inadequate power with which to uncover treatment effect differences, even in the presence of true treatment-effect modification. Further multicenter prospective randomized trials are required to evaluate efficacy and safety distinctly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We observed a survival benefit with rhTM treatment in sepsis-induced DIC patients with baseline APACHE II scores &#x02265;24 or SOFA scores &#x02265;11.
