Laryngoscopy and intubation causes exaggerated haemodynamic responses and monitoring indices, such as the bispectral index (BIS)[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and auditory evoked potential index,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have shown these patients to be in lighter planes of anaesthesia. Potential benefit can be obtained by the addition of an agent that could enhance analgesia and amnesia without adverse effects on the mother or foetus. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose ketamine, used as an adjunct analgesic and amnesic, in attenuating the haemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy, intubation and surgery during caesarean section under general anaesthesia (GA). The occurrence of awareness based on clinical signs and the foetal outcome were also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective, double blinded, randomised study was conducted from October 2012 to June 2015. Following approval from Hospital Ethical Committee, 40 consenting patients aged 18&#x02013;45 years, with &#x0003e;36 weeks gestation, posted for elective caesarean section, who were not willing for regional anaesthesia, were studied. Exclusion criteria comprised of presence of maternal co-morbidities, foetal distress and patient refusal. The patients were randomly allotted to two groups by computer generated random sequence of numbers.</p><p>Following a thorough pre-anaesthetic evaluation, the patients were kept fasting for 8 h. The patients were premedicated with metoclopramide 10 mg and ranitidine 150 mg on the night prior to and on the morning of surgery. On arrival in the operation theatre, an 18 g cannula was inserted and lactated Ringer's solution was started and a wedge was kept under the right buttock. Pulse-oximeter, electrocardiogram and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitors were attached, and the abdomen was cleaned and draped.</p><p>Following 3 min pre-oxygenation, the study group (Group K) received 0.25 mg/kg body weight ketamine diluted to 5 ml, whereas the control group (Group C) received 5 ml normal saline intravenously (IV) just before induction of anaesthesia. All patients underwent rapid sequence induction with thiopentone 5 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 2 mg/kg and were intubated with 6.5 or 7 mm cuffed endotracheal tube. After confirming correct tracheal placement of the tube, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was given IV, and patients were ventilated with oxygen and nitrous oxide mixture (40:60%) with 0.7% endtidal isoflurane maintaining normocarbia and normoxia. Following delivery of the baby, fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;/kg and midazolam 2 mg were given IV and oxytocin 20 units in 500 ml Ringer lactate was started as an infusion.</p><p>Heart rate (HR), systolic and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were documented just before induction (baseline), then at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 45 min after induction of anaesthesia. Patients were intubated immediately, following documentation of the haemodynamic parameters at 1 min after induction. Apgar score at 1 and 5 min after delivery were also documented. Gas analysis of umbilical vein blood was done and partial pressure of oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH were noted. Time taken from skin incision to delivery of the baby and time from uterine incision to delivery of the baby were also noted. Intraoperative lacrimation, if any, was noted.</p><p>Based on results of the previous study by Baraka <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] on the changes in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) (114 &#x000b1; 9.0 vs. 127 &#x000b1; 14), with 95% confidence and 90% power, minimum sample size was calculated to be 17 in each group to get statistically significant results. We used Mann&#x02013;Whitney test to compare the demographics, HR, blood pressure, umbilical vein pH, pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, skin incision to delivery time, uterine incision to delivery time and the Apgar score between Group C and Group K. Fisher's exact test was applied to find the association of intraoperative lacrimation and hallucinations.

However, regional anaesthesia remains the preferred choice in obstetric practice on account of its well established maternal and foetal benefits.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The major indications for GA are foetal distress, abruption, eclampsia, uterine rupture and a prolonged and obstructed labour. Maternal refusal of regional techniques, inadequate regional block, or any contraindication for regional techniques such as coagulopathies or the presence of local infection may however necessitate administration of GA. The major concerns include difficulty in intubation, increased risk of aspiration, increased blood loss intraoperatively and development of awareness during anaesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Though GA is associated with a higher blood loss as compared to neuraxial anaesthesia, it is considered to be of uncertain clinical relevance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Apart from the added risks associated with physiological changes of pregnancy, the need to withhold sedatives and opioids until delivery of the baby to avoid foetal depression further complicates the management of GA for caesarean section. Exaggerated haemodynamic responses are commonly observed at laryngoscopy, intubation and initial stages of surgery as the depth of anaesthesia will be less compared to other routine surgeries under GA.</p><p>The incidence of intraoperative awareness is more during caesarean sections under GA.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Ensuring an end-tidal concentration of volatile agent &#x0003e;0.8 MAC makes awareness unlikely.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, the lack of availability of advanced respiratory gas monitors in many hospitals makes the accurate titration of the volatile agent concentration difficult. While the administration of high concentrations of volatile agents can result in postpartum haemorrhage, low concentrations result in exaggerated stress responses and awareness. The overwhelming concerns towards foetal well-being results in a tendency to use lower concentrations of volatile agents. This along with the practice of withholding opioids and benzodiazepines until foetal delivery could result in inadequate analgesia.</p><p>Quite often the only analgesic provided to these patients until the delivery of the baby is nitrous oxide alone, which is a poor analgesic. Along with a decrease in the volatile agents and analgesics, a higher oxygen concentration (Fi0<sub>2</sub> 0.5) is often used even though there is no rationale for an inspired oxygen concentration above 0.33 in the absence of foetal compromise.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This practice further reduces the analgesic effects of nitrous oxide. In the presence of foetal distress, even higher inspired concentrations of oxygen may be used.</p><p>In the present study, we used 0.7% isoflurane with 40% nitrous oxide in oxygen for maintenance of anaesthesia till delivery following the existing practice at our institute. We also aimed to assess the efficacy of our practice. We believed that an adequate depth of anaesthesia would be ensured with this concentration as it had been shown that use of 0.7% endtidal isoflurane along with 60% nitrous oxide provided one MAC in the age group of 20&#x02013;30 years.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Assessing depth of anaesthesia is challenging as clinical signs are unreliable and not specific. The clinical signs signalling development of awareness are mainly signs due to sympathetic stimulation. Intraoperative hypertension, tachycardia, lacrimation, sweating, coughing and patient movements could indicate development of awareness. BIS monitoring has been proven to be effective for monitoring depth of anaesthesia and scores &#x0003c;60 has been recommended to prevent the occurrence of awareness.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, its availability and cost[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] limit its routine use.</p><p>As caesarean section is a commonly performed surgery, which is being performed even in hospitals with minimum monitors, BIS or auditory evoked potential index monitoring or even endtidal inhalation agent monitoring may not be available. Hence, a practical approach to minimize the problems of inadequate analgesia and awareness in these circumstances will be the use of analgesics with amnesic properties, with proven maternal and neonatal safety, from the beginning of surgery itself.</p><p>Ketamine is a time tested drug which provides good analgesia and amnesia. However, use of ketamine as a sole induction agent in caesarean section is not recommended as it causes significant maternal haemodynamic changes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, doses &#x0003e;1 mg/kg can theoretically increase uterine tone and jeopardise foetal circulation. However, these disadvantages could be overcome by careful dosing and by combining it with other drugs. It was shown that addition of a small dose of ketamine to thiopentone for induction provided reduced analgesic requirement without side effects and was found not to affect maternal or foetal well-being.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>It has been shown that ketamine when given along with propofol can reduce the hypotensive effects of propofol.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Used as an adjunct in doses of 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, ketamine had resulted in comparable maternal intraoperative haemodynamic parameters, Apgar scores and post-operative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A single bolus dose of ketamine was found to decrease post-operative opioid requirements, and adverse effects were not increased with low-dose ketamine. Hence, low-dose ketamine has been recommended as a safe and useful adjuvant to standard practice opioid-analgesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The advantage of using lower doses of ketamine is that the incidence of adverse effects can be reduced. Prophylactic IV ketamine 0.25 mg/kg was found to be effective in preventing intraoperative shivering during caesarean sections under subarachnoid block.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In our study, patients were intubated immediately after documenting the haemodynamic parameters at 1 min following induction. Therefore, the haemodynamic parameters recorded at this point did not reflect the intubation response. In fact, the haemodynamic parameters recorded following laryngoscopy and intubation actually correspond to the values recorded at 3 min after induction and later. The time interval for NIBP measurements was set at 2 min in the initial period so as to minimise distraction of the anaesthesiologist. Hence, the haemodynamic parameters immediately following intubation were not recorded. The blunted haemodynamic responses observed from 3 min onwards extending throughout the study period indicate that ketamine 0.25 mg/kg effectively attenuated the stress response to laryngoscopy, intubation and surgery. This could be attributed to the additional analgesia and/or amnesia provided by ketamine.</p><p>The umbilical vein blood gas analysis and Apgar score reflect adequacy of the uteroplacental circulation. Better Apgar scores observed in ketamine group at 1 min in our study could be because of the attenuated stress response to laryngoscopy, intubation and surgery. As the sympathetic stimulation was less intense in this group, it could have resulted in lower plasma catecholamine levels, less vasoconstriction and normal placental perfusion. Though statistically insignificant, the higher mean PO<sub>2</sub> and lower mean PCO<sub>2</sub> observed in the ketamine group support this [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>The main disadvantage of our study was that our observations were linked to the clinical signs for detection of the development of awareness. Though intraoperative lacrimation/tachycardia/hypertension could reflect development of awareness, these signs are not specific. The availability of BIS monitoring would have provided more reliable information on the depth of anaesthesia. However, the addition of low dose ketamine to the general anaesthetic regimen can still be considered for reducing the occurrence of intraoperative awareness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>IV ketamine 0.25 mg/kg, when used as an adjunct analgesic and amnesic, attenuates the haemodynamic responses during caesarean section under GA without affecting the foetal outcome.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hadavi</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Allahyary</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Asadi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of the adequacy of general anesthesia in cesarean section by bispectral index</article-title><source>Iran J Med Sci</source><year>2013</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>240</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24174695</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allahyary</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zand</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Tabatabaee</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of the adequacy of general anesthesia in cesarean section by auditory evoked potential index: An observational study</article-title><source>Acta Anaesthesiol Taiwan</source><year>2008</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>16</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18390396</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baraka</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Louis</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalleh</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Maternal awareness and neonatal outcome after ketamine induction of anaesthesia for caesarean section</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>1990</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>641</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2208534</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonnet</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruy&#x000e8;re</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Moufouki</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>De la Dorie</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Benhamou</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anaesthesia, a cause of fetal distress?</article-title><source>Ann Fr Anesth Reanim</source><year>2007</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>694</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17572048</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McGlennan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mustafa</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>General anaesthesia for Caesarean section</article-title><source>Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care Pain</source><year>2009</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>148</fpage><lpage>51</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heesen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofmann</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kl&#x000f6;hr</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossaint</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>van de Velde</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Deprest</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Is general anaesthesia for caesarean section associated with postpartum haemorrhage?
