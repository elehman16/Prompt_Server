It is found in about 25% of the normal population. The main symptoms of this syndrome are headaches, an impaired nasal breathing and hyposmia. Headache is the most common symptom, and it may occur due to a contact between a CB and other structures of the nasal cavity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The incidence is increased in sinonasal patients, for example, an incidence of the co-existence of nasal septal deviation and CB has been reported in 44.6% of the patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In another study, an incidence of CB was found in 47 out of 100 Chinese with chronic sinusitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>From 100 Caucasian patients that had undergone a paranasal sinuses CT examination, 29% of them were affected by <italic>concha bullosa</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Unilateral or bilateral CB was found in 53% of the sinusitis patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In CT scans of the paranasal sinuses, CB was present in 34% of the patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Of 320 patients evaluated for sinus disease with coronal CT, 34% of them had CB on at least one side.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In computed tomographic scans from the patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms, the CB was present in 35% of the patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] CB is more frequent in females compared to males. There was no significant relationship between the presence of CB and an ethnicity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Contact point headaches are one of the sub-groups of rhinogenic headaches. Dr. Commas (1960) was one of the pioneers, who described the rhinogenic headache.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] It has been suggested that contact point can trigger headache in individuals with migraine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In patients with primary headaches, the contact points may be refractory to the treatment. Contact point headaches and migraine without aura have similar symptoms (photophobia, nausea and vomiting, pulsating nature). Contact point headaches should be considered in these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists play an important role in diagnosis of the headaches, such as mucosal contact point headache.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] According to the location of pneumatization of middle concha, CB may be classified as lamellar, bulbous, and extensive types, but there is no significant relationship between the CB types and the sinus disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The most common type of the CB is middle turbinate pneumatization; however, superior and inferior turbinate pneumatizations have also been rarely reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In 74% of the patients, contact point headaches feel in periorbital region.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The criterions for the diagnosis of a rhinogenic source of the headache or facial pain are as follows:</p><p>Headaches are not related to sinus problems such as polyps, sinusitis, tumors and foreign bodies, and the nasal cavity is considered as normal in routine examinations. Headaches are associated with an evidence of contact point by nasal endoscopy and/or CT imaging. During headache, an application of local anesthesia and local decongestants to this contact points will relieve the headache in 5 minutes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>As reported in the classical work of Wolff (1948), the middle turbinate and the nasal septum is innervated by an anterior ethmoidal nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve; stimulation of these regions causes pain in the medial canthus of the supraorbital region. Periorbital pain may be due to middle turbinate compression against the septum or the lateral wall of the nose, and it leads to the congestion of the nasal mucosa or pneumatization of the middle turbinate. The diagnosis of middle turbinate headache syndrome is made by exclusion and requires a high index of suspicion, anterior rhinoscopy, computerized tomography (CT), and confirmation by the Lidocaine test.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Mucosal contact points between two mucosal surfaces result in stimulating of the C fibers that transmit an orthodromic impulse by triggering substance P (SP). Released SP induces vasodilation, hypersecretion, spasm of smooth muscles and extravasations of plasma from vessels. Antidromic release of SP is responsible for mucosal swelling during headache in the same side and the opposite side of the lesion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Modulation of pain transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) may also occur via an action of Enkefalin (EK). These physiologic sequences, in turn, are responsible for the subjective experience of pain in periorbital or frontal region. Rhinogenic headaches may be treated by surgical or medical interventions. Corticosteroid spray and decongestants are used in medical treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Pneumatization (CB) or hypertrophy of the middle turbinate can result in its contact with the septum or the lateral nasal wall and may cause headaches in the periorbital region. The treatment is by relieving the contact point by surgical or medical options.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Various methods of endoscopic surgery are used in treatment of these types of headaches for many years. Endoscopic turbinoplasty methods for CB included, removing the lateral wall of the CB, removing fronto-inferior part of CB, and turbinoplasty.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>An aim of this study was to evaluate an efficacy and the possible priority of surgical intervention in relieving the contact point headaches induced by CB, in contrast with medical treatment in two isolated, identical groups simultaneously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized double blind clinical trial study was conducted between 2008 and 2009 in otolaryngology, eye and neurologic clinics of Mustafa Khomeini hospital Tehran, Iran.</p><p>We received the registration number (ACTRN12608000560392) after designing the study protocol.</p><p>Authors indicate that, the study design followed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

</p><p>According to these criterions, 8 out of 52 patients, were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria (4 cases), declined to participate (2 cases), or did not complete the follow-up study (2 cases). Finally, out of 46 patients, 44 (19 male, and 25 female) cases were completed the study in 2 groups of 22 patients for each surgical or medical intervention. All the patients were completely examined by an otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, neurologist, dentist, and an internist. Coronal computerized tomography (CT) of the nasal cavity (with 3 mm cuts) was performed for all patients. In surgical group (23 patients), turbinoplasty was performed. A sagital incision was made along an anterior surface of the middle turbinate, and then the contents within the middle turbinate including internal mucosa were removed by a straight forceps. It was important to remove all the mucosal contents from within the cells. The next step was to approximate the lateral and medial surfaces of middle concha. Therefore, in addition to splitting the contact points between two external sides of the mucosal surfaces, the middle concha becomes smaller. Turbinoplasty results in a significant reduction of large middle turbinate bullosa. This is a simple endoscopic procedure with short operative time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>Medical group (23 patients) received 3 courses of 1.5 months treatment with Fluticason nasal spray 125 &#x003bc;g per puff (2 puffs Q 24 hours in each nasal cavity) and 30 mg Pseudoephedrin tablets Q 8 hours. In order to decrease the adverse effects of the medications, the treatments were discontinued for a period of 2 weeks, just before the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> section of the treatment. 2 additional patients (1 patient in each group) were excluded due to irregular post-intervention visits and incomplete follow-up information.

After preliminary training of all the patients, severities of headaches were measured in each group by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before treatment, and at 1.5, 3 and 6 months after institution of treatment. Comparison of gender between the study groups was done with Chi-square test. Age and disease duration was compared with independent t-test. Changes in duration, frequency and severity of headaches during the follow-up were evaluated by Friedman test, separately in surgical and medical groups. Comparison of the headache factors between the surgical and medical groups was assessed with Mann-Whitney test. Analysis was done via SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, ILL), and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in gender (<italic>P</italic> = 0.761), age (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0.976) and chronicity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.980) between the 2 groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Moreover, this test revealed that the frequencies and durations of the headaches in surgical group were significantly different from the medical group only at 6 months from the beginning of the treatment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027 and 0.008, respectively) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, rows]. Severity of the headaches was the first character that responded to the treatment followed by the frequency and the duration of the diseases. No significant side effects were encountered in each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study showed that turbinoplasty in chonca bullusa patients is an acceptable and simple procedure for relieving of pain in rhinogenic headaches. In the study of Chow (1991-1992), 18 patients were enrolled, including: 12 cases with septal deviation and septal spur, 3 cases with sinus retention cyst, 2 cases with mucosal contact point pain, and 1 case with dehiscent infra-orbital wall. The patients were managed by surgical and medical interventions with a rate of 83% well-being.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The causes of the headaches varied more than the present study, and no comparison was made between the surgical and medical groups. In another retrospective review study by Parsons <italic>et al</italic>., conducted on on 15 children (6 to 15 years) and 19 adults (28 to 63 years) who were treated with surgical intervention, the causes of the headaches were large middle concha, large uncinate process, nasal spur, and double middle turbinate. The surgical intervention was done as directive endoscopic procedure on the lesion. The well-being symptoms were seen in 87% of the children and 84% of the adults. The follow-up time was 4.5 to 30 months. The severity of the pain was measured by questioner method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In present study, the surgical procedure was done only on the middle CB, and the pain was measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) compared with control medical group. In the study of Nselmo (1997), 5 cases with middle turbinate headache syndrome, septal deviation and CB were presented. Of them, 4 were treated surgically by partial middle turbinectomy and septoplasty, with excellent results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] But, Har <italic>el</italic> and Slavit DH (1996) suggested that, the partial middle turbinectomy, especially with simultaneous uncinectomy and ethmoidectomy, increased the risk of an adhesion formation in middle meatus, while, turbinoplasty results in a significant reduction in the width of the middle turbinate without any damages to the mucosal surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Turbinoplasty technique was also used in the present study. In a similar study done by Ramadan HH (1999), 23 individuals with CB and hypertrophic concha and mucosal contact points were observed. Surgical intervention was undertaken for 15 cases, and the medical treatment was considered for the other 8 cases; the results were compared to each other after 23 months. Nearly 60% of those who had surgery, reported marked relief of their headaches.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>The compared groups were not equal, and the patients had the middle CB and hyperthrophic concha; however, in the present study, the 2 groups were equal, and they just had the middle CB. Also, the methods of analysis and the details of the headaches characteristics are not identical. In the study of Giacomini P.G (2003), 34 patients with contact point headache that did not respond to the medical therapy, were analyzed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) after septoplasty, rhinoseptoplasty, and middle turbinate electro-cauterization. In 25% of the cases, the pain relapsed up to 1 year post-operatively, and the surgical results were superior to conservative nasal therapy treatment in the same group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] In the study of Mohebbi A <italic>et al</italic>. on 36 patients with chronic headaches who had not previously responded to conventional treatments, the intensity of the headaches, pre- and post-operatively, were compared by utilizing the VAS. The overall success rate approximated 83% after surgery. Surgery in specific cases of headaches with more positive evidence of contact point could be successful, particularly if medical therapy has failed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Although in present study, the headache severity has been analyzed by the VAS, the studied groups and the study design were different. Kunachak S (2002) introduced the middle turbinate lateralization as a safe and effective method in eliminating the symptoms of rhinologic cephalgia, induced by contact point between the middle turbinate and the nasal septum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] While in present study, de-bulking of the CB was the preferred surgical method. Also, Mariotti LJ <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that, endoscopic sinus surgery in rhinogenic headache was widely successful on their patients, and 28 (84.8%) of 33 patients had reported an improvement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] As an important difference with the others, in this study, the characteristics of the headaches were evaluated by an examiner, who was unaware of the patients&#x02019; treatment plans. Some patients with refractory headaches and endo-nasal contact areas benefit from the surgery, thereby supporting an existence of a correlation between the two entities. Even though it is clear that surgery should be considered only if all other treatments have failed, a success rate of 65% over almost 10 years justifies an importance of this option. Pre-operative patient selection remains crucial and warrants further investigation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Sinus headache (headache of rhinogenic origin) and migraine are frequently confused with each other. Considerable research and clinical study are needed to further understand the role of the nasal pathology and autonomic activation in migraine and rhinogenic headaches.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In rhinogenic headache patients, simple surgical de-bulking of the CB in order to eliminate the contact points between the nasal mucosal surfaces is superior and cost-benefit method to medical management.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Yarmohammadi ME carried out the frame work, co-ordination of the study and clinical examinations; Ghasemi H, participated in most of the experiments, patients evaluations and prepared the manuscript as the corresponding author; Pourfarzam S, provided assistance as an unaware examiner of the patients in the study; Jalali Nadoushan MR, provided assistance for the study design; Majd SA, participated in patients clinical examinations and referral of the patients.
