Over time, the tissue lining the vagina becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic, resulting in vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA; also known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> VVA is generally accompanied by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and vaginal pain or bleeding associated with sexual activity<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>; however, early, sustained treatment can preclude irreversible declines in vaginal health.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Up to 32 million women in the United States currently are suffering from symptoms of VVA,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and more than 85% of this population currently receives no prescription therapy for the condition.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Effective treatments designed to help relieve the pain and discomfort associated with VVA symptoms will improve the quality of life for many women.</p><p>The North American Menopause Society and the International Menopause Society recommend local vaginal estrogens when menopausal symptoms are limited to VVA.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Despite the relative safety and efficacy of local vaginal treatments, consumers remain dissatisfied with the currently available local treatment options.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Vaginal creams approved in the 1980s are antiquated. They require an applicator, can be unsanitary and inconvenient for women to apply, and dosing can be complicated and confusing.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The creams can be messy and cause excessive discharge, leading some women to alternatively choose vaginal tablets or rings.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Vaginal tablets currently on the market, however, can be difficult to use, may not fully dissolve for days, and may be inconvenient, in addition to concerns of overall treatment efficacy. Likewise, the vaginal ring may be difficult to insert and remove,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> may change position or dislodge,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and has been shown to release an initial burst of systemic estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>A new softgel vaginal capsule (VagiCap) that contains solubilized 17&#x003b2;-E<sub>2</sub>, known as TX-004HR (TherapeuticsMD, Inc, Boca Raton, FL), was designed to treat moderate-to-severe symptoms of VVA in postmenopausal women. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated lower systemic estrogen exposure with TX-004HR as compared with equivalent doses of the vaginal E<sub>2</sub> tablet (Vagifem, Novo Nordisk, Plainsboro, NJ).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This lower systemic exposure of E<sub>2</sub> supports the call of the Working Group on Women's Health and Well-Being in Menopause to modify the boxed warning on labels and package inserts for low-dose vaginal estrogen.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The warning included in the black box on low-dose vaginal estrogens is based on extrapolations from trials of systemic estrogen or combination estrogen-progestin hormone preparations.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The Working Group proposes to distinguish that the relevance of findings of risks associated with systemic estrogen administration is not applicable to low-dose vaginal estrogen preparations.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This clarity is likely to increase use and compliance, resulting in substantial vaginal health benefits to a broader population.</p><p>If approved, TX-004HR, as a vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsule, would fill an unmet need for a more user-friendly, modern product, considering that most of the available products were approved more than 20 years ago. TX-004HR is expected to provide improved ease of vaginal administration without the need of an applicator and minimize vaginal discharge after administration. TX-004HR may also provide a more effective dosage form with improved efficacy, early onset of action, and patient compliance, as well as lower systemic estrogen levels than currently available products. The phase 3 REJOICE trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsules at 4, 10, and 25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g doses in the United States and Canada.</p><p>The overall objective of this phase 2 pilot study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 10-&#x003bc;g TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsules, when compared with placebo, as a treatment for postmenopausal women suffering from moderate-to-severe symptoms of VVA.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and drug administration</title><p>In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 pilot trial, eligible women were randomized 1:1 to either 10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsules or matching placebo vaginal softgel capsules (TherapeuticsMD) administered intravaginally once-daily for 14 days. A reproducible, computer-generated block randomization schedule (produced in SAS v. 9.1.3, PLAN procedure) was used to randomize the women to the study groups. Biostudy Solutions, LLC generated the assignment codes, which were locked in a room with restricted access. The packaging, labeling, appearance, and route of administration of TX-004HR and placebo were identical, and all persons participating in the study were blinded to the treatment each woman received. The blind was maintained until study completion.</p><p>On day 1, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed VVA symptoms and specified their most bothersome symptom (MBS), and the investigator assessed the appearance of the vaginal mucosa (secretions, color, epithelial integrity, and epithelial surface thickness; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Women self-administered their first dose of study medication at the clinical site under supervision, and capsule disintegration was assessed after 6 hours. During screening, vaginal smears were collected to evaluate vaginal pH and cytology (vaginal maturation index [VMI]). Participants were provided with a diary and instructed to record dosing dates and times for the 2-week study period. On day 15, VVA symptoms (participant assessment via questionnaire), vaginal mucosa, cytology, pH, and capsule disintegration (investigator assessment) were evaluated.

In addition, treatment with TX-004HR was safe and well tolerated when administered intravaginally once daily for 14 days. Also, as demonstrated in phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies, systemic estrogen levels with TX-004HR were two to three times lower than with an approved vaginal E<sub>2</sub> tablet at equivalent doses.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Thus, this new vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsule is effective at treating the signs of VVA with low systemic estrogen levels. Furthermore, the results of a survey of the women participating in this study indicate that the majority of women thought the capsule was easy to use, were satisfied with the product, and would consider using the treatment again.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The significant improvements in the signs of VVA that this study found with the TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsule were clinically meaningful. The efficacy observed with TX-004HR at week 2 with objective markers (ie, changes in VMI) in our study seems to be superior to historical data reported with the vaginal E<sub>2</sub> tablet at the same dose (10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g E<sub>2</sub>). In a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind study (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;309), improvements were observed from baseline after 2 weeks of daily administration of a 10-&#x003bc;g E<sub>2</sub> tablet that were significantly better than with placebo. The increase in the percentage of superficial cells at 2 weeks was significantly greater than placebo, but was less than the improvement seen in this study in which superficial cells increased to 37% after 2 weeks of treatment.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The significant improvements seen in our pilot phase 2 study in all components of the VMI, in pH, and in observations of vaginal epithelial integrity and secretions are an important indication of potential improvements in symptoms of VVA. The VMI and pH are the most useful objective markers of vaginal atrophy due to estrogen decline.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Visual assessments of the vaginal mucosa have been shown to correlate with the objective measures and, thus, are an additional validation of the diagnosis of VVA and of the monitoring of effects of treatment on VVA.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Significant improvements in VMI, pH, and the vaginal examination (vaginal epithelial integrity and vaginal secretions) were observed within 2 weeks. With a longer duration of treatment and follow-up, and a larger sample size, improvements in the vaginal MBS would be expected to follow.</p><p>No major or unexpected safety concerns were observed with TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsule treatment during the study period. This is consistent with the favorable safety profiles of other low-dose vaginal estrogen therapies that have been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The testing of the safety and efficacy of TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsules is currently being expanded in the phase 3 REJOICE trial. Three doses are being tested (25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g, 10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g, and an ultra-low-dose of 4&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g) with additional outcome measures. Primary outcome measures include change from baseline in VMI, vaginal pH, and the severity of dyspareunia as MBS after 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include change from baseline in the severity of vaginal dryness and vaginal burning; appearance of the vaginal mucosa at 2, 6, 8, and 12 weeks; change from baseline in Female Sexual Function Index at 12 weeks; and hormone concentration assessments at pretreatment, day 1, and weeks 2 and 12.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of this study suggest that TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsules are a safe, effective, local, novel treatment option for postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe VVA. Improvements in vaginal cytology and pH from baseline at week 2 were significantly higher with TX-004HR than with placebo. These improvements on vaginal cell physiology seem to be superior to other vaginal therapies based on historical data. The clinical evidence presented here, coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic results showing two to three times lower systemic exposure of E<sub>2</sub> than an approved vaginal E<sub>2</sub> tablet at the same dose, along with positive satisfaction survey results, is promising and has helped to frame the design of a larger phase 3 trial to further evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of TX-004HR. If approved, the TX-004HR vaginal E<sub>2</sub> softgel capsule would provide a new alternative for women with VVA, with better efficacy, earlier onset of action, easier usage, and lower systemic estrogen exposure than currently available options.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Chastity Bradley, PhD, and Jolene Mason, PhD, of Precise Publications for their assistance in the writing of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding/support: TherapeuticsMD sponsored the study and funded the medical writing support provided by Chastity Bradley, PhD, and Jolene Mason, PhD, of Precise Publications, LLC.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial disclosure/conflicts of interest: Dr Pickar was formerly an employee of Wyeth Research; has received consultant fees from Wyeth/Pfizer, Besins Healthcare, Shionogi Inc, Metagenics, and TherapeuticsMD; and has stock options with TherapeuticsMD (but was not paid for his role as an author on this paper).
