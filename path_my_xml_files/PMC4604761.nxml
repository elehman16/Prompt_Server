Online psychotherapeutic interventions have now been trialled in a wide range of mental illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Many of these interventions involve online discussion boards, also known as discussion forums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], to allow users to communicate with other likeminded peers. It is unclear, however, what impact these boards have on the psychosocial outcomes of users. It is even less clear how users interact with discussion boards (discussion engagement), and how this might influence outcomes. There are different types of engagement, with some users actively engaging by contributing new content, while others passively engage through reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are also different levels of this engagement (e.g. low, mid or high), depending on how frequently users engage. To date, there are no published studies analysing the impact of the different types and levels of discussion engagement on psychosocial outcomes in users of discussion boards within online psychotherapeutic interventions. Greater clarity is needed regarding what role discussion boards play within online interventions, what benefits can be gained through discussion board participation, and what level or type of engagement, if any, is required to gain the most benefit from these discussion boards. This paper describes an ongoing study evaluating discussion board engagement and its impact on perceived social support, quality of life, stigma and symptom severity within an online self-help program for bipolar disorder, known as MoodSwings 2.0.<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>

Unlike most other online communication mediums, the use of pseudonyms in online discussion boards is commonplace, which means members cannot personally identify each other. Suler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] suggested this concealment of one&#x02019;s true identity acts as &#x0201c;dissociative anonymity&#x0201d;, where Internet users create an online psyche, separate from their day to day self. This contributes to what has been described as the &#x0201c;online disinhibition effect&#x0201d;, where people feel more open and willing to disclose information about themselves they might ordinarily find embarrassing or stigmatizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Discussion forums also offer asynchronous communication (i.e. users do not have to be online at the same time to communicate), rather than the real-time, instant communication of live chat. This not only gives users the opportunity to take their time in writing out a thought-out response, but also allows time to prepare for others&#x02019; responses. Removing the pressure to hear immediate reactions from others boosts the disinhibition effect. Asynchronous discussion also allows users to disclose information and leave without having to deal with responses from others, which can be particularly comforting for those sharing emotional or personal posts who simply wish to &#x0201c;put it out there&#x0201d; rather than receive feedback from others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>People seek out online discussion forums for a variety of reasons. Townsend, Gearing and Polyanskaya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found a fear of being hospitalised or taking medications, and poor insurance coverage were significant predictors of mental health-related online forum use. These findings suggest people see a greater role for online discussion forums when face-to-face healthcare isn&#x02019;t accessible or is anxiety provoking. People may also seek out discussion boards to expand their social networks. It has also been suggested that online discussion forums open up a much broader social network of similar peers that one would not otherwise have access to offline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This may be particularly appealing to those suffering from a stigmatized illness, such as bipolar disorder, where people can often feel unable or inhibited to discuss their illness with others who do not have personal experience.</p><p>The possible benefits of engagement with online discussion boards include increased social support, a reduced perception of stigma and improved quality of life, which are of central importance to people with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Increased social support</title><p>The term social support refers to the availability of interpersonal resources, and more specifically has been defined as any information that leads an individual to believe they are cared for and loved, esteemed and valued, and/or belong to a network of communication and mutual obligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Social support can be categorised into five key types: informational (providing information or advice), tangible (providing, or offering to provide goods or services), esteem (communicating respect and confidence in abilities), emotional (communicating love, concern or empathy) and social network support (communicating belonging to a group of people with similar experiences) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In bipolar disorder, social support has been identified as a potential protective factor against suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A lack of social support has also been identified as a factor influencing the risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the recurrence of bipolar depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and reduced psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The opportunity to provide social support online could therefore have a significant impact on those living with bipolar disorder.</p><p>A study looking specifically at self-help discussion boards for bipolar disorder found social networking was the major theme of discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with the largest percentage of postings including statements about social networks. These findings suggest that social relationships are seen as important to those with bipolar disorder who are using online forums, suggesting that this may be a perceived role of such forums. Discussion board usage has been linked to an increase in support network size, as well as support network satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that those participating in online discussion are seeking to broaden their social networks, and discussion boards are providing a valuable space to foster such networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Reduced perception of stigma</title><p>Stigma has been defined in a number of ways, with a series of complex factors involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Link and Phelan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] broadly define stigma as a combination of labelling, stereotyping, separation (or &#x0201c;us&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;them&#x0201d; mentality), loss, and discrimination. These attitudes and behaviours are perpetrated by an individual or group who possess some level of social, economic and/or political power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and can include close friends and family members, resulting in the loss of previously valuable sources of support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Many factors contribute to reduced social support, including stigma. People who perceive stigma from others may withdraw from social interaction, rather than seek the support and contact they need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For this reason, the perceived absence of stigma in online communities is a potential attraction, with users indicating it is the most commonly perceived advantage of online support when compared with face-to-face support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Due to the anonymous nature of online discussion, there is great potential for discussion boards to aid in reducing stigma, as anonymity is considered a key influence in reducing the level of stigma experienced by online discussion board users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It&#x02019;s possible that by disclosing more information and receiving positive, supportive responses, users begin to perceive less stigma. Like social support, stigma has been linked to poorer psychosocial functioning in people with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Disappointingly, the experience of stigma has been self-reported in as much as 85&#x000a0;% of people with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In face-to-face support groups for mental illness, identification with a group has been shown to significantly increase resistance to the adverse effects of stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Group identification is the acknowledgement of belonging to a particular group. It is suggested that this identification provides a basis for social support, which is also significantly associated with resistance against stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These positive effects evident in face-to-face groups may be replicated in online discussion boards as they also allow members to identify with similar others. Many people with mood disorders avoid face-to-face support groups completely, due to social anxiety or fear of discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and online discussion boards provide an alternative which may help to alleviate these issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Improved quality of life</title><p>Broadly, quality of life (QoL) is defined as an individual&#x02019;s well-being in a spectrum of life domains, such as occupational, emotional, social and physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is unclear whether or not discussion board use helps or hinders quality of life, despite it being positively linked to both social support and stigma.</p><p>Along with social support and stigma, QoL is an important factor to consider in illness management for bipolar disorder. It has been identified as a significant area of impairment for those with bipolar disorder and is often regarded as a key target for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A number of online interventions for mood disorders that include discussion boards have shown significant improvements in QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], though only one of these studies specifically evaluated the impact of discussion board use on QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Crisp et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that when the e-couch online intervention for depression was coupled with an online discussion board, European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life(EUROHIS-QoL) 8-item index scores significantly improved when compared with the intervention and discussion board separately. These results highlight the potential benefit of including online support groups within online interventions for mental illness, and mood disorders in particular. This study, however, did not evaluate users&#x02019; level or type of discussion board engagement, so it remains unclear whether or not particular engagement patterns result in greater benefits to users.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The role of discussion engagement</title><p>Despite the potential benefits, discussion board utilization can often be limited, with only around 50&#x000a0;% of users posting at least once, and a small minority of users posting the majority of content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Little is known about the percentage of users who read content shared by others (known as lurkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]), or what benefit reading activity may have. Most studies into discussion board engagement focus on users who actively contribute new content (known as posters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]), and many do not take reading behaviour into account at all. Further investigation is required to evaluate the role of discussion board engagement, to determine if active or passive discussion engagement is most influential (if at all), and to determine what level of engagement is required to receive the most benefit.</p><p>Despite the growing number of online self-help programs for mental illness, many of which include online discussion boards, no published studies have evaluated discussion board engagement within an online intervention. The current study utilizes the MoodSwings online self-help program for bipolar disorder, which includes a series of educational learning modules, interactive tools, and three moderated peer discussion boards. This program offers a valuable opportunity to: Observe differing levels of active and passive discussion engagement in comparison to those who do not engage at all; evaluate the impact of discussion board engagement on both self report and clinician administered psychosocial outcome measures; and view discussion engagement in the context of an online self-help intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this novel exploratory study is to determine if there is a relationship between discussion board engagement and improvement in outcome measures from baseline to follow up, with a focus on self-reported social support, stigma, quality of life and levels of depression and mania. The secondary aim is to identify any differences in demographic variables between users who have different types and levels of discussion board engagement (active, passive or none).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The present study is a sub-study of a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) R34 funded randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of the MoodSwings online self-help program for bipolar disorder. This sub-study involves an analytic observational prospective cohort design using a naturalistic sample. This sub-study focuses on the three discussion boards included within the MoodSwings program. While there was no allocation to specific conditions by the researchers for this sub-study, it does take place within the context of a RCT that involves randomly allocating participants to three graded but parallel groups, however all participants receive a discussion board. Individuals have access to one of three different treatment arms of the MoodSwings program, and the discussion boards are allocated per treatment arm. Arm one has access to a discussion board alone; arm two has access to a discussion board and a series of online learning modules; and arm three has access to a discussion board, the learning modules, and a number of interactive tools.

All posts submitted to each discussion board are screened by a moderator before being published for other participants to see and all posts are moderated within two business days of submission. To be approved, all posts must fall within a set of guidelines which outline appropriate content. Inappropriate content including personal information, offensive language and distressing content is not allowed.

All posts submitted to each discussion board are stored for analysis, including those deemed inappropriate for publication. In addition to text content, all participant discussion usage will be tracked to determine discussion engagement patterns. The MoodSwings website allows administrators to monitor page views and log in times, and therefore monitor adherence to the intervention. Discussion board page views will be used to identify passive and active forum activities (i.e. reading and posting activities). These activities will be added up to form active and passive engagement scores, which will then be combined to form a third total engagement score. Tertiles will be calculated for each score to determine cut-off points for low, mid and high level engagement. Each score will then be categorised accordingly, and all three categorised scores will be used to represent each user&#x02019;s discussion engagement level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Quarterly assessment</title><p>Participants who were deemed eligible were then assessed via phone for baseline symptom scores using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The MoodSwings online psychotherapeutic intervention for bipolar disorder offers a valuable opportunity to deliver online discussion boards in an environment where natural usage patterns can be observed and accurately monitored. This will allow clear comparisons between users and non-users, as well as users with differing types and levels of engagement on a broad range of both self-report and clinician administered outcome measures. The results of this study will help to inform future programs about whether or not discussion boards are a beneficial inclusion in online self-help interventions. It will also help to determine if motivating users to actively engage in online discussion is necessary, and if so, what level of engagement is optimal to produce the most benefit. Future programs may benefit through being able to identify those most likely to poorly engage, based on demographic variables, so motivational strategies can be targeted accordingly.</p><p>As the Internet grows, there is increased appreciation of the utility of online discussion boards, particularly in the area of mental health. This research will assist in clarifying and maximising the benefits of online discussion, provide data guiding the design and utilisation of discussion boards, and will give clinicians and online users the best chance of positively utilizing online mental health communities.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>EUROHIS QoL</term><def><p>European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAM-D</term><def><p>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MADRS</term><def><p>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOS-SSS</term><def><p>Medical Outcomes Study &#x02013; Social Support Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIMH</term><def><p>National Institutes of Mental Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Q-LES-Q</term><def><p>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID-5-RV</term><def><p>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Research Version)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p>Veterans&#x02019; Affairs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YMRS</term><def><p>Young Mania Rating Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>VC receives royalties from UptoDate, Inc.
