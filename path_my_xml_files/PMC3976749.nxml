<bold><italic>Objective(s):</italic></bold> Hyperglycemia worsens the neuronal death induced by cerebral ischemia. Previous studies demonstrated that diabetic hyperglycemia suppressed the expression of heat shock protein 70 and 60 (HSP70 and 60) in the liver. IgG antibody titres against heat shock protein 27 (anti HSP27) were measured to determine whether hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic brain damage by suppressing the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in the brain.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Materials and Methods:</italic></bold> A randomized controlled study of traumatic brain injury ICU patients treated either by intensive insulin treatment (IIT) or by conventional glucose control (CGC) was conducted. Patients received at least 50% of their estimated daily energy requirements parenterally. Serum anti HSP27 antibody concentration was assessed at baseline, day 7 and day 14.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Twenty-six out of 29 patients (n=13 in each group) completed the study. At baseline, there were no differences between the two groups. On day 14, there was a significant reduction in anti HSP27 titre concentration in the IIT compared to the GCG group (0.47&#x000b1;0.27 mg/dl vs 0.60&#x000b1;0.15 mg/dl, <italic>P</italic>=0.03).</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> In this study, intensive control of traumatic brain injury patients on parenteral nutrition reduced anti HSP27 titre, possibly suggesting a reduction in stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Glucose control</kwd><kwd>Heat shock protein 27</kwd><kwd>Parenteral nutrition</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperglycemia induced by parenteral nutrition (PN) has been shown to exacerbate secondary brain injury and independently predicts poor neurologic outcomes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Cells respond to a variety of environm-ental stresses such as cerebral ischemia by expres-sing a family of proteins called the heat shock proteins (HSPs) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). HSP27 is a member of the small HSP (sHSP) family of proteins and has a molecular weight of approximately 27 KDa, however, it can form large aggregates of up to 800 KDa in the cytosol. In adults, HSP27 is expressed at high levels in several normal tissues including breast, uterus, cervix, placenta, skin, lung, heart and platelets. In addition to its role as a chaperone, HSP27 has also several other potentially important roles. Chaperones are proteins that assist the non-covalent folding or unfolding and the assembly or disassembly of other macromolecular structures, but do not occur in these structures when the structures are performing their normal biological functions and have completed the processes of folding and/or assembly. These include cell migration, apoptosis, protection against oxidative stress, endothelial barrier function and modulation of inflammation. Transient cerebral ischemia of either focal or global type enhances the HSPs gene expression and protein synthesis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It has been speculated that the role of these proteins during ischemia is to suppress neuronal cell death by stabilizing denatured proteins and removing damaged proteins for degradation or by interfering with apoptotic pathways. The objective of the present study was to assess whether HSP 27 concentration is affected by manipulating blood glucose (BG) regulation in traumatic brain injury intensive care unit (ICU) patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized controlled trial aiming to compare intensive insulin treatment (IIT) and conventional glucose control (CGC) in adult patients admitted to ICU with traumatic brain injury was designed. Inclusion criteria were patients aged &#x02265;18 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale 4-9 who received at least 50% of their estimated energy requirements (EER)ia PN. Patients with liver, kidney, heart, pancreatic failure or type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded from participation. The study was approved by the Bioet-hics Committee of Mashhad Medical University and was registered in the Iranian Randomized Control Trial studies (Registration number: IRCT201111 158108N1). Written informed consent or assent was provided by the participants or a close family member, before participation. </p><p>The patients energy requirements were estimated as 25 kcal/kg ideal body weight (calcula-ted as explained below) as proposed by the ESPEN guidelines (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The patients body height was estima-ted using the ulna length measurement (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and the ideal body weight was estimated as (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>):</p><p>IBW (male) = 50+(2.3 height [in inches]-60)</p><p>IBW (female) = 45.5+(2.3 height [in inches]-60)</p><p>The patients were hospitalized in ICU for at least 7 days before enrolment in the study. At baseline, demographic and clinical characteristics were obta-ined, including patient&#x02019;s age, gender, weight and height as reported by a close family member, BG concentration, GCS and Acute Physiology and Chro-nic Health Evaluation II score (APACHEII) results and medication type and dose (including hypog-lycemic agents). </p><p>Each patient randomly received either IIT defined as insulin infusion with cessation for at least 2 hr if BG concentration fell 75 mg/dl or CGC, provided by subcutaneous insulin infusion when BG &#x02265;180 mg/dl. In the IIT group, BG was assessed immediately after infusion of 50 regular insulin units and at 2 hr intervals thereafter throughout the 24 hr period. Insulin infusion was discontinued if BG fell 75 mg/dl and re-assessed after 2 hr and was only re-started if BG was higher than 75 mg/dl. BG concentration of the CGC patients was assessed every 12 hr and insulin was injected subcutaneously aiming to maintain BG 180 mg/dl. In both groups, BG concentration was measured in capillary blood using the IME-DC glucometer (Germany). Reliability was assessed by assessment of a venous blood sample taken every 24 hr using the glucose-oxidase method. The coefficient of variation between the two methods was found to be 3.1%. </p><p>Serum IgG antibody titres against heat shock protein 27 (anti HSP27) were assessed at baseline and on days 7 and 14 using an in-house ELISA assay. Microtitre plates (NuncMaxisorp, Nottingham, UK) were coated with 100 ng per well recombinant human HSP27 dissolved in 50 &#x000b5;l carbonate buffer pH 9.6 incubated for 18 hr at 4&#x000b0;C under humidified conditions. The wells were washed three times with PBS buffer. Non-specific binding was reduced by blocking each well with 2% goat serum in PBS and 250 &#x000b5;l was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C and 30 min at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with PBS. Serum was diluted 1:100 with 2% goat serum in PBS and 100 &#x000b5;l was added to each well in duplicate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washing (four times in wash buffer and two times in PBS), 100 &#x000b5;l peroxidase conjugated-goat anti human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) diluted 1:500 with 2% goat serum in PBS, was added to each well, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, 100 &#x000b5;l of TMB substrate (100 &#x000b5;l of 6 mg/ml TMB in DMSO was added to 10 ml of 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 3 &#x000b5;l H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was added per well and plate incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 &#x000b5;l HCl 2 M per well. Optical density at 450 nm was measured using a Lab system Reader MF Microtitre plate reader with a reference wavelength of 620 or 570 nm. The within-assay and between-assay precision was 3.5% and 5.2% respectively. </p><p>Data were analyzed according to intention to treat. Continuous variables were analyzed using the unpaired student t-test if normally distributed or by the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test if not normally distributed. Categorical variables were analyzed using either the Fischer&#x02019;s exact test or the chi-squared test. To assess the variations in serum HSP27 antibody titres over the 14-day period, repeated measures ANOVA test was used. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). A two sided <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 29 patients, all male (IIT group: n=13, age: 31&#x000b1;11 yrs, CGC group: n=16, age: 36.6&#x000b1;13 yrs) were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Three out of 16 patients assigned to the CGC group expired during the first 5 days of admission.

Outcome including anti HSP27 titre was less in tight control group but this difference was not significant on day 7. Fourteen days after intervention, HSP27 reduced significantly in tight control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.03). Totally, only a few studies about glycemic control in trauma patients and anti HSP27 measurement have been published. Blood glucose level is one of the variables that accelerates neural death. Therefore, controlling this factor tightly, can lead to better outcomes in neural conditions. Another study (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) has detected changes of HSP gene expression after global cerebral ischemia using DNA microarray and measured HSP levels using western blot analysis and immunohisto-chemistry. These results showed that hyperglycemic ischemia for 15 min enhanced the mRNA expressions of hsp27, hsp70, hsp70, hsp90A and hsp90B in the neocortical tissues after 1 hr of reperfusion. Our results are in agreement with the previously publish-ed findings showing that the expression of hsp27 was significantly increased in brain after global and/ or focal ischemia followed by 3 hr reperfusion (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>- <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this investigation was the first pilot study in this area in Iran. The study had a homogenous population. The small sample was one of the limitations and so further data collection is warranted before reaching final conclusions. Increased levels of HSPs may suggest that hyperglycemia induces an enhanced stress response in neurons. IIT reduced neuron's stress by reducing the level of this protein. </p><p>For future studies, we suggest that larger sample sizes are needed. Mortality and duration of ICU/ hospital stay as the major points in this population that need large sample size. Also, this method should be taken into consideration in other ICU hospitalized patients and all other patients that have hyperglyce mia in ICU. With more studies in this area, we can prepare a good scale for ICU hospitalized patients on PN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Blood glucose level is one of the variables that accelerates neural death. Parenteral nutrition, head injury, stress and ICU stay lead to hyperglycemia. HSP27 is a stress factor. Therefore, reducing this factor in traumatic brain injury patients is an indicator of stress reduction. In this study we showed that IIT (intensive insulin therapy) as the best method for glucose control can reduce stress by reducing Anti-HSP27 in serum in traumatic brain injury patients that receive PN. However, larger sample sizes are needed to reach a better conclusion. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are very grateful to the physicians and nurses of the Intensive
