The three groups were asked to perform the routine oral hygiene procedures thought out the study period.

The most effective method of prevention and maintenance of periodontal disease is mechanical as well as chemical plaque control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Several chemical plaque control agents have been evaluated for their effectiveness on supragingival plaque including bis biguinaides, essential oils, enzymes, and even herbal extract. Some of these substances have been associated with various side effects incapacitating their long term use, so new formulation of equal efficacy and fewer side effects are required to be evaluated. For thousands of years, humans have sought to fortify their health and cure various aliments with herbal remedies. Many herbal extracts are commercially available. <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> also known as neem has been used in India and South Asia for thousands of years as a perfect tool for maintaining healthy periodontium. Neem has been long considered to have an astringent, antiseptic, insecticidal, antiulcer and for medical properties. It is used for periodontitis and other dental diseases. The antibacterial activity of neem has been evaluated and known from ancient times.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Other than this, the leaf extract of neem has also shown superior antiviral and antihyperglycemic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> on animals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Neem leaves have been used in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis. The possible mechanism of anti inflammatory action of neem is by inhibiting prostaglandin E and 5 HT and thus reducing the inflammation. The antibacterial action can be explained by &#x0201c;Azadiachtin&#x0201d; that is known to destroy bacterial cell wall and thus inevitably inhibit the growth of bacteria,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] also the breakdown of cell wall disturb osmotic pressure and leads to cell death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] But still, its use of treatment for gingivitis and perodontitis is not very clear. Hence, aim of the present study was &#x0201c;to assess the anti-gingivitis and antiplaque properties of an <italic>A. indica</italic> based mouthrinse in plaque induced gingivitis.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo clinical trial approved by the ethical committee of the IDS, Bareilly.

However, long term use of chlorhexidine is limited by its disagreeable taste and propensity to stain the teeth brown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Therefore, the effectiveness of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaf extract against plaque formation was assessed. Almost every part of the tree was used in indigenous systems of medicine for the treatment of a variety of human ailments, particularly against diseases of bacterial and fungal origin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, new formulation with similar or superior efficacy and possible few long effect need to be investigated. In the present study, <italic>A. indica</italic> extract mouthrinse was formulated along with the sweetener and flavor so as to increase the patient compliance. Our data shows that an <italic>A. indica</italic> mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing periodontal indices as chlorhexidine. The treatment doses were applied after breakfast and after lunch. In order to eliminate the bias, decreased flow of the saliva during overnight that could be attributed to was also successful in reducing the plaque index compared to the control group. The results demonstrated a significant reduction of gingival, bleeding, and plaque indices in both groups over a period of 21 day as compared to placebo. The results of our study are consistent with the study done by Botelho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] reported that <italic>A. indica</italic>-based mouth rinse is highly efficacious and that it may be used as an alternative therapy in the treatment of periodontal disease-based mouth rinse is highly efficacious and that it may be used as an alternative therapy in the treatment of periodontal disease . However, certain studies have proved that neem extract leads to even better reduction in plaque index and bacterial load. Patel and Ventakrishna (1988) reported a significant reduction in probing depth and gain in clinical attachment level by its use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within limitations of the study, it was found that 0.19% <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> (neem) has significant anti-inflammatory property. Thus, it can be used as an adjunct to mechanical therapy for treating plaque induced gingivitis. Present study has an important impact in order to create an effective and inexpensive oral health intervention for low socio-economic communities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Botelho</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>BezerraFilho</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Correa</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Heukelbach</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of a novel essential oil mouthrinse without alcohol on gingivitis: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>J Appl Oral Sci</source><year>2007</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>175</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19089126</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chaurasia</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antibacterial activity of essential oils of four medicinal plants</article-title><source>Indian J Hospital Pharm</source><year>1978</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>166</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chawla</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bansal</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemical constituents and biological activity of neem-a review</article-title><source>Indian Drugs</source><year>1994</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chattopadhyay</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Possible mechanism of antihyperglycemic effect of Azadirachta indica leaf extract: Part V</article-title><source>J Ethnopharmacol</source><year>1999</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>367</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10617074</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Trewari</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Monograph on Neem (Azadirachta indica)</article-title><year>1992</year><publisher-loc>DehraDun, India</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Int.
