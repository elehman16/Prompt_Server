Subjects received single doses of placebo, peginesatide injection 0.1 mg/kg intravenous, or moxifloxacin 400 mg during three treatment periods, separated by 14-day washout intervals. ECG recordings and blood samples for peginesatide and moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were collected prior to dosing and through 22 hours postdose. QT intervals were measured with a high resolution manual on-screen caliper method. The study endpoint was the mean difference between peginesatide and placebo in baseline-adjusted corrected QT interval (ddQTc). The maximum upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI was 2.2 milliseconds at 0.75 hours for Fridericia-corrected ddQTc (ddQTcF) and 2.2 milliseconds at 0.25 hours for individual corrected ddQTcI. The linear relationship between ddQTcF and peginesatide concentrations was essentially flat and not statistically significant [slope = 0.001, <italic>P</italic> = 0.126, 90% CI: (&#x0003c;&#x02212;0.0005, 0.002)]. Using this model, the projected ddQTcF effect at the observed mean peak plasma concentration is estimated to be 0.9 milliseconds, 90% CI: (&#x02212;2.0, 0.3 milliseconds). There were no peginesatide-related effects on heart rate, PR interval, or QRS interval. Thus, there is no anticipated cardiovascular effect of peginesatide injection 0.1 mg/kg in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erythropoiesis-stimulating agent</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular safety</kwd><kwd>peginesatide pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>QTcF</kwd><kwd>QTc</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Peginesatide (OMONTYS&#x000ae;; Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., Deerfield, IL) is a novel, synthetic, dimeric peptide linked to polyethylene glycol that is designed to specifically activate the erythropoietin receptor and stimulate erythropoiesis.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It was approved in the United States for once-monthly administration for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients on dialysis in March 2012 and was subsequently voluntarily recalled in February 2013 because of new postmarketing reports regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions. The molecular size of peginesatide (44.8 &#x000b1; 4.5 kDa) and preclinical data suggest it is unlikely to exert electrophysiologic cardiovascular effects in humans. In vitro and in vivo studies show that peginesatide undergoes negligible metabolism (data on file) and it is unlikely that the intact PEGylated peptide interacts with ionic channels in the cell membrane or is transported into the cell due to its size. In preclinical studies, peginesatide did not cause appreciable inhibition of the human <italic>ether-&#x000e0;-go-go</italic>-related gene potassium current at a concentration approximately 31-fold higher than the observed plasma concentration for a human dose of 0.35 mg/kg, which was the upper limit of the maximum dose for 95% of patients in Phase 3 clinical trials in dialysis patients (data on file). This suggests negligible potential for an in vivo inhibitory effect on cardiac potassium channel conduction.</p><p>This study was undertaken to confirm the cardiovascular safety of peginesatide injection with regard to the QT interval, to evaluate the relationship between peginesatide plasma levels and QT interval, and to examine the safety profile following a single dose of peginesatide injection 0.1 mg/kg intravenous (IV) in healthy subjects.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 50 years of age with a body mass index &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible for inclusion in the study.

The study protocol was approved by the Independent Investigational Review Board (Plantation, FL). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the initiation of any study procedures.</p><p>This was a Phase 1, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled, three-period crossover study. Each treatment period consisted of a 3-day confinement period, with the dosing days separated by 14-day washout intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>A).

Peginesatide injection and corresponding placebo were administered IV as a bolus injection over 30 seconds. Over-encapsulated moxifloxacin and corresponding placebo were administered orally with 240 mL water 1 hour after peginesatide or placebo injection (i.e., at Hour 1).</p><p>Study ECGs were acquired from a 24-hour Holter recording. On the day of dosing in each treatment period, three 10-second ECG recordings were extracted at approximately Hour &#x02212;1, &#x02212;0.5, &#x02212;0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 22, relative to the peginesatide or placebo injection. All ECG measurements were performed at a central laboratory (eResearch Technology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) and were interpreted by United States board-certified cardiologists. All ECG readers and technicians were blinded to study treatment, timepoints, and subject identifiers (including age and gender).</p><p>The dose of peginesatide (0.1 mg/kg) was selected based on the median dose used in subjects on hemodialysis (0.09 mg/kg every 4 weeks; range 0.02&#x02013;0.5 mg/kg). A 0.1 mg/kg dose was determined to be the highest dose that could be safely administered to nonanemic healthy adults, minimizing the risk of absolute Hb levels &#x0003e;18 g/dL or an excessive rate of rise in Hb (&#x0003e;1 g/dL over 2 weeks), either of which could increase the potential for cardiovascular events such as hypertension or thrombotic events. A single oral dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg is the standard positive control accepted in QT/QTc studies in healthy subjects.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The endpoints for the study were the mean difference in the postdose time-matched baseline-adjusted corrected QT intervals between peginesatide and placebo (ddQTc) using three different correction methods: individual corrected QTc (QTcI), QTcF, and QT interval corrected using the Bazett formula (QTcB).

The fixed factors in the model were sequence, period, treatment, scheduled time points, the interaction between treatment and the scheduled time points, and the interaction between period and scheduled time points. Subject within sequence was the random factor. One-sided 95% upper confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed for the difference between peginesatide and placebo (ddQTc) and &#x0201c;no QT prolongation effect&#x0201d; of peginesatide was declared if the upper CI at each time point was no higher than 10 milliseconds.</p><p>The study's ability to detect a small QTc effect was validated by the effect of moxifloxacin on QT/QTc. Assay sensitivity was confirmed if the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI of the ddQTc was greater than 5 milliseconds for at least one time point between Hours 2 and 5 (i.e., 1 and 4 hours post-moxifloxacin dosing).

Samples for the measurement of moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were collected after the peginesatide sample at Hour 1 (prior to moxifloxacin dose), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 22. All samples were centrifuged and the plasma was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis. Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were set to 0 for pharmacokinetic analyses.</p><p>Peginesatide concentrations were measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Human plasma containing antigen (peginesatide) and anti-peginesatide antibody were pre-incubated for 30 minutes. The pre-incubated solution was added onto a microplate previously coated with the antigen and the microplate was incubated at room temperature for approximately 1 hour. Subsequently, anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was added and the microplate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate solution was added and the microplate was incubated at room temperature for 36&#x02013;46 minutes, followed by the addition of base to stop the reaction. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader. A standard curve was fit to a four-parameter logistic equation, from which the concentrations were calculated. The standard curve range was 25&#x02013;750 ng/mL with additional anchor points included. The LLOQ was determined to be 25 ng/mL. The intra-day precision and accuracy ranged from 0.7% to 22.8% and 78.7% to 117.8%, respectively. The inter-day precision and accuracy ranged from 7.2% to 16.0% and 90.5% to 102.9%, respectively.</p><p>Moxifloxacin concentrations were measured using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) assay. Human plasma containing moxifloxacin was fortified with internal standard, d4-moxifloxacin, and extracted using an Oasis HLB SPE cartridge. The final eluent was evaporated to dryness and then reconstituted in 300 &#x003bc;L of 0.1% formic acid. An aliquot, 25 &#x003bc;L, of the final extract was injected onto an HPLC with MS/MS detection. The HPLC column was a 50 mm &#x000d7; 2.1 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m, BDS Hypersil C<sub>18</sub> column. The HPLC separation was achieved using a flow rate of 0.300 mL/min and gradient with a mobile phase A of 5.0 mM ammonium formate and mobile phase B of 1.0% formic acid in acetonitrile. Initial conditions were 10% mobile phase B to 20% mobile phase B over 1 minute and then an increase to 40% mobile phase B over the next 1.5 minutes. The column was then returned to initial conditions for reinjection at 5 minutes. The Mass Spec used electrospray in the positive ion mode with MRM for moxifloxacin ions at 402.1 and 384.1 and for d4-moxifloxacin ions at 406.3 and 388.2 m/z. The standard curve range was 25.0 to 5000 ng/mL; the LLOQ was determined to be 25.0 ng/mL. The intra-day precision and accuracy (% difference from theoretical) ranged from 3.89% to 4.83% and &#x02212;0.957% to 3.44%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject Population</title><p>Sixty-five subjects were enrolled in the study, 4 subjects prematurely discontinued (2 due to TEAEs, 1 due to a positive alcohol test, and 1 with voluntarily withdrawal), and 61 subjects completed all 3 regimens.

The study demonstrated that peginesatide does not have a prolongation effect on QTc interval or on any other ECG parameters of clinical concern.</p><p>Three correction methods, QTcI, QTcF, and QTcB, were used in this study. They were evaluated using the method proposed by the FDA's interdisciplinary review team,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> where the appropriateness of each correction method is evaluated accounting for the evaluation of the correction for individual subjects. Examination of the means of the squared individual QTc/RR slopes for the different correction methods showed the lowest (i.e., the flattest slope) was for QTcF, which therefore gave the best correction for HR changes in this study.</p><p>Assay sensitivity was demonstrated through the QTcF effect of the positive control, moxifloxacin, for which the lower bound of ddQTcF was above 5 milliseconds at all four prespecified timepoints (Hours 2, 3, 4, and 5).<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mean difference in dQTcI and dQTcF between moxifloxacin and placebo peaked 2 hours after administration (at Hours 3 and 4) at around 12 milliseconds and was approximately 10 milliseconds at all timepoints from 2 to 9 hours post-moxifloxacin dose.</p><p>This study demonstrated that peginesatide injection does not prolong the QT interval in healthy adult subjects.

In this study, across all the evaluated postdose time points, the highest upper bound for the one-sided 95% CI of the difference in the least-square means of the baseline adjusted QTcI between peginesatide injection and placebo was 2.2 milliseconds at 0.75 hours postdose for QTcF and 2.2 milliseconds at 0.25 hours for QTcI. In addition, no subject had a QTcF &#x0003e;450 milliseconds or an increase of &#x0003e;30 milliseconds in QTcF at any time following peginesatide injection.</p><p>The linear relationship between ddQTcF and peginesatide concentrations was not statistically significant, which clearly supports the lack of effect of peginesatide on the changes in QTc interval. Therefore, it is not appropriate to project the QTc effect at higher peginesatide concentrations due to the lack of association.</p><p>Increases in HR and decreases in PR interval were observed with all three regimens between Hours 5 and 10, and these changes were similar for all regimens at all timepoints. The HR changes were likely due to the increased freedom of movement allowed for the subjects after the intense monitoring during the first few hours after study drug administration.</p><p>The most common TEAEs in this study were headache and dizziness for each regimen, and all TEAEs with peginesatide injection were mild or moderate in intensity.</p><p>One limitation of this study was the choice of the therapeutic peginesatide injection dose (0.1 mg/kg) rather than a supratherapeutic dose. This was based on the results of an earlier study demonstrating that this dose was associated with clinically and statistically significant increases in Hb in patients with CKD.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Supratherapeutic doses were not used in order to minimize the risk to subjects of either an excessive absolute Hb level or an excessive rate of rise in Hb levels, either of which could increase the potential for cardiovascular events such as hypertension and thrombotic events.

The results of this study confirm this finding and demonstrate that peginesatide injection 0.1 mg/kg IV does not cause QTc prolongation and that there is no drug-related effect on the HR, PR interval, or QRS interval. Thus, there is no anticipated cardiovascular effect of peginesatide injection 0.1 mg/kg in patients with CKD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Jacqueline Wu, PhD (Ledell, Inc.) with funding provided by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International.
