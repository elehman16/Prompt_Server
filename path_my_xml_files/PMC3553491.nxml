The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving a 20% improvement in RA signs and symptoms according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ie, an ACR20 response) at week 12. Changes in morning pain, duration of morning stiffness, 28-joint Disease Activity Score and health-related quality of life were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>MR prednisone plus DMARD treatment produced higher response rates for ACR20 (48% vs 29%, p&#x0003c;0.001) and ACR50 (22% vs 10%, p&#x0003c;0.006) and a greater median relative reduction from baseline in morning stiffness (55% vs 35%, p&#x0003c;0.002) at week 12 than placebo plus DMARD treatment. Significantly greater reductions in severity of RA (Disease Activity Score 28) (p&#x0003c;0.001) and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score) (p=0.003) as well as a greater improvement in physical function (36-item Short-Form Health Survey score) (p&#x0003c;0.001) were seen at week 12 for MR prednisone versus placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar for MR prednisone (43%) and placebo (49%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Low-dose MR prednisone added to existing DMARD treatment produced rapid and relevant improvements in RA signs and symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, number</title><p>NCT00650078</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucocorticoids such as prednisone are established components of treatment strategies for many inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and are widely used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Accumulating evidence suggests that low-dose treatment is well tolerated and minimises the risk of the undesirable effects associated with higher doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> However, there is still a need to improve the risk&#x02013;benefit profile for these valuable anti-inflammatory drugs by increasing the efficacy of low-dose treatment. One promising approach is chronotherapy, in which the delivery of treatment is coordinated with circadian biological rhythms. The chronotherapeutic approach has shown promise in several therapeutic areas, including the management of hypertension, allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>Chronotherapy may be particularly appropriate for RA because symptoms follow circadian rhythms, with impaired function due to pain and joint stiffness commonly being most severe in the early morning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Emergence of these symptoms follows the increase in serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6; a key inflammatory mediator), tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and other proinflammatory cytokines that occur late at night.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Nocturnal secretion of cortisol, which can counter the effects of increased IL-6 levels, is also perturbed in patients with RA and may contribute to the emergence of morning symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> These observations suggest that the optimal time for delivery of glucocorticoid treatment is during the night, to mimic the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion and target the effects of nocturnal proinflammatory stimuli.</p><p>A modified-release (MR) formulation of prednisone has been developed to deliver prednisone chronotherapy. This innovative tablet uses a programmed-release mechanism to release prednisone approximately 4 h after ingestion (ie, at approximately 02:00 am if the patient takes the tablet at 10:00 pm). We report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis, CAPRA-2) that investigated the efficacy and safety of low-dose prednisone chronotherapy in patients with active RA.</p><p>This is the first rigorous placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy of low-dose prednisone in patients with active disease receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment and according to current standards. It thus allows comparison with the results of recent studies of other treatments in patients with active RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>In this 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, following a 1-week screening period, eligible patients were randomised 2:1 to receive MR prednisone (5 mg) or placebo once daily, taken with or after their evening meal, in addition to their standard RA treatment.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees and institutional review boards of all centres, and all patients provided written informed consent before study-related procedures.

Patients were also required to have had a duration of morning stiffness of at least 45 min on at least 4 days within the 7 days of screening, a swollen joint count of &#x02265;4 and a tender joint count of &#x02265;4. Patients receiving oral glucocorticoids within 6 weeks of the screening visit were excluded from the study (see online supplementary material for further details). The study protocol prohibited initiation of any new DMARD or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment during the study; changes to existing DMARD treatment (dosing and frequency) were also prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>Scheduled study visits occurred at baseline and weeks 2, 6 and 12, and were to occur between 08:00 and 10:00 pm. At each visit, doctors assessed the number of tender and swollen joints and global disease activity, and patients assessed pain and global disease activity and completed the Functional Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Disease activity at each visit was determined using the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Assessments of pain and global disease activity were made using 0&#x02013;100 mm visual analogue scales (0=no pain/not active at all; 100=very intense pain/extremely active). Blood samples were collected at each study visit.</p><p>Throughout the study, patients completed a diary card twice daily. In the mornings they recorded whether they had joint stiffness and its severity, the time of resolution of joint stiffness and pain levels on waking. Evening assessments included pain intensity during the day and whether the patient had experienced recurrence of stiffness. Patients assessed their health status using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

Safety assessments (recording of adverse events (AEs) and vital signs) were performed at each study visit according to standard procedure (ie, without using checklists with predefined events).</p><p>The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with a 20% improvement in RA signs and symptoms according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (ie, an ACR20 response)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> at week 12. A key secondary end point was the change in duration of morning stiffness between baseline and week 12. (See online supplementary material for details of secondary end points.)</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study aimed to demonstrate a difference of at least 20% in ACR20 for MR prednisone versus placebo at week 12. The sample size calculation was based on comparison of two proportions using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and a randomisation ratio of 2:1 for MR prednisone:placebo. Assuming an ACR20 response rate of 25% for placebo, 294 patients would be required to provide 90% power to detect an ACR20 response rate of 45% in the MR prednisone group at a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05. The study therefore aimed to randomise at least 294 patients; in order to account for potential drop-outs, a total of 350 patients were recruited to the study.</p><p>Duration of morning stiffness was the difference between the time of resolution of morning stiffness and the time of waking. The difference between the treatment groups was assessed using the median and the 95% CI of the median, computed using the Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann method.

No clinically relevant changes in haematological or biochemical parameters or vital signs were seen during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Low-dose MR prednisone chronotherapy has an important clinical effect on symptoms of RA in patients with active disease receiving conventional DMARDs, as evident from ACR20 and ACR50 response rates at week 12 in this study. Clinical responses were achieved rapidly, with most clinical end points showing statistically significant differences for MR prednisone over placebo as early as 2 weeks after the start of treatment, and responses were maintained for the duration of the 12-week study. Significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were also seen. The use of analgesics was similar between groups, indicating that the observed improvements could be attributed to MR prednisone, rather than differences in analgesic medication.</p><p>Prednisone chronotherapy is expected to have a particular impact on morning symptoms of RA. This is borne out in this study, in which MR prednisone reduced the duration of morning stiffness from approximately 2 h at baseline to 46 min at week 12, a median relative reduction of 55% which was approximately 1.5-fold greater than that seen with placebo. Morning pain, severity of morning stiffness and RA severity (according to DAS28 score) were also considerably reduced with MR prednisone over the 12-week study. This is in agreement with results from our previous study (CAPRA-1),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> in which MR prednisone induced greater improvements in morning stiffness and reductions in IL-6 levels than immediate-release (IR) prednisone. These results suggest that the timing of delivery significantly affects the efficacy of glucocorticoid treatment and that chronotherapy may allow efficacious treatment with lower glucocorticoid doses.</p><p>Previous studies of low-dose prednisone have largely investigated the benefits of adding low-dose (&#x02264;10 mg/day) IR prednisone to DMARDs in patients with early RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> These placebo- controlled studies have demonstrated more rapid improvements in clinical symptoms over the first 6 months of treatment for prednisone compared with placebo, and are thus in agreement with our results obtained in patients with more advanced disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> While numerical differences in favour of the prednisone group were also evident at 12 or 24 months, differences were no longer statistically significant in most cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> However, the addition of low-dose prednisone has been reported to increase the probability of achieving remission over the first year of treatment and of maintaining remission beyond the first year,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> and to decrease radiographic progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Given the similar results reported for IR prednisone and MR prednisone over the first months of treatment, prolonged treatment with MR prednisone can also be expected to slow radiographic progression, but this disease-modifying effect has still to be proved.</p><p>We report that MR prednisone was well tolerated. In this 12-week study, the overall incidence of AEs was slightly lower in patients receiving MR prednisone than in those receiving placebo, and none of the serious or severe AEs in the MR prednisone group was considered related to treatment. In addition, there was no evidence for an increased risk of infection with active treatment; indeed the incidence of bronchitis was higher in the placebo group. The incidences of hypertension and discontinuation due to AEs were low but were slightly higher in the MR prednisone group. Notably, the incidences of arthritis and arthralgia reported as AEs were higher in the placebo group, again reflecting the efficacy of MR prednisone. The safety profile of MR prednisone presented here is similar to that seen in the CAPRA-1 study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> and in placebo-controlled studies for IR prednisone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, patients were required to have morning stiffness of more than 45 min to be included in the study; our results may thus not be directly applicable to patients with less severe disease. Second, this was a 12-week study. This duration is sufficient to demonstrate the initial benefits achieved by adding MR prednisone to DMARD treatment, including improvements in morning function and HRQoL. However, the study did not assess effects on structural damage and disease progression, which would require longer follow-up. Third, while the results of this study demonstrate that short-term treatment with MR prednisone has a similar safety profile to that of placebo, long-term studies are required to assess the safety and tolerability of prolonged treatment.</p><p>In fact, this has already been demonstrated in the open-label extension to the CAPRA-1 study, where patients received either MR prednisone or IR prednisone for 3 months, before receiving MR prednisone for 9 months. The only AEs reported in &#x0003e;2% of patients during the 9-month extension (months 4&#x02013;12) were RA-related symptoms (14.5%), upper respiratory tract infections (2.8%), back pain (2.8%) and weight increase (2.8%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> An integrated safety analysis (supplementary tables 5 and 6) provides further safety data from the full 12 months of CAPRA-1 (either 12 months MR prednisone treatment or 3 months IR prednisone treatment (months 0&#x02013;3) followed by 9 months MR prednisone treatment (months 4&#x02013;12) depending on initial randomisation) and combined safety data for patients receiving MR prednisone for 3 months from both CAPRA-1 and CAPRA-2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> The incidence of AEs was higher over the 12-month period than for the 3-month period (as would be expected for the longer duration of treatment), though the increase was not proportional to the duration of treatment. For example, the incidence of severe AEs during the first 3 months of treatment was 2.4% (supplementary table 5) compared with 3.3% in patients receiving 12 months MR prednisone treatment (supplementary table 6). Similarly, aggravated RA/RA flare-up was reported in 12.8% of patients during the first 3 months and in 14.2% of patients during the 12-month treatment period (supplementary tables 5 and 6). The only AEs reported in &#x02265;4% of patients receiving MR prednisone for 12 months were aggravated RA/RA flare-up and flushing (supplementary table 6).</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that even at a dose considered to be below substitution levels, MR prednisone chronotherapy is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with RA, providing rapid relief of symptoms and, particularly, improving morning function. Further, longer-term studies are warranted to determine the dose and strategy that optimises the benefit-to-risk ratio for MR prednisone in the management of RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1326" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1334" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1342" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1350" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s5.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1358" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201067_s6.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1366" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients and investigators who took part in this study.
