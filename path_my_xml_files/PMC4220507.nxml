A sample of 105 children aged 12-15 years was randomized into three groups, namely neem, mango, and chlorhexidine mouthwash groups. All the children were examined at baseline and gingival and plaque indices were recorded. Baseline scores for plaque and gingivitis were fair and moderate, respectively, in all the three groups and there existed no statistically significant difference among them. Ten millilitres each of herbal and chlorhexidine mouthwashes (0.2%) were administered according to the group allocation twice daily for 21 days. Indices were reassessed at 21 days (immediately after intervention) and at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after discontinuing the mouthwashes. Statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in plaque index was found in all the three mouthwash groups at 21 days and at 1 month from discontinuing the mouthwash. Chlorhexidine additionally showed statistically significant reduction in plaque index at 2 months from discontinuing the mouthwash. Statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in gingival index was found in all the three mouthwash groups at 21 days (immediately after discontinuing the mouthwash) and at 1 and 2 months from discontinuing the mouthwash. To conclude, all the three mouthwashes were effective antiplaque and antigingivitis agents. Chlorhexidine and neem possess equivalent efficacy in reducing plaque, while chlorhexidine has superior antigingivitis properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Azadirachta indica</italic></kwd><kwd>Gingival index</kwd><kwd><italic>Mangifera indica</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouthwash</kwd><kwd>Plaque index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Research has linked oral microorganisms, particularly those with adherent biofilm properties, to clinically specific oral conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral malodor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Plaque reduction has been the hallmark of preventive dentistry since the advent of antibiotics and the realization that bacteria are possible causative agents of the major dental diseases, caries, and periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical hygiene procedures such as tooth brushing, interdental brushing, and dental floss are the key methods of plaque control.

Hence, the present study was planned to evaluate the effect of neem and mango on plaque and gingival scores in high school children of Belgaum city.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was a triple-blind randomized controlled field trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two herbal mouthrinses (neem and mango) on plaque and gingival scores of 12-15-year-old school children in Belgaum city. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the institutional review board of KLE VK Institute of Dental Sciences, Belgaum, Karnataka, India, Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI), Belgaum, and the principal of the selected high school.</p><p>A pilot study was conducted on 10 people to determine the acceptability, palatability, and safety of the mouthwashes. The required sample size was estimated based on the difference in the plaque and gingival scores between the study and control groups. Sample size was calculated based on the minimum difference expected between the two groups, which was 0.7.</p><p>Two examiners were selected to ensure blind evaluation of the study participants. Examiner 1 (principal investigator) selected the schools, obtained permission from them, did primary screening (examination for inclusion and exclusion criteria, which included baseline clinical examination) and selection, collected baseline data, and administered the mouthwashes for 21 days. Examiner 2 recorded the plaque and gingival scores after 21 days (immediately after the intervention) and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after discontinuing the mouthwash. Examiner 2 was blinded to the type of mouthwashes admistered. The statistician remained blinded regarding the subject allocation to the three groups. Both the examiners were trained and calibrated before the start of study in the Department of Public Health Dentistry, KLE VK Institute of Dental Sciences, Belgaum under the guidance of a professor in order to limit the intra-examiner and inter-examiner variability. They were reassessed for satisfactory agreement at various time intervals during the clinical examinations. Recording assistants were trained in documenting the readings accurately. The intra-examiner and inter-examiner variabilities were calculated using Kappa statistics. Inter-examiner and intra-examiner variability (Kappa) for plaque index and gingival index ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 and from 0.7 to 0.8, respectively, during all the assessments.</p><p>For obtaining the study sample, two-stage random sampling was done. In the first stage, a list of all the schools was obtained from DDPI, Belgaum. From these schools, one school was selected by lottery method. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the children examined. Children were free to withdraw from the study at any point during the study period.</p><p>During the initial phase of study (before selecting the sample), a 29-item self-designed combination of closed and open-ended questionnaire and assessment form was prepared to collect information regarding socio-demographics, oral hygiene practices, and food habits from all the children aged 12-15 years. All the children were also clinically examined for the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as mentioned later. This form was divided into five parts:</p><p>

</p><p>One hundred and five subjects were randomly selected from the eligible population (who fulfilled the inclusion criteria) and randomized into three groups, namely mango, neem, and chlorhexidine mouthwash groups, having 35 participants each. Randomization was done using lottery method by a person not involved with the study proceedings. All the parameters (including food habits, oral hygiene habits, etc.) were assessed statistically. No statistically significant difference was found among the three groups.</p><p>All the children were administered mango, neem, and chlorhexidine mouthwashes (0.2%) according to the group they were assigned to, twice daily for 21 days. Measured amount (10 ml) of mouthwashes was poured in plastic cups and given to children. All the children were asked to take mouthwash into their mouths and start swishing the mouthwash upon a prompt from the investigator who stood with a stop watch to record the time. After swishing the mouthwash for 30 sec as recorded in the stop watch, children were asked to spit in the nearby wash basin. They were also asked not to eat or drink anything for 30 min. Children were instructed to use 10 ml of mouthwash as prescribed, under parents&#x02019; supervision at night time after dinner. Every participant was provided with 75 ml of their respective mouthwashes for home use on a weekly basis. Before start of the intervention, all the children were instructed to rinse with the mouthwashes given to them in the night, before going to bed, and not to eat or drink anything for atleast half an hour after rinsing. Positive reinforcements were given from time to time. No oral prophylaxis was done prior to commencement of intervention. Children were allowed to follow their individual oral hygiene procedures.</p><p>After 21 days of mouthwash administration, plaque index and gingival index were reassessed. Parameters were reassessed at monthly intervals for 3 months, i.e. at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after discontinuing the mouthwash. Children were blinded as to which mouthwash they were receiving. Second examiner was blinded to the group allocation, meaning he did not know which child was assigned to which mouthwash group. The statistician remained blinded regarding the subject allocation to the three groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Preparation of mouthwash</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Procurement and drying of the tree sticks</title><p>Mango and neem trees are available in abundance in India. The small branches of these trees were freshly cut. Leaves from the concerned branches procured were removed and immediately the branches measuring 4 inches in length were cut. These cut sticks were cleaned thoroughly in a disinfecting solution (2% povidone iodine) and washed in running water for about 10-15 min to remove all traces of dirt and extraneous contaminating material. Final wash was done with distilled water. These branches were dried in direct sunlight keeping each variety on separate sheets of double filter paper. Sticks were covered with filter paper during drying to prevent contamination. Drying was carried out till the sticks were completely dehydrated and became easily breakable. Both types of twigs were stored in separate containers and labeling was done to avoid mixing with other branches during the following procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Preparation of neem and mango sticks powder</title><p>The extracts of the above chewing sticks were prepared for each one separately, starting with the mango sticks. The dried sticks were cut into smaller pieces using a twig cutter and pulverized to fine powder using a Kenstar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> high-speed electric grinder for 15 min. The powder was transferred to separate sterile, airtight plastic containers with lids and each container was labeled with the name of the respective plant. Similar procedure was adopted for the neem sticks. After preparation of powder of each variety, the electric mixer was thoroughly cleaned with distilled water and dried thoroughly before commencing the preparation of the powder of the other variety of chewing sticks. Finally, two containers of the powders of different chewing sticks were obtained which were labeled and kept in cool, dry conditions till further use.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Preparation of mouthwash solution</title><p>Cold maceration technique was employed. The obtained powders of mango and neem were weighed individually into 50 g using Digiweigh<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic weighing machine and put into separate sterile containers to which sterile deionized distilled water was added using a measuring jar to make the final volume of 100 ml. The container was then shaken well manually for 5 min to mix the powder well with water before keeping it in the refrigerator at 4&#x000b0;C. The mixture was allowed to soak for 48 h at 4&#x000b0;C in the refrigerator. After 48 h, the mixture was filtered using a filter paper. Sweetening agent (30% sucralose, code E955) and preservative (0.05% sodium benzoate, code 211 and 0.01% sodium methyl paraben, code 218) were added to obtain the final mouthwash.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS for Windows, Version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequencies, percentages, and mean values.

Final assessment was made on 97 participants as 8 participants dropped out (3 in mango group, 2 in neem group, and 3 in chlorhexidine group). Taste was the main governing factor for children dropping out of herbal mouthwashes group as neem and mango are known for their bitter and astringent taste, respectively (mango = 2, neem = 2). Two participants were excluded from the study on 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> day, respectively, as they acquired throat infection and were put on antibiotics by their physicians (chlorhexidine = 1, mango = 1). One participant dropped out because he had to take a leave of absence from the school (chlorhexidine = 1). One participant was excluded as he revealed that he was not able to comply with home rinsing regimen for all the days.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference among the three mouthwash groups at baseline with respect to age, sex, plaque and gingival indices [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].
