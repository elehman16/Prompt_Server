<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Treatment of chronic respiratory infection is therefore a cornerstone of CF care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Of the organisms responsible for pulmonary infection in CF, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is one of the most prevalent,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with an estimated 50.6% of patients chronically infected with this pathogenic bacteria in the USA in 2011.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Management of chronic infection consists of airway clearance using techniques such as postural drainage, chest compression, oscillatory positive expiratory pressure or exercise,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> combined with antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics may be administered orally, via an intravenous line or via inhalation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The most frequently used US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved inhaled antibiotics require the use of compressors and nebulisers, and may require long treatment durations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, nebulisers need to be carefully cleaned after use, and these treatments are relatively expensive to employ. All these factors are barriers to the effective use of this mode of administration.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Dry powder inhalers, which are small, portable, breath-actuated devices,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> have proven useful in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory conditions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Importantly, they can be administered within a short period of time, thereby helping to reduce the burden of treatment. This is an essential factor to consider in a patient population that spends an average of 2&#x02005;h daily on healthcare-related activities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> An important aspect of the CF therapeutic drug development pipeline has been to develop a wider range of agents and delivery systems to treat <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> respiratory infection,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> such as the recently approved aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin DPI (TOBI Podhaler).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Despite this approval, there is still a clinical need for antibiotics that can be administered via the DPI route for the treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in patients with CF.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Ciprofloxacin DPI is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic manufactured using PulmoSphere technology from Novartis (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) and consists of particles of a controlled size of &#x02264;5&#x02005;&#x000b5;m, with powder density and morphology optimised for pulmonary delivery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The drug is administered using a capsule-based dry powder inhaler device (T-326 inhaler).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This formulation of the antibiotic has properties that lead to markedly reduced systemic absorption, thus enhancing its action and potentially minimising side effects.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> After decades of intensive antibiotic use, there is now accelerated evolution of antibiotic resistance. New treatment options administered by inhalation could help counter the increasing drug resistance and improve efficacy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Approval of this agent would provide CF physicians and patients with a new option for antipseudomonal treatments administered through the DPI route.</p><p>The mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin is distinct from other agents commonly administered by inhalation, such as tobramycin.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Ciprofloxacin has frequently been used via oral or intravenous administration for the treatment of pulmonary infection in CF.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, a clinical trial of the new DPI formulation was considered appropriate to perform. A double-blind, prospective, randomised phase IIb trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin DPI in patients with CF, over a 4-week period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicentre, phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (Clinicaltrials.gov trial registration number: NCT00645788; EudraCT number: 2008-008314-40) was conducted at 73 centres: USA (51), Canada (3), Germany (4), Sweden (3), Denmark (1), Israel (4), UK (1) and Australia (6). All study personnel and participants were blinded with respect to active treatment (ciprofloxacin DPI, formulated by Novartis&#x02019; PulmoSphere technology, or placebo), but not to dose. The study protocol was amended several times after enrolment started; the most important changes were the inclusion of children aged 12&#x02013;17&#x02005;years on availability of safety and pharmacokinetic data, and the addition of a higher ciprofloxacin DPI dose group (48.75&#x02005;mg) approximately 1&#x02005;year after the first participants were enrolled. The decision to add the higher dose was based on the good safety results with the 32.5&#x02005;mg dose and the desire to investigate more than one dose in the phase II trial. Investigation of the higher dose was also recommended by regulatory authorities to help to determine the most appropriate doses to carry forward into the phase III programme.</p><p>Participants were stratified according to maintenance macrolide usage (ie, participants currently treated with macrolide vs participants not currently treated with macrolide), and randomised 2:2:2:1 to 32.5&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI (corresponding to 50&#x02005;mg dry powder); placebo corresponding to 32.5&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI; 48.75&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI (corresponding to 75&#x02005;mg dry powder); or placebo corresponding to 48.75&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJRESP2015000100F1">figure 1</xref>A). All treatments were given twice daily for 29&#x02005;days (&#x000b1;1&#x02005;day).

Pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC and FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75%</sub>) were performed at every clinic visit or at discontinuation. Microbiology on sputum samples obtained at all study visits was performed at a central laboratory. Objectives were assessment of the change in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> density in sputum from baseline to all subsequent clinic visits and the incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates in sputum.

The safety analysis comprised monitoring for adverse events (AEs), and haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, pulse oximetry, vital signs, physical examinations and musculoskeletal examination for patients &#x02264;18&#x02005;years of age. These were performed at all clinic visits (except for haematology and clinical chemistry at day 15 (treatment phase) and 2-week follow-up visits). AEs were documented as treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) up to 7&#x02005;days after EOT and, along with serious AEs occurring at any time, were followed up to 30&#x02005;days post-therapy. Bronchospasm was defined as a drop of &#x02265;15% in FEV1 and pulmonary exacerbations were reported as AEs. Patients who received an antipseudomonal antibiotic for a pulmonary exacerbation were discontinued from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population.

Of these, 286 received either study drug or placebo, and were included in the ITT and safety analyses sets. The first and last subject visits were 5 May 2008 and 25 January 2011, respectively. The main reason for discontinuation was AEs; these included pulmonary exacerbations requiring an antipseudomonal antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJRESP2015000100F1">figure 1</xref>B). Baseline demographics were similar between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJRESP2015000100TB1">table 1</xref>).

Overall, 64% and 70% of patients in the ciprofloxacin DPI and placebo groups had received previous antipseudomonal maintenance therapy, respectively. Prior macrolide treatment status was similar for all groups (range 69.9&#x02013;72.3%) except the 48.75&#x02005;mg placebo group (54.3%).

No deaths occurred during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>A significant need remains for the development of additional and easier-to-use inhalational antibiotics. Prolonged use of systemically administered antibiotics to patients with CF infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is known to result in resistance to treatment and, therefore, diminished efficacy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> To maintain efficacy on repeated administration, the strategy is usually to add another antibiotic to the treatment, which would have either an additive or a synergistic effect.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Because the relevance of organism antibiotic sensitivity patterns has been questioned in recent years, the use of two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action to improve outcome is still common practice in most CF centres.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Antibiotics administered through a DPI route have the potential for greater efficacy and safety, owing to targeted delivery of higher concentrations of the drug to the lungs and lower systemic exposure. Additionally, the more convenient method of administration (compared with traditional nebulisers) is likely to improve patient compliance.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The primary end point of this study was to compare the change in FEV1 from baseline to EOT between patients receiving ciprofloxacin DPI and those receiving matching placebo. Based on the results of this study, the null hypotheses of no difference between the treatment groups could not be rejected.</p><p>Although the primary end point was not met, ciprofloxacin DPI was associated with some positive effects in analyses of the primary variable of lung function (FEV1), as well as on sputum bacterial load and health-related quality of life. In particular, there was a significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.05) between pooled ciprofloxacin DPI arms and pooled placebo arms in change in FEV1 from baseline to EOT. However, changes in FEV1 between 32.5 or 48.75&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI and matching placebo, the prespecified primary study end point, did not achieve statistical significance. Both ciprofloxacin DPI arms transiently showed nominally significant results of reduced total bacterial load (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) up to day 15 compared with matching placebo arms.</p><p>There was some evidence of both mucoid and non-mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reduction from baseline with ciprofloxacin DPI and, in the case of the former, these decreases were independent of resistance status at baseline. However, there was no sustained long-term decrease in the mean total bacterial load, as this change in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> density in the sputum from baseline was no longer statistically significant at EOT (ciprofloxacin DPI vs matching placebo; p=0.068). This finding has been noted in trials of other therapeutic agents, such as colistin.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Significant improvements in health-related quality of life, assessed with the CFQ-R, were observed in the ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5&#x02005;mg treatment group versus placebo as well as in pooled analyses at EOT (p=0.007 in the 32.5&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI group vs matching placebo), although these improvements were not sustained at the 4-week follow-up visit (p=0.935 in the 32.5&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI group vs matching placebo).</p><p>Several factors may have contributed to the primary end point not being met. Overall, the patients represented a heavily managed older population: approximately 77% of patients had received prior antipseudomonal maintenance therapy and mean age was 29.3&#x02005;years; (16.8% of patients were aged &#x02264;20&#x02005;years), indicating a relatively advanced disease state in most patients.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The limited progress in treatment over the last decade has reduced the potential to see clinically meaningful improvements in FEV1. Additionally, the lungs of older patients with CF are damaged to the point that significant improvements in FEV1 are less likely. Although suboptimal drug delivery or penetration could potentially have influenced the results of our study, data from phase I studies in CF participants indicate that twice daily ciprofloxacin DPI administration results in mean sputum ciprofloxacin concentrations of 34.9&#x02013;149.7&#x02005;mg/L, which are well above plasma levels achieved by systemic ciprofloxacin use (1.2&#x02013;3.0&#x02005;mg/L).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In addition, scintigraphic data support high and reproducible lung deposition of approximately 50% in healthy study participants and in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We therefore believe it is unlikely that poor drug delivery or penetration influenced the results. The overall reason for lack of FEV1 improvement in patients with CF treated with ciprofloxacin DPI is unknown, but this result demonstrates the complexity of CF inhalation studies and the possible need to consider alternative clinical end points in this population.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Small airway occlusion by purulent mucus is common in the lungs of patients with CF, and this is likely to be more severe in patients with advanced disease. Disease severity may therefore influence distribution and location of the inhaled drug, as with any inhaled antibiotic. This, in turn, can affect the local concentration of ciprofloxacin.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In addition to improved airway clearance before DPI administration, altering the dosing frequency may help to mitigate these challenges. In a study of levofloxacin inhalation solution, improved outcomes were observed with higher doses (240&#x02005;mg twice daily vs 120&#x02005;mg twice daily).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, however, there was no statistically significant difference between doses for the primary end point. The reasons for this are unclear, but may relate to a limited potential for improvement in this heavily pretreated patient population.</p><p>Overall, the safety parameters&#x02014;type of TEAEs and their intensity, relationship to the study drug, seriousness and outcome&#x02014;remained similar in all groups. There were three cases of haemoptysis considered to be related to the study drug, two of which were serious. However, it should be noted that haemoptysis is not an uncommon manifestation of pulmonary disease in CF. The 32.5&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI seemed to be slightly better tolerated than the 48.75&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI, with fewer cases of discontinuation due to AEs and fewer drug-related TEAEs. In both treatment groups, the incidence of cough was low. Inhalation of dry powder can result in cough, owing to the nature of the dosage form<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; however, in this study, although the inhaled mass was greater than that inhaled with the TOBI Podhaler,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> a low incidence of cough was reported. This may be due to the fact that ciprofloxacin DPI is less osmotic than tobramycin; therefore, a lesser effect is being exerted on the lung epithelium.</p><p>Because of the short-term nature of this study, we are unable to speculate on the impact of ciprofloxacin DPI therapy on the effectiveness of future oral ciprofloxacin in this patient population. Studies with tobramycin solution for inhalation indicate that intermittent use in patients with CF results in modest increases in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> MIC values, but the increased MICs are not associated with clinically relevant effects.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, to date, no study has specifically examined the effect of inhaled antibiotics on subsequent systemic therapy with the same drug or drug class.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with CF, twice daily treatment with ciprofloxacin DPI (32.5 or 48.75&#x02005;mg) for 28&#x02005;days did not result in significant improvements versus placebo in change in FEV1 from baseline to EOT, although some encouraging signs of efficacy were observed. It is possible that FEV1 is not the best end point for evaluating the efficacy of a short-term treatment on lung function in such a patient population. Ciprofloxacin DPI was safe and well tolerated; the 32.5&#x02005;mg dose had a slightly more favourable overall tolerability profile than the 48.75&#x02005;mg ciprofloxacin DPI dose. Additional studies assessing the efficacy of longer term (&#x0003e;28&#x02005;days) treatment as indicated by alternative end points, as well as further investigations on optimal delivery of ciprofloxacin DPI in stable patients with CF, may be worth pursuing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Barbara Hampel (formerly with Bayer HealthCare, Berlin, Germany) and Peter Reimnitz (formerly with Bayer Pharma, Wuppertal, Germany), for important intellectual contributions; and to acknowledge Fusion MD, Montreal, Canada, Highfield Communication, Oxford, England, and Kate Haynes of Chameleon Communications International, for providing medical writing services, with funding from Bayer Pharma AG.
