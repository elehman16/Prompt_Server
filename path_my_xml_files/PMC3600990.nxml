neurobehavioral and neurophysiological dysfunction and poorer brain structure. Preterms with severe intrauterine growth restriction are doubly jeopardized given their compromised brains. The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program improved outcome at early school-age for preterms with appropriate intrauterine growth. It also showed effectiveness to nine months for preterms with intrauterine growth restriction. The current study tested effectiveness into school-age for preterms with intrauterine growth restriction regarding executive function (EF), electrophysiology (EEG) and neurostructure (MRI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-three 9-year-old former growth-restricted preterms, randomized at birth to standard care (14 controls) or to the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (9 experimentals) were assessed with standardized measures of cognition, achievement, executive function, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The participating children were comparable to those lost to follow-up, and the controls to the experimentals, in terms of newborn background health and demographics. All outcome measures were corrected for mother&#x02019;s intelligence. Analysis techniques included two-group analysis of variance and stepwise discriminate analysis for the outcome measures, Wilks&#x02019; lambda and jackknifed classification to ascertain two-group classification success per and across domains; canonical correlation analysis to explore relationships among neuropsychological, electrophysiological and neurostructural domains at school-age, and from the newborn period to school-age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Controls and experimentals were comparable in age at testing, anthropometric and health parameters, and in cognitive and achievement scores. Experimentals scored better in executive function, spectral coherence, and cerebellar volumes. Furthermore, executive function, spectral coherence and brain structural measures discriminated controls from experimentals. Executive function correlated with coherence and brain structure measures, and with newborn-period neurobehavioral assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The intervention in the intensive care nursery improved executive function as well as spectral coherence between occipital and frontal as well as parietal regions. The experimentals&#x02019; cerebella were significantly larger than the controls&#x02019;. These results, while preliminary, point to the possibility of long-term brain improvement even of intrauterine growth compromised preterms if individualized intervention begins with admission to the NICU and extends throughout transition home. Larger sample replications are required in order to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial registration</title><p>The study is registered as a clinical trial.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Of the 4.3 million annual US births, 12.7% are premature
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], of these 30% are intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. IUGR preterms show increased mortality and morbidity, brain changes and developmental disabilities (&#x0003e;50%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reduces neurodevelopmental NICU-sequelae for appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) preterm infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Beneficial effects were also recently demonstrated for IUGR preterm infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Long-term effectiveness of NIDCAP into school-age so far has been demonstrated only for AGA preterm children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The current study examined the hypothesis that NIDCAP is also effective in improving school-age outcome for IUGR preterm-born children in terms of executive function (EF), as well as of occipital to frontal coherence (EEG), and frontal and cerebellar brain tissue volumes when compared to IUGR preterm-born children who received standard NICU care.</p><p>With advances in perinatology and neonatology survival rates not only of preterm infants appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but also of severely IUGR preterm infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have significantly increased. The added burden of intrauterine growth restriction in the prematurely born infant is associated with considerably higher cost not only in terms of NICU care but also in terms of long-term educational and social resource requirements when compared to those required by the AGA preterm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Research suggests that as IUGR preterms mature and both academic and life challenges increase in complexity, the gap between them and their full term and AGA preterm peers widens on many measures of cognition, educational achievement, and especially executive function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Preterm-born children in general and especially IUGR preterms are over-represented among those requiring early intervention and special education services. As the demands of the learning environment become steadily more complex, such children typically require increased educational services
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The impact of such children&#x02019;s alternative neuropsychological development on IQ and learning capacities intensifies in the face of increased demands on abstract integrative abilities. School-age IUGR preterm-born children are characterized by a range of mental control and executive function difficulties that include poor planning, problem solving, and impaired inhibitory controls, all of which are core abilities associated with poor educational performance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The lifetime costs associated with IUGR prematurity are not only those of the newborn intensive care they must receive but include also increased costs for educational and social resources
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>While some of the integrative developmental difficulties might be explained by the cumulative effect of medical complications such as temperature control and glucose metabolism instabilities inevitably associated with preterm birth
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the infant&#x02019;s sensory experience in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) environment with exposure to bright lights, high sound levels, and frequent stressful interventions exerts additional harmful, if not damaging effects on the dysmature brain, and thus further alters its subsequent development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The extrauterine environment appears to present an additional challenge for the already compromised brain of the IUGR preterm infant during a very sensitive period of rapid growth and differentiation. The goal of the NIDCAP intervention is to mitigate the sensory impact of the NICU environment. It is based on the assumption that all infants, no matter how small, display reliably observable behaviors in the form of autonomic and visceral responses, motor system patterns, and state behaviors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which express the current appropriateness for the individual infant of the environment (sound, light, activity, affective climate), as well as of the timing and quality of all caregiving and all social interactions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Each infant&#x02019;s behavior in turn may aid the caregiving professionals in the reliable identification of the infant&#x02019;s restfulness, comfort and well-being, as well as the infant&#x02019;s impending stress responses. Monitoring of the infant&#x02019;s behavior allows for ongoing provision of care in a manner that is matched to the infant&#x02019;s tolerance level, thus minimizing additional stressors on an already burdened system.</p><p>The NIDCAP approach has been demonstrated to be associated with improved longer-term outcomes in AGA preterm-born children in one study at age 5&#x000a0;years, with significantly fewer severe disabilities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and another study at age 8&#x000a0;years with significantly better visual-motor function and improved EEG spectral coherence, in the form of more effective connections between occipital and frontal lobes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in the NIDCAP compared to the control group. The current study extends this work by examining for the first time the effectiveness of NIDCAP interventions on neuropsychological function, cortical coherence and brain structure at school-age in the IUGR preterm-born population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>Follow-up evaluations at nine years (y) of age corrected for prematurity (CA) were conducted for the IUGR preterm-born children of a two-group (control - C and experimental - E) randomized controlled trial (RCT). The original study, reported elsewhere,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the study protocol for the school-age follow-up were approved in full compliance with the Helsinki Declaration by the institutional review board for research with human subjects at the study hospital. All outcome assessment personnel were purposefully kept blinded to the children&#x02019;s group assignments throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The original RCT sample
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] consisted of 30 preterm infants with severe IUGR and their parent(s). Recruitment extended from January 1996 &#x02013; May 2000; seventy-five infants and their parents met study criteria. Of these, 45 were approached and 30 families signed consent. They and their infants were randomized to control (C) (standard care in the study hospital at the time of study) and experimental (E) care (NIDCAP), yielding 18 C- and 12 E-group subjects. Non-participating eligible infants and their families were comparable to those participating in all background criteria. All infants were recruited from the NICU of a large tertiary care academic center in an urban US setting (&#x0003e;7000 births/year). The NICU was a 48-bed level-III unit that served almost exclusively newborns delivered at the same hospital. IUGR was defined as birth weight and head circumference&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5<sup>th</sup> percentile (%ile) for GA and due to placental insufficiency as documented by two or more of the following: Maternal high blood pressure, oligohydramnios, and/or absent or compromised Doppler-diagnosed end diastolic flow velocity. All deliveries were initiated due to the fetus&#x02019; severe growth restriction.</p><p>Selection criteria included: For the mother - residence in the greater urban area surrounding the study hospital; age &#x02265;14&#x000a0;years; absence of major maternal medical/psychiatric illness, chronic medication treatment, and history of substance abuse; telephone accessibility; and some English language facility. For the infant these included - inborn at study hospital; GA 29 - 33w by estimated date of confinement (EDC) based on 2<sup>nd</sup> or 1<sup>st</sup> trimester fetal ultrasound, mother&#x02019;s dates and/or Ballard GA assessment

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The 30 (18C, 12E) original study families were re-contacted once the children reached nine years (y) corrected age for prematurity (CA). Three of the families were not located; four declined participation. Of the original 30 study infants&#x02019; families, 23 (14C; 9E) agreed to participate in the follow-up study and signed a new institution-approved consent form prior to data acquisition. Background comparability of the participating school-age children and those not participating was examined in terms of newborn medical, anthropometric and demographic background variables. Comparability of the participating school-age C- and E-group children was assessed in terms of their newborn anthropometric, medical and demographic background variables as well as in terms of school-age anthropometric, medical and schooling background and their mothers&#x02019; IQ.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This included effort at primary care nursing, variable staff-dependent parent inclusion, shielding of incubators, use of infant clothing, side and foot rolls and pacifiers, and variable staff-dependent encouragement of skin-to-skin holding and breast-feeding. Contamination effects from E- to C-group infants were not prevented systematically nor measured, e.g. a nurse involved in the care of an E-subject might also provide care to a C-subject on an occasional basis. Any E-effects found, therefore, should be considered conservative since by definition they were in excess of possible C-group contamination.</p><p>The E-group received the NIDCAP intervention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which emphasized each infant&#x02019;s behavioral individuality. The E-group&#x02019;s NIDCAP team consisted of a developmental psychologist and a pediatrician, both certified NIDCAP Professionals in keeping with the NIDCAP Federation International&#x02019;s (NFI) certification standards
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and experienced in the implementation of the NIDCAP intervention. They provided weekly detailed infant observations and daily contact with the E-group&#x02019;s professional care providers (nurses, neonatologists, physio- and respiratory therapists, and social workers) in the NICU and with the parents. Their role was to support caregivers and parents in their understanding of the infants&#x02019; stress and comfort signals, and to adjust their care accordingly in order to ensure continuity and consistency of individualized care for each E-group infant. Weekly formal behavioral observations translated into neurobehavioral reports and daily (seven days/week) support to individualized caregiving began with initial stabilization and ended at 2&#x000a0;weeks corrected age (2wCA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Newborn medical, anthropometric and demographic background measures; school-age anthropometric and health measures, and mothers&#x02019; IQ</title><p>Newborn medical, anthropometric and demographic information available in a database from the infants&#x02019; previous evaluations was accessed for the school-age study sample. These data were used to compare the participating to non-participating children, as well as to assess comparability between C- and E-group children at school-age. Anthropometric, medical and academic history measures at school-age were obtained by direct measurement in terms of weight, height and head circumference as well as in terms of growth percentiles for corrected age, and by parent interview
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It was hypothesized that the school-age participants and the non-participants would be comparable in medical and demographic background measures. It was furthermore hypothesized that the C- and E-group children at school-age would be comparable in newborn medical and demographic, and in school-age anthropometric, medical and academic history measures.</p><p>Since the literature reports the importance of parent IQ for child school-age functioning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], mothers&#x02019; IQ was assessed at the school-age study point with the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This test yields three standardized scores, each with a mean (X) of 100 and a standard deviation (SD) of 15, namely a Verbal IQ, a Non-Verbal IQ, and an IQ Composite. Confidentiality was assured prior to administration of the IQ measure, which was performed by a skilled examiner in a private comfortable testing room.</p><p>It was hypothesized that C-and E-groups at school-age would be comparable in parent IQ. It was also hypothesized that the children&#x02019;s school-age cognitive function might be correlated with parent IQ, in which case all outcome measures would have to be corrected for parent IQ. On the basis of the earlier AGA school-age NIDCAP outcome study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] significant effects favoring the IUGR-preterm E-group school-age children were hypothesized specifically for neuropsychological functioning in terms of executive function (EF) including visual-motor and memory aspects. On the basis of the earlier AGA spectral coherence findings at school-age
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] as well as IUGR spectral coherence findings in the newborn period
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] it was hypothesized that the electrophysiological functioning effects would favor the E-group in terms of increased spectral coherence between long-distance frontal and occipital brain regions as well as decreased widely distributed coherences of short and medium distances. Neurostructural effects reflected in improved frontal white matter and cerebellar volumes for the E-group were hypothesized on the basis of the current literature

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], which assesses integrative gestalt planning abilities, perceptual organization, visual motor planning and visual memory in three conditions, the Copy condition, the Immediate Recall and the Delayed Recall conditions (20&#x000a0;minutes after the original copy condition). The Developmental Scoring System (DSS-ROCF)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] yields for each of the three conditions three mutually exclusive scores, an Organization score, a Structural Elements Accuracy score, and an Incidental Elements Accuracy score. These nine scores were utilized. All have been demonstrated to be sensitive to prematurity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The <italic>Organization</italic> score provides a measure of the child&#x02019;s appreciation of the basic structure of the design. It ranges from 1 (poorly organized) to 13 (well organized). The <italic>Structural Elements Accuracy</italic> score quantifies the number of line segments (0 to 25) reproduced from the ROCF Base Rectangle (BR) and Main Structures (MS). The <italic>Incidental Elements Accuracy</italic> score quantifies the number (0 to 39) of Outer Configuration and Internal Detail segments.</p><p>All neuropsychological assessments were performed by an experienced neuropsychologist, purposefully blinded as to the subjects&#x02019; group identities. All studies were performed at a specially designed neurobehavioral laboratory outfitted with a one-way mirror window and two hidden cameras; the scoring of all assessments was double-checked for accuracy. Parent(s), if they so chose, and their children agreed, watched the assessments through a one-way-mirror window or were in the room with their child. Rest breaks were interspersed as indicated. All neuropsychological variables derived from the assessments were coded and double-checked by one of two experienced blinded coders.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurophysiological outcome measures at school-age</title><p>Following the neuropsychological assessment, the children were assessed neurophysiologically (EEG) in the Eyes Closed (ECL) alert state. ECL was chosen for analysis since eye movement contamination tends to be minimal in this condition. Paroxysmal epochs of eye movement, muscle activity, and whole body movement were visually identified by the senior neurophysiologist and excluded from subsequent analysis. ECL EEG was collected in 2-minute-segments for a total of 12&#x000a0;minutes by a registered EEG technologist with expertise in pediatric EEG. Both the neurophysiologist and technologist were blinded as to the subjects&#x02019; study and group identities. All neurophysiologic assessments were performed in a specially designed research EEG suite immediately adjacent to the neurobehavioral testing laboratory. The parent(s), if they chose and their children agreed, watched the EEG assessments through a one way-mirror window within the EEG suite and/or sat with their child in the EEG booth within the suite.</p><p>EEG data were collected from 32 EEG channels at a 256&#x000a0;Hz sampling rate with subsequent bandpass filtering from 1&#x02013;50&#x000a0;Hz and a 60&#x000a0;Hz notch filter to minimize environmentally induced artifacts such as data contamination from nearness to electrical power mains.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Remaining eye blink and eye movement artifacts, which may be surprisingly prominent even during the eyes closed state, were removed from EEG by utilizing the source component technique
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] as implemented in the BESA&#x02122; software package. Spectral analysis, including spectral coherence calculation as outlined by van Drongelen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], was performed using a Nicolet&#x02122; software package. Using a spectral resolution of 2&#x000a0;Hz per data point (16 points over 32&#x000a0;Hz), among all 32 channels, 4416 individual coherence variables were created. A multivariate regression analysis, originally described by Semlitsch
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], was used which, by first identifying a signal proportional to a known source of artifact (e.g., prefrontal slow delta for eye blink artifact and fast beta for temporal muscle artifact) effectively removes remaining, low amplitude, artifactual contributions. As previously described, these coherence variables &#x02013; now largely free from artifact - were reduced in number by using in-house-developed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] principal components analysis (PCA) software that includes Varimax rotation and is suited to factoring of large asymmetrical matrices. Forty coherence factors, previously created on an independent age-comparable normal control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;219), and reflecting 48% of total coherence variance

Non-invasive 3D-MRI of brain structure was used in order to test for NIDCAP-supported brain structural improvement at school-age and to evaluate the assumption of neurodevelopmental continuity to school-age. Data were acquired at 3Tesla (Siemens Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with an MR imager using a 32-channel head coil. High spatial resolution echo-planar diffusion weighted images were acquired (24&#x000a0;cm FOV, matrix 128x128, 2&#x000a0;mm thick contiguous slices). Geometric distortion from magnetic susceptibility differences was minimized with a short echo time (TE&#x02009;=&#x02009;78&#x000a0;ms) and parallel imaging (iPAT 2). Thirty b&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000&#x000a0;s/mm2 images were acquired at directions evenly spaced on the sphere along with five baseline (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) images. Volumetric tissue segmentation was utilized. MRI tissue volumes were measured in cubic millimeters, per structure. To control for ventricular size, all tissue measures were expressed as a percentage of total parenchyma. White matter (WM) was identified for the right and left frontal lobes, and percent of total tissue volumes were measured for the right and left cerebellum for the test of the primary hypothesis, which stated that frontal lobe (prefrontal inclusive of pre-motor and sensorimotor) white matter and cerebellum volumes would differentially favor the E-group and support hypothesized improved EF. Frontal lobe volumes are widely reported of key importance for executive and associated integrative functions. The sensitivity of the cerebellum has been highlighted more recently: Cerebellar structures develop rapidly between 29 and 33&#x000a0;weeks gestation - the corresponding high metabolic rate makes them particularly vulnerable to trophic disturbances, and they have wide-ranging interconnectivity with many higher cortical areas well beyond the traditionally assumed motor function area, implicating them in various meta-cognitive function abnormalities in the preterm born child
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and more recently implicated in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] which includes impairments in executive and visual spatial functions. The primary MRI outcome measures of bilateral frontal (F) WM and bilateral cerebellar inclusive of vermis tissue volumes were supplemented on a purely exploratory basis by additional descriptive brain structure tissue volume measures, given the relative dearth of information regarding specificity of involvement of brain regions in the IUGR preterm condition at school-age. Given the early prenatal brain insult involved in IUGR, the exploration attempted to cast a wide net. Additional exploratory measurements included the tissue volumes of bilateral frontal grey matter (GM), as well as bilateral WM and GM of occipital, temporal and parietal regions, total tissue volumes of brainstem inclusive of the ventral diencephalon, right and left thalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala, as well as the insula. Post-acquisition MRI processing techniques were used for tissue segmentation and 3D renderings with advanced volume visualization and quantification as described and utilized elsewhere
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Regional tissue volumes were defined by warping an anatomical template onto each subject&#x02019;s data using non-rigid registration algorithms

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Factor 3 indicated significantly increased and surprisingly symmetrical, bi-hemispheric, across midline, long-distance coherence for the E-group connecting the frontal left and bilateral occipital-parietal brain regions as well as the frontal left and bilateral occipital-parietal regions in a very broad frequency band (4 &#x02013; 20&#x000a0;Hz; theta, alpha and slow beta) with maximum frequency at 8&#x000a0;Hz (alpha). This indicates significantly more mature and effective cortical coupling between these distant brain regions

One other factor, Coherence Factor 17, showed a trend in the direction of lower coherence for the E- than C-group children (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.11). Factor 17 indicated E-group decreased medium-to-short distance coherence between temporal right and midline posterior frontal regions, suggesting decreased cortical coupling between these regions for the E-group. This would be consistent with reduction of short distance over-coupling between regions, which by school-age are expected to function differentially. The persistence of over-coupling in the C-group may well reflect the effect of IUGR-related pathology

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] the children who were in the NIDCAP-group showed significantly better neurobehavioral functioning as measured with the APIB
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] than did the control-group children as newborns. The correlation analysis on neurobehavioral functioning measures from the newborn to the school-age study point showed, in specific, that the newborns with better attention organization displayed better EF later as reflected in the Organization (i.e. Gestalt appreciation) score in the Delayed Recall (i.e. memory) condition of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>The demonstrated superiority in executive functioning measures for E- versus C-group IUGR children in spite of academic and IQ equivalence is consistent with the results of other investigators, who suggest that despite considerable shared variability, the measures of executive functioning maintain unique variance that is not encapsulated in the construct of global intelligence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. The demands for the skill set considered under the general rubric of EF including planning, response inhibition, working memory, organizing and strategizing ongoing behavior increase significantly in middle and later school years when the child is increasingly required to monitor and self direct behavior. It may be hypothesized that the impact of EF differences may become increasingly apparent at a later age since it is reflected in measures of independent functioning and the development and maintenance of appropriate social relationships of increasing importance at later ages.</p><p>Electrophysiological function at school-age was also improved. Similar to the earlier findings for the IUGR sample in the newborn period (2wCA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and its more recent replication study with a second IUGR sample
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], NIDCAP effects on EEG coherence resulted in a pattern of decreased short distance connectivity between multiple adjacent brain regions. However, it appears to have also resulted in increased long-distance, across-midline bilateral frontal to occipital connectivities in the E-group. This is similar to the pattern found in a comparable-in-gestational age AGA preterm sample in the newborn period
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] as well as an extremely early-born AGA sample at 8&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Without the experimental intervention in the preterm period the IUGR-preterm-born school-age children in the control group who did not receive experimental intervention in the preterm period show continued excessive cortical short-distance connectivities, possibly a carry-over from the multiple pathological influences generated by the IUGR condition. The IUGR children who received the NIDCAP intervention in the NICU appear to have preserved some of the plasticity evidenced in increased long-distance coherences in an AGA school-age sample, despite the IUGR condition. Presumably such connectivity is more conducive to better differentiated mental control function and visual motor integration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. In particular, Coherence factor 3, stronger in the IUGR E-group, appears to suggest increased connectivity between the dorso-lateral frontal cortex and bilateral occipital parietal regions. These regions are known to be active in visual spatial working memory
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] and thought to be largely independent of IQ
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Furthermore, better connectivity was correlated with better ROCF performance, an integrative visual spatial working memory task, in the IUGR E-group. Thus, the intervention appears to ameliorate excessive coupling noticeable still at school-age in the IUGR control group children, and to enhance cortical function in long distance connectivities supportive of differentiated attention regulation, visual spatial memory organization and executive function in the IUGR experimental group children. This finding of enhanced long distance cortical coupling and its implication for more effective executive functioning has been supported by others
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] who investigated whether varying demands on central executive processes are reflected by differences in coherence activity. Their results indicate that a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of fronto-parietal long-range coherence may be considered as plausible candidates for the neural correlates of central executive function.</p><p>This is the first report of NIDCAP effectiveness at school-age for IUGR preterm-born children, and the first documentation of brain structural differences for IUGR preterm born children at school-age. The tighter distribution of right and left cerebellar volume measures around the group mean for the experimental as compared to the control group speaks not only to the greater symmetry of right and left cerebellum in the experimental group but also perhaps a better opportunity to develop than the control group experienced. The larger tissue volumes identified consistently for the right and left cerebellum are interpreted to reflect intervention-enhanced connectivity of the cerebellum with multiple other cortical regions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>] in particular frontal and prefrontal cortex
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>] as in this study corroborated by the cortical coherence findings. The findings substantiate the cerebellum&#x02019;s increasingly recognized, important role in complex behavior, including visual-spatial organization and complex integrative and executive function as exemplified in poor ROCFT performance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>] and cognitive and mental control functions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>].</p><p>Normative data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] for a healthy sample (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;433) of children from 4 to 18&#x000a0;years of age indicated mean cerebellar volumes of 132.82&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>, which corresponded to 10.52% of brain parenchyma, comparable to the 10.55% found for the IUGR sample&#x02019;s E-group while the IUGR C-group&#x02019;s cerebellar volume was only 9.88%, a significant difference (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).</p><p>Thus, the current study shows the cerebellum amenable to very early behavioral intervention during the time of its most rapid development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. The cerebellar findings are in keeping with the improved ROCFT findings and the coherence findings of enhanced broad frontal to broad occipital long distance connectivities observed in the experimental group. The results identified for the IUGR preterm born school-age sample are internally consistent and consistent with the most recent literature on the cerebellum and its functions. They are also consistent with two IUGR preterm studies in the newborn period. They speak to the effectiveness of the experimental intervention also for severely IUGR preterm infants who are already compromised in the womb with respect to the growth and function of multiple organs including brain. The results provide additional evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention delivered in the immediate newborn period. When the study children reached school-age, those who had been in the NIDCAP group demonstrated significantly better spatial visualization and mental control than those who received standard NICU care. The EEG-derived measures of cortical connectivity also successfully differentiated E-group from C-group children at school-age and corroborated the neuropsychological findings in terms of the neural pathways implicated. The findings, although limited by the small sample size, potentially have important implications for the amelioration of the specific learning disabilities with which so many early born IUGR children struggle. The study&#x02019;s findings contribute to the validation of the hypothesis that underlies NIDCAP, namely that the fetal brain in the late second and throughout the third trimester is differentially sensitive to the repeated stressful events experienced in the NICU, and that this vulnerability may be compensated for by consistent individualized developmental care implementation. While the specific pathways involved in NIDCAP effectiveness are not fully understood, consistent implementation of individualized cue-based reintegration times specifically to support reliable re-synchronization of the autonomic, motor and state systems as well as attention organization appears to strengthen the infant&#x02019;s self regulatory capacities. In the face of the many demands of intensive care, this individualized support appears to provide an opportunity for the immature brain to develop its connectivities in a more adaptive manner than is the case in a more traditional faster paced approach to intensive care. The reliable behavioral subsystem reintegration may provide protection of programmed cell death and of the development of better inter-cortical connectivities which may guard against compromised brain development. The neurobiological processes underlying NIDCAP effectiveness are speculative. It is postulated that NIDCAP processes may involve stabilization of the NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-d-aspartate) axis, protection against neurocytotoxic damage, lowered sensory and pain thresholds, and increased stability with modulated thresholds of reactivity and sensitivity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. Other potential mechanisms, inferred from results of differential mothering and sensory experience experiments in animal models, suggest that continuity and reliability of maternal care promotes hippocampal synaptogenesis as well as spatial learning and memory through systems known to mediate experience-dependent neural development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>], which appear to also include the cerebellum
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. All of these effects may enhance NIDCAP group preterm infants&#x02019; capacity to take advantage of environmental offers in and beyond discharge from the stressful NICU environment.</p><p>In the NIDCAP model of caregiving, the infant&#x02019;s behavior guides the caregiver in improving the infant&#x02019;s comfort and in decreasing the infant&#x02019;s stress. The NIDCAP approach focuses on individualization of care in the NICU as based on each infant&#x02019;s behavioral cues, to support each infant&#x02019;s strengths and to reduce the level of stress and pain experienced by the infant. Conscious, deliberate, and thoughtful caregiving and the consistent familiar presence of, and intimate contact with, the parents and other family members appears to support the infant to be more calm and self-regulated. This in turn appears to facilitate brain development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>]. This study provides the first indication that NIDCAP may demonstrate specific beneficial brain developmental effects for IUGR experimental group children not only in infancy but likely also into school-age; this is very encouraging.</p><p>Interpretation of the findings however requires much caution. The study&#x02019;s most serious limitation is the small sample size. Further substantiation by larger longitudinal follow-up studies into school-age is necessary to corroborate the result of this preliminary, while promising, small study. Advances in newborn intensive care since the time of the NICU intervention phase of the study have implications for the interpretation of the results also. Although the exact underlying mechanisms of NIDCAP effectiveness remain to be discovered, evidence from this study points to the intervention&#x02019;s possible long-term effectiveness. Future research is required to validate the encouraging results reported and to determine the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness beyond school-age into adolescence and early adulthood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite significant fetal compromise due to severe IUGR, preterm brain plasticity appears to prevail and specific brain based improvement that includes cerebellar improvement and consistent associated neuro-cognitive and spectral coherence findings appears to occur for the group that received the NIDCAP intervention in the NICU. Thus, NIDCAP, an individualized, behavior observation-based newborn intensive care and environment adaptation, appears to improve significantly the neurodevelopment of IUGR children with beneficial effects lasting into school-age in terms of behavior, functional brain connectivity and brain structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>3D: Three dimensional;
