A large retrospective cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated with GH reported an approximate threefold higher rate of second neoplasms than expected (SIR 3&#x000b7;2, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;9&#x02013;5&#x000b7;5) at 15 years of follow-up.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This rate decreased somewhat after 32 years of follow-up, but still remained elevated (SIR 2&#x000b7;1, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;3&#x02013;3&#x000b7;5).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Although a definitive link between elevated IGF-I levels associated with GH treatment and biological end-points has not been shown, it has been recommended that IGF-I levels in individual patients should be maintained within age- and gender-based reference ranges.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We found that in patients dosed conventionally with 0&#x000b7;04 mg/kg/day, the proportion of IGF-I levels above +2 SDS was 30%. Others have reported similar excursions. For example, 28% of pubertal patients treated with 0&#x000b7;7 mg/kg/week had high IGF-I concentrations,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> as did 45% of SGA patients treated with 0&#x000b7;057 mg/kg/day for 2 years.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In another report, 17% of GHD patients had IGF-I excursions above +2 SDS after 2 years even when the GH dose was based on body surface area at an average dose of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day (equivalent to 0&#x000b7;035/mg/day).<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A GH dose-sparing effect of IGF-I-based dosing was also noted in a study of adult Japanese patients with GHD who were switched from a conventional weight-based dose regimen, with a concomitant increase in the number of patients who were maintained within the reference range for IGF-I SDS.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The present analysis demonstrated that targeting IGF-I to the mean (i.e., 0 SDS) significantly decreased the proportion of IGF-I measurements &#x0003e;+2 SDS at the end of year 2 compared to conventional weight-based dosing. Decreasing the risk of exposure to high IGF-I levels potentially reduces the theoretical risk of cancer and other adverse events related to high IGF-I levels.</p><p>There are limitations to the present analysis. It was not prospectively designed for the purpose of dose-sparing and was not intended to provide any specific dosing target or recommendations. With that said, based on our analysis, an IGF-I level around the mean for the population rather than at the upper limit of normal would seem to be a reasonable approach in terms of cost-effectiveness and more prudent in terms of safety, without incurring any compromise of efficacy, especially for patients with GHD. Although IGF-I targets were met equally in patients with GHD and ISS, gains in height were significantly less for ISS patients.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This may indicate a degree of IGF-I insensitivity, as well as GH insensitivity, in the ISS patients, who may require a more aggressive IGF-I target.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Also, the 2-year duration of the study may not have been long enough for all patients to achieve optimal catch-up growth.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As other IGF-I targets have yet to be fully examined, the optimal IGF-I target, particularly for non-GHD conditions, remains to be identified, and long-term clinical benefits of dosing based on IGF-I targets still need to be demonstrated. One proposed model suggests using higher IGF-I targets (+2 to +3 SDS) to maximize height during the catch-up phase followed by lower targets for maintenance.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Furthermore, a general IGF-based dosing strategy would not preclude also individualizing treatment based upon responsiveness in growth.</p><p>The lack of IGF-I assay standardization and accepted normative reference ranges are additional factors that may impact the generalizability of the reported results. A consensus statement put forth by the Growth Hormone Research Society has outlined the obstacles and steps needed to move towards a standardized process.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Until an accepted standardized assay is available, clinicians should utilize an assay with demonstrated reliability, collect and process samples appropriately and adjust to appropriate age and gender-matched reference norms,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which should be requested from each laboratory whenever possible. When feasible, clinicians should attempt to utilize the same assay and technique for a patient over time, although patient factors, such as health insurance, may be a barrier.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In addition to interassay variability, clinicians should also be aware of intrapatient variability when interpreting IGF-I assay results, especially with regard to borderline values.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>In conclusion, IGF-based GH dosing targeted to the age- and gender-adjusted mean (0 SDS) in GHD and ISS children resulted in a higher &#x00394;HSDS/GH dose ratio than conventional weight-based dosing, despite comparable levels of IGF-I and &#x00394;HSDS achieved, and may offer a more dose-sparing mode of GH therapy than traditional weight-based GH dosing. IGF-I-based dosing targeted to the mean SDS also decreased exposure to IGF-I levels above +2 SDS and may therefore address some of the theoretical safety concerns related to GH treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for the statistical analysis was provided by Novo Nordisk Inc.
