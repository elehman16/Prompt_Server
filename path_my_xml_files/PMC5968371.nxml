Drug combinations used in these strategies do not target the gametocyte stage of the parasite, allowing continued human to mosquito transmission despite clearance of the asexual blood stage infection. WHO recommends addition of a single 0&#x000b7;25 mg/kg dose of primaquine (single low-dose primaquine) to standard artemisinin-based combination therapy to reduce onward transmission of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in areas of low malaria transmission and emerging antimalarial drug resistance.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, important questions remain.</p><p id="para30"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para40"><bold>Evidence before the study</bold></p><p id="para50">We searched <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs30">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> and PubMed between Sept 18, 2015, and Sept 15, 2017, using the search terms &#x0201c;primaquine&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;methylene blue&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;malaria&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;falciparum&#x0201d;, OR &#x0201c;primaquine&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;methylene blue&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;transmission&#x0201d;, OR &#x0201c;primaquine&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;methylene blue&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;gametocyte&#x0201d;. No language restrictions were used in the search. Although numerous studies, including randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, have reported on the efficacy and safety of single low-dose primaquine as a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> gametocytocidal drug, only four efficacy studies used membrane feeding assays, the gold standard for infectivity assays, to assess the transmission-blocking effect of primaquine. None of these studies assessed the efficacy of primaquine combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine. One study in Colombia assessed the efficacy of adding a single dose of 0&#x000b7;75 mg/kg primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine on <italic>P falciparum</italic> gametocyte clearance. Using blood smear microscopy, authors found lower gametocytaemia on days 4 and 8, but no clearance of gametocytes by day 8. Since no direct measurements of membrane feeding assays were done, it is unclear if the persisting gametocytes would have been infectious to mosquitoes. Eight published trials of methylene blue were identified. Two studies assessed the effect of methylene blue with either artesunate, amodiaquine, or artesunate-amodiaquine on gametocytes. Groups receiving methylene blue had lower gametocytaemia by at least day 7. Neither of these studies assessed transmission using membrane feeding assays, nor was methylene blue paired with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the major drugs used in community drug interventions, known for its long prophylactic period.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the membrane feeding assay to directly quantify the effect of primaquine (partnered with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine) and methylene blue (partnered with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) on human to mosquito transmission of <italic>P falciparum</italic>. Our findings show that antimalarial combinations of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine with 0&#x000b7;25 mg/kg primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with a 3-day treatment course of 15 mg/kg methylene blue are safe and block human to mosquito transmission by day 2 post-treatment.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">Potent gametocytocidal drugs primaquine and methylene blue are two promising transmission-blocking tools that can be used for falciparum malaria control and elimination. Future studies should focus on assessment of the community-level effect of adding gametocytocidal drugs to first-line treatments and large-scale, drug-based interventions, including seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine) and mass drug administration (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine).</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para100">First, whether addition of single low-dose primaquine to non-artemisinin-based combination therapy can prevent <italic>P falciparum</italic> transmission is unclear. The antimalarial combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine has strong treatment and chemoprophylactic effects. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine is the standard drug combination for seasonal malaria chemoprevention and has been highly effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in the Sahel and sub-Sahel regions of Africa, where seasonal malaria chemoprevention is widely implemented.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, the increased gametocyte production associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> might influence its ability to affect malaria transmission. Thus, adding an effective gametocytocidal drug could greatly increase the community-level effect of seasonal malaria chemoprevention.</p><p id="para110">The second question is whether addition of methylene blue (also known as methylthioninium chloride) to artemisinin-based combination therapy reduces post-treatment transmission potential. Methylene blue has highly potent gametocytocidal effects<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and, if given with artemisinin-based combination therapy, might provide additional protection against the development and spread of artemisinin resistance.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> However, no formal infectivity studies have been done using methylene blue.

Adverse events were assessed at each follow-up visit and monitored passively by medical staff. All adverse events were graded by severity (eg, mild, grade 1; moderate, grade 2; or severe, grade 3) according to the study's standard operating procedures and based on the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) toxicity tables. Adverse events were further categorised based on whether they were considered serious by the treating physician, and categorised by their causal relationship to the study drugs (unrelated or probably not, possibly, probably, or definitely related). Adverse events were considered causal if they were categorised as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="para260">Based on preliminary data from a similar infectivity trial,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> sample size calculations assumed that the proportion of individuals that would infect at least one mosquito was 0&#x000b7;79, and that on average the proportion of infected mosquitoes was 0&#x000b7;25, resulting in a probability of infection of 0&#x000b7;79&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;0&#x000b7;25=0&#x000b7;198.

The number of participants who had an adverse event differed between the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue groups (p=0&#x000b7;031), although this effect was mainly due to frequent reports of blue urine among participants in the methylene blue group. As blue urine is not known to adversely affect health, a separate subanalysis excluding blue urine was done. After exclusion of blue urine, the number of participants that had an adverse event was similar across the four groups. Of the 162 adverse events that occurred throughout the study period, 145 (90%) were mild (grade 1) and 16 (10%) were moderate (grade 2) events. One (1%) severe (grade 3) headache was reported on day 7 in a participant in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine group, although this event was considered unlikely to be caused by study drug. Of the 80 adverse events that were considered related to study drug, 78 (98%) were mild and two (3%) were of moderate severity (headache and loss of appetite). Of the 78 mild adverse events, 19 (24%) were blue urine. An 11-year-old participant in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue arm halted methylene blue treatment after day 1 because of vomiting after drug administration.

Addition of single low-dose primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or methylene blue to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine resulted in almost complete blockage of human to mosquito transmission by day 2, and a larger reduction in transmission than that offered by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone. No differences in adverse events (excluding blue urine) or haemolysis were observed between groups, suggesting primaquine and methylene blue are safe in this population.</p><p id="para410">We examined gametocyte dynamics and infectivity to mosquitoes following treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue, two drug regimens that have important roles in malaria control and elimination efforts. The importance of our direct assessments of infectivity is illustrated by the observation that the transmission-blocking effect of gametocytocidal drugs precedes gametocyte clearance.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Additionally, our findings support observations that infectious gametocytes persist after administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, early identification and treatment of <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection to prevent formation of mature gametocytes is crucial for malaria control.</p><p id="para420">To our knowledge, this study is the first to formally show the potent transmission-blocking effect of methylene blue in <italic>P falciparum</italic> gametocyte carriers using mosquito infectivity assays, confirming the potency of methylene blue as suggested by previous in-vitro<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and gametocyte clearance<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> studies.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine alone did not have an effect on reducing human to mosquito transmission in the week following treatment. Most individuals treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine carried gametocytes for at least 1 month following treatment with no reduction in mosquito infection rates achieved by day 7 after treatment. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine is recommended by WHO for use in seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Although the primary objective of seasonal malaria chemoprevention is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality and not to directly reduce transmission, adding single low-dose primaquine to seasonal malaria chemoprevention might confer indirect community benefits for malaria transmission by reducing post-treatment transmission potential. Transmission reduction by seasonal malaria chemoprevention could be further improved by expanding the age range to include adolescents because gametocyte carriage is high in this population<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> as observed by the age group enrolled in our study.</p><p id="para440">Countries moving towards malaria elimination could consider adding a transmission-blocking drug to first-line treatments or community-wide mass drug administration to rapidly reduce population-level malaria transmission. Modelling studies suggest that, given adequate coverage and multiple rounds of mass drug administration, addition of gametocytocidal drugs (eg, primaquine and methylene blue) to antimalarial combinations with a long prophylactic period (eg, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) might result in larger reductions in transmission than with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment alone.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Formal trials are needed to confirm the best-use scenario for these drug-based transmission-blocking tools, including the target transmission intensity and appropriate integration into other malaria interventions.</p><p id="para450">Our study revealed that gametocytocidal drugs might have different effects on male and female gametocytes.

First, the study population analysed was not as per intention to treat, as one patient was lost to follow-up and seven patients withdrew. This factor was unlikely to cause attribution bias since the reasons given for withdrawals were unrelated to study drug. Second, our study endpoint was the proportion of oocyst-positive mosquitoes, based on the assumption that even low oocyst densities are likely to render mosquitoes infective.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, not all mosquitoes with oocysts might have gone on to produce infective sporozoites or could have done so at a reduced rate. Third, the study sample was limited to G6PD-normal male participants in Mali with high <italic>P falciparum</italic> gametocyte densities. Therefore, our findings might not represent the effect of single low-dose primaquine and methylene blue in other malaria-infected populations, particularly those with lower gametocyte densities who have lower pre-treatment and post-treatment transmission potential and G6PD-deficient populations. Although studies in Burkina Faso showed that methylene blue is unlikely to be responsible for clinically relevant haemolysis in individuals with or without G6PD-deficiency,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> additional studies are needed on the safety of methylene blue among G6PD-deficient individuals.
