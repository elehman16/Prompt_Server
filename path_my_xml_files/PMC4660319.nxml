This study, nested within the NIHR Laser in Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension (LiGHT) Trial, looks into the main reasons for non-participation in a Trial investigating the quality of life and cost-effectiveness of two established glaucoma treatments, and whether the use of audiovisual material (video) improves recruitment rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Prospective participants to the LiGHT Trial were approached by a member of the research team and were given an explanation of the Trial. Patients who refused to participate were asked to explain the reason for their refusal choosing from a pre-populated list of 12 items and were also given the option to add other reasons. Fifteen months into the Trial a video was also used to facilitate recruitment. The material of the video was the same as delivered by the recruiting team, but was delivered by the Principal Investigator (PI).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Preliminary data indicate that the overall non-participation rate is 14.2%. The most common reasons for non-participation are treatment preconceptions (63.5%) and unwillingness to participate in research (25.4%). A minority of patients chose to have no treatment at all (6.3%). Incorporation of the video significantly reduced refusal rates from 21.1% to 8.5% (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment preconceptions are the predominant reason non-participation in a RCT. Incorporation of the video significantly reduced non-participation rates; it is possible that the involvement of the PI might have a positive effect on recruitment.</p></sec></body></article>
