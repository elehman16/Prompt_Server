The study was approved by the local institutional review board.</p><p>A total of 183 patients with history of an operation to treat primary colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to undergo cap-assisted colonoscopy (CAP group) or standard colonoscopy (non-CAP group) based on computer-generated random sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The endoscopist performed about 70 colonoscopies under supervision and an additional 50 colonoscopies without any supervision, and had no experience in the use of CAP before onset of this trial. Considering technical convenience, patients who underwent right-sided colon resection, subtotal colectomy, or total proctocolectomy were excluded before randomization. Colonoscopy was performed for postoperative surveillance. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram demonstrating enrollment of the patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e4869-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Procedures and outcome measurement</title><p>Before their procedures, all participants received standard bowel preparation including a one-day low-residue diet followed by 4&#x0200a;L of polyethylene glycol-containing lavage solution. Sedation was not induced during procedures, and patients were given only a single intramuscular analgesic injection (pethidine 50&#x0200a;mg for males, 25&#x0200a;mg for females). One colonoscope (CF-H260&#x0200a;AL/I, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the examination, and a transparent cap (D-201&#x02013;14305, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was fitted to the tip of the colonoscope in the CAP group.</p><p>During the insertion phase, the endoscopist intended to intubate the cecal base as quickly as possible without any effort to detect polyps. When cecal intubation was confirmed, photo documentation with stopwatch was performed to show the appendiceal orifice and cecal valve, or intubation of the terminal ileum. During the withdrawal phase, the colonic mucosa was observed carefully, and all detected polyps were removed for pathologic assessment.</p><p>After the procedure, quality of bowel preparation was assessed by the endoscopist using the 5-grading system of Aronchick bowel preparation scale.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In this study, results of the quality of bowel preparation were defined as excellent (Aronchick scale &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d;), fair (Aronchick scale &#x0201c;good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;fair&#x0201d;), and poor (Aronchick scale &#x0201c;poor,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;inadequate&#x0201d;).</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was the comparison of cecal intubation time between the 2 groups.

We used the moving average method to represent the cecal intubation time. To filter the variation caused by variation of individual values, averaging of past values was used to clarify the trend of the cecal intubation time. A moving average order of 10 was defined as the mean of the previous 10 data points.&#x000a0;<disp-formula id="MU1"><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e4869-g002.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test was used for analysis of categorical variables, and continuous variables were analyzed using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.

Most have agreed that a history of hysterectomy is significantly related to procedure incompleteness and prolonged cecal intubation time.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Also, it is generally believed that previous pelvic surgery results in poor cooperation during passage of the sigmoid colon, and upper abdominal surgery, such as gastrectomy, usually causes discomfort during passage of the transverse colon or hepatic flexure. This phenomenon seems to be developed from parts of colon trapped in adhesions,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> however; analyzing the effect of previous abdominal surgery on procedure completeness is not simple, due to multiple surgical types and approaches.</p><p>Although there is room for controversy, cap-assisted colonoscopy has been considered as a useful tool for successful colonoscopy. Especially in specific situations including older patients, those with previous abdominal surgery, or females with low BMI, cap-assisted colonoscopy has displayed a shorter cecal intubation time.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Although the efficacy of cap-assisted colonoscopy has been demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> most previous studies comparing cap-assisted colonoscopy and conventional colonoscopy did not include patients who previously underwent colorectal resection. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare cecal intubation time during cap-assisted and standard colonoscopy in patients who had previously undergone colorectal resection due to primary cancers.</p><p>Only one previous study reported the factors affecting cecal intubation time after colorectal resection.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The researchers demonstrated that right-sided colon resection was an independent predictor for prolonged insertion time and that colonoscopy was easier in patients with sigmoid colon resection. They explained this conclusion by assuming that resected sigmoid colon resulted in less looping or angling during the procedure. In the present study, we reduced possible sources of error resulting from different surgical types by excluding patients with previous right-sided, subtotal, or total colon resection.</p><p>Another unique part of our study was that only one endoscopist participated. Park et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that cap-assisted colonoscopies might help increase the rate of cecal intubation (80.7% in the cap group vs 63.3% in the non-cap group, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) and reduce cecal intubation time (13.7&#x0200a;minutes in the cap group vs 18.7&#x0200a;minutes in the non-cap group, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) for trainees. However, all 6 participating endoscopists in their study were assigned to only one group and performed only one procedure (cap-assisted or standard) during the study periods. Therefore, they could not rule out the possibility that the difference in individual abilities of trainees had an influence on the overall results. In our study, one endoscopist performed both cap-assisted and standard colonoscopy with serial sequencing. Thus, our study design minimized interendoscopist bias resulting from individual abilities.</p><p>However, this advantage may also be a limitation. All procedures were performed by one endoscopist (Kang J.) who had performed about 120 colonoscopies before the start of this study. From the results of a prospective, multicenter trial evaluating the adequate level of training required for technical competence in screening and diagnostic colonoscopy,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> more than 150 cases of experience were recommended for efficient colonoscopy in accordance with previous reports of at least 100 to 200 procedures.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> According to these criteria, the endoscopist in this study had either just completed his learning curve or was still in his learning period. Considering the earlier learning periods of the endoscopist, however, the cecal intubation rate of 97.2% in this study is comparable with the average cecal intubation rate, ranging from 94.6% to 99.0% performed by experienced hands.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>Interestingly, when we inspect the moving average curve demonstrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, we found that the learning curve did not achieve steady state until an additional 40 cases. Comparing the moving average curve on cecal intubation time between the 2 groups, the CAP group showed a gentle slope to the steady state after an additional 40 cases, while the non-CAP group demonstrated a steep decrease before maintaining steady state. Although this may be a reflection that cap-assisted colonoscopy during inexperienced periods might be beneficial in overcoming the difficulties met during the learning periods, further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary result.</p><p>In addition to successful cecal intubation, adenoma detection rate has been proposed as a reliable indicator to assess the quality of colonoscopic exams. Among postoperative-surveillance group, previous data<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> showed that metachronous adenomas were detected in 35.0% to 36.1% of patients after curative resection of colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. Polyp detection rate in this study was not different between the cap-assisted group and conventional colonoscopy group (27.0% in the CAP group vs 29.6% in the non-CAP group). Even though these might be somewhat lower than those reported, if we take into account the specific study cohort with mean follow-up period of 3-year postoperative-surveillance, repeated colonoscopies and polyp removal had already been performed. Moreover, this study showed similar withdrawal time (WT) (more than 10 minutes) between the CAP and non-CAP groups (data not shown). It is generally accepted that WT of more than 6 minutes is required for complete colonoscopic examinations that result in significantly higher adenoma detection rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Gromski et al<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> supported this trend by reporting that adenoma detection rate was significantly higher among first-year trainees with WT more than 10 minutes. These outcomes demonstrate that the qualities of this randomized trial were with acceptable range.</p><p>In conclusion, cap-assisted colonoscopy could reduce cecal intubation time and achieve more frequent faster intubation compared with standard colonoscopy in patients with a history of colorectal resection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, MIS = minimally invasive surgery, SD = standard deviation, WT = withdrawal time.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: This study was supported by a Faculty Research Grant (6-2015-0025) of Yonsei University College of Medicine.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group>
