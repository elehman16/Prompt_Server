Writing skills were assessed using a touch-sensitive tablet pre- and post-training, and after a six-week retention period.

Aside from the primary motor symptoms, handwriting difficulties occur frequently and are generally known as micrographia, i.e. a reduction in writing amplitude [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These difficulties commonly result in reduced legibility. While micrographia is one of the important features of handwriting impairment in PD, it is not the only deficit [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Letanneux <italic>et al</italic>. showed that three other variables may also differ from healthy controls, i.e. stroke duration, velocity and fluency [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Altogether, smaller writing size, longer stroke duration, slower handwriting velocity and reduced fluency point to dysgraphic handwriting [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which characterizes performance in PD better than micrographia alone. Treatment with dopaminergic medication or deep brain stimulation was found to have a beneficial effect on the latter three variables, but not on amplitude [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As such, there is an unmet need for rehabilitation interventions that target writing size, which can be considered as the most important parameter determining handwriting legibility. In a recent randomized controlled trial, our group showed solid improvements of writing amplitude after six weeks of intensive amplitude training, in addition to dopaminergic medication [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In healthy persons, amplitude and speed during voluntary arm and hand movements, such as writing, obey certain generally accepted rules of motor control: irrespective of the muscles involved, larger movement amplitudes are accompanied by an increase in velocity [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, in patients with PD this speed-amplitude relation was shown to be altered and characterized by either a reduced movement speed to maintain amplitude or by dysregulation of movement size to the benefit of movement speed in comparison to healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], expressing the symptomatic effects of bradykinesia. Also, patients with PD modulated acceleration measures inefficiently as compared with controls, i.e. had a lower mean acceleration and smaller peak acceleration compared to controls, mainly when they were requested to write with large stroke sizes [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Early EMG studies provided a partial explanation for this difference. While healthy persons needed a single EMG burst to execute arm movements, patients with PD required multiple bursts, a pattern which was aggravated during large-amplitude movements [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in PD using graphics tablets have also reported prominent problems in movement fluency (see Letanneux <italic>et al</italic>. for a review [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Writing fluency can be measured by the normalized jerk of a writing trajectory, which reflects the change in acceleration normalized for different stroke durations and sizes [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An increased normalized jerk during several handwriting tasks was found consistently in PD, reflecting a reduced capacity to coordinate the fingers and wrist [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most studies in this field investigated the speed, amplitude and fluency of writing during single session experiments, whereby writing at different sizes, velocities and complexity was compared [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. So far, it has not been investigated how training of handwriting, with a focus on improving writing amplitude, may differentially affect writing size, stroke duration, speed and fluency and the relation among these variables after a multi-session training. Gaining insight into the effects of training on these parameters is crucial to refine future rehabilitation interventions for handwriting problems in PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>The same patient groups were included as described in an earlier paper by Nackaerts <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], of which this study comprises a more detailed kinematic analysis. In short, 38 right-handed patients with PD participated [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were: (i) diagnosis of PD according to the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank criteria [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; (ii) Hoehn and Yahr (H&#x00026;Y) stage I to III in the on-phase of the medication cycle [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; (iii) experiencing writing problems, as identified by a score of one or more on item 2.7 (Handwriting) of the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part II [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; and (iv) the absence of severe cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) &#x02265; 24) [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Exclusion criteria were: (i) color blindness or other impairments in vision interfering with handwriting; (ii) upper limb problems unrelated to PD; and (iii) deep brain stimulation.</p><p>Patients were assigned to one of two training programs by means of a stratified randomization procedure based on H&#x00026;Y stage and age. Eighteen patients were assigned to an intensive writing amplitude training (= EXP group) and 20 to a placebo group, who received a stretch and relaxation program designed not to influence writing amplitude (= PLB group). Both programs were equally time-intensive and included 30 minutes of practice, five days per week over the course of six weeks. All patients filled out a diary so that the amount and duration of the intervention could be closely monitored. As well, patients in both groups received a weekly follow-up by the researcher, during which feedback and support were provided. In short, writing training consisted of pen-and-paper exercises and exercises on the touch-sensitive tablet and was aimed at improving writing amplitude with the help of visual cues. The stretch and relaxation program aimed to teach patients how to alleviate tension in the upper limbs. More detailed information on general characteristics of both groups and the content of the training programs can be found in Nackaerts <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The study design and protocol were approved by the local Ethics Committee of the KU Leuven and were in accordance with the code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, 1967). After explanation of the study protocol written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study. The trial was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Record G.0906.11.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The effect of training on stroke duration (s), writing velocity (cm/s) and normalized jerk was measured on a touch-sensitive tablet (sampling frequency 200 Hz, spatial resolution 32.5 &#x003bc;m) before and after the training program and after a six-week retention period. During all tests, two types of tasks were performed, i.e. an automatization and transfer task [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In short, for the automatization task patients were asked to write a 3-loop sequence at two sizes, 0.6 or 1.0 cm indicated by visual target zones, and this either alone or while counting high or low tones [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The transfer task incorporated writing of a trained and untrained sequence in the presence and absence of the visual target lines, resulting in four conditions. The trained sequence consisted of the same 3-loop sequence mentioned above. The untrained sequence involved a continuous figure 8-like movement [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both trained and untrained sequences were performed with and without cues and at the two sizes described above.</p><p>For both the automatization and transfer task, three blocks were performed in which each condition was provided in a random order. Each writing condition lasted 27 s and was followed by a rest period of 6 s. Participants were tested during the on-phase of the medication cycle at baseline, after six weeks of training (post-test) and after six weeks without training (retention-test). Medication intake was monitored and kept constant throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data processing and statistical analysis</title><p>All data from the tablet were filtered at 7 Hz with a 4<sup>th</sup>-order Butterworth filter and further processed using Matlab R2011b. Stroke duration (s), writing velocity (cm/s) and normalized jerk were extracted as dependent variables. The size and duration of individual up- and downstrokes were defined by calculating local minima and maxima. Writing velocity (cm/s) was calculated based on the duration and size of the individual strokes. The normalized jerk was calculated as the change in acceleration, normalized for different stroke durations and sizes making in a unit-free measure, using the formula described by Teulings <italic>et al</italic>.

These adaptations included an increase in movement duration and a decrease in writing fluency across tasks and conditions, i.e. in both single and dual task, trained and untrained or cued and uncued sequences. On the contrary, the placebo group did not show beneficial effects on writing amplitude [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, movement duration decreased, which led to an increase in writing velocity regardless of condition. Additionally, the placebo group showed an improvement of writing fluency in the automatization task.</p><p>The training of amplitude is a common rehabilitation approach in patients with PD, which was originally applied to improve speech deficits [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This treatment concept, known as Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT&#x000ae;), underlies the more recently developed protocol called &#x02018;Training BIG&#x02019;, to improve movement amplitude in the limbs [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. During BIG, amplitude is chosen as the main focus of training to overcome bradykinesia/hypokinesia by a &#x02018;recalibration&#x02019; of the patients&#x02019; perception of normal amplitude execution. This amplitude focus is combined with an increase of intensity and complexity during training BIG, which is similar to the writing protocol used in this study. Interestingly, previous BIG trials showed positive effects on both the speed and amplitude during reaching movements, balance and bed mobility [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], except for one study on gait. In the latter, only stride length increased after training without increases in velocity or cadence in the as-fast-as-possible condition, confirming the possibility of a ceiling effect [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Importantly, none of the BIG trials analyzed the possible cost of amplitude-based training on motor fluency, cognitive load and energy consumption. Also, BIG training effects were largely studied on the trained tasks only, while in this study we analyzed trade-off and learning effects during automatization and transfer tasks. Finally, the differences between the training BIG studies and the current study could be a result of the task, as handwriting is a highly visually-driven movement incorporating both habitual and goal-directed motor control [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>We will interpret these results in the light of a proposed framework of movement parameter trade-off presented in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>. Though not assessed in this study, the literature suggests that in a healthy system simply changing one movement parameter in one direction has an effect on the other parameters [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, left panel). For instance, in healthy persons, movement speed was found to increase with rising amplitude [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, the findings of the current and other studies on handwriting demonstrate that in patients with PD, velocity was found to saturate when amplitude increases (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, middle panel) [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The lack of concomitant increase in velocity (or velocity saturation) after amplitude training may be explained by a motor control impairment, affecting the speed-amplitude relation in patients with PD (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, middle panel). As a result, motor learning may come at a cost once patients reach the upper limits of their motor control system, explaining the stagnation in velocity. This view is supported by several studies showing that although patients with PD can alter one movement parameter, this occurs at the expense of another [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0190223.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0190223.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Movement parameter trade-off in health and disease.</title><p>Dotted arrows indicate the possible interaction between disease-related changes and compensatory change in priorities.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0190223.g004"/></fig><p>A second explanation for the deterioration of movement duration is in line with the cognitive reserve theory, i.e. the recruitment of cognitive or other compensatory processes to substitute for ageing or pathology (for a review see Stern [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) due to a priority change (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, right panel). This priority shift may also explain the increase of the normalized jerk accompanying the benefits on writing size, which may be a direct consequence of a system overload expressed as a loss of movement fluency. Worsening of writing fluency when movements are executed more slowly or with a larger amplitude is in agreement with previous studies in healthy young adults and other patient groups [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190223.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, in support of this hypothesis, we found that a worse cognitive profile and more advanced disease, represented by more sequential upper limb difficulties, resulted in a greater trade-off for movement duration and normalized jerk. This implies that rather than a ceiling, the lack of change in velocity may have been the result of the compensatory strategy used, which impacted on fluency and speed.</p><p>A final explanation, not illustrated in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190223.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, is that the placebo treatment consisting of stretching and relaxation was in fact beneficial, as the writing tasks were performed faster and with a decrease in the normalized jerk for the automatization task, although these changes were not necessarily beneficial for legibility of handwriting [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One specific explanation for the changes in velocity and fluency could be that the stretch and relaxation program influenced tremor positively. However, neither the correlation analysis with the upper limb tremor scores of the MDS-UPDRS-III, nor previous research on mindfulness training [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] supports this line of reasoning. Moreover, other rehabilitation studies showed that stretching and relaxation was not beneficial for motor performance in PD [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, we consider this explanation as unlikely.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Implications for rehabilitation</title><p>The most comprehensive interpretation of our results suggests that intensive amplitude training resulted in a trade-off between amplitude and movement duration and fluency. This implies that the compensatory strategy learned during training may come at a cost, which has consequences for clinical practice. This knowledge does not argue against motor learning or rehabilitation. Rather, it acknowledges that in patients with PD it is of utmost importance to select one single parameter which is crucial for the largest functional gains. When aiming to improve the legibility of handwriting, the main parameter to focus on seems to be movement amplitude. Progression of training could then be aimed to follow logical steps if the clinical profile of the patients allows it. One strategy could be to solely target the most important movement parameter during the entire program, as is currently done in BIG programs [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This approach is based on the hypothesis that the parkinsonian brain may solve kinematic challenges in separate steps. Improvements will mainly be found on the parameter to which main priority is given, inevitably coming at a cost regarding the secondary parameters. However, as training progresses, resources may gradually become available again and the deterioration of other variables will decrease, optimizing the functional outcome of the training program. We also found that movement duration decreased, velocity increased and fluency improved again in the experimental group from post-training to retention for the automatization task, in combination with a stable amplitude [<xref rid="pone.0190223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is, however, important to note that these effects were detected after a period without practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we found that intensive amplitude training, reported earlier to help writing amplitude, came at the expense of writing duration and fluency in patients with PD. Several hypotheses were put forward to explain the observed trade-off. While there likely is an interaction between the disease-related and the compensatory changes, our findings point towards a reorganization within the limited motor control system due to changing motor priorities. Further research is indicated to investigate whether a more extensive training program could address various aspects of handwriting comprehensively. Until then, we advise to focus on amplitude to improve legibility of handwriting in PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190223.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary results of the small-amplitude condition.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190223.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190223.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190223.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all participants of this study.
