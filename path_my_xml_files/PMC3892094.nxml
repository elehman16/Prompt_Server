However, substantial barriers to psychosocial assessment exist, resulting in less than 20% of prenatal care providers assessing and treating mental health problems. Moreover, pregnant women are often reluctant to disclose their mental health concerns to a healthcare provider. Identifying screening and assessment tools and procedures that are acceptable to both women and service providers, cost-effective, and clinically useful is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The primary objective of this randomized, parallel-group, superiority trial is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer tablet-based prenatal psychosocial assessment (e-screening) compared to paper-based screening. Secondary objectives are to compare the two modes of screening on: (1) the level of detection of prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms and psychosocial risk; (2) the level of disclosure of symptoms; (3) the factors associated with feasibility, acceptability, and disclosure; (4) the psychometric properties of the e-version of the assessment tools; and (5) cost-effectiveness. A sample of 542 women will be recruited from large, primary care maternity clinics and a high-risk antenatal unit in an urban Canadian city. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they: (1) receive care at one of the recruitment sites; (2) are able to speak/read English; (3) are willing to be randomized to e-screening; and (4) are willing to participate in a follow-up diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment. Allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment on a computer tablet, while those in the control group will complete the same assessment in paper-based form. All women will complete baseline questionnaires at the time of recruitment and will participate in a diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment. Research assistants conducting diagnostic interviews and physicians will be blinded. A qualitative descriptive study involving healthcare providers from the recruitment sites and women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We hypothesize that mental health e-screening in primary care maternity settings and high-risk antenatal units will be as or more feasible, acceptable, and capable of detecting depression, anxiety, and psychosocial risk compared to paper-based screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01899534?term=dawn+kingston&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01899534</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psychosocial assessment</kwd><kwd>Online</kwd><kwd>Screening</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Depression and anxiety are among the most common morbidities in pregnancy and postpartum (up to 1 year post-delivery), with prevalence rates of 13% to 29% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Without early screening and treatment, 50% to 70% of women with prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] will experience persistent symptoms through their child&#x02019;s early years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] with enduring effects on their children&#x02019;s development and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Psychiatric illness is also the leading cause of maternal mortality in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, perinatal mental health problems are severely underdetected and undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Without standardized screening, 80% of cases remain undetected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>While screening is important, there are significant barriers that prevent the majority of pregnant and postpartum women from seeking mental healthcare and disclosing concerns. These include the stigma of mental health, lack of understanding of whether symptoms are abnormal or a typical pregnancy experience, having providers or support persons underestimate their symptoms and concerns, and fear that reporting symptoms will lead others to think that they will be an incompetent mother, prevent the majority of pregnant and postpartum women from seeking mental healthcare and disclosing concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although such barriers may prevent women from accessing support on their own, only 4% of women refuse mental health screening when offered by healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and high acceptance by women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], only 20% of perinatal providers conduct proactive screening as part of prenatal care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and less than 15% of pregnant/postpartum women receive the help they need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A systematic review conducted by our team (manuscript in preparation) found that substantial personal and system barriers to routine screening exist for healthcare providers, including fear of women&#x02019;s responses to screening, lack of time, lack of accurate assessment tools and knowledge of their interpretation, and lack of referral processes and options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, this body of research underscores the need to identify screening and assessment tools and procedures that are acceptable to both women and service providers, overcome barriers to implementation, and are cost-effective and clinically useful. The most effective perinatal mental health screening and management programs are those characterized by screening incorporated into routine care with designated systems of referral and treatment that are initiated immediately after screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><sec><title><italic>The potential impact of e-screening</italic></title><p>Routine, standardized screening significantly improves detection of mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the scarcity of human health resources poses a major deterrent to routine screening. E-screening has the potential to increase efficiency of mental healthcare by reallocating limited human resources where they are most needed - in-depth follow-up assessment, referral, and treatment. It is a low-resource option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] that can be embedded in current prenatal and postpartum care across various settings and providers (for example, midwives, nurses, obstetricians, family physicians) and thus will increase access to routine screening.</p><p>Importantly, e-screening can address the most prominent barriers to screening identified by pregnant women and healthcare providers. Several studies report that e-screening for sensitive issues such as prenatal/postnatal intimate partner violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and postpartum depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] is acceptable and feasible. It is well-suited for busy clinical settings in that it offers consistency, can be tailored to patient needs, can be used with audio/video for low literacy, provides real-time data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], achieves similar or greater rates of disclosure compared to interviews, and is preferred by patients due to its anonymity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. To date, no studies have evaluated e-screening in pregnant women, yet screening that increases access to early prenatal intervention may reduce the risk of prenatal and postpartum depression/anxiety, as well as adverse child outcomes. One small study that examined the psychometric properties and rates of detection of postpartum depression of two Internet-based screening tools found that both tools (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale) had excellent validity and reliability with prevalence rates within range of other self-report and interview-based assessment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>There is a clear need for a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability, and psychometric performance of e-screening for prenatal mental health difficulties. A key consideration for evaluation is to determine whether established assessment tools are valid and reliable for use when delivered online. For example, it has been shown that some tools have different psychometric properties when delivered online, suggesting a need for different cutoff points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Another key issue is the inclusion of women experiencing a broad range of degrees of psychosocial risk. Pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies represent a vulnerable group in that the prevalence of mental health problems in this group is more than three times greater than medically low-risk women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; however, medically high-risk women are rarely included in intervention studies of perinatal mental health.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Screening versus psychosocial assessment</italic></title><p>Screening is defined as the use of a symptom-based tool, and psychosocial assessment is the combined use of a screening tool plus an assessment of psychosocial risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

Medically high-risk pregnant women have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety than low risk women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, recruiting women with low and high medical risk will enable us to evaluate the effectiveness of e-screening to accurately detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial risk across the spectrum of low to high symptom prevalence and severity. All sites serve a sociodemographically diverse population. At the maternity clinics, family physicians specializing in obstetrics provide full obstetrical care (for example, all prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care) and shared care (for example, they provide prenatal care up to 28 weeks and then care is transferred to an obstetrician). The high-risk antenatal unit is a 24-bed inpatient unit in a large, tertiary care hospital with over 5,900 births per year. It is the only inpatient acute hospital in the community and surrounding region for women with high-risk pregnancies, and women receive care primarily from obstetricians. The majority of family physicians, obstetricians, and nurses at the recruitment sites do not have specialized training in mental healthcare.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Recruitment procedures, consent, randomization, and allocation procedures</italic></title><p>Recruitment procedures are similar across sites. Trained staff at the recruitment sites will use a standardized script to determine each eligible (see Eligibility criteria) woman&#x02019;s interest in study participation. Women will be referred to an onsite research assistant who will provide the tablet. Women will complete the consent electronically on the tablet and receive the automatically generated copy via email. The research assistant will be available to answer questions about study participation and tablet logistics. A simple, computer-generated randomization process designed by the Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Health Research Institute (WCHRI) at the University of Alberta allocates women (1:1 ratio) automatically to the control or intervention group, and they will receive a &#x02018;pop-up&#x02019; message informing them that they will complete questions about emotional health on paper (control group) or tablet (intervention group). Computerized randomization preserves allocation concealment and reduces the possibility of selection bias since the research assistant is kept unaware of the group assignments until after the participants are allocated to groups.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>The intervention</italic></title><p>The intervention is psychosocial assessment via electronic administration. Women assigned to the intervention group will complete the psychosocial assessment comprising the ALPHA and the EPDS electronically using a computer tablet. Rather than the traditional, sole use of symptom-based mental health screening tools, the combined use of a psychosocial risk assessment instrument (for example, ALPHA) that detects current and future risk for mental health problems and a symptom screening tool (for example, EPDS) that detects current symptomatology has been recommended as the most effective, comprehensive approach to psychosocial assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The ALPHA was selected for use as a psychosocial risk assessment tool because its paper-based version is currently used in our clinic recruitment sites. In addition, the ALPHA is a Canadian-developed tool that has been tested in the Canadian context in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and has been gaining popularity for antenatal psychosocial assessment in these settings. It was designed to identify psychosocial risk factors in pregnant women that may increase their risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes (for example, stressful life events, lack of support), including postpartum depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It has undergone extensive face and content validity by experts including obstetricians, family physicians, and midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and identifies significantly more cases of psychosocial risk than non-standardized assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The majority of providers indicated that the tool could readily be implemented in routine prenatal care and pregnant women found it acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The self-report version used in this study is easily completed in 5 to 10 minutes. It asks women questions on the topics of family life, stressors, feelings about the pregnancy, substance use, abuse, and family of origin. Women respond with yes/no or 6-point Likert-scale options. Based on a review of responses in each category, trained providers subjectively judge whether women are at low, some, or high psychosocial risk. No cutoff points or scoring algorithm have been developed and thus sensitivity and specificity data are not available. Risk categories are then used to create a care plan.</p><p>The 10-item EPDS was selected for evaluation because it is one of the most widely used screening instruments for postpartum, and less commonly, prenatal depression. The EPDS was designed as a brief tool to screen for postpartum depression symptoms within the previous 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. A score of 13 or greater (range, 0 to 30) is a well-established cutoff for clinically significant depression symptoms consistent with meeting criteria for a major depressive episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Original psychometric testing resulted in sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 77%, the positive predictive value of 83%, split-half reliability of 0.8, and a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.87 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The 3-item anxiety subscale of the EPDS is a reliable and valid tool for probable anxiety using a cutoff of 4 or more with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.74, sensitivity of 66.7%, and specificity of 73.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>The control group</italic></title><p>Women in the control group will complete paper-based versions of the ALPHA and EPDS. Usual prenatal care at our clinic recruitment sites involves women self-completing the ALPHA on a single occasion during pregnancy, typically while they wait for their first or second prenatal visit. At the hospital recruitment site, usual care does not include formal screening, although women&#x02019;s mental health status is monitored due to the high medical risk. Paper-based screening was chosen as the comparator because the primary objective of the study is to assess feasibility and acceptability of the electronic administration of a psychosocial assessment.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Procedures</italic></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Maternity clinics</bold> At the maternity clinic recruitment sites, each eligible woman will complete the ALPHA and EPDS while they wait for their prenatal appointment - either via computer tablet or paper. After randomization to the control group, a message appears on the tablet, directing women to complete the ALPHA and EPDS on paper. An automatic &#x02018;skip&#x02019; procedure ensures that the electronic versions of the ALPHA and EPDS are bypassed for women in the control group. Following completion of the paper-based psychosocial assessment, women will proceed to complete the baseline questionnaire on the tablet. Women in the intervention group will be directed to answer questions about emotional health (ALPHA and EPDS) and the baseline questionnaire on the tablet. All questions require responses, and thus women cannot proceed past questions with missing answers until completed. In keeping with the current clinic processes of including the assessment in the medical record, the electronic copy will be printed following completion. As is usual care in the maternity clinics, a Registered Nurse will review the assessment, judge whether women are at low, some, or high risk, discuss women&#x02019;s psychosocial assessment responses with them, and provide follow-up referrals for those with some or high psychosocial risk with a mental health nurse affiliated with the clinic.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Hospital-based antenatal unit</bold> In the antenatal unit, the research assistant will meet with women who have agreed to a follow-up contact by the research team. The research assistant will provide the tablet, a copy of the paper-based questionnaire, and an opaque envelope. The research assistant will be available to answer questions related to study participation, but then will leave the room to allow the woman to proceed to the computer randomization, and complete the assessment and baseline questionnaire independently. Thus, the research assistant will have no knowledge of the woman&#x02019;s group assignment. Following randomization to the intervention group, women will be directed by a computer message to complete the ALPHA and EPDS on the tablet as well as the baseline questionnaire. Women assigned to the control group will be directed by a computer message to complete the ALPHA and EPDS on paper and then return to the tablet for completion of the baseline questionnaire. An automatic &#x02018;skip&#x02019; procedure ensures that the electronic versions of the ALPHA and EPDS are bypassed for women in the control group.</p><p>In both cases, prior to the final submission of the baseline questionnaire, intervention and control group women will be prompted to place the paper-version questionnaire in the opaque envelope and seal it.</p><p>In the antenatal unit setting, procedures to maintain blinding of the research assistant are required because he/she will be both recruiting women and conducting the follow-up diagnostic interview. Blinding of the research assistant is maintained by: (1) distributing an opaque envelope and a paper-based version of the ALPHA and EPDS to all participants prior to randomization; (2) using a computer-based randomization process that reveals the assignment to the woman, but not the research assistant; (3) instructing all women to return the paper-based assessments to the envelope prior to giving the tablet and envelope back to the research assistant (an electronic message on the tablet prompts women to return the paper-based assessment to the envelope); and (4) training the research assistant to return all envelopes (unopened) to the research coordinator.</p><p>Two processes have been designed to ensure that the correct versions of the ALPHA and EPDS are completed (for example, paper <italic>versus</italic> electronic) and to avert the possibility that participants might self-select a preferred version: (1) the electronic versions of the ALPHA and EPDS are not available to women in the control group through a programmed &#x02018;skip&#x02019; procedure; and (2) the research coordinator will conduct a manual check on a subset of 30 control group participants at three different times in the course of the study to ensure that paper-based versions of the ALPHA and EPDS are completed.</p><p>If women are identified as meeting criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder on the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (see Confirmation of diagnosis) or if they score 13 or more on the EPDS the research assistant will create a referral for the woman (with her permission) to the hospital-based reproductive mental health support program and she will be followed up by a mental health therapist.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>Confirmation of diagnosis</italic></title><p>All women will have a MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, Version 6.0.0) by a trained, blinded research team member skilled in diagnostic interviews within 1 week of completing their psychosocial assessment. The MINI is a brief, &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; diagnostic interview designed to assess the presence of mental disorders according to criteria defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It can be administered in approximately 15 minutes with interviewees providing yes/no responses. All research staff conducting diagnostic interviews will participate in four 3-hour training sessions on the structure and completion of the MINI, interviewing skills, approaches to asking sensitive questions, and role-playing. Additionally, the first two to three interviews will be supervised by one of the mental health clinicians on our team (KMH).</p><p>For women recruited through the maternity clinics, a research team member not involved in recruitment will conduct a telephone-based MINI within 1 week of the woman completing the psychosocial assessment (at the clinic). Because of space and time constraints in the maternity clinics, it is necessary to conduct the MINI via telephone, and follow-up by a different research assistant maintains blinding. For women recruited through the inpatient antenatal unit, the MINI will be conducted at the time of recruitment, after completion of the psychosocial assessment and baseline questionnaire. The research assistant involved in recruitment will conduct the MINI, with specific measures employed to maintain blinding (see Procedures).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Outcomes and measurement</italic></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Primary outcome</bold> The primary outcome is feasibility and acceptability of screening (for example, e-screening <italic>versus</italic> paper-based screening) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>a).</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Feasibility</bold> All women will complete the 10-item CASI Assessment Evaluation (CAE), an established instrument designed to evaluate the feasibility of computer-based screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

Women select responses by touching the screen. If a woman does not answer a question, she will be prompted to respond before she can proceed. This is to mimic the usual screening process where the nurse would ask the woman to respond to a missing answer. A &#x02018;SUBMIT&#x02019; button at the bottom of the baseline questionnaire will allow women to submit their responses.</p><p>The order of material on the tablet will be: (1) Participant Information Letter and Consent; (2) preamble describing the importance of screening and the follow-up with the healthcare provider; (3) ALPHA and EPDS; (4) the CAE, DES, and questions related to acceptability, feasibility, and disclosure; and (5) baseline questionnaire. The content of the baseline questionnaire includes questions that represent factors associated with prenatal mental health or disclosure of mental health concerns, and includes: (1) demographics (age, parity, marital status, education, income, ethnicity, country of birth, and length of time in Canada); (2) obstetrical history (current and past, including use of fertility treatments); (3) mental health history (diagnoses, treatment); (4) level of comfort with technology (for example, laptop, tablet); (5) quality of relationship with perinatal care provider; (6) level of social support, experience of talking with doctor/nurse/midwife about emotional health; and (7) adverse childhood experiences (using ACES questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). With the exception of the ACES (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://acestudy.org/ace_score">http://acestudy.org/ace_score</ext-link>), questions were derived from the All Our Babies longitudinal birth cohort study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prehot.org/The%20All%20Our%20Babies%20Study/">http://www.prehot.org/The%20All%20Our%20Babies%20Study/</ext-link>) and the Maternity Experiences Survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/survey-eng.php">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/survey-eng.php</ext-link>).

The e-screening costs include investment costs to technology (programs, tablets, data storage) and the operating costs at the clinic that may differ somewhat from the conventional group administrative and analytical cost. Cost-effectiveness is determined by incremental cost to identify a woman with increased risk of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety.
