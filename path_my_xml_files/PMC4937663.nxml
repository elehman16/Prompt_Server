However, belimumab had not been evaluated in Japanese patients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in Japanese patients with SLE, as well as to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and biological activity of belimumab in this population.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 12 Japanese patients were enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending design study. A dosing regimen of a single intravenous infusion over 1 hour of belimumab (1&#x02009;mg/kg and 10&#x02009;mg/kg) was employed. Patients were followed for 84 days after dosing to assess adverse events, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and SLE disease activity.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Clinical trial registration number</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01381536.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Results</title><p>Belimumab (1&#x02009;mg/kg and 10&#x02009;mg/kg) demonstrated a favorable clinical safety and tolerability profile in Japanese patients with SLE. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the two belimumab groups and placebo group. The PK profile of single-dose belimumab was approximately dose proportional, and the long terminal elimination half-life (12.4&#x02013;15.7 days), low clearance (3.55&#x02013;4.65&#x02009;mL/day/kg), and small volume of distribution (76.2&#x02013;80.1&#x02009;mL/kg) were consistent with a fully humanized antibody. Effects of belimumab on B cells suggested biological activity effects expected as an inhibitor of BLyS.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Limitation</title><p>The small sample size and single dose design of this study prevent definitive conclusions regarding the safety, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of belimumab in a Japanese population being made.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The preliminary safety, PK profile, and observed biological activity of belimumab support further evaluation of its safety and efficacy in Japanese patient with SLE.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Belimumab</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Safety</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Pharmacodynamics</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Systemic lupus erythematosus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S7"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibody production and abnormal B lymphocyte function<xref rid="C1">1</xref>. Although high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are widely used for treatment, some patients with SLE are refractory to these conventional treatments. In addition to the background of considerable progress in conventional therapies, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) approved belimumab as a new biological agent for the treatment of SLE in 2011.</p><p>Belimumab is a recombinant, human, immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1&#x003bb;) monoclonal antibody that binds soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) protein with high affinity and inhibits its biological activity<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. BLyS is overexpressed in patients with SLE and correlates with severities in disease activity. Approval of belimumab was based on two clinical studies, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, both of which demonstrated benefit when belimumab was superimposed on standard-of-care<xref rid="C3 C4 C5">3&#x02013;5</xref>. Based on positive results in efficacy in both studies, as well as a favorable safety profile, belimumab was approved for patients with many of the diverse manifestations of lupus. However, since patients with active nephritis and central nervous system involvement were excluded from the studies, belimumab is not approved for these indications. Data in Asian populations was also limited, and Japanese patients were not included in either pivotal study.</p><p>Clinically significant inter-ethnic differences in drug response and pharmacokinetics have been reported for a number of drugs<xref rid="C6">6</xref>,<xref rid="C7">7</xref>. Differences in drug response may be attributable to differences in average pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and in turn variations in drug safety and efficacy between populations have been reported. Additionally, differences across populations in the nature of some diseases could contribute to inter-ethnic differences in drug response.</p><p>In the first study of belimumab, SLE patients with stable disease were given various doses of belimumab to study the <italic>in vivo</italic> safety of the drug as well as its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics<xref rid="C8">8</xref>. The results of the study concluded that belimumab had a good safety profile <italic>in vivo</italic>, predictable linear pharmacokinetics over a dosage range from 1 to 20&#x02009;mg/kg, small volume of distribution, slow clearance and a half-life ranging from 8 to 14 days. And belimumab was effective in reducing peripheral B-cell counts. However Japanese patients with SLE have not been included in previous study.</p><p>Therefore, as for all pharmacotherapies, an assessment of the potential for ethnic differences is relevant for belimumab. In the present study, Japanese patients with SLE were enrolled, and the primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in Japanese patients. In addition, we examined the pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of belimumab in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0008-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 20 years or older with SLE, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria<xref rid="C9">9</xref>, were enrolled in this study. All patients were required to be born in Japan with four ethnic Japanese grandparents and possess Japanese citizenship. Eligible patients had stable SLE disease activity, as judged clinically by the principal investigator, for at least 2 months before screening and either maintained with no medication or with a stable SLE treatment. Patients were also positive for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) or anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibody. Patients with severe active lupus nephritis requiring hemodialysis, cyclophosphamide, or high-dose (&#x0003e;60&#x02009;mg) prednisone, or who had received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasmapheresis within 6 months of screening were not eligible. Patients with active central nervous system lupus within 6 months of screening, a history of renal transplant, hypogammaglobulinemia or IgA deficiency (IgA &#x0003c;10&#x02009;mg/dL), evidence of clinically significant non-SLE-related acute or chronic disease, a history of any serious infection within 4 weeks of screening, or a history of an anaphylactic reaction to monoclonal antibodies were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they were tested positive for hepatitis (B or C) or human immunodeficiency virus, or had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Pregnant or nursing patients were ineligible for inclusion in the study, and adequate practice of contraception was required for participating patients. All patients provided written, informed consent to participate in the study. The institutional review board provided formal approval for the study, which was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, all known regulatory requirements and the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in Edinburgh 2000, Washington 2002, and Tokyo 2004).</p></sec><sec id="S0008-S2002" disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending design study of single intravenous (IV) doses of belimumab in Japanese patients with SLE.

Dosing in Cohort 2 was started after dosing was completed and the safety and tolerability results had been assessed in Cohort 1. Patients in Cohort 2 received a single administration of placebo or belimumab at a dose of 10&#x02009;mg/kg.

The reconstituted investigational product was diluted in 250&#x02009;mL normal saline for IV infusion. An amount of normal saline, equal to the calculated amount of product to be added was removed from the infusion bag prior to adding the product. After adding the reconstituted product, the bag was gently inverted to mix the solution.

One patient in the placebo group experienced a non-treatment-related SAE of severe back pain that required hospitalization and which resolved 11 days after its onset.</p><table-wrap id="TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Summary of drug-related adverse events by treatment groups.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Belimumab</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02009;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x02009;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any event</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (50)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (50)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pharyngitis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oral herpes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constipation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paronychia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Erythema</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rash</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conjunctivitis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pollakiuria</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Values are expressed as <italic>n</italic> (%).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>No clinically significant changes in laboratory values, vital signs, or 12-Lead ECG results occurred during the study.</p></sec><sec id="S0009-S2003" disp-level="2"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Following single IV administration, serum belimumab concentration declined in a bi-exponential manner, with a geometric mean <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;,&#x003b1;</sub> of 0.644 and 0.600 days and geometric mean <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;,&#x003b2;</sub> of 12.395 and 15.705 day for the 1&#x02009;mg/kg and 10&#x02009;mg/kg groups, respectively (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table 3</xref>).

The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in Japanese patients with SLE, as well as to investigate the PK and biological activity of belimumab in this population.</p><p>Belimumab was generally safe and no safety concerns were found following a single intravenous administration of belimumab at both 1&#x02009;mg/kg and 10&#x02009;mg/kg doses in Japanese patients with SLE. No deaths, drug-related SAEs, or withdrawals due to AEs were reported; additionally, no belimumab-related laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital signs or ECG were observed. The majority of AE were classified as mild in severity. There was no relationship between the dose of belimumab and the number of incidence, severity, or type of AE reported. Considering the pivotal role of B cells in immune function, it is conceivable that a BLyS inhibitor may increase the risk of infection. However, there were no reports of moderate or severe infections. Anti-belimumab antibodies were not detected in this study. Overall, there were no unanticipated AEs in this study, although there are a number of limitations of this study, notably the small sample size and single-dose design. Thus, a full assessment of the long-term safety of belimumab in Japanese patients cannot be made.</p><p>Low serum complement concentrations and elevated anti-dsDNA antibody concentrations correlate with disease severity and can predict future flares in SLE patients<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. Belimumab is a molecule expected to reduce certain B-cell subsets by blocking the activity of BLyS; BLyS receptors are expressed on most B-cell subsets including memory B cells. An agent that reduces B-cell counts might also be expected to reduce the products of B cells (i.e., immunoglobulins, including autoantibodies). A reduction in autoantibodies, in turn, could be expected to be associated with increases in complement concentrations. Thus, pharmacodynamic endpoints that have been evaluated in this study include serum immunoglobulin, autoantibody, complement (C3 and C4) and B-cell counts. The percentage reduction in CD20+ B cells tended to be greater in patients treated with belimumab than in those treated with placebo. Levels of na&#x000ef;ve B cells (CD20+/CD27&#x02212;) and activated B cells (CD20+/CD69+) tended to be decreased in the 10&#x02009;mg/kg group while no change was observed in the placebo group. Therefore, administration of belimumab has been associated with decrease in B cells consistent with its mechanism of action as a BLyS inhibitor. Increases in memory B cells (CD20+/CD27+) occurred in the 10&#x02009;mg/kg group. The mechanism underlying this increase in memory B cells may include release of memory B cells from disrupted lymphoid tissue, inhibition of the return of memory B cells to germinal centers, or the promotion of differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve cells to memory B cells, although the latter may be less likely with effective binding of BLyS by belimumab<xref rid="C11">11</xref>,<xref rid="C12">12</xref>. The serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) and autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA antibody and ANA) were not consistent and did not follow a trend in all the treatment groups. This is not unanticipated given that only a single dose of belimumab was administered, the sample size was small, and the patients with limited disease activity were included.</p><p>The single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of belimumab was approximately dose proportional and consistent with other monoclonal antibodies<xref rid="C13">13</xref>. The geometric mean CL ranged from 3.55 to 4.65&#x02009;mL/day/kg, which is much less than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that renal clearance is not a major component of belimumab clearance. A half-life for terminal phase (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;,&#x003b2;</sub>) of 12&#x02013;16 days supports dosing every 28 days in clinical program of belimumab. Although the study did not have the power to detect ethnic differences, this PK result seems to be similar to previous reports assessed non-Japanese population<xref rid="C8">8</xref>,<xref rid="C14">14</xref>.</p><p>The small sample size and single-dose design of this study prevent definitive conclusions regarding the safety, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of belimumab in a Japanese population being made. However, the results are not inconsistent with currently available data in non-Japanese populations.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Japanese patients with SLE, no safety concerns were found following a single intravenous administration of belimumab and the pharmacokinetic profile was consistent with that expected. Effects of belimumab on B cells, although difficult to interpret in a single-dose study, suggest pharmacodynamic effects expected of an inhibitor of BLyS. This single-dose study testing of small numbers of subjects have limitations. However, the preliminary safety, PK profile, and observed PD effects of belimumab support further evaluation of its safety and efficacy in Japanese patient with SLE and our results suggest that the treatment of Japanese SLE patients with belimumab may prove beneficial, just as it did for non-Japanese patients.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s12a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline and Human Genome Sciences, Inc.</p></sec><sec id="s12b"><title>Declaration of financial/other relationships</title><p>All authors are employees of GlaxoSmithKline, K.K.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>First and foremost, the authors thank the SLE patients for participating in this study.
