Integrated clinical practice guidelines for managing patient pain, agitation and delirium (PAD) have been developed. The Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management, and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle provides a strategy to implement PAD guidelines into everyday clinical practice. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of the ABCDE bundle in the literature.</p><p id="Par2">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial comparing the ABCDE bundle to standard care in an ICU. Trial feasibility was defined as the successful recruitment and retention of trial participants, adherence to the intervention, identification of barriers to the intervention, and the rigorous collection of outcome data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled feasibility study was conducted. Thirty adult mechanically ventilated participants were recruited from an eight-bed ICU in south east Queensland, Australia, between April 2015 and December 2015. Participants were randomised to receive either the ABCDE bundle or standard routine management. The ABCDE bundle integrated prescribed awakening and breathing trials, delirium monitoring and management, and prescribed exercise and mobility regimes. Feasibility outcomes measured included recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity, and the feasibility of participant outcome data collection. Outcome measurement assessors were blinded to participant assignment. It was not possible to blind the research team or the participant to group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">In total, 30 (81.1%) of 37 eligible participants consented and were randomised to the intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) or the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15). Of these, 23 (76.6%) participants successfully completed the 90-day post discharge assessment. A lengthy recruitment period of 8&#x000a0;months was related to overly stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Intervention adherence exceeded defined success rates with participation in awakening and breathing trials, delirium monitoring and exercise interventions performed on 80.2, 97.4 and 90.2% of ventilated days respectively. Outcome assessments were successfully and accurately performed at ICU and hospital discharge and 90-day post hospital discharge. Intervention participants were deemed to be delirious on 39.6% of mechanically ventilated days indicating a requirement for a scripted regime to prevent delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">With minor adjustment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the inclusion of delirium management protocols, and encouragement of family engagement and involvement, a large-scale definitive randomised controlled trial to test the impact of the ABCDEF bundle will be feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=366623">12614000763640</ext-link> Date registered 17/08/2014</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40814-017-0224-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ABCDE bundle</kwd><kwd>Critical illness</kwd><kwd>Delirium</kwd><kwd>Muscle weakness</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Intensive care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Health and Medical Research Unit, Queensland Australia</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par25">Critically ill patients commonly suffer profound weakness, pain, and delirium which are inextricably linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Limited physical function and adverse effects associated with immobilisation are likely to worsen if cognition is not intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Physical impairments related to these issues may last for years after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Integrated pain, agitation and delirium (PAD) clinical practice guidelines for critically ill patients using pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches have been developed following rigorous research and aim to prevent long-term detrimental patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, these approaches have not necessarily produced reductions in negative sequela for the critically ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Researchers agree that delirium and ICU-associated weakness (ICUAW) remain pervasive and under-recognised within our ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The ABCDE bundle focusses on a way to implement the PAD guidelines to reduce delirium and weakness related to over-sedation, prolonged mechanical ventilation and forced immobility in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This bundle of cares as described by Balas and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] comprises three inter-related components: coordination of awakening and breathing trials, monitoring and management of delirium, and early exercise. Clinicians are increasingly incorporating the ABCDE bundle into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and investigating outcomes associated with its use in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">A prospective before&#x02013;after study tested the effectiveness and safety of incorporating the ABCDE bundle into everyday practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Balas and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] recruited 296 patients (146 in the pre-group and 150 in the post bundle implementation group) from five adult ICUs, a step-down unit, and an oncology special care unit in a large tertiary hospital in the USA. The authors found a number of significant patient benefits that resulted from incorporating the ABCDE bundle including decreased duration of ventilation, reduced delirium and increased episodes of mobilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Although results of this study were promising, limitations of the study design warrant consideration. Balas and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] acknowledged that education regarding the ABCDE protocol applied during the pre-implementation period may have influenced study results. There may have been contamination during the pre-test period with inadvertent implementation of aspects of the intervention. As with all pre-post studies, the effect of history on the internal validity cannot be disregarded. Rigorous RCTs are therefore required to adequately test the effect of this bundle. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published RCTs examining the ABCDE bundle and its impact on ICU survivor quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par30">In this study, we aimed to test the feasibility of conducting an RCT to examine the impact of the ABCDE bundle on quality of life in ICU survivors.</p><p id="Par31">Our research question was: What is the feasibility of conducting a RCT using the ABCDE bundle compared with usual practice to improve ICU survivors&#x02019; quality of life? Feasibility outcomes included successful recruitment and retention of trial participants, intervention fidelity, identification of barriers to implementation of the intervention, and the feasibility of collecting outcome assessment data. The CONSORT extension statement checklist for pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] was used as a guide to ensure complete and transparent reporting of our study (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par32">A prospective, single-centre, single-blinded, equally randomised (1:1), controlled feasibility study was conducted between April 2015 and March 2016 in an eight-bed, level two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] ICU in south east Queensland, Australia. The protocol for this pilot trial is available on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry website.</p><p id="Par33">We were cognisant that a study involving the multicomponent ABCDE bundle is complex and that many trials involving complex interventions fail to prove a significant positive result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This may be related to poor implementation of the intervention or substandard study design rather than genuine ineffectiveness. To ensure the effectiveness of our study protocol, we have utilised the principles of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council&#x02019;s framework for the design and evaluation of complex health care intervention to prepare for a rigorous and appropriately powered future RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The initial development phase of the framework required a comprehensive review of pertinent literature relating to the early rehabilitation of critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our integrative review informed the modelling component of the framework which involved introducing the ABCDE bundle of cares into an ICU as detailed in the following method section. The results of the feasibility and piloting phase of the framework are presented in this manuscript. The outcome of this trial will determine if and how we can progress to an RCT to compare the ABCDE bundle with standard ICU practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par35">Schweickert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] had reported improved functional outcomes in patients who had received physical therapy within 72&#x000a0;h of the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Thus, patients admitted to the ICU were included if they were aged over 18&#x000a0;years, had been mechanically ventilated for 48&#x000a0;h and were expected to require ventilation for at least a further 24&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="Par36">Patients were excluded from the study if a premorbid functional or cognitive impairment precluded engagement in exercise. Exclusion criteria included an inability to mobilise 3&#x000a0;meters before the current ICU illness; were diagnosed with neuromuscular disease that could impair ventilator weaning; had suffered&#x000a0;an acute stroke; were not for active resuscitation; had&#x000a0;been readmitted&#x000a0;to ICU within the current hospitalisation; or were&#x000a0;not expected to survive the current ICU admission.</p><p id="Par37">During the week, potential participants were identified during the 8&#x000a0;am ward round by a member of the research nursing team.

The assigned group allocations were concealed in opaque (when held to the light) envelopes that were consecutively numbered and sealed. The envelopes were prepared by personnel not connected to the study and were stored in a secured office within the ICU. An envelope was opened by a member of the research team, and a participant was assigned to the allocated group once eligibility criteria were met and informed consent obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par42">It was not possible to blind the research team or the participant to group assignment.

The completed Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> provides a detailed description regarding the intervention for replication in future studies.</p><p id="Par44">In brief, the ABCDE bundle education program commenced 2&#x000a0;months prior to study commencement. Multimodal education was delivered via unit-based presentations and simulation in order to familiarise staff with procedures and to practice emergency responses. Ongoing support was provided during the trial. Nursing, medical and allied health staff who provide exercise interventions in the trial were experienced critical care clinicians.</p><p id="Par45">The ABCDE bundle was a standardised and protocolised complex care bundle that was integrated into daily patient care activities and delivered by the appropriate member of the treating multidisciplinary team at various times each day. The implementation of the bundle was facilitated by using computer software that provided staff care prompts. That is, the protocol components were embedded into the patient record computerised information system (CIS). Each component of the bundle was prescribed by nursing or physiotherapy staff following completion of a safety screen. The CIS provided an alert when bundle components were due for action. A 1-h window was provided so that other ICU activities could be considered. An electronic signature was required to confirm that each component of the bundle had or had not been completed.</p><p id="Par46">The Awakening and Breathing Coordination (ABC) component of the bundle required the completion of a safety screen within the CIS to determine whether it was safe to interrupt sedation and commence a spontaneous awakening trial (SAT). If the SAT was successful, a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) safety screen was performed prior to testing pressure support ventilation or a T-piece trial. Mechanical ventilation was recommenced if the patient failed the SBT. The intensivist considered extubation if the SBT was passed within 30&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par47">The Delirium monitoring and management component ensured all patients received routine pain, sedation and delirium assessment using standardised and validated assessment tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Pain was assessed every 2&#x000a0;h with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) if conscious or the Critical Care Observation Tool (CCOT) if unconscious. Continuous infusions of Fentanyl and/or Remifentanil were titrated to keep NRS less than 4 or CCOT less than 3. Level of alertness was monitored every 4&#x000a0;h with the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Sedation was optimised by keeping the RASS between light sedation (&#x02212;&#x02009;2) to alert and calm (0). Propofol and/or Dexmedetomidine were recommended for the patients in the intervention group. The CAM-ICU was performed every 12&#x000a0;h (8&#x000a0;am and 8&#x000a0;pm) to determine if the patient was delirious.</p><p id="Par48">The early exercise and mobility component of the bundle required the completion of a screen within the CIS to ensure the patient met safety criteria. If the patient did not pass the safety screen, they received passive range of motion exercise and sitting position three times a day in bed. The nurse or physiotherapist determined the patient&#x02019;s capacity for independent movement. Patients progressed through four levels of progressive activity, receiving the highest level they could manage<italic>.</italic> The nurse created a nursing order in the CIS which would appear in the CIS at the appropriate time throughout the day. The nurse was provided a 1-h window either side of the prescribed time to allow other patient therapies to occur.</p><p id="Par49">Nursing, medical and allied health staff involved in providing interventions and those involved in performing outcome measurements were experienced critical care clinicians and were deemed competent to perform the rehabilitation strategies. Safety guidelines especially with regard to management of endotracheal tubes and invasive lines during exercise and mobility were provided to all ICU staff involved in patient care. Safety strategies were effective as no adverse events occurred during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par50">The control group received standard medical, nursing and allied health care with routine pain, sedation and delirium assessment using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) if conscious or the Critical Care Observation Tool (CCOT) if unconscious, the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale, and the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU).</p><p id="Par51">Interruption of sedative and opiate infusions was performed at the discretion of the ICU consultant on duty and would generally occur following the morning handover round (8.00&#x000a0;am). The decision to progress to cessation of sedation was based on information regarding the patient&#x02019;s clinical progress during the previous 12 to 24&#x000a0;h. There were no standardised procedures to guide spontaneous breathing trials. Nursing staff would closely monitor the patient&#x02019;s neurological, haemodynamic and respiratory status. The intensive care specialist would make the decision whether to progress to extubation or to resedate the patient.</p><p id="Par52">There were no standardised approaches to the provision of exercise and mobility at this site. Nursing staff did not routinely provide patient exercise. Physiotherapists provided physical exercise for each patient on an ad hoc basis. The degree of exercise ranged from no exercise to passive range of motion to sitting out of bed and was delivered at the discretion of individual physiotherapists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcome assessment data</title><p id="Par53">The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) quantified the participant&#x02019;s functional and cognitive status at both ICU and hospital discharge.

All four patients admitted with gastrointestinal disorders were randomised to the intervention group (26%).

In the literature, the term &#x02018;rehabilitation&#x02019; frequently refers to mobility or exercise programs exclusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, rehabilitation strategies in the ICU should aim to restore physical, functional and cognitive capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This may potentially be achieved using a bundled approach to treat and prevent both ICU-acquired weakness and delirium.</p><p id="Par90">Health care interventions require rigorous evaluation, and most health researchers agree that this is best achieved with an RCT. However, complex interventions made up of various components like the ABCDE bundle pose additional methodological challenges. The UK MRC guidance on designing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] explicitly recommend thorough feasibility work as an important initial step in the phased approach to identifying problems that might occur in an RCT of a complex intervention. This important preparatory stage aims to deliver an RCT that is both robust (internal validity) and generalizable in a real world context (external validity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Important methodological criteria have been assessed within this study to determine whether a definitive RCT is feasible.</p><p id="Par91">Target enrolment of an adequate number of participants to test the study protocol was achieved. However, recruitment of participants was accomplished in 8&#x000a0;months. We are mindful that an adjustment to the recruitment strategy is required to ensure that recruitment goals meet timely project completion.</p><p id="Par92">The selection of participants who required a minimum of 72&#x000a0;h of invasive ventilation resulted in a cohort with a prolonged stay in the ICU. As it was not the intent of the study to focus only on long stay patients, and as little as 1&#x000a0;day of bed rest has been shown to have an impact on muscle weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], reducing the time for inclusion would provide relevance to the wider ICU population.</p><p id="Par93">The exclusion criteria relied on subjective assessments only. Examination of functionality using a validated tool would have strengthened objective assessment. Although exclusion criteria were designed to avoid the confounding effects of pre-existing cognitive and medical conditions, eligibility numbers were lower than expected indicating the criteria was restrictive. Potential cohorts of the normal ICU population were omitted from the study which would negatively impact on the generalisability of the results. For instance, patients with neuromuscular disorders were excluded from the study, yet are capable of performing some level of exercise and mobility and importantly often require rehabilitation post ICU discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Revision of the exclusion criteria to also include patients suffering premorbid functional impairment will strengthen the relevance of a larger RCT.</p><p id="Par94">Randomisation processes worked efficiently and facilitated unpredictable assignment to the control and the intervention group. Participants were randomised once they had been mechanically ventilated for 48&#x000a0;h and were expected to remain ventilated for at least 72&#x000a0;h. Although limited, previous research confirms early rehabilitation interventions that incorporate both prevention of delirium and early physical exercise can optimise the short term outcomes and long term quality of life for intensive care unit survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, patients had frequently been administered potentially delirium inducing sedation prior to randomisation negating the positive effects of the ABCDE bundle. Revision of recruitment processes to ensure recruitment at 24&#x000a0;h following the commencement of mechanical ventilation would facilitate earlier implementation of interventions.</p><p id="Par95">Retention throughout the trial to the 90-day follow-up was deemed successful with only two of the surviving participants lost to follow-up. Participants&#x02019; responses to follow-up phone calls were very positive with the researcher often providing reassurance regarding physical, emotional and psychological recovery. Research personnel were responsive and friendly, characteristics which have been shown to foster participant motivation and retention in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par96">We have demonstrated that the ABCDE bundle can be reliably implemented in an Australian ICU with good intervention fidelity. Awakening and breathing coordination protocols focussed on safe cessation from sedative drugs and timely preparation for extubation. Medical staff incorporated nurse initiated safety screens with clinical judgement although SBTs were frequently ordered by the medical staff regardless of whether the patient had passed the safety screen.</p><p id="Par97">Long-term patients that experienced difficulty weaning from the ventilator presented a clinical challenge. However, we were mindful that the inclusion of delirium management and early exercise would be particularly beneficial for this cohort of patient. Trial participants received a positive CAM-ICU assessment on 39.6% of mechanically ventilated days. This is a similar rate to the before/after US study which found a significant reduction in prevalence and duration of delirium following the introduction of the ABCDE bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although the ICU team improved delirium assessment, prevention and management remained an issue. A scripted pharmacological and non-pharmacological regime would be key to the future success of an RCT.</p><p id="Par98">Staff were encouraged to provide a minimum of passive range of motion exercises to all participants in the intervention group. A 2-h window around the prescribed exercise session permitted necessary flexibility for clinical procedures. The standard bed in our ICU facilitated a &#x02018;sit in full chair position&#x02019; without removing the patient from the bed. Generalisation of our protocol to other sites would be impacted by the lack of this or similar equipment. Prescription of exercise as an actionable task in the CIS promoted protocol adherence.</p><p id="Par99">Potential contamination of the care of the control group was considered. The intervention group received the standardised and protocolised ABCDE bundle via a prescription within the clinical information system which once ordered could not be ignored or deleted resulting in the delivery of consistent and standard care every day. To provide additional control in our pilot study, only the intervention group had access to the ABCDE protocols via the clinical information system. The protocols were not available in any other format. Alternatively, the control group received care dependent on the medical officers, physiotherapists, occupational therapist, nursing decisions made daily with no use of protocol. Variation in the control group occurred related to different clinical practice and effort of individuals.</p><p id="Par100">A future RCT would benefit from the inclusion of data related to contamination of the control group.</p><p id="Par101">Family engagement and involvement was critical to the success of this study. Healthcare professionals worked in partnership with families to promote participant support and encouragement. Family members viewed the completion of increasingly difficult levels of exercise as a positive affirmation that their relative was recovering. Improving family satisfaction by encouraging participation and communication has been shown to decrease psychological distress and is considered a critical component of the provision of quality care in ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Importantly, latest literature includes an &#x0201c;F&#x0201d; for family engagement in the ABCDE bundle acknowledging the value of this relationship in the recovery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].Thus, an ABCDEF bundle will be implemented in the future RCT.</p><p id="Par102">Our study has some limitations. It is possible that some clinicians would have provided the intervention to all patients. A future RCT would benefit from the inclusion of data related to potential contamination of the control group. It is important to emphasise that our feasibility study was not designed or appropriately powered to test a hypothesis that objective will be achieved in a future RCT. A review of literature supports the assertion that hypothesis testing in a feasibility study is inappropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the ABCDE&#x02019;s bundle effect on functional or HRQOL outcomes. Enrolment at a single site limits the generalisability of our results, and bias may have been introduced related to our inability to blind participants and ICU staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par103">Functional disability and reduced quality of life remains problematic for ICU survivors highlighting the requirement for further investigation to guide quality care improvements in our ICUs. This feasibility study was designed to test important aspects of our research methodology to ensure a future appropriately powered RCT would be robust. With only minor adjustment, we can assert that a large-scale RCT to test the effect of the ABCDEF bundle&#x02019;s impact on critically ill survivors functional and quality of life indicators will be feasible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec37"><p>
