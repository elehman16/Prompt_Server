In a randomised controlled trial, NF training was found to be superior to a computerised attention skills training (AST) (Gevensleben et al. in J Child Psychol Psychiatry 50(7):780&#x02013;789, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). In the present paper, treatment effects at 6-month follow-up were studied. 94 children with ADHD, aged 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years, completed either 36 sessions of NF training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59) or a computerised AST (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35). Pre-training, post-training and follow-up assessment encompassed several behaviour rating scales (e.g., the German ADHD rating scale, FBB-HKS) completed by parents. Follow-up information was analysed in 61 children (ca. 65%) on a per-protocol basis. 17 children (of 33 dropouts) had started a medication after the end of the training or early in the follow-up period. Improvements in the NF group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38) at follow-up were superior to those of the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23) and comparable to the effects at the end of the training. For the FBB-HKS total score (primary outcome measure), a medium effect size of 0.71 was obtained at follow-up. A reduction of at least 25% in the primary outcome measure (responder criterion) was observed in 50% of the children in the NF group. In conclusion, behavioural improvements induced by NF training in children with ADHD were maintained at a 6-month follow-up. Though treatment effects appear to be limited, the results confirm the notion that NF is a clinically efficacious module in the treatment of children with ADHD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ADHD</kwd><kwd>Neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial (RCT)</kwd><kwd>Follow-up</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), European guidelines recommend a multimodal treatment tailored to the requirements of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Medication (first-line treatment: methylphenidate), cognitive-behaviour therapy and parental training have proven to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. But there is still a need for further effective treatment strategies in improving attentional and self-management capabilities in children with ADHD, especially concerning long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent neurofeedback (NF) studies obtained encouraging results and raise the hope of closing the gap in providing children strategies for better self-regulation and -management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>NF aims at acquiring self-control over certain brain activity patterns, deriving self-regulation strategies, and implementing these self-regulation skills in daily life. Two training protocols&#x02014;theta/beta training and training of slow cortical potentials (SCPs)&#x02014;are typically used for children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In theta/beta training, children learn to reduce activity in the theta band of the EEG (4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;Hz) and to increase activity in the beta band (13&#x02013;20&#x000a0;Hz). In the resting EEG, increased slow wave (theta) activity and/or reduced relative alpha (8&#x02013;13&#x000a0;Hz) and beta activity was reported in several studies on children with ADHD (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). Thus, theta/beta training may address an underlying neuronal dysfunction. On the other hand, NF may simply be seen as a tool for enhancing specific cognitive or attentional states (an alert and focused but relaxed state in theta/beta training), irrespective of supposed neurophysiological deviations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>SCPs are changes of cortical electrical activity lasting from several hundred milliseconds to several seconds. They are thought to represent task-dependent short-term mobilisations of cortical processing resources. While negative SCPs reflect increased excitation (e.g., during states of behavioural or cognitive preparation), positive SCPs indicate reduction of cortical excitation of the underlying neural networks (e.g., during behavioural inhibition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The contingent negative variation (CNV) is an SCP that reflects anticipation and/or preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is, for example, elicited in cue trials of a continuous performance test. In event-related potential studies, the CNV was found to be reduced in children with ADHD (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Training of SCPs leads to an increase of the CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, SCP training, in which surface-negative and surface-positive SCPs have to be generated over the sensorimotor cortex, could help children with ADHD to improve their assumed dysfunctional regulation of energetical resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the last decade, several NF studies in children with ADHD have been published which manage to overcome the methodological shortcomings of earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In all of these studies, positive behavioural, cognitive and/or neurophysiological effects were described. Our group conducted a randomised controlled trial encompassing 102 children with ADHD. In this trial, behavioural and neurophysiological effects of NF, which included one training block of theta/beta training and one block of SCP training, were analysed in comparison to a computerised attention skills training (AST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to parent and teacher ratings, children of the NF group showed larger behavioural improvements than those of the control group (medium effect size of 0.6 for the primary outcome measure, total score of the German ADHD rating scale, FBB-HKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Due to comparable settings and demands for NF and the control training, superiority of NF was first and foremost ascribed to specific factors. A tendency for larger improvements was observed if theta/beta training preceded SCP training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>At the neurophysiological level (resting EEG, event-related potentials), specific associations with behavioural improvements could be revealed for theta/beta and SCP training (e.g., association between decrease of theta activity and reduction of ADHD symptomatology) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These neurophysiological effects contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying a successful training and indicate specificity of NF training effects.</p><p>Both behavioural and neurophysiological findings of our trial indicate that NF may be considered as a clinically efficacious module in the treatment of children with ADHD.</p><p>One of the questions which has not been studied under controlled conditions is whether NF training effects remain stable after completing the training. Leins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that children with ADHD, who had participated in either a theta/beta training or an SCP training, were able to learn cortical self-regulation accompanied by significant improvements in behaviour and cognition. These effects remained constant after 6&#x000a0;months. For a subgroup of 23 (from initially 47) children, 2-year follow-up data could also be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Neuroregulation skills were still preserved. Behavioural and cognitive effects were reported to be stable or even further enhanced. However, due to the lack of a control group, the effects cannot be differentiated from the natural course.</p><p>This paper reports follow-up behavioural data assessed 6&#x000a0;months after completion of the training (either NF training or AST) for the children with ADHD of our previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We hypothesised that behavioural improvements in the NF group remain stable and superior to those of the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>102 children with ADHD (8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years) participated in a NF training or an AST.

This underlines the necessity to consider multiple indicators as well as to assess follow-up measurements concerning the stability of effects. In previous papers, we reported the immediate treatment effects of a NF training (theta/beta training and SCP training) compared to an AST on different outcome levels, encompassing behavioural and neurophysiological measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This paper deals with the 6-month follow-up analyses of the behavioural outcome. Since some children started medication, we conducted a per-protocol analysis in order to avoid confounding the treatment effect with medication effect. For 61 of the 94 children (ca. 65%) of this sample, 6-month follow-up data (parent ratings) could be analysed. On average, effects were sustained at follow-up and the effects in the NF group were still superior to those of the control group. For the total score of the German ADHD rating scale (primary outcome measure), a medium effect size was obtained. Further, effects were not restricted to core ADHD symptoms but could also be observed in other domains (homework situation, conduct disorder; small to medium effect sizes). Regarding order effects for the NF protocols, the tendency for larger improvements when theta/beta training preceded SCP training could not be confirmed in the follow-up sample.</p><p>Since settings and demands for NF and the control training were comparable, these findings indicate that mainly specific effects accounted for the superiority of NF compared to the ASTs.</p><p>Specificity of effects is further supported by associations between neurophysiological patterns and the outcome at the clinical (behavioural) level as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For example, in theta/beta training, the decrease of theta activity in the resting EEG was associated with a decrease of the FBB-HKS total score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Concerning SCP training, children with a higher CNV in an attention test at baseline showed larger improvements after the relatively short training block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, partly due to the non-blind design, it cannot be ruled out that unspecific effects might have also contributed to the behavioural effects.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref></p><p>There was a relatively large number of dropouts, i.e., children who either started a medication or for whom no questionnaires were received, at follow-up (about 35%). However, dropouts were not characterised by a worse training outcome at the end of the training. These children (mainly in the control group) had slightly (but non-significantly) higher scores on the German ADHD rating scale already at the beginning of the training. In general, children for whom follow-up data were available could not be differentiated from dropouts with respect to behavioural or demographic characteristics. So, it seems unlikely that the follow-up results were strongly biased by the large portion of dropouts.</p><p>Findings are based on parent ratings only. At the post-training assessment, for only about 70% of the children, ratings of the same teacher who had completed the pre-training questionnaires were available. Expecting further high dropout rates due to change of teachers and loss of motivation to complete the questionnaires, we decided not to include teacher ratings in the follow-up analysis. It can be questioned whether teacher ratings would have supported the follow-up results obtained from parent ratings. However, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], parent and teacher ratings did not develop differentially from post-training to follow-up. In our study, comparable effects resulted for parent and teacher ratings at the post-training assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>50% of the children completing the training were categorised as non-responders, according to a criterion of 25% reduction in the primary outcome measure. 11 out of 59 children of the NF group started a medication during the follow-up interval. Our study was not designed to achieve maximum NF training effects but had an arguably artificial scientific setting (e.g., separating theta/beta and SCP training in two separate, non-coordinated blocks). Nevertheless, the low responder rate and the portion of children starting a medication in our study argue against NF as a stand-alone intervention for children with ADHD. The results indicate that not every child with ADHD may improve after NF treatment. In our opinion, NF should rather be seen as a treatment module for children with ADHD which can be embedded in a multimodal treatment program tailored to the individual needs of a child.</p><p>Stability of training effects at follow-up refers to the mean scores of the NF group and naturally does not apply to all individuals within the group. In our design, we used a fixed number of training sessions. This was intended to standardise number of treatment sessions across all individuals. However, qualitative analyses of our data suggest that children vary in their abilities and speed to learn and apply NF techniques. One block of 18 units for a single protocol might have been too short at least in some children to build up stable regulation capability and to establish transfer into daily life sufficiently. Further research therefore would be required to determine the optimal NF protocol (or combination of protocols) and the adequate number of treatment sessions for a particular child.</p><p>Coming back to the long-term outcome, it could be helpful at least for some of the children to conduct further training sessions with longer intervals between the training session to sustain and consolidate regulation capabilities and the transfer into daily life, just as it is usually practiced in conventional cognitive-behaviour therapy. In this respect, the possible benefit of such booster sessions should also be investigated in further studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Behavioural effects of NF training were maintained in children with ADHD at 6-month follow-up, further supporting clinical efficacy of this neurobehavioral training. NF may be recommended as a treatment module for children with ADHD besides conventional behavioural trainings and medication. Future studies should systematically address how to optimise/individualise NF training and how to embed it in a multimodal treatment in children with ADHD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Christa Dahlmann, Martin Deinzer, Claudia Vogel, Susanne Wangler, Nicola W&#x000f6;stmann and the student assistants for their valuable support as well as all the participating families for their contribution and effort.
