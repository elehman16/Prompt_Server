Obesity and overweight play a key role in NAFLD pathogenesis. Thus, weight loss (especially body fat mass) is one component of therapeutic strategies in NAFLD. Results from experimental studies have shown that garlic (<italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.) can reduce body weight and body fat mass. However, the effect of garlic on body fat mass and weight in the human population, which is addressed in this study, is still obscure.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, 110 subjects with NAFLD were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group. The intervention group received two garlic tablets (containing 400 mg of garlic powder) daily while the control group received placebo tablets. Dietary intake and physical activity of participants were obtained by a validated questionnaire. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In the intervention group, significant reductions were observed in body weight and body fat mass (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). We also observed a significant reduction in body weight in the control group, but there were no significant changes in total body water and lean body mass in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In the intervention group, the percentage change in body weight was significantly greater than the control group (&#x02212;2.6 vs. &#x02212;0.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).

It has been reported that weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia, reduces the amount of lipid accumulation in the liver, and may prevent or delay the progression of NAFLD.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Various strategies including lifestyle modifications (caloric restriction, physical increasing), anti-obesity medication, and bariatric surgery are used for weight loss.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nonetheless, sometimes weight loss is not achievable without using dietary supplements.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Garlic (<italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.) has been used as food and medicinal plant in many countries and cultures for thousands of years. It has traditionally been used to treat respiratory diseases. Current studies also suggest that consumption of garlic can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Garlic contains many organosulfur compounds that its biological activities are attributed to them.

All subjects were recruited from Metabolic Liver Disease Research Center in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. The appropriate sample size was estimated using the suggested formula for parallel clinical trials. We considered type 1 error of 5% (&#x003b1; = 0.05), type 2 error of 20% (&#x003b2; = 20, power = 80%), and body fat mass as a key variable. On the basis of a previous study,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the variance of body fat mass was 3 kg. We also considered 1.7 kg as the difference in mean (<italic>d</italic>) of body fat mass. The result showed that the study needed 45 subjects in each group. To allow participants dropping out during the study, 110 patients were selected for study. The inclusion criteria of the study were: Men and women aged between 20 and 70 years, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &#x02265;40 U/L and newly diagnosed NAFLD by ultrasonography. The exclusion criteria were: Pregnancy and lactation, smoking subjects, allergic to garlic, use of supplements, alcohol, anti-hypertensive medications, anti-obesity medication, statins and metformin, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, chronic heart failure, hemochromatosis, cholestasis, Wilson's disease, and cirrhosis.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This study was approved by the Research Council and Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and was registered on Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website (IRCT2014110819853N1).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>In this 15-week clinical randomized trial, participants were randomly assigned to intervention or control group using the stratified blocked randomization method. All participants, assistant, and researcher were blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the study until the main analyses were completed. A trained person, who was not blinded to the intervention, performed the randomized allocation and assigned participants to interventions. Based on previous studies,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the intervention group received 400 mg garlic powder tablets (coated tablets contain 1.5 mg allicin, Amin Pharmaceuticals Co., Isfahan, Iran) twice a day while the control group received placebo (coated tablets contain starch and microcrystalline cellulose). Placebo was produced in School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. All patients received one tablet after breakfast and one tablet after dinner for a 15-week period. Placebo tablets were in the same shape and appearance as the garlic tablets. Participant adherence was measured by tablet counting at each visit and phone call. Poor compliance was defined as &#x0003c;80% of expected tablets taken.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Both groups were advised to the common dietary and behavioral recommendations during follow-up. The participants were not allowed to eat more than two garlic cloves per week.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Anthropometric assessment</title><p>In this study, a trained person measured height and body composition under the standard protocols in participants with light clothes and without shoes at the beginning and the end of the study. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the Body Composition Analyzer (Jawon IOI 353, Korea). According to the methods of using BIA, patients were advised to be hydrated; avoid exercising in the previous 4&#x02013;6 h and consuming tea or caffeine in the previous 24 h.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m<sup>2</sup>). We used the same machine and instrument in order to avoid inter-instrument variation in all measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Dietary intake assessment</title><p>Dietary intake was assessed by a 3-day food record (1-week end and 2 work days) at baseline and the end of the study, in order to assess dietary variation. The amount of each food item was calculated using household measures. Then food records were analyzed using the Nutritionist IV software (version 7.0; N-squared Computing, Salam, OR, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Physical activity assessments</title><p>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used to estimate physical activity level. IPAQ was taken of each participant at baseline, during the study period, and the end of the study by a trained person.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first clinical trial published about the effect of garlic on body composition in both genders.</p><p>In the present study, there were significant reductions in body weight not only in the garlic group but also in the placebo group. It seems that the observed reduction in body weight among the control group may be due to significant reductions in energy intake. In garlic group, although energy intake was unchanged, weight changes in the garlic group were significantly greater than the placebo group. These observations imply that garlic supplementation successfully reduced body weight. Consistent with this, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. showed that adding garlic to diet-induced obese mice suppressed body weight gain.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>We also observed no significant changes in lean body mass after a 15-week garlic supplementation. The weight loss is often accompanied by a loss of lean body mass, which has deleterious metabolic consequences.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Therefore, this finding demonstrated that garlic could have beneficial effects on lean body mass. In a clinical study, Seo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the aged garlic extract reduced body weight and lean body mass in postmenopausal women after a 12-week intervention.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] There are several differences between our study and aforesaid report such as gender, supplement, and study duration. It also seems that their observations cannot be reliable due to the small sample size (placebo; <italic>n</italic> = 6 and age intake; <italic>n</italic> = 8).</p><p>Another important finding in our study was a significant reduction in body fat mass after garlic supplementation without significant changes in energy intake. Although there are limited studies in this context, Joo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that dietary supplementation with garlic significantly reduced adipose tissue mass in rats fed a high-fat diet.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In the adipocytes, fat is accumulated due to excess energy intake. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the main storage for reserve energy in the form of TG. In contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in using the triglyceride (TG) to produce heat. Thermogenesis in BAT is induced via the sympathetic nervous system.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In rats, it has been reported that garlic and its derivatives enhanced the sympathetic nervous system activation through increasing the secretion of norepinephrine.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The anti-obesity action associated with garlic may refer to its thermogenic properties. In support to this suggestion, it has been reported that garlic and its derivatives increased the oxygen consumption.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Some studies also suggested that anti-obesity effect of garlic and its derivatives might be mediated at least partially by other mechanisms. Keophiphath <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that 1,2-vinyldithiin (a garlic-derived organosulfur) suppressed human preadipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation in differentiated preadipocyte by inhibiting gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Yang <italic>et al</italic>. reported that ajoene (another garlic-derived organosulfur) could induce apoptosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and fragmentation of DNA.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Joo <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that garlic caused an increase in the fecal triglyceride by decreasing intestinal triglyceride absorption.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Several points should be considered as strengths of the current study such as the stratified blocked randomization design, equal macro and micronutrient distribution between two groups, high compliance rate (more than 93%) among patients completing the study, and adequate sample size and study duration.</p><p>We should mention several limitations. In the current study, we used BIA as a noninvasive, safe, portable, and rapid method for assessment of body composition while BIA is not the gold-standard measure of body composition. Also, using BIA to measure body fat mass has a major limitation due to changes in total body water during the study.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We did not observe changes in total body water during the study, so this did not limit our findings. Another limitation of this study was that we could not precisely assess dietary intake throughout the trial. So, these might have been affected our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrated that a 15-week garlic supplementation could decrease body fat mass among NAFLD patients.
