A reservoir of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> within the Eurasian badger (<italic>Meles meles</italic>) population is thought to have hindered disease control. Cattle herd incidents, termed breakdowns, that are either &#x02018;<italic>prolonged</italic>&#x02019; (lasting &#x02265;240 days) or &#x02018;<italic>recurrent</italic>&#x02019; (with another breakdown within a specified time period) may be important foci for onward spread of infection. They drain veterinary resources and can be demoralising for farmers. Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) data were re-analysed to examine the effects of two culling strategies on breakdown prolongation and recurrence, <italic>during</italic> and <italic>after</italic> culling, using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Separate effect estimates were obtained for the &#x02018;core&#x02019; trial areas (where culling occurred) and the &#x02018;buffer&#x02019; zones (up to 2 km outside of the core areas). For breakdowns that started during the culling period, &#x02018;<italic>reactive</italic>&#x02019; (localised) culling was associated with marginally increased odds of prolongation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.7 (95% credible interval [CI] 1.1&#x02013;2.4) within the core areas. This effect was not present after the culling ceased. There was no notable effect of &#x02018;<italic>proactive</italic>&#x02019; culling on prolongation. In contrast, reactive culling had no effect on breakdown recurrence, though there was evidence of a reduced risk of recurrence in proactive core areas during the culling period (ORs and 95% CIs: 0.82 (0.64&#x02013;1.0) and 0.69 (0.54&#x02013;0.86) for 24- and 36-month recurrence respectively). Again these effects were not present after the culling ceased. There seemed to be no effect of culling on breakdown prolongation or recurrence in the buffer zones. These results suggest that the RBCT badger culling strategies are unlikely to reduce either the prolongation or recurrence of breakdowns in the long term, and that reactive strategies (such as employed during the RBCT) are, if anything, likely to impact detrimentally on breakdown persistence.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>KK, TJM and JLNW were supported by grant VT0105 from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Hefce.

A routine surveillance programme to slaughter cattle classified as infected has been unsuccessful, with incidence of herd &#x02018;breakdowns&#x02019; (movement restrictions associated with detection of infection in cattle) increasing over the last 25 years <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Failure to eradicate bTB from GB has been complicated by the existence of a wildlife reservoir, namely the Eurasian badger (<italic>Meles meles</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Nationally, around 30% of herd breakdowns are &#x02018;<italic>prolonged</italic>&#x02019; (&#x02265;240 days) <xref rid="pone.0051342-Karolemeas1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and around 23% and 38% are &#x02018;<italic>recurrent</italic>&#x02019; within 12 and 24 months respectively <xref rid="pone.0051342-Karolemeas2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These persistent breakdowns are important as they are demanding on resources, and may additionally be acting as foci of infection, fuelling the increase in incidence. Furthermore, they can have a substantially detrimental effect on the well-being of farmers <xref rid="pone.0051342-FarmCrisis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Breakdowns may become persistent from the presence of underlying and undetected infection within the herd, or by transmission and re-infection into the herd from other herds or environmental reservoirs of infection. The relative contribution of the badger reservoir to these empirical measures of persistence is not clear.</p><p>Due to a lack of detailed data on badger densities and infection status (which is not routinely collected), many previous studies have focussed on measuring associations between proxies for badger risk and incidence of bTB. For example, in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) <xref rid="pone.0051342-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> there was found to be an association between the presence of badgers on farms and breakdowns that were either over 12 months in duration, or recurrent within a four-year period. In another study <xref rid="pone.0051342-Christiansen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> there was found to be no association with the presence of badgers and recurrence at the test conducted six months after the end of a breakdown. In GB, an association between the relative density of badgers and breakdowns over six months duration has been reported <xref rid="pone.0051342-Reilly1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although the aforementioned studies were similar in that they all used bTB test-negative herds as controls, differences in their case definitions for persistence makes comparisons between the findings challenging.</p><p>Previous studies in GB that examined risk factors for breakdown prolongation and recurrence, in which a range of farm-level factors were considered, included examination of information on the presence or absence of badgers, and whether or not badger control policies were performed at the farm level <xref rid="pone.0051342-Karolemeas1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Karolemeas2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although no association was found between the badger variables examined and breakdown persistence, it is possible that this lack of association may have been due to confounding in measured or unmeasured variables, or that some of the variables identified in the model represented proxies for increased potential for transmission from badgers.</p><p>Further insight into the role that badgers play in infecting cattle herds can be gained from examining the effect of badger culling. Since 1971, when a dead badger infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> was first discovered on a farm affected by bTB in GB, badgers have been strongly implicated in the transmission of <italic>M. bovis</italic> to cattle, prompting a number of badger culling strategies that occurred between 1973 and 1998. However, these culling operations <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and those conducted in the ROI <xref rid="pone.0051342-Eves1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Griffin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> lacked randomised control areas where no culling was conducted, making conclusions difficult to interpret.</p><p>The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) was set up in 1998 to examine the effect of badger culling on bTB incidence in cattle herds in GB, and specifically included randomly selected matched control areas where no culling was undertaken <xref rid="pone.0051342-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The RBCT was designed and conducted by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG; <xref rid="pone.0051342-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>). The data are a valuable resource, and various analyses have been conducted. Analyses to date have measured the effect of culling on <italic>overall confirmed</italic> and <italic>total</italic> (confirmed and unconfirmed) <italic>incidence</italic>, both during and subsequent to the trial <xref rid="pone.0051342-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051342-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and more recently have examined individual herd risk factors for breakdowns <xref rid="pone.0051342-Vial1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-WT1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Nonetheless, the effect of badger culling on <italic>persistent</italic> breakdowns within individual cattle herds has yet to be examined.</p><p>Widespread badger culling remains illegal in GB and is an ongoing subject of political debate <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-King1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, in December 2011 Defra ministers announced a cull of badgers in two pilot areas, originally due to commence in 2012 <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but now delayed until 2013 <xref rid="pone.0051342-Badgercull1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Farmers and landowners in these areas will be able to apply for licences to reduce badger populations at their own expense, and the humaneness of the culling will be judged by a panel of independent experts at the end of the period. The results from the pilot areas will inform policy decisions on whether this approach will be more widely adopted in the future. As an alternative, the vaccination of badgers is currently being trialled in one area of Gloucester <xref rid="pone.0051342-Defra6" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which is planned to continue until 2015, and in June 2012 the Welsh Assembly Government announced that a badger vaccination trial had begun as part of their bTB eradication strategy <xref rid="pone.0051342-Welsh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The perceived failure to address the wildlife reservoir has led to much distress and unrest in farming communities. Farmers are often reluctant to implement increased cattle controls when re-infection by badgers is perceived to be inevitable. Knowledge of the role of badgers in the re-infection of cattle herds is critical to inform those developing control policies. In this study we quantify the effects of the two badger culling strategies (proactive and reactive) conducted during the RBCT, on breakdown prolongation and recurrence in individual herds in areas of high cattle bTB incidence in GB.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0051342-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0051342.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Numbers of cases (prolonged) and controls (non-prolonged), and the proportion prolonged, for the different treatment areas aggregated across the core and buffer zones.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0051342-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0051342.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Core</td><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Buffer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cases</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Controls</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proportion</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cases</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Controls</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proportion</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proactive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">460</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">893</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1353</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.34</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">371</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">650</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1021</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reactive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">437</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">750</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1187</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.37</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">298</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">535</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">833</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survey</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">686</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1214</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1900</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">399</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">796</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1195</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Summary of RBCT Trial Areas and Culling Treatments</title><p>The RBCT was conducted in 30 trial areas, located in areas of high bTB incidence, mainly in the West and South-west of England <xref rid="pone.0051342-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

We also explored the impacts of the culling treatment on persistence in two time periods: during the cull and after the cull.</p><p>In terms of breakdown prolongation, we found marginal evidence of an increase in the odds of prolongation in the core reactive areas in the period during the cull (OR: 1.7; 95% C.I. [1.1&#x02013;2.4]). However, this detrimental effect did not persist in the period after the cull. There was no notable impact of culling treatment on prolongation in the buffer zones.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying these results are unclear. Both reactive and proactive culling have been shown to result in an increased prevalence of bTB infection in badger populations <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, most likely due to social and territorial disruption in mixing patterns in the badger populations as a result of the cull <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and potentially leading to an increase in mixing and transmission between badgers and cattle <xref rid="pone.0051342-Jenkins2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It is possible that these behaviours could result in an increase in the force-of-infection acting on an already infected cattle herd, and hence potentially increase the degree of within-herd spread of the disease.</p><p>In proactively culled areas, any increase in prevalence in badgers was likely to have been offset by a large reduction in badger density, which was not observed to anywhere near the same magnitude in the reactively culled areas <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Coupled with the fact that reactive culling was conducted over small, localised areas surrounding <italic>confirmed</italic> breakdowns, this may have resulted in increased contact between cattle and badgers in localised regions (i.e. herds) that were already experiencing above-average levels of underlying infection. This mechanism would also be consistent with the effect disappearing in the period after the culling ended, since there is evidence to suggest that re-colonisation (and hence stabilisation) of the badger populations was quick in the reactive areas <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>The perturbation effect hypothesis has been questioned by some who suggest a lag period is necessary before any effect might be expected to be seen <xref rid="pone.0051342-More1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The Godfray report <xref rid="pone.0051342-CJ1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, published in 2004, concluded that there was insufficient information in the reactive areas to support the perturbation effect hypothesis, questioning whether firm conclusions can be drawn from the reactively-culled areas due to the low numbers of badgers removed from relatively small areas. A similar consideration is whether reactive culling, on the scale conducted in the RBCT, would be able to influence breakdown prolongation and recurrence as measured in our study. However, subsequent analysis of cattle TB in and around proactively culled RBCT areas found a 29% increase in bTB risk observed among cattle herds living close to (but outside) proactive trial areas <xref rid="pone.0051342-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, consistent with the earlier finding in reactive areas. Our findings, albeit marginal, suggest that reactive culling, as practiced in the RBCT, is associated with a detrimental effect in the shorter term. This complements the results of a recent study <xref rid="pone.0051342-Flavie1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which examined the change in bTB risk in nearby cattle herds as a direct result of reactive culling over different time periods up to January 2007, concluding that the risk of having a confirmed breakdown was increased in the period during the reactive cull, even after adjusting for other important local risk factors.</p><p>Disruption to testing caused by the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic is likely to have a more pronounced impact on the data obtained from reactive areas due to the timing of the culling periods with respect to the FMD outbreak. Reactive culling was stopped at a much earlier stage than the proactive cull, with all reactive areas experiencing their last cull in 2003, compared to 2005 for the proactive culls. In the model, the definition of the time period during the cull is centred around these earlier years in the reactive areas, which span the FMD epidemic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051342-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the proportions of prolonged breakdowns that started in each year, stratified by treatment. It can be seen that there was a spike in the levels of prolongation in each of the treatment regions in 2001, however the proportions of prolonged breakdowns were already higher in 2000 in the reactive areas compared to the proactive and survey-only areas, which carried through to higher levels in 2001. It is these patterns that are reflected in the increased OR for prolongation in the reactive areas during the culling period. However, there is no clear systematic or mechanistic reason why the reactive areas should have been disproportionately affected by FMD compared to the other areas. It is also worth noting that the sample sizes at these earlier time points is much smaller than at later time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051342.s002">Table S2</xref>), and it is possible that the observed effect may simply be due to an artefact of the small sample size. However, we note that this should also be reflected in the uncertainty in the parameter estimates.</p><p>In terms of breakdown recurrence, we found a small decrease in the odds of recurrence at 24 and 36 months (ORs and 96% C.I.s of 0.82 [0.64&#x02013;1.0] and 0.69 [0.54&#x02013;0.86] respectively) in the proactively culled core areas in the period during the culling. These beneficial effects consequently reduced in the period subsequent to the cull. No notable impact of culling on recurrence was observed in the buffer zones. Recent work on the mechanisms of recurrence <xref rid="pone.0051342-Conlan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> suggest that due to the testing regime imposed upon a herd as a result of a breakdown, it is likely that re-introduction of infection (rather than persistence of infection within a herd) is the main driver of recurrence. To this end a large reduction in badger density, such as was observed in the proactively culled areas <xref rid="pone.0051342-Woodroffe4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, would be consistent with a reduced risk of re-introduction of infection by badgers into cattle herds. However, re-infection by badgers is only one possible source of re-introduction of infection into a herd, with cattle movements being the other main potential source.</p><p>Some work has been conducted exploring the relative impacts of cattle movements and localised sources on between-herd transmission of bTB <xref rid="pone.0051342-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, however the relative contributions of cattle-to-cattle and badger-to-cattle transmission have not yet been accurately quantified, though work has been done towards modelling these interactions <xref rid="pone.0051342-Cox2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Certainly if cattle-to-cattle transmission was responsible for a larger degree of cattle infection than badger-to-cattle transmission, then this would be consistent with the observation that proactive culling reduces the risk of recurrence by a relatively small degree in the first instance, before the beneficial effects tail off.</p><p>The optimal control policies directed at an individual farm to reduce breakdown prolongation and recurrence, for which an individual farmer will have a vested interest, might be quite different to the optimal policies aimed at reducing incidence across a wider area. Since it is likely that future culling would be at the farmer&#x02019;s expense (the Government wildlife unit that performed the culling during the RBCT has since been disbanded), the financial cost, as well as the time that farmers would have to outlay for culling operations, should be weighed against any potential beneficial/detrimental effects of the culling.</p><p>This work could be extended to examine the spatial relationships of whether localised (reactive) culling leads to prolongation or recurrence on the farm itself, and/or on contiguous farms. This might give further insight for policymakers regarding the spatial scale of effects of localised culling on persistence, and may shed more light on potential biological mechanisms regarding the interaction between badger culling and persistence.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that a future culling policy that mirrored the proactive strategy used in the RBCT may have a marginal effect on reducing the degree of recurrence in the short-term, but this benefit is unlikely to extend much further beyond the end of the culling period. In contrast, a reactive strategy, such as that used in the RBCT, would most likely increase the average duration of breakdowns in the short-term, with little impact on reducing recurrence. These detrimental effects are unlikely to last in the long-term. In order to have any beneficial impact on recurrence, albeit most likely marginal, any culling strategy would have to mirror more closely the proactive treatment. These findings should be considered alongside those from other studies if badger culling is to form part of the future bTB control programme for cattle in GB.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051342.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
