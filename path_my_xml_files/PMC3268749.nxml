Effective patient self-management is critical for improving health outcomes. However, key aspects of self-management such as self-monitoring of behaviours and symptoms, coupled with regular feedback from the health care team, are rarely addressed or integrated into ongoing care. Health information technology (HIT) provides unique opportunities to facilitate this by providing a means for two way communication and exchange of information between the patient and care team, and access to their health information, presented in personalized ways that can alert them when there is a need for action. The objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of using a web-based self-management system, My Asthma Portal (MAP), linked to a case-management system on asthma control, and asthma health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The trial is a parallel multi-centered 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) MAP and usual care; or b) usual care alone. Individuals will be included if they are between 18 and 70, have a confirmed asthma diagnosis, and their asthma is classified as not well controlled by their physician. Asthma control will be evaluated by calculating the amount of fast acting beta agonists recorded as dispensed in the provincial drug database, and asthma quality of life using the Mini Asthma Related Quality of Life Questionnaire. Power calculations indicated a needed total sample size of 80 subjects. Data are collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post randomization. Recruitment started in March 2010 and the inclusion of patients in the trial in June 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Self-management support from the care team is critical for improving chronic disease outcomes. Given the high volume of patients and time constraints during clinical visits, primary care physicians have limited time to teach and reinforce use of proven self-management strategies.

Despite the availability of effective therapies, optimal management of asthma remains problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Much of the cost of asthma care is attributable to poor disease control due to non-adherence to prophylactic therapies, inadequate monitoring of disease severity, and insufficient patient education for effective self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Effective management requires a strong collaborative partnership between patients and their care team. Asthma programs that incorporate strategies to optimise self-management reduce ED visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, barriers to building effective partnerships between patients and the care team include lack of patient time and engagement, reduced continuity of care, limited patient self-monitoring of symptoms, and minimal follow-up between visits by the care team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Health information technologies (HIT) can offer novel opportunities to enhance patient self-management and patient-provider partnerships by facilitating: 1) active disease monitoring and feedback with the care team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; 2) patient education about successful adoption and maintenance of health behaviours between clinical encounters; 3) case management when problems are identified; and 3) an opportunity to share clinical information and treatment goals through patient access to their personal health record (PHR). Ongoing efforts to develop, implement, and evaluate computerized-assisted decision-support and clinical information systems for clinicians have shown promise in reducing medication errors and healthcare utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Limited work, however, has been completed in the area of decision and self-management support systems for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><sec><title>The Chronic Care Model and Patient Self-Management Support</title><p>The Chronic Care Model (CCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] is an evidence-based, client-centered framework to improve care for individuals with chronic disease and provide support for their caregivers. A basic tenet of the CCM is that productive, patient-centered interactions between informed patients and knowledgeable teams across the care continuum can lead to optimal outcomes. The CCM component with the second strongest evidence base is patient self-management support, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] which empowers individuals to develop the self-efficacy and skills needed to manage their health effectively.</p><sec><title>Engaging and training patients to manage their asthma</title><p>Self-management is the individual's ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical, and psychosocial consequences and lifestyle changes inherent to living with a chronic health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Beyond providing education and supportive counselling, self-management programs also teach specific skills with proven effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The impact of self-management on health outcomes is thought to occur primarily through changes in health behaviours by providing patients with the confidence to engage in tasks and to acquire core knowledge and skills aimed at helping them better manage their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Optimal long-term management requires ongoing monitoring of asthma control by patients, coupled with an individualized written asthma action plan. This allows patients to quickly identify and address suboptimal disease control by adjusting medications or by contacting their physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Many individuals with asthma lack the necessary knowledge to effectively manage their asthma such as how to avoid common triggers and the role of medications in preventing and addressing worsening symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Often, patients do not recognize early signs of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It is estimated that less than 40% of patients regularly monitor their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and even fewer initiate their prescribed action plan at the first signs of an exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. As a result, even when an action plan is available, only a minority of patients titrate their therapy as directed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In turn, the exacerbation may escalate to the point of requiring urgent medical attention with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have also found that many individuals with asthma have suboptimal levels of physical activity and aerobic endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. However, there has been relatively limited interest and success developing interventions to improve physical activity in asthma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Reinforcement and follow-up are key predictors of long-term adherence to increased physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Support from others (e.g. health professional, peer group, trainer) can improve self-efficacy and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Proven strategies that facilitate the adoption and maintenance of increased physical activity levels include setting realistic goals, tailoring activities based on enjoyment and personal history, identifying and addressing common barriers such as time constraints, and monitoring progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p><p>The episodic nature of asthma symptoms and exacerbations may be a significant barrier to effective self-management. Decision research on trend perception has shown that it is difficult to recognize changes in trend in disease control when information on momentary experiences is presented in a partitioned manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. In the context of asthma, if patients view their disease as a series of acute episodes, this impairs their ability to monitor changes in asthma control. While previous studies using simple alert systems have had little effect in improving asthma control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], graphically representing changes in asthma control over time may increase the salience of this information. HIT tools that can improve trend perception combined with feedback from the care team have the potential to improve self-management. Web-based technology allows real time visual representation of asthma control over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Studies have also found that when patients have greater asthma knowledge of how to use their action plan effectively and are given appropriate tools to monitor symptoms and document changes, they are better able to learn and develop the skills needed to optimise asthma control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. These skills centre on problem solving when symptoms worsen, decision making to identify optimal actions (e.g., increase medicines or call the care team), and the ability to find and utilize resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Finally, given the wealth of available health information, sorting through what is relevant and appropriate is another skill that individuals need to master [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. When information is easily accessible at the time it is needed (e.g., when symptoms worsen), patients are more likely to be able to act on the information. The ability to access the appropriate information, tailored to their needs and preferences, and coupled with the knowledge that they have ongoing support and feedback from the care team, can enhance confidence to develop the necessary skills to engage in essential self-management tasks.</p></sec><sec><title>Ongoing Monitoring and feedback from the care team</title><p>Another important contributor to suboptimal management of asthma is the lack of follow-up by the care team between visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Efforts to persist in ongoing self-monitoring and self-management are often directly related to the extent to which patients perceive that they have access to and receive feedback from the care team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Many patients have difficulty recognizing early signs of deterioration and do not access their care team in a timely manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Given the high volume of patients, primary care physicians often have limited time for regular monitoring, feedback, and reinforcement. Even when face-to-face asthma education programs are available, many patients are not able to attend and often these programs do not incorporate necessary self-management skill training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>].</p><p>Reminders to monitor their asthma and share results with the care team have been shown to improve medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Such approaches allow patients to partner with their care providers, routinely discuss trends and rhythm of their disease and share in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Patients engaged in their own care may be effective catalysts for changing and optimizing clinical management of their asthma.</p><p>Chronic disease case-management can effectively improve symptoms and health-related quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. Case managers play a critical role engaging patients in treatment and providing ongoing monitoring and feedback with the clinical team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. To achieve this, case mangers require real time access to patients' medical records and patient reported outcomes and other information that will aid in the identification of problems as they arise. These two key principles, engaging and training patients to manage their asthma and providing patients with active monitoring and feedback from the care team, were used to develop <italic>My Asthma Portal </italic>(MAP) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and the linked nurse case-management system.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Relationship between MAP and Health Outcomes</bold>.

The EHR contains drug information entered by the physician and from the Quebec provincial health database (RAMQ) including: 1) medications prescribed by the physician, and the RAMQ record for all drugs dispensed, medical services provided, ED visits and hospitalizations. Relevant data from the EHR are sent to MAP and the nurse case-management system. The MAP system also provides links to selected patient educational materials from credible online resources.</p><p>Participants are given a MAP username and password and are asked to access the internet from anywhere (home, work, library). They are asked to select the number of times they will commit to logging in per week, with a minimum log in of at least 1&#x000d7;/week. During the first time log in, they complete a <italic>My Profile </italic>page to verify basic demographic information, enter additional health information (e.g., smoking status, allergies, triggers) and select initial health goals to work on.</p><p>Once patients complete the initial log-in, their information appears in the nurse case management system. When the nurse receives a new participant file, she reviews the accuracy of the medication list, the action plan details, and clarifies discrepancies with the referring physician, if needed. As patients complete monitoring information in the MAP system (symptoms, medication adherence, action plan use, and physical activity), the information appears simultaneously in the nurse case-management system. Based on information from the EHR and participant responses to patient reported outcomes in MAP, the MAP and nurse case-management systems provide clinical decision support (described later on) to patients and the nurse. The flow of information between MAP and the other systems is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Integration of MAP with the MOXXI EHR and nurse case-management system</bold>.

Key principals were used to guide the design of user-friendly screens and the organization and display of educational material including Instructional Design (ID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>], User Centered Design (UCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>], Information Architecture (IA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>], Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>], health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>], and usability principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>].

Colors were chosen based on their widespread application both within the medical community and within society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>] and also to help distinguish information entered by patients from that entered by the healthcare team. A user-centered iterative design process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>] was used to design the MAP interface. This process involved 3 nurses, 2 physicians, and 10 patients (5 for focus group, 5 for individual interviews) attending an asthma clinic (Montreal Chest Institute, asthma clinic where PE works) who were asked to provide feedback on the tool and based on the feedback changes were made to the content and layout of the system.

Each week, patients are prompted to complete the series of questions that assess symptoms, need for urgent care use (i.e., unscheduled office or ED visit), asthma medication use (medications are pre-populated in the system from the EHR), understanding of the steps of the action plan, action plan use, and physical activity. During subsequent log-ins each week, patients are only asked about medication adherence, action plan use, and physical activity information after the first login.

This section allows patients to track asthma behaviours and receive feedback at a glance. Both color-coding (green, yellow, red) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and text feedback in the 'Advice From Your Healthcare Team' box are used to convey how well they are reaching targeted goals. Because examining trends over time may facilitate problem identification and promote health behavior change, graphs that show longitudinal trends over a 6 month period in symptoms, use of rescue medication, medication adherence, and number of steps walked (as an indicator of physical activity) are presented. Each graph also indicates the date on which a participant had a respiratory-related ED or urgent care visit to help link participant behaviors with relevant outcomes.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>My Asthma Health Profile</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-260-4"/></fig><p>&#x02022; <italic>My Medicatio</italic>ns. Because proper use of medications is central for optimal asthma control, a separate tab was created that lists the name of each medication, type (controller, rescue), and how it should be used (i.e., frequency and dose). A separate tab is also available where patients can view their color-coded action plan (<italic>My Action Plan</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Given the importance of the environment and avoiding stimuli that trigger exacerbations, the participant's asthma triggers are highlighted across the top of the action plan.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>MAP Action Plan</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-260-5"/></fig><p>&#x02022; <italic>My Mail</italic>. To facilitate communication and partnership building with the nurse case-manager, a separate tab was created to allow patients to email and receive messages from the nurse. The email view was designed to look similar to other common email applications in terms of the functions for creating and sending an email, and folders.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Learning Center</italic>. Here, patients can view a table of contents of links to external sites gathered from legitimate sources of asthma and health educational information that were selected by the research and clinical team. Note: <italic>Links to </italic>educational materials <italic>are also </italic>directly integrated within the main content of the site to facilitate use. Throughout various parts of the portal, patients have information links that redirect them to specific content in the learning center thereby tailoring the educational material they are presented to their personal health information. For example, each medication has an information button that will direct the participant to the Quebec Ministry of Health Drug Database site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guidesante.gouv.qc.ca">http://www.guidesante.gouv.qc.ca</ext-link> which offers a description of the medication, intended use, side effects, along with potential interactions with other drugs or health conditions. Similarly, if patients indicate that they do not understand their action plan (when they respond to monitoring questions) they are taken to a web page that describes an action plan and its importance for asthma control.</p></sec><sec><title>Nurse Case Management System Design and Features</title><p>The nurse case-management system was designed to: 1) Quickly identify patients that may require immediate care; 2) Collate relevant medical and monitoring information for each participant; 3) Document participant management information, including interactions by phone and through email, and interventions and advice provided during interactions.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Participant List</italic>: The first view in the nurse case management portal is a participant triage list color-coded and ordered by urgency with respect to participant control status (i.e. those classified as not having good asthma control and not using their action plan will appear first) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The nurse's dashboard also includes a summary of alerts related to asthma monitoring (described below) and sorted by date.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Nurse Case-Management Triage Patient List</bold>.

The business logic for the color-coding and advice presented to patients is summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. An alert is sent to patients via email when the system identifies that a participant's asthma is poorly controlled and the participant indicates they have not initiated use of their action plan, if the nurse has updated the action plan, or if they have not logged in for 7 days (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The participant is given an opportunity to act on these alerts and if the flag of a problem for any of these areas remains for 48 hours, the alert status is escalated to notify the nurse case-manager.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Monitoring business rules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Green</th><th align="left">Yellow</th><th align="left">Red</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Symptoms</td><td align="left">No symptoms</td><td align="left">1 symptom</td><td align="left">2 symptoms and/or emergency visit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Overuse of rescue puffer*</td><td align="left">P &#x0003c;

Doses dispensed will be based on quantities recorded in dispensed prescriptions from the RAMQ and private pharmacy prescription files. The maximum acceptable use of fast acting beta2-agonists is derived from recommendations in the guidelines that allow up to 3 doses per week and a daily dose for the prevention of exercise induced symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

When it comes to asthma, ongoing team care and follow-up is often limited and fragmented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">149</xref>], and case- management is typically available only in specialized centers. Health information technologies provide a unique opportunity to facilitate asthma management by providing a means for two way communication and exchange of information between the patient and care team. MAP provides patients with timely access to their health information coupled with case-management, presented in personalized ways that can alert them when there is a need for action, and may empower them to self-manage more effectively and facilitate and reinforce health behaviour change.</p><p>The main focus of this trial will be on evaluating the benefit of MAP on asthma control and health-related quality of life. The increasing importance of multidisciplinary care in chronic disease gives reason for the implementation of the case manager who can assume the role of a coordinator and act as an interface between the different disciplines. One of the concerns is the increased demand on case manger time outside of the clinical encounter. We have designed the case manager system in a way to minimize needed time on the nurse's part and to facilitate access to information. Future work will examine the cost implications of providing nurse case management via information technologies through a patient portal compared to traditional care approaches.</p><p>Another potential challenge may be identifying the training needed of individuals who will use the system. While some patients are more intuitively inclined to learn how to use new technologies, some require more training time and support than others. This will be monitored through the trial to identify participant profiles that will inform future design of systems like MAP and to streamline the training process.</p><p>With any web-based tool a further concern is the differential access and comfort of participants with technologies in general for older, poorer, and less educated people who are less likely to adopt the web-based system described here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">150</xref>]. The implications are that we may recruit younger and more educated individuals who are more inclined to have access to computers and thus the results may not be immediately generalizable to other patient groups. Further, MAP is a multi-faceted intervention and the results from this trial will not be able to attribute any potential improvement in outcome to a specific component of the intervention. If benefits are found from this pilot, future studies will incorporate comparison groups to identify specific components of MAP that are necessary for improving outcomes.</p><p>As new technologies are developed and their benefits rigorously evaluated, the provider-patient workflow will continue to evolve. The challenge remains to develop integrated systems of care that permit easy access to information, enhance collaboration between clinicians and patients, and emphasize a patient-centered approach to care by addressing the self-management needs that are most relevant to patients. Individual access to patient health portals coupled with self-management tools and efficient feedback from the care team represents one such new paradigm of care. Results from our study will provide clinical trial evidence for the clinical impact of a web-based chronic disease management system and a new structure for collaborative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>HIT: Health information technology; MAP: My Asthma Portal; ED: emergency department; PHR: personal health record; CCM: Chronic Care Model; EHR: electronic health record; MOXXI: Medical Office of the Twenty-First Century; RAMQ: Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec; ID: Instructional Design; UCD: User Centered Design; IA: Information Architecture; HCI: Human Computer Interaction; AQLQ: Asthma quality of life questionnaire; TAM: Technology Acceptance Model; HRQL: health-related quality of life; IRB: institutional review board.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SA conceived the study objectives, and led the design and implementation of MAP, and drafted the manuscript.
