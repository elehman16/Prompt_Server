Internationally, research suggests that schools often fail to implement practices consistent with healthy school canteen policies. Without a population wide implementation, the potential benefits of these policies will not be realised. The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of an implementation intervention in increasing school canteen practices consistent with a healthy canteen policy of the New South Wales (NSW), Australia, government known as the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The parallel randomised trial will be conducted in 70 primary schools located in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Schools will be eligible to participate if they are not currently meeting key components of the healthy canteen policy. Schools will be randomly allocated after baseline data collection in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control group using a computerised random number function in Microsoft Excel. Thirty-five schools will be selected to receive a multi-component intervention including implementation support from research staff, staff training, resources, recognition and incentives, consensus and leadership strategies, follow-up support and implementation feedback. The 35 schools allocated to the control group will not receive any intervention support as part of the research trial. The primary outcome measures will be i) the proportion of schools with a canteen menu that does not contain foods or beverages restricted from regular sale (&#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items) and ii) the proportion of schools where healthy canteen items (&#x02018;green&#x02019; items) represent the majority (&#x0003e;50%) of products listed on the menu. Outcome data will be collected via a comprehensive menu audit, conducted by dietitians blind to group allocation. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed using logistic regression models adjusting for baseline values.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed trial will represent a novel contribution to the literature, being the first randomised trial internationally to examine the effectiveness of an intervention to facilitate implementation of a healthy canteen policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12613000311752">ACTRN12613000311752</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0147-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Healthy eating</kwd><kwd>Canteens</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>Policy</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Researchers in developed countries including the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US) and Australia report that children fail to consume sufficient serves of fruits and vegetables and overconsume energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages increasing their risk of excessive weight gain and future chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Schools represent a valuable setting to improve child diet as they provide almost universal access to children on a continuous and intensive basis during crucial phases in their development of dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recent systematic review found that school policies or guidelines that focussed on increasing the availability of healthy products on the school menu, placing restrictions on the availability of unhealthy foods sold at schools or competitively pricing healthier foods significantly increased the sales of healthy products and improved child dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As such, guidelines and policies governing the availability of foods in school food services, canteens and kiosks have also been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and introduced by governments, internationally, including in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite the benefits of implementing school nutrition policies and guidelines, international research suggests that most schools fail to implement such initiatives, even when schools are obliged to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The strategy used a traffic light system to classify foods and beverages sold by schools as &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; or &#x02018;green&#x02019; based on their nutritional properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The strategy was adopted as part of the Department of Education and Communities policy in NSW requiring all government schools to remove unhealthy foods and beverages&#x02014;those classified as &#x02018;red&#x02019;&#x02014;from regular sale at school canteens. Furthermore, schools were encouraged to &#x02018;fill the menu&#x02019; with items classified as &#x02018;green&#x02019; and not let items classified as &#x02018;amber&#x02019; dominate the menu.</p><p>Items classified as &#x02018;red&#x02019; based on the healthy canteen policy are those that lack adequate nutritional value and can contribute to excessive energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. They are high in saturated fat and/or added sugar and/or salt and include sugar-sweetened drinks (banned), chocolate-coated premium ice creams, confectionary and deep-fried foods.

Support officers will attend a 2-day training workshop conducted by a consultant experienced in canteen and finance management. The workshop will focus on equipping staff with sufficient knowledge and skills to deliver the intervention. Support officers will be managed by an experienced health promotion project co-ordinator and project records will be used to monitor intervention delivery according to the protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group and contamination</title><p>The delivery of all intervention components will be controlled by the research team and will not be provided to control group schools. During the trial period, teachers from either intervention or control group schools will be able to access NSW Government-run programs directed at supporting school promotion of healthy eating and physical activity generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Data regarding schools&#x02019; exposure to such programs and potential sources of contamination for control schools will be collected by the research team during the follow-up survey with principals and the canteen managers.

At baseline and post-intervention (12&#x02013;14 months following baseline), copies of canteen menus will be collected from participating schools. Each menu will be audited by two independent dietitians blind to group allocation. The menu audit will be conducted based on the procedures for menu review previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Specifically, menu items will be classified as &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; or &#x02018;green&#x02019; according to the healthy canteen policy criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additional information required to classify menu items which is unable to be obtained from the canteen menu will be collected by research assistants via a telephone call or canteen visit. Dietitians will use the NSW Ministry of Health guidelines to assist with item classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Discrepancies between dietitians in product classification will be resolved through discussion and consensus.

Primary trial outcomes will be assessed by comparing between group differences at follow-up regarding i) the proportion of schools with a canteen menu that does not contain foods or beverages (&#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019;) restricted for sale under the healthy canteen policy and ii) the proportion of schools where healthy canteen items (&#x02018;green items&#x02019;) represent &#x0003e;50% of products listed on the menu. Analyses will be performed under an intention to treat framework. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed using logistic regression models adjusting for baseline values and with all available data. Multiple imputations (including baseline observation carried forward) will be performed as part of sensitivity analysis for schools not providing follow-up data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Based on previous recruitment experiences of the research team in this setting, it is anticipated that 80% of participating schools will be retained at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Assuming a prevalence of 15% at follow-up in the comparison group for both primary trial outcomes, the sample will be sufficient to detect an absolute difference of 34% with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Subgroup analyses will be performed by school size (number of students) and measure of the socioeconomic status of the school&#x02019;s geographic locality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in the implementation stage of the intervention and has not initiated follow-up data collection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The protocol provides a comprehensive description of the methods to be employed to assess the effectiveness of implementation intervention in increasing school canteen practices consistent with a healthy canteen policy.
