neurological treatment and a virtual reality training program on eye-hand coordination in
children with cerebral palsy. [Subjects] Sixteen children (9 males, 7 females) with
spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were recruited and randomly assigned to the conventional
neurological physical therapy group (CG) and virtual reality training group (VRG).
[Methods] Eight children in the control group performed 45 minutes of therapeutic exercise
twice a week for eight weeks. In the experimental group, the other eight children
performed 30 minutes of therapeutic exercise and 15 minutes of a training program using
virtual reality twice a week during the experimental period. [Results] After eight weeks
of the training program, there were significant differences in eye-hand coordination and
visual motor speed in the comparison of the virtual reality training group with the
conventional neurological physical therapy group. [Conclusion] We conclude that a
well-designed training program using virtual reality can improve eye-hand coordination in
children with cerebral palsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Eye hand coordination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that hinder the development of movement and posture,
causing activity limitation. It can be attributed to nonprogressive disturbances occurring
in the fetal or infant brain and is frequently characterized by difficulties with feeling,
perception, communication, recognition, and behavior, as well as convulsions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. During normal development, babies learn the
characteristics of objects through the sensations acquired by the hands until they develop
their sight. They learn the size and characteristics of forms as their vision improves and
develop their body schemes fully through all sensory channels via the learning relationship
between bodies and the environment<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Limitation in the functional use of hands is the primary characteristic of the motor
disturbance found among children with cerebral palsy, which is manifested in various forms
according to the degree of damage from hindered brain development<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Eye-hand coordination movement is the skill whereby visual
information from the eyes and motor information from the hands are efficiently applied to
work together as an essential component of self-help activities, play, perception, and
school work<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard, postural
control is extremely important for the development of hand functions, while brain control
affects the capacity of children to perform a visual search<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, problems with eye-hand coordination make it hard to
accept various types of sensory information from the external environment and make it
difficult for children to experience search tasks in their daily lives, such as playing and
school activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Virtual reality, an interactive simulation allowing users to have experiences similar to
real-life ones with the help of computer hardware and software<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> is a method for solving problems through the display of a series of
interacting tasks on the screen in which the user appears through a video capture
system<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children taking part in virtual
reality exercises are provided with visual and auditory feedback generated while they are
performing specific tasks expressed in the form of games; the feedback enables them to start
controlling their movements efficiently<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among other rehabilitation research studies based on virtual reality, a study by Seo et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> in 2011 suggested that virtual
reality is effective for improving visual sensory functions, in addition to the functional
and muscular capacity of the upper limbs, in the case of stroke patients. Further studies by
Levin et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and by Merians et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> also found that virtual reality is
effective for improving hand and upper limb functions in stroke patients. However, it was
difficult to assess the continued effects of such rehabilitation activities, as it was not
possible to observe whether the movements regulated at hospitals were properly performed at
home. In addition, treatment outcomes were not good when patients were not interested in the
treatments or had low expectations of them<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mechling<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that children with intellectual disabilities are able to employ their visual,
auditory, and proprioceptive senses when playing with toys that generate sound and light, or
bell sounds and vibrations; this also improves their motor outputs and focus. Herris and
Reid<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that virtual reality
play is aimed at introducing motivation and has potential as a mediational means to measure
the interest of research participants, particularly children with cerebral palsy. A study on
the eye-hand coordination of children with cerebral palsy by Saavedra et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that accurate arm stretching
reflects the coordinated movements of the eyes, brain, and hands. Straker et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned the need to provide dynamic
video games for children with poor motor coordination who require motor development and
physical activities. Accordingly, there is a need to investigate motor development and
eye-hand coordination in children with cerebral palsy by providing treatment rooms and by
using virtual reality programs as a mediatory means to induce interest and focus in
them.</p><p>This study aimed to determine whether training with a Nintendo Wii virtual reality program
can be used as a mediatory means that can affect eye-hand coordination by inducing interest
in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The researchers chose 16 children with cerebral palsy from a group of patients visiting K
Children&#x02019;s Development Center in Daegu, Republic of Korea, who had been diagnosed with palsy
of both lower limbs, but did not have hearing and visual disabilities: they were able to
communicate sufficiently to understand cooperate with the instructions of the researchers
and were classified into stages 1 to 3 the Gross Motor Function Classification System
(GMFCS). Of the 16 children, eight children whose exercise treatment only consisted of
grasping objects by stretching their arms, in addition to other basic exercises, were
selected as a conventional neurological physical therapy group (CG). Eight other children
participated in the virtual reality program training and basic exercises, and they formed
the virtual reality training group (VRG).</p><p>The research duration was eight weeks from July 26, 2014, to September 18, 2014, and it
included twice-weekly sessions of 45 minutes per session.</p><p>The eye-hand coordination and visual-motor speed, which improve motor intervention,
subtests of the K-DTVP-2 (Korean-Developmental Test of Visual Perception) were conducted as
a preliminary evaluation to measure eye-hand coordination. A post-test evaluation was
conducted after tests were carried out for eight weeks on both groups. The tests included 45
minutes of exercise treatment for the CG group, and 45 minutes of exercise treatment along
with 45 minutes of Nintendo Wii game play for the VRG group.</p><p>For the CG patients, the basic exercises, including articular movement exercises, muscular
extension and strength enhancement exercises, and trunk stabilization exercises, took 30
minutes. The other exercises included grasping objects by stretching the arms in various
directions. The aim of this exercise was to grasp objects held by the therapist by
stretching the arms while sitting with the trunk perpendicular to the floor. The idea is to
maintain the body&#x02019;s centerlines, grasp objects by stretching the arms while breaking away
from the centerline, return back to the original posture, all within 15 minutes. Like the CG
patients, the VRG patients performed 30 minutes of basic exercises while taking practice
based on upper limb movements. This basic exercise involved movement based on programs, for
example, hitting targets using one or both hands while sitting in a posture, taking account
of the engagement and movement of children, moving in directions according to instructions,
discerning pictures, and so on.</p><p>SPSS Ver. 12.0 for Microsoft Windows was used for statistical processing of the data.</p><p>The Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish the significance between the CG and VRG
groups, and Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test was used for in-group comparisons between
pretreatment and post treatment values among the participants.</p><p>The statistical level of significance was &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Neither the CG nor the VRG groups showed general Characters (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics (mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VRG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of cerebral palsy (diplegia)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">127.1&#x000b1;11.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">128.1&#x000b1;5.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.5&#x000b1;7.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.0&#x000b1;6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (months)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.8&#x000b1;16.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">106.8&#x000b1;2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gestational age (weeks)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.8&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.0&#x000b1;2.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CG: conventional neurological physical therapy group; VRG: virtual reality training

with cerebral palsy by inducing interest in the children using a virtual reality program.
The study selected children between 4 and 8&#x02005;years old, with the control group participating
in grasping exercises in various directions and the test group participating in Nintendo
Wii-based virtual reality programs, in addition to basic exercises, for a period of eight
weeks. The effects were verified by carrying out an evaluation using the K-DTVP-2 before and
after the interventions.</p><p>Comparisons between evaluations before and after the interventions revealed statistically
significant results in terms of changes in eye-hand coordination, visual-motor speeds, and
visual-motor speed age in both the CG and VRG groups in the study. These results correspond
to results from existing studies, including one regarding the impact of visual-motor
development programs on the visual perception capabilities of infants, which showed an
improvement in their visual-motor coordination capabilities. A further study looked at the
impact of visual perception training programs in terms of how they affect improvements to
visual perception capabilities (eye-hand coordination and visual-motor speeds<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study of Hong<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> on integrated sensory treatment showed improved results in
terms of visual-motor integrated capabilities including eye-hand coordination and
visual-motor speeds.</p><p>There was no significant difference in eye-hand coordination and visual-motor speeds
between the CG and VRG groups in this study. This result differs from that of a study by
Chung<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> on the impact of visual-motor
development programs on the visual perception capabilities of infants; that study showed
significant differences between groups, as the study included visual perception training
programs for its VRG, while it was not included for its CG. By comparison, the current
results indicate that the CG group, which performed grasping exercises by stretching their
arms, and the VRG group, additionally performed the VR programs, both displayed within-group
differences between the results before and after the tests but no significant difference
between the groups; in other words, both activities had a positive impact on improvement of
eye-hand coordination. Furthermore, a comparison between the results before and after the
interventions in each group showed significant differences in the eye-hand coordination
scores for the CG group. It is thought that the significant results in terms of eye-hand
coordination scores indicate a positive impact on eye-hand coordination with age. Visual
perception capabilities are the most important and fundamental perception capabilities
throughout early childhood and can affect self-help activities, work, play, and leisure
activities in infants<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Handwriting
clarity in children between five and six is reported to be correlated with eye-hand
coordination in visual-motor coordination activities requiring mobility, such as drawing by
tracing, and with visual-motor speeds. Visual perception development generally follows as
children grow up, with most children continuing to develop skills up to the age of 9 and
completing their development by the age of 10 or 11<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the average age of the participants in this study was
100.8 months (8&#x02005;years and 3 months) for the CG and 106.8 months (8&#x02005;years and 8 months) for
the VRG, a comparison of speed age between before and after tests of visual-motor
capabilities showed changes from 63.25 months (5&#x02005;years and 2 months) to 80.5 months (6&#x02005;years
and 6 months) in the CG, and from 65.25 months (5&#x02005;years and 4 months) to 88.5 months
(7&#x02005;years and 3 months) in the VRG. In these cases, it was found that the visual-motor speed
age was lower than the real ages of the children and that there were increases in
visual-motor speed ages after mediation; it follows that there were also significant
mediations in both groups. Therefore, children&#x02019;s visual perception development is of the
utmost significance in enabling them to live as humans, and visual perception development
may be even more crucial to children with cerebral palsy who have disabilities in terms of
their eye-hand coordination function, along with motor disabilities<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among previous research studies on the use of VR programs for children with cerebral palsy,
a study by Deutsch et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported on
the feasibility of VR for treating children with palsy of both lower limbs and found that
there were improvements in visual perception processing, posture control, and functional
movement capabilities. Another study by Yoo et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> found that there were changes in neural plasticity related to
self-help activities after the VR program was applied as part of neural rehabilitation
mediation therapy for strengthening exercise performance in children.</p><p>Many changes occur when children with cerebral palsy reach school age after early
childhood. For example, they are exposed to fewer hours of treatment due to a combination of
schools, private institutions, and treatment rooms following their intensive early childhood
treatment period, which is centered on daytime wards at hospitals. Furthermore, they are
faced with many self-help activities in their daily lives and exposed to self-study
environments following intensive play and care at home, in addition to nursery facilities.
This period requires a positive influence on functional improvement of children through the
integration of home life with therapy activities in treatment rooms. The current study
proposes training methods that are VR based and provide using the Nintendo Wii, as such
devices are easy to use in terms of cost and are highly efficient as methods for enhancing
treatment effects. Furthermore, we believe that VR training and exercises such as grasping
objects by stretching the arms can be employed as useful activities for school age children,
as they positively affect eye-hand coordination and visual perception capabilities, which
are relevant to the improvement of handwriting skills and cognitive learning in children.
Also, the program used in this study offers the potential to be used as a home program
connected to treatment rooms by inducing interest in school age children with the
appropriate assistance of VR programs.</p><p>However, there were limitations in this research in that the number of participants was
small and control factors other than the test conditions in the daily lives of individual
children could not be unified. Moreover, it is difficult to generalize the results from
tests based on children with spastic palsy of both lower limbs to all children with cerebral
palsy. Direct research should be conducted in the future to determine home virtual reality
programs based on the results of this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bax</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenbaum</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>Executive Committee for the Definition of Cerebral Palsy:
