on the pulmonary function of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were
randomly allocated into lumbar stabilization exercise group and a general physical therapy
group. The program consisted of 30-min sessions conducted 3 days a week for 8 weeks.
Pulmonary function was assessed based on lung performance parameters, including forced
vital capacity, forced expiratory volume at 1 second, ratio of forced expiratory volume at
1 second to forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow. [Results] In the assessment
of pulmonary function, the values of all the lung performance parameters were
significantly increased in the lumbar stabilization exercise group but were significantly
decreased in the general physical therapy group. [Conclusion] These results indicate that
lumbar stabilization exercise had a more positive effect on pulmonary function than
general physical therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a leading cause of major disabilities in social, psychological, and physical
functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The decline in the pulmonary
function of stroke patients is caused by reduced physical activity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, the decline in the cardiopulmonary function of
these patients is related to decreased oxygen transport ability caused by prolonged bed
rest<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Respiration provides oxygen for
activities of daily living (ADL); as a result, respiratory disturbances influence patients&#x02019;
ADL. Therefore, respiratory problems are crucial factors in the rehabilitation and survival
of stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al. reported
that stroke patients exhibited a respiratory pattern of restrictive lung disease. The
characteristics of restrictive lung disease include decreased forced vital capacity
(FVC)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the stroke patients
in their study showed reduced FVC and peak expiratory flow (PEF)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various physical therapies to improve the pulmonary function have been applied, such as
thoracic spine mobility exercises and respiratory exercises including diaphragm breathing,
ventilator muscle training, glossopharyngeal breathing and pursed-lip breathing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, machines such as resistance
breathing equipment, reverse testing equipment, and incentive spirometer are used in
breathing therapies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Respiratory impairment causes weakening of trunk muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Deep abdominal muscle strengthening exercise was effective at
increasing vital capacity. Especially the transverse abdominis muscle influences the partial
stabilization of the lumbar spine<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles stabilize the trunk. In
particular, the transverse abdominis muscle, together with the multifidus muscle, plays a
major role in stabilizing the lumbar region<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among other expiratory muscles (rectus abdominis, internal
oblique, and external oblique), the transverse abdominis muscle is the most active during
easy breathing<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has the largest
activity change relative to other abdominal muscles, even during maximal inspiratory
breathing<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gollee et al. reported
that abdominal muscle stimulation also improved the lung function of paretic patients with
decreased functional residual capacity<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies on stroke patients, respiratory therapies that used various breathing
exercises were reported. However, research on the clinical applications of general exercise
therapy is lacking. The present study aimed to verify the efficacy of lumbar stabilization
exercise (LSE) and LSE with abdominal stimulation used in clinical practice, and to identify
the effects of the LSE method on the pulmonary function of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with patients from B Hospital (Suwon, Gyeonggido) who had had a
stroke &#x0003e;6 months previously. The subjects selected were those without orthopedic diseases
such as congenital defects involving the thoracic cage or fractured ribs, and those who
scored&#x0003e;24 points in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. The study
purpose and methods were explained to the subjects, and only those who consented to
participate were included in the study. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics
committee of the Yongin University (2&#x02013;1040966-AB-N-01&#x02013;201503-HSR-026&#x02013;1).</p><p>The subjects were 40 stroke patients. They were randomly and equally divided into two
groups, namely a LSE group and a general physical therapy (GPT) group. However, during the
study, two subjects were discharged from the hospital before the study completion and one
subject dropped out of the study. As a result, 18 subjects in the LSE group and 19 subjects
in the GPT group underwent the trial. The intervention was conducted three times per week,
for a total of 8 weeks.

The LSE was performed after a 30-min physical therapy. Each step was repeated three
times. The subjects performed a 5-min stretching before and after the exercise. Six physical
therapists with more than 1&#x02005;year of experience in clinical trials were selected for this
study. The subjects in the GPT group performed general physical therapies that are normally
performed at rehabilitation centers, such as neurodevelopment treatment, mat, and gait
training, for 30&#x02005;min after physical therapy.</p><p>In order to assess pulmonary function, Fitmate MED (COSMED, Italy) was used to measure FVC,
forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF. All pulmonary function
measurements were performed with the subjects in the sitting position.</p><p>The subject waited for the start signal while holding the mouthpiece as tightly as possible
to prevent air from escaping through the mouth while staring straight ahead without
breathing through the nose. While the subjects were waiting for the start signal, the
research inspectors asked them to take normal breaths three times and to breathe in as much
as they could and exhale for more than 6 seconds. When the start signal was given, the
subjects took three normal breaths, inhaled as much as they could, and exhaled for more than
6 seconds. The inspectors made sure that the subjects exhaled for at least 6 seconds, and
the average of three measurements was calculated for each round. Three measurements were
performed, once before, during, and after the exercise.</p><p>For data processing, the SPSS version 20.0 software for Windows was used. Descriptive
statistics were processed by using the general characteristics of the subjects. The
independent t-test was used to compare the change in the values of the pulmonary function
parameters between the groups. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to
compare in-group data before, during (4 weeks), and after (8 weeks) the intervention. The
significance level was set at <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, the pulmonary functions of the stroke patients in the LSE or GPT groups were

life<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lanini et al. observed
significant decreases in maximal respiratory pressure in stroke patients as compared with
healthy control subjects<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Impaired pulmonary function may be a consequence of weakened respiratory muscles and
postural trunk dysfunction<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abdominal
muscle strengthening exercises were shown to have positive effects such as improvement in
pulmonary function<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and LSE has been
used in clinical practice with abdominal muscle stimulation. Gollee et al. suggested the
application of abdominal muscle stimulation to increase expiratory flow and tidal volume in
order to improve respiratory function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Accordingly, this study examined the effect of LSE on the pulmonary function of stroke
patients. To assess pulmonary function, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEF were measured.</p><p>In this study, the LSE group showed significant increases in FVC, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and PEF
values after the exercise intervention, indicating that LSE had a positive effect on the
pulmonary function of the stroke patients. By contrast, the GPT group showed a decline in
the FVC, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and PEF values after the exercise intervention, indicating that GPT
alone cannot improve the pulmonary function of stroke patients.</p><p>Kim and Lee reported that deep abdominal muscle training was effective at enhancing
pulmonary function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jung et al. reported
that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with abdominal stimulation improved the pulmonary
function of chronic stroke patients. In their study, the subjects who received IMT with
abdominal stimulation showed significant increases in FEV1, PEF, and FEF<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings are consistent with those
of this study. In addition, the co-contraction of the abdominal muscles fixes the trunk and
reduces the stress on the spine<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the
other hand, Kulnik et al. reported that respiratory muscle training did not improve
pulmonary function and cough function in patients with acute stroke<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. This means that LSE have a more positive effect on
pulmonary function than respiratory muscle exercise.</p><p>Song and Park reported that chest resistance and expansion exercises were effective for
improving pulmonary function and trunk control ability in stroke patients<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Seo et al. reported that a combination of
inspiratory diaphragm exercise and expiratory pursed-lip breathing exercise was effective
for strengthening weakened pulmonary functions in the rehabilitation of patients with
neurological disease<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. With these
findings, it is hoped that in future studies, the effect of combining respiratory muscle
strengthening exercises and LSEs in stroke patients will be investigated.</p><p>The findings of this study indicate that LSE may be a more appropriate therapeutic method
than GPT for improving pulmonary function in stroke patients. Owing to the limited sample
size of this study, the study finding is difficult to generalize to all stroke patients.
Therefore, studies with larger patient samples that investigate long-term therapies and
their benefits to stroke patients are needed. In addition, further studies are needed to
include additional exercise combinations for both lumbar stabilization and respiratory
muscle strengthening.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Homer</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Reker</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Adherence to post acute rehabilitaion guidelines is
