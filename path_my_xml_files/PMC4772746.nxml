Technology-based recruitment methods hold promise as a more robust form of reaching and enrolling historically hard to reach young adults. The TARGIT study is a randomized two-arm clinical trial in young adults using interactive technology testing an efficacious proactive telephone Quitline versus the Quitline plus a behavioral weight management intervention focusing on smoking cessation and weight change. All randomized participants in the TARGIT study were required to be a young adult smoker (18&#x02013;35 years), who reported smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day, had a BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2,</sup> and were willing to stop smoking and not gain weight. Traditional recruitment methods were compared to technology-based strategies using standard descriptive statistics based on counts and proportions to describe the recruitment process from initial pre-screening (PS) to randomization into TARGIT. Participants at PS were majority Black (59.80%), female (52.66%), normal or over weight (combined 62.42%), 29.5 years old, and smoked 18.4 cigarettes per day. There were differences in men and women with respect to reasons for ineligibility during PS (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001; ignoring gender specific pregnancy-related ineligibility). TARGIT experienced a disproportionate loss of minorities during recruitment as well as a prolonged recruitment period due to either study ineligibility or not completing screening activities. Recruitment into longer term behavioral change intervention trials can be challenging and multiple methods are often required to recruit hard to reach groups.</p></sec><sec><title>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01199185</title><p>The NHLBI funded TARGIT as part of a U01 Cooperative Agreement and as such the study design was approved.

Multiple recruitment strategies are often needed to recruit an adequate number of participants, especially hard to reach groups. Study design issues such as eligibility criteria along with participant behaviors can challenge investigators to identify effective and timely recruitment strategies during screening <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Also adequate participation and representativeness of the study sample can be compromised during recruitment due to ineligibility, disinterest in participating, or inability maintaining contact with those interested. These dynamic behavioral factors limiting inclusion and diversity during recruitment of the study sample can influence external validity <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Population subgroups of interest that have historically been difficult to enroll in primary prevention trials include younger persons, smokers, and African Americans <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In smoking cessation trials, successful enrollment of minorities <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, men and younger adults <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> oftentimes has presented challenges. In prevention trials specific for overweight and obese persons, similar recruitment patterns, as have been seen with smokers, have shown noticeably lower eligibility rates among African Americans <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> with markedly lower participation rates among men and young adults (18&#x02013;35 years) <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This lack of adequate representation of young adults and African Americans in behavioral intervention trials has raised concerns regarding the generalizability of primary prevention outcomes to younger persons <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and minorities <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> along with adequate translation of prevention science evidence.</p><p id="p0015">Technology-based recruitment methods hold promise as a more robust form of reaching and enrolling historically hard to reach young adults <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, as do technology delivered interventions for greater dissemination of behavioral treatments to diverse populations <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, information on technology recruitment methods is lacking, especially among the historically harder to reach groups previously identified. This paper will describe the recruitment process employed during the screening and enrollment phases of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded study &#x0201c;Treating Adults at Risk for Weight Gain with Interactive Technology&#x0201d; (TARGIT) designed to recruit young adult smokers at risk for weight gain to stop smoking without gaining weight. Additionally, this study elucidates how the TARGIT experience helps to ascertain which recruitment methods (i.e., traditional versus technology-based strategies) were effective for randomizing the final study cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0020">The TARGIT study is a randomized two-arm clinical trial in young adults using interactive technology testing an efficacious proactive telephone Quitline versus the Quitline plus a behavioral weight management intervention focusing on smoking cessation and weight change.

All randomized participants in the TARGIT study were required to be a young adult smoker (18&#x02013;35 years), who reported smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day, had a BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2,</sup> and were willing to stop smoking and not gain weight. The lower bound eligibility criteria for BMI was initially &#x02265;22, but was decreased to &#x02265;20 during the recruitment phase in an effort to increase enrollment (IRB approved change became effective 08/08/11). Before that change, 66 individuals were excluded during phone screen (PS) and one during screening visit (SV) because their BMI was &#x0003c;22, but would have passed the later applicable criterion of BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;20, therefore, these individuals were invited to re-screen for the study. This approach ultimately allowed TARGIT to enroll additional participants whereby among the final 330 randomized, 21 (6.4%) were enrolled with a BMI in the affected range (e.g., they would not have been enrolled without the lowered BMI criteria). Additionally, TARGIT participants were required to have the ability to understand consent procedures (in English), have access to a telephone and the internet, demonstrate ability to access a specific web site, and demonstrate the ability to receive and respond to email. Further, interested persons had to be willing to accept random assignment to one of two intervention arms and be able to participate in a 24 month behavioral lifestyle change intervention to stop smoking and not gain weight. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is found in <xref rid="dtbl1" ref-type="table">Appendix 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Recruitment strategies</title><p id="p0030">Recruitment for the TARGIT study took place over a two-year period from December 2010 to August 2012 and included both traditional- and technology-based methods. Traditional recruitment approaches included media (i.e., television, radio), print (i.e., mass mailings of postcards to age appropriate persons identified by driver's license registries, newspaper ads, rack cards, flyers), and community (i.e., events at college campuses, health fairs, word of mouth). Technology recruitment approaches included website (TARGIT study), internet (i.e., Google ads, Craig's List), social media (TARGIT Facebook page) and email list serves (i.e., academic, healthcare, corporate, professional).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Screening and enrollment</title><p id="p0035">Enrollment into TARGIT was as follows: During PS the TARGIT study was explained to individuals and eligibility criteria were assessed. Persons who were eligible and interested were scheduled for an onsite SV. At SV, written informed consent was obtained and participants were evaluated for additional study eligibility requirements. Eligible and willing participants were asked to record dietary intake online at the study website and were scheduled for a randomization visit (RV). Only those eligible who demonstrated a successful dietary recording were randomized into an intervention assignment for treatment of smoking cessation (Quitline only versus Quitline plus technology-delivered weight management).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Screening and enrollment variables</title><p id="p0040">A completed PS contact determined an individual's age, height/weight, gender, ethnicity/race, number of cigarettes currently smoked per day, history of current substance abuse, indications of an unstable psychiatric condition, current medications, and whether the individual was pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 2 years. In addition, the individual was asked how he/she learned about the TARGIT study. PS contacts were terminated whenever a reason for ineligibility was first determined in order to decrease participant/staff burden. The purpose of this study was to recruit eligible participants and not to determine the reasons for ineligibility, thus resulting in missing information for the variables not yet queried. During the subsequent on-site SV additional demographic information was obtained such as education, income, or marital status. The main focus of this manuscript is to identify the most effective recruitment strategies for eliciting interest in screening that resulted in successful study randomization. Further, evaluation of whether demographic variables were predictive of how far an individual progressed in the recruitment process and what patterns in recruitment flow emerged are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="p0045">We used standard descriptive statistics based primarily on counts and proportions to describe the recruitment process from initial PS to randomization into TARGIT. Statistical significance was based on t-tests, Wilcoxon and Krushkal&#x02013;Wallis tests, as well as chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression with randomization coded as &#x0201c;yes/no&#x0201d; was used to verify the significance of the identified traits of importance in a multivariable setting. In addition, this approach was used to address the relative predictive power of the identified model (Area under the Receiver Operating Curve &#x02013; AUC). When cell-counts became small and the standard assumptions underlying the chi-square test were not satisfied, we based conclusions on Fisher's exact test. In those cases, we also re-estimated significance with the low-count subgroups removed in order to verify that statistically significant findings were not driven by the possibly erratic distribution of cases in these small-frequency subgroups&#x000a0;(e.g., in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> the p-value was computed when the recruitment source &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;

Of the 534 participants who completed an SV, 32.21% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;172) were not eligible due to technology-related, BMI, and medical conditions being the most common reasons along with an additional 5.99% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32) refusing further participation. By the end of screening, there were 330 participants eligible (i.e., 10.67% of all initial PS contacts) and who were randomly assigned to either proactive Quitline or proactive Quitline plus Weight Management Intervention delivered via interactive technology.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Recruitment flow from first phone contact to randomization.

During PS a larger proportion of Blacks (43.08%) compared to Whites (32.14%) did not qualify to proceed on to SV with the reasons for ineligibility being different (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for association test of race vs. type of ineligibility reason; data not shown): Blacks were more likely to be excluded due to current substance abuse (34.46% vs. 18.99% of Whites), but less likely due to prescription medications (2.18% vs. 13.97% of Whites) or an unstable psychiatric condition (2.57% vs. 7.26% Whites). Other major exclusions affecting both races equally included age (13.66% and 12.85%, respectively) and BMI (21.19% vs. 17.88%). There were no differences between Blacks and Whites with respect to refusing to participate given equal eligibility (14.90% Blacks vs. 16.30% Whites, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.420), but of those who could have attended SV, only 26.38% of Blacks while 42.83% of Whites attended the in-person screening (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).</p><p id="p0065">Among those who were eligible but did not attend a SV, approximately two-thirds never scheduled the in-person visit, and the remaining one-third scheduled but did not attend despite several attempts to reschedule a convenient appointment.

Blacks were also more likely to exceed the upper BMI criteria at SV (13.98% vs. 4.41% of Whites with similar proportions for low BMI exclusion of 5.38% and 4.41%, respectively) and were more often excluded due to technology-related reasons (22.58% vs. 16.18%, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Other baseline characteristics affecting recruitment for TARGIT</title><p id="p0070">There were differences in men and women with respect to reasons for ineligibility during PS (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001; ignoring gender specific pregnancy-related ineligibility). Males were relatively more likely to be excluded for current substance abuse (41.14% vs. 24.39% females) and were less likely BMI-ineligible (13.71% vs. 28.46%, respectively). There were no systematic differences in eligibility between males and females at SV. About one out of five (34/172) persons excluded at SV was due to a technology-related reason which was an eligibility requirement not addressed during PS. Other demographic variables that influenced recruitment flow included education (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004; higher educated participants were more likely to be randomized), personal income (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001; higher income groups were more likely to be randomized), and marital status (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.021; married individuals or those living in a committed relationship were more likely to be randomized). These variables were first collected at SV, thus, the comparisons are between those randomized versus those who attended SV but were not randomized.

Traditional sources of recruitment (e.g., media, print, and community) yielded larger numbers of participants attending all visit types than any technology source. At PS, television ads (36.40%; subgroup of Media; not shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), direct mail (24.12%; subgroup of Print), and word of mouth (13.35%; subgroup of Community) were the most common recruitment sources self-reported by participants whereas all types of technology combined (e.g., email, internet ad, social media ad, study website) were only self-reported by 5.47% of callers. However, at RV direct mail (31.21%) was the most commonly reported recruitment source above that of television ads (29.39%), with technology sources accounting for only 6.23% of those randomized. Of note, radio was seldom mentioned (only 6.14% of callers and 7.88% of randomized participants). Among those randomized, a significant association was found between race and the type of recruitment strategies reported (p-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.030). Blacks compared to Whites were more likely to respond to media advertisement (48.78% and 31.67%, respectively), while Whites were more responsive to print materials (41.67% in Whites and 32.52% in Blacks).

TARGIT successfully recruited the targeted sample size (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;330). To accomplish this goal, focused recruitment strategies to increase study participation among historically hard to reach minority groups <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> representative of our community included multiple mass mailings, traditional ads on minority media outlets, community outreach activities, and social media advertising. Although initial recruitment efforts yielded a racial composition interested in participating that was similar to the Mid-south community at large (3093 of whom approx. 60% were African American and approx. 40% were White&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>); TARGIT experienced a disproportionate loss of minorities during recruitment as well as a prolonged recruitment period due to either study ineligibility or not completing screening activities. Black participants were found to be ineligible at PS and SV to a greater extent than Whites and less likely to attend the in-person screening visit if found eligible by telephone. Specifically, the proportion of Blacks enrolled in one of two TARGIT interventions to stop smoking and not gain weight dropped from 59.80% to 37.27% among all interested callers who were ultimately randomized to treatment (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Final randomized participants into TARGIT were approximately 60% White and 40% Black; the inverse of call responders.</p><p id="p0100">Although we are unable to make specific conclusions from these data regarding the disproportionate loss of minorities during recruitment, there is some previous work that helps shed light on the findings. For example, numerous barriers have been cited previously as reasons for inadequate study participation for recruitment of hard to reach study populations. Common challenges for participating in research studies may include lack of community involvement, misperceptions or distrust of the research purpose or of the informed consent process, language or literacy issues, study participation and/or treatment burden, and lack of interest and/or awareness of the health risk <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Further, personal circumstances such as lack of transportation, safety concerns, child care or family demands, job schedule conflicts, health issues, and being unwilling or unable to sustain regular contact with study staff and/or scheduled study visits may also effect recruitment success <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. During TARGIT recruitment, more current substance abuse beyond that of smoking, medical reasons, and not completing web-based food diaries that adversely impacted study eligibility was observed among our minority participants. Exploring and potentially addressing these barriers to participation in future studies is warranted.</p><p id="p0105">Therefore, given the interest seen by the positive responses to TARGIT advertising, coupled with the loss of follow through in attendance/adherence to recruitment processes suggests that general community perceptions of the value of the research was favorable; however, personal circumstances may have presented individual challenges to further recruitment participation. The proportion lost following phone eligibility was clearly more affected by inability to contact (two-thirds) and failure to attend (one-third) than eligibility which could indicate a lack of general interest in the program after the phone screen. Another interesting observation in this study was how gender composition remained almost a 50&#x02013;50 split from call in to randomization (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.132) with women having a slight majority during PS (52.66%) and remaining similarly proportioned in the final randomized sample (48.79%). Previously, studies have shown that men, especially minorities, have been less likely to be enrolled into lifestyle change trials for weight loss or weight gain prevention <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, TARGIT demonstrates that men were equally as willing to stop smoking and not gain weight as women were. There has been limited information on recruiting younger persons into behavioral prevention trials <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, with recent data suggesting this group can be challenging <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. TARGIT showed appeal to young adults as we successfully randomized age eligible participants (18&#x02013;35 years) seeking to prevent cessation-related weight gain. One additional point of interest was how age seemed to matter in regards to responsivity to technology-based recruitment methods. Specifically, those who responded to technology methods were on average three years younger.</p><p id="p0110">Community partnerships and involvement, taking a bottom-up approach to clinical research and identifying community needs that could enhance participation and excitement for an intervention and health research may be important future directions for research into effective recruitment methods for clinical trials <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Another important implication of our findings is that use of technology appeared to be a very challenging method to recruit participants into the clinical trial even among this young adult group. Although we saturated the community with all possible recruitment sources, the ease of access to all technology based methods may have limited the responsivity particularly among minority participants. Future research could be aimed at identifying if a more effective use of technology as a recruitment strategy could be identified and what the effort/cost ratio per recruited participant would be.</p><p id="p0115">Most randomized TARGIT participants responded to traditional recruitment methods (e.g., print, media) over that of technology-based approaches. It is also important to note that multiple methods of recruitment were necessary to enroll the final sample size in TARGIT and when a recruitment method appeared to be less effective alternate methods were employed. Further, when recruitment into the trial was slow a small modification of eligibility criteria allowed TARGIT to randomize additional persons with slightly lower BMI. Thus, it is important for research studies to monitor the recruitment process and continually re-evaluate the success of the recruitment methods used and whether eligibility criteria need to be modified. Also of note in TARGIT, several methods of recruitment were occurring simultaneously thus exposure to 2 or more methods for many of the participants is likely. For example, a participant may receive a recruitment postcard from the study (sent to every age eligible person in the area) and also hear the television advertisements running. Saturation of message delivery via multiple recruitment methods may be important to the ultimate response; however, TARGIT did not collect information about the potential exposure to more than one recruitment method and thus cannot contribute to its importance. The importance of printed study materials resulting in the majority of randomized participants suggests that it is beneficial to have these traditional methods available even if newer methods are being utilized. Future research into message saturation and exposure may be informative to improve recruitment into behavioral intervention trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0120">Recruitment into longer term behavioral change intervention trials can be challenging and multiple methods are often required to recruit hard to reach groups. A limitation of this study was not being able to quantify the effort and cost of each recruitment method when comparing traditional versus technological approaches to study participation. Further, the differences that were observed between successful recruitment strategies for screenings versus randomization into the trial need additional investigation. Reaching a representative sample of the community and enrolling an adequate number of eligible study participants during the recruitment period limited TARGIT's ability to distinguish frequency and/or repetition of recruitment methods by participant self-report. Therefore, in addition to lower cost easily disseminated technology-based approaches to participation in research studies, traditional recruitment methods such as print and media remain important in the overall armamentarium for researchers to attain overall study goals. Examination of the importance of message saturation and tailored recruitment methods among hard to reach groups may be important for identifying optimal recruitment strategies. Moreover, determining the advantages of media versus technology driven approaches to study participation among minorities and younger persons could be helpful in informing future recruitment into behavioral intervention trials.<table-wrap id="dtbl1" position="float"><label>Appendix</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for TARGIT.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td><bold>Inclusion criteria</bold></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><p id="p0125">1.*18&#x02013;35 years old</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0015"><list-item id="u0015"><p id="p0130">2.
