This centre has an established service for treatment of tongue-tie led by midwife lactation consultants and good support for breastfeeding in the hospital and the community midwifery service in Bristol. The study was approved by the Central Bristol research ethics committee and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Trial registration: ISRCTN 73554751.

Eligibility was determined by one of two lactation consultants who observed a breast feed and used the Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (HATLFF-short form) to measure the degree of tongue-tie, and the <italic>L</italic>atch, <italic>A</italic>udible swallowing, nipple <italic>T</italic>ype, <italic>C</italic>omfort, <italic>H</italic>old (LATCH) Scale<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> to assess breastfeeding. A comparison between the two lactation consultants using the HATLFF, based on 30 infants, produced an interclass correlation of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.94).</p><p>Breastfed babies were eligible for enrolment if the HATLFF score was 6&#x02013;12 (indicating a mild&#x02013;moderate tongue-tie) and the LATCH score was &#x02264;8. Exclusion criteria were infant age (&#x0003e;2&#x02005;weeks old), prematurity (&#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks), congenital orofacial malformations and infant weight loss (&#x0003e;10% birth weight). Those with a severe tongue-tie (HATLFF score &#x0003c;6) were not eligible for randomisation and were offered immediate frenotomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>After giving written informed consent, mothers were randomised to an intervention arm and offered immediate frenotomy, or to a comparison arm and given the standard postnatal care offered in Bristol. Participants were block randomised equally to the two groups by an independent telephone-based randomisation service provided by Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration, stratifying for sex of infant and birth order. All trial participants were offered routine breastfeeding support as provided by midwives as part of community postnatal care and reassessed at a special research clinic 5&#x02005;days later. Mothers in the comparison arm who were still experiencing breastfeeding difficulties at the 5-day assessment were then given the option of frenotomy. The final trial assessment at 8&#x02005;weeks was undertaken initially by telephone, and those who were still breast feeding were reassessed at home. Researchers collecting the outcomes, but not participant mothers, were blinded to infant group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measuring tools used</title><p>The short-form HATLFF<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> was used to measure the degree of tongue-tie.

From the 84 who agreed, a purposive sample of 20 was selected to include a range of feeding methods and ages of babies in both arms of the trial. The telephone interviews explored their views on the trial, the intervention process, the acceptability of randomisation and their attitude to frenotomy.

The continuous data were not normally distributed, so non-parametric methods were used to test for differences between the two groups. Median and IQRs (25th and 75th centiles) have been used and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test as an equivalent to the Student t test. For categorical data, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used or the Fisher's exact test (when an expected cell was less than 5). Significance was set at the 5% level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Recruited sample</title><p>Mothers and infants were recruited from October 2011 to March 2013 following referral by a hospital or community midwife to the lactation consultants at Southmead Hospital. In total, 107 infants were randomised to the study, 55 in the intervention group and 52 in the control group. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were very similar, but compared with the general profile of women delivering at Southmead hospital, trial mothers had a higher educational level and were less likely to come from an ethnic minority background. Of the 429 women with breastfeeding difficulties who were assessed for eligibility but were not enrolled (see Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow chart <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FETALNEONATAL2013305031F1">figure 1</xref>), the most common reason (206; 48%) was the baby was too old (&#x0003e;2&#x02005;weeks). For 84 (20%), the tongue-tie was too severe (HATLFF score&#x0003c;6) and the mother was offered frenotomy outside the trial. Of the 95 women who met the inclusion criteria but refused to be randomised, nearly half wanted the frenotomy straight away (these were women who had had a previous infant with tongue-tie), and a third preferred to &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; how breast feeding progressed.

The study was successfully conducted, with excellent retention rates and high breastfeeding rates in both arms at the 8-week end point. No safety concerns were raised about frenotomy. The trial has shown that it is feasible to explain equipoise about the role of frenotomy in mild&#x02013;moderate tongue-tie to mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties, randomise them and to keep the majority of mothers in the non-intervention arm engaged until 5&#x02005;days. However, 17% in the comparison arm did not last to 5&#x02005;days without demanding a frenotomy, and 15% switched to bottle feeding. The qualitative interviews indicated that 5&#x02005;days was the limit that women were prepared to continue with painful and difficult feeding of a tongue-tied infant.

Of the mothers in the comparison group, only 12% were feeding their babies at the breast by 8&#x02005;weeks without a frenotomy.</p><p>What we do not know, however, is how many women would have given up breastfeeding if frenotomy had been not been available in a few days&#x02019; time; or how many women would have requested frenotomy if they were not aware a service existed. The trial hospital has good breastfeeding support from experienced lactation consultants, and midwives and mothers know that a frenotomy service is available. Half of the mothers who were eligible but refused randomisation wanted frenotomy straight away. Those randomised to the comparison arm knew that a frenotomy would be offered if they still had breastfeeding difficulties at 5&#x02005;days.</p><p>The Bristol Tongue-Tie Trial encountered many of the issues with assessment of tongue-tie and breastfeeding reported by others.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> While the short HATLFF tool was able to categorise the severity of tongue-tie, it is based on subjective assessments and requires experience to apply consistently.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The main limitation of this trial is that the measures used to assess breast feeding were relatively insensitive in picking up difficulties in attachment due to tongue-tie, even in the expert hands of the lactation specialists. This is in contrast to other studies that have shown improvements in LATCH scores<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> or IBFAT scores.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The self-efficacy tool, in which mothers rated their own confidence in breastfeeding, proved to be the best measure. Maternally rated self-efficacy has been shown to correlate well with overall duration of breastfeeding<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and self-efficacy has been an outcome in other trials of frenotomy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Painful nipples, due to inefficient sucking and frequent attempts to latch on to the breast, is a common complaint from mothers of tongue-tied babies and was a primary outcome measure in other studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While the simple VAS used in the Bristol Trial was not sensitive enough to show differences between the groups, the relief of painful sucking provided by frenotomy was a clear theme emerging from the qualitative interviews.</p><p>Simple inspection of a tongue-tie is not enough to determine which infants should be offered early frenotomy, and clinical assessment must include observation and measurement of the effectiveness of feeding. Better assessment tools are needed.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There is a continuing need for lactation support even after a frenotomy to ensure breastfeeding is established and maintained. This trial, the largest so far reported, adds to the available evidence by showing that mild&#x02013;moderate tongue-tie can be managed with breastfeeding support for 5&#x02005;days but that if feeding is still difficult and painful at this point, then mothers want their babies to have a frenotomy&#x02014;which is a safe and low-cost procedure.</p><p>In conclusion, tongue-tie is a common condition which is not easy to measure objectively, and its impact on feeding is complicated to assess. Although the majority of mothers of infants with mild&#x02013;moderate tongue-tie were compliant for 5&#x02005;days with the treatment arm to which they were allocated, this carefully conducted randomised trial could not demonstrate an objective and sustained improvement in breastfeeding following the procedure because the majority in the comparison arm ended up having the intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the parents who took part in the trial, the midwives and the lactation support team for their help in recruiting and supporting breastfeeding mothers.
