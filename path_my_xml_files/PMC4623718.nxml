consequent capillary hypertension <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.The treatment
of this type of ulcer must be directed towards the attempt to revert the venous
hypertension at the level of the superficial veins of the lower members <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. As a result, treatment with compression therapy is
indicated for patients with chronic venous insufficiency, as this acts on the
macrocirculation, increasing the venous return and the tissue pressure, favoring the
reabsorption of the edema and causing the fluids located in the interstitial spaces to
return to within the vascular and lymphatic systems <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>The therapeutic approach of patients with venous ulcers must be based, in the majority
of cases, in compression therapy <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>and in the topical treatment of the
ulcer<sup>(2-3) </sup> while, in more serious cases, treatment with systemic
medications and surgery may be added <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The
inadequate control of venous hypertension is directly proportional to the increase in
the rates of recurrence of ulcers with venous etiology <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>There is, at the present time, a large number of different types of compression
therapies on the market for the treatment of wounds, however, it is not yet clear if all
of these are genuinely effective, or which of these therapies is the best indication for
the treatment of </p><p>chronic venous ulcers <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>The Unna Boot is a form of inelastic compression therapy, acting in such a way as to
increase the compression and promote venous drainage and support, thus benefiting the
healing of the ulcer<sup>(2-6)</sup>. These inelastic bandages create high pressure with
the muscular contraction (during walking) and little pressure at rest. For this reason,
it is essential for the nurse to observe whether the patient continues to undertake her
daily activities, such as work-related, or taking short walks, when she is using the
Unna Boot, in order to implement the action of the product <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Another type of compression therapy existing on the market is the elastic bandages, made
with elastic fibers which provide compression and remain in place in movement and at
rest. During walking, the muscles of the calf contract and the bandage expands,
dissipating the strength exercised by the contraction of this musculature and promoting
the venous return to the heart<sup>(3-6)</sup>. These bandages are classified as of high
compression type III, as they exercise adequate pressure on an ankle of 18 through to 25
cm in circumference <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. They are washable and can
be reusable <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>This study's objective was to analyze the process of tissue repair of patients with
venous ulcers using inelastic compression therapy (the Unna Boot), in comparison with
the use of the elastic bandage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a controlled and randomized clinical trial. The study was undertaken in an
outpatient center specialized in treating wounds at a teaching hospital in the State of
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p><p>The sample was consecutive, and was initially composed of 19 (nineteen) patients
admitted to the outpatient center between 7<sup>th</sup> June and 20<sup>th</sup>
September 2011, and who met the eligibility criteria. In the randomization, 10 (ten)
patients were allocated to group A (elastic bandage) and 9 (nine) to group B (Unna
Boot). One patient from group A was excluded due to not attending the consultations. The
randomization was implemented by the Research Unit's statistician, using a table of
random numbers, generated by the Biostat 5.0 software and applied as the patients were
included in the study. The follow-up period was thirteen weeks.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: walking patients, over 18 years old; with a medical
diagnosis of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), not diabetic; presenting palpable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, with an anklebrachial index (ABI) of
&#x0003e;0.9, a venous ulcer with a minimum size of 6.0 cm<sup>2</sup> and a maximum of 9.0
cm<sup>2</sup>. The following were excluded: pregnant women; patients with signs of
allergy, cyanosis, with venous ulcers which were infected and/or with necrotic tissue,
and who discontinued use of the therapies.</p><p>Data collection was undertaken between June and December 2011, and was divided in two
stages: in the first stage, there was the initial approach and signing of the Terms of
Free and Informed Consent (TFIC) and authorization for making photographic records of
the lesion. In the second stage, the weekly consultations were held with a medical
history, clinical evaluation of the patient and of the wound, changing of dressings,
planimetrics and digital photographs.</p><p>The changing of the dressing and the evaluation of the wound were undertaken weekly in
the outpatient center by the same trained researcher. They were undertaken daily at home
by the patient subsequent to receiving guidance, training and explanatory leaflets. Both
groups changed the secondary dressing with the objective of preventing odor and the
accumulation of exudate. In accordance with the prescription and the maker's
recommendations, the elastic bandage group (group A) removed the bandage at night and
put it back on in the morning. For the beginning of the reapplication of the bandage,
the bandage was rolled from the center of the sole of the foot, with the lower end of
the bandage being placed at the base of the toes, rolling it around the heel and rising
upwards until 2 cm below the knee. The force applied in the bandage was controlled by
the change in format of the design, from rectangular to square. </p><p>In order to apply the dressing at home, the patients were supplied weekly with a
"dressing kit", containing the following materials: 6 cr&#x000ea;pe bandages, 6 packets with 10
units of sterile gauze and one container of adhesive tape. For Group A, in addition to
the dressing kit, two elastic graduated compression bandages were supplied. </p><p>The changing of the dressing in the outpatient center was based on cleaning with 0.9%
saline solution, at room temperature, in the form of irrigation using a 40x12mm needle.
The cleaning of the perilesional area was undertaken with neutral soap and 0.9% saline
solution. Only the margins were dried in order to avoid maceration of the perilesional
tissue. The wound bed was kept humid, in order to promote the process of tissue repair. </p><p>In group A, Petrolatum<sup>(r) </sup>gauze was used on the wound bed, for a period of
time of seven days, in order to maintain the humidity; in group B, the Unna Boot was
applied directly to the wound.</p><p>The primary outcome was the reduction of the area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of the venous
ulcers over the 13 (thirteen) weeks of treatment in groups A and B. The data were
evaluated using the technique of planimetrics and photography in the 1<sup>st</sup>,
5<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> weeks of treatment in both groups.
The calculation of the percentage of final reduction of the areas of the ulcers was
calculated using the following formula: </p><p>Percentage of reduction of the area of the venous ulcer = <inline-graphic xlink:href="0104-1169-rlae-23-04-00571-ee01.jpg"/>
</p><p>The secondary outcomes detected were the increase in granulation tissue, reduction of
the quantity of exudate, and reduction in edema and pain. These outcomes were evaluated
through instruments and protocols of the wound outpatient center. The quantity of
granulation tissue was assessed as: absent, from 1 to 25%, from 26 to 50%, from 51 to
75%, and from 76 to 100% of the total area of the lesion. In relation to the exudate,
the quantity was assessed as: absent, when the wound bed was found to be dry; little,
when the wound bed was at high humidity and involved draining of less than 25% of the
dressing; moderate, when the wound bed was saturated and the draining involved from 25
to 75%; and big, when the wound bed was bathed in fluid and draining involved more than
75% of the dressing <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.The pain was assessed using
the Numeric Rating Scale, graduated from 0 to 10 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>The demographic variables were: age and sex, and the health variables were: underlying
diseases, and the location of the lesion, eczema, Body Mass Index (BMI) and
Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI).</p><p>The comparison of the sociodemographic and clinical variables, and those related to the
lesion, between the two groups (A and B) were analyzed using the Student t-test
(independent samples) or Mann-Whitney test, for numerical data, and using the Fisher
exact test, for categorical data.</p><p>The variation of the area of the ulcer obtained at the four different points
(1<sup>st</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup>consultations) in
each group was evaluated using the Friedman ANOVAand the corresponding Nemenyi multiple
comparison test(non-parametric), which identifies which points differ significantly
between each other; the criteria for determining significance adopted was the level of
5%. The results were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, using the
SAS software, version 6.11.</p><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
under Protocol N. 327/10 and CAAE: 0252.0.258.000-10; the patients were offered the
continuation of the treatment after the 13 (thirteen) weeks of data collection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 18 patients participated in the study, 9 in group A (elastic bandage) and 9

</p><p>Two patients presented total healing of their ulcers, the patient from group A in the
9<sup>th</sup> week, and the patient from group B in the 13<sup>th</sup>week. It is
highlighted that all the ulcers monitored by the study had suffered relapses in a period
of time below five years.</p><p>Based on the calculation of the percentage of the final reduction of the area of the
venous ulcers, one can state that group B (69.41%) presented a higher percentage of
value of reduction of the ulcers' area, in comparison with group A (42.32%). </p><p>At the end of the thirteen weeks of monitoring, the two groups presented granulation
tissue in the wound beds. In relation to the quantity of exudate, group B presented a
greater reduction in the production of exudate in comparison with group A. </p><p>Intense edema graded at +3/+4, which was initially evaluated in 88.9% of the patients,
progressed at the end of the study to mild edema (+1/+4) in the same. </p><p>The majority of the patients (80%) report having stopped using pain killers for
undertaking activities of daily living, classifying the pain, at the end of the study,
on a numerical scale with values from 0 to 4. </p><p>In relation to the inconvenience of the use of compression therapy, the groups reported
improvement in the discomfort and the pain after the first five weeks of treatment. </p><p>Ochre dermatitis was found in all the lower limbs affected by the venous ulcers. In the
elastic bandage group, the appearance of crusts was observed on the margins of all the
ulcers; in the Unna Boot group, the ulcers presented periwound maceration. </p><p>

it was observed that the areas adjacent to the ulcers were more hydrated in all the

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, there was a predominance of 77.8% of adults and male older adults, of
individuals in full maturity and who were still in the job market<sup>(9-11)</sup>, in
whom the predominant illness was chronic venous insufficiency, considered greater from
the third decade of life onward.</p><p>Various studies involving patients with the same profile as this sample have evidenced
systolic arterial hypertension as the chronic disease which most affects patients with
venous ulcers, in whom its percentage can reach 62%<sup>(9-11)</sup>. Another
aggravating factor in the treatment of venous ulcers was the presence of obesity or
overweight, as these patients have a tendency to sedentarism and present difficulty in
applying the compression therapy <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>The main anatomical location of the ulcers was the malleolar region. The ulcers can be
single or multiple, and can vary in size and location; however, in general, they occur
in the distal part of the lower limbs, particularly in the region of the malleolus <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The time of evolution of these ulcers counted in months varied from a minimum of 4
(four) months to a maximum of 120 (one hundred and twenty) months.</p><p>It is expected that these lesions last for a long time, as chronic lesions occur over a
prolonged period and take more time than normal to heal, due to the pre-existing
conditions such as pressure, diabetes, poor circulation, poor nutritional status,
immunodeficiency or infection. In addition to this, emphasis is also placed on the fact
that the time which passes between the appearance of the wound and its total healing,
and the possibility of recurrence, are also influenced by the therapy adopted </p><p>for its treatment <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>The eczema, found around the wound, can be represented by pruritus, erythema and
desquamation, affecting the vast majority of patients with venous ulcers, and even
increasing the area of the lesion, causing infection when the patients scratch the
wound<sup>(10-11)</sup>. The brownish coloration, also known as "ochre dermatitis",
is caused by the accumulation of hemosiderin (pigment arising from the death of the
blood cells in the subcutaneous tissue)<sup>(10-11)</sup>. All of the distal thirds of
the lower limbs affected by the venous wounds presented lipodermatosclerosis, which
consists of hardening caused by the chronic edema and fibrosis, which can also be
denominated as the inverted champagne bottle deformity <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The presence of fetid odor was not observed in this study, possibly due to the nursing
guidance regarding self-care and to the provision of material, such that the patients
could change the secondary dressing at home. </p><p>In relation to the reduction of the area of the ulcer in cm&#x000b2;, over the 13 weeks of
treatment, it was ascertained that only group B (Unna Boot) presented a significant
reduction in the area (cm&#x000b2;) throughout all of the evaluations (1<sup>st</sup>,
5<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th)</sup>. Group A (elastic bandage), on the
other hand, only presented a fall in the area of the ulcer in cm&#x000b2; (p=0.06) after the
5<sup>th</sup> consultation. </p><p>Based on the calculation of the percentage of reduction of the area of the ulcers for
each treatment group, it was observed that group B presented a high percentage of
reduction of the area of the ulcers (69.41%), in comparison with group A (42.32%). </p><p>The tissue found in the wound bed of all the ulcers at the end of the 13<sup>th</sup>
week of treatment with the two compression therapies was that of granulation. This was a
positive result, as, at the start of the study, there were ulcers with devitalized
tissues and with hypergranulation. Another important data was the presence, at the
beginning of treatment, of hypergranulation tissue in the wound bed of two ulcers of the
elastic bandage group which, subsequent to treatment with the elastic therapy, presented
significant improvement in the quality of the tissue. This result was evidenced in the
last evaluation, as the elastic bandage acted as a "physical barrier", delaying the
process of disorganized stimulation of the granulation tissue found in the ulcers' wound
beds. </p><p>In relation to the presence of exudate in the ulcers, an increase in the production was
observed with the two compression therapies at the beginning of the treatment. In group
B, the patients undertook a greater number of changes of secondary dressings, twice a
day, while group A undertook this once per day. However, at the end of the study, it was
evidenced that group B presented greater reduction in the production of exudate in
comparison with group A. </p><p>The excess of exudate can favor infection, hindering the process of tissue repair, as
well as producing odor and discomfort for the patient <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Improvement was noted in the grade of the edema in all the patients, after the 13
(thirteen) weeks of treatment. In the first consultation, it was observed that 90% of
the patients presented edema grade 3+/4+, progressing in the last consultation to +1/4+.
The compression therapies - both elastic and inelastic - are the main and most efficient
means of controlling edema with venous and lymphatic causes. Rest is also indicated,
with the lower limbs being raised to heart level <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>In relation to pain, it was noted that in group B there was a greater number of patients
who reported pain in using the inelastic compression therapy, in comparison with group
A. This data corroborates the literature regarding the mechanism of action of the Unna
Boot; being an inelastic compression therapy, containing few or no elastometric fibers,
this does not mold to the changes in the size of the patient's leg, as well as
exercising great pressure on the musculature of the calf of the lower limb in question,
during walking and rest <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. It is these pressures, acting during rest and
walking, which can cause greater discomfort during the use of this therapy <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>The use of compression therapy, during the first weeks of treatment, can cause a slight
increase of pain in the patients <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>In relation to the crusts on the margins of the ulcers of the elastic bandage group, the
undertaking of mechanical debridement is recommended using a scalpel blade, during the
weekly nursing consultations. The appearance of crusts on the margins is more common in
dried ulcers, and these must be mechanically debrided using scalpel blades, so that the
keratosis may be removed, facilitating the process of healing <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>The perilesional laceration observed in the Unna Boot group nearly always results from
the application of the product directly on the wound and from the abundance of exudate,
and reduces with the healing of the wound. Another problem is the loss of the
epithelialization tissue during the changing of the dressing, for which reason the
recommendation is to abundantly irrigate the dressing with saline solution until it
unsticks from the lesion and, at the end of the dressing process, to apply urea cream at
10% on the edges of the ulcers for hydration.</p><p>Urea cream at 10% was used during all the changings of dressings in all the patients of
the study, for hydration of the intact skin around the ulcers. Due to the positive
results, the hydration of the skin around the wound is recommended, using hydrating
creams based on urea and lanolin, for the maintenance of the skin function and integrity
and moisture balance <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>There are complementary measures which facilitate healing and reduce the risk of the
appearance of new ulcers, such as resting the lower limbs above the level of the heart
for 30 minutes, four times a day, encouragement to take short walks, and maintaining the
person's weight within normal limits, as well as avoiding tobacco products and alcoholic
drinks <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>The patient's adherence to the treatment is important in order to avoid relapses.
Various authors have argued that the high number of patients with relapsing ulcers is
owed to the fact that the patient did not collaborate in relation to the preventive
measures, such as the use of compression therapy following the healing of the ulcers,
the lack of post-healing monitoring with angiologists, and not undertaking surgery,
among other factors <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

treating venous ulcers, in comparison with the use of the elastic bandage, in a
homogenous sample. There was significant reduction, at the level of 5%, in the area
(cm<sup>2)</sup> of the ulcers of group B (p&#x0003c;0.0001), throughout the treatment,
and there was a tendency in group A for reduction in the area of the ulcer in
cm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.06) only after the fifth week.</p><p>The Unna Boot presented a better result in venous ulcers with areas greater than 10cm&#x000b2;,
and the elastic bandage with Petrolatum<sup>(r)</sup> gauze presented a better result in
venous ulcers with areas below 10cm&#x000b2;. in these two treatments, there was an increase in
granulation tissue in the wound beds of the ulcers, and reduction in pain and edema. The
treatment with the Unna Boot was characterized by significant reduction of the
exudate.</p><p>It is recommended that patients using the Unna Boot should change the secondary dressing
on a daily basis so as to prevent odor, and that they should use urea cream at 10% on
the wound margins. The patients using the elastic bandage should remove the bandage
before sleeping and reapply it in the morning.</p><p>The limitation of the study was the difficulty in including patients who were willing to
adhere to the treatment in the long-term, and the financial cost of the study. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="presented-at"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from master's thesis "Usa of Unna Boot in Comparison to Elastic
