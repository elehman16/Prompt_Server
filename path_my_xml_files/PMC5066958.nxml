Total duration of treatment was either 24 or 48 weeks (response-guided treatment), with TVR administered for the first 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at post treatment week 12 (SVR12), which was tested for noninferiority of Lambda/RBV/TVR.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 838 patients were enrolled, and 617 were treated; 411 and 206 patients received Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR, respectively. The majority of patients were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve, with HCV GT-1b and a high baseline viral load (&#x02265;800,000 IU/mL). Less than 10% of patients had cirrhosis (Lambda, 7.5%; Alfa, 6.8%). Lambda/RBV/TVR did not meet the criterion for noninferiority (lower bound of the treatment difference interval was -12.3%); the SVR12 in all patients (modified intent-to-treat) was 76.2% in the Lambda arm and 82.0% in the Alfa arm. Overall, the frequency of adverse events in each arm was comparable (Lambda, 91.7%; Alfa, 97.1%). As expected based on the safety profile of the 2 interferons, there were more hepatobiliary events observed in the Lambda arm and more hematologic events in the Alfa arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this comparison of Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR in patients who were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or had relapsed on prior Alfa/RBV treatment, Lambda failed to demonstrate noninferiority based on SVR12 results. Treatment with Lambda/RBV/TVR was associated with a higher incidence of relapse. More patients discontinued Lambda/RBV/TVR treatment during the first 4 weeks of study treatment, mainly due to hepatobiliary-related events, and more Lambda patients were lost to follow-up.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002491</institution-id><institution>Bristol-Myers Squibb</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Bristol-Myers Squibb (the sponsor) designed the study in collaboration with the academic investigators (Robert Flisiak, Mitchell Shiffman, Juan Arenas, Hugo Cheinquer, and Igor Nikitin), conducted the study, collected study data, and performed statistical analyses.

In 2003, type III (lambda) IFNs were identified [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lambda IFNs have antiviral activity similar to that of type I IFNs [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however their receptor complexes are expressed on a more limited subset of host cells, suggesting treatment with IFN lambda may be associated with fewer systemic adverse events (AEs) [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of peginterferon lambda-1a (Lambda)-based regimens for treatment of chronic HCV infection have shown improved overall tolerability, along with similar efficacy, compared to Alfa-based regimens [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In 2011, regulatory authorities in the United States and in many countries in Europe approved 2 direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), telaprevir (TVR) [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and boceprevir (BOC) [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], for use in combination with Alfa plus RBV for the treatment of IFN/RBV-na&#x000ef;ve and -experienced patients with genotype-1 (GT-1) chronic HCV infection. Response-guided treatment using TVR or BOC, each in combination with Alfa/RBV, was shown to reduce treatment duration and improve sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and -experienced patients [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although these new combination regimens demonstrated improved efficacy, they were not without both tolerability and resistance challenges.</p><p>At the time this study was initiated, IFN-based alternatives to Alfa with the potential for improved tolerability and efficacy were being developed for use in combination with RBV with or without a DAA. Based on the improved safety profile of Lambda vs. Alfa and the improved efficacy of Alfa plus RBV when combined with a DAA [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the combination of Lambda/RBV/DAA was of interest. To investigate this option, Lambda and Alfa, each administered in combination with RBV plus TVR (TVR selected because of its wider usage at the time), were evaluated in this study to compare their safety and efficacy profiles in patients with chronic HCV GT-1 infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 study in patients with GT-1 chronic HCV infection (treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or relapsed following prior Alfa/RBV treatment) (supporting CONSORT checklist is available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164563.s001">S1 Checklist</xref>). Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive Lambda (180 &#x003bc;g by subcutaneous [SC] injection once weekly) or Alfa (180 &#x003bc;g by SC injection once weekly), each administered in combination with RBV (1000 mg per day orally for patients weighing &#x0003c;75 kg and 1200 mg per day orally for patients weighing &#x02265;75 kg) plus TVR (750 mg orally 3 times daily) during the first 12 weeks, followed by either Lambda/RBV or Alfa/RBV for a total treatment duration of 24 or 48 weeks depending on the achievement or not, respectively, of an extended rapid virologic response (eRVR; defined as undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12 of treatment). Patients with cirrhosis completed a total of 48 weeks of treatment, regardless of their eRVR status. At the completion of treatment, all patients were to receive off-treatment follow-up for 48 weeks.

Because the clinical development of Lambda was discontinued while this study was in progress, the trial was terminated after all patients had received at least 12 weeks of post-treatment follow-up to determine SVR12 but not the initially planned 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up assessments.</p><fig id="pone.0164563.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164563.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Patient disposition and reasons for discontinuation.</title><p>RBV, ribavirin; TVR, telaprevir.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0164563.g001"/></fig><p>Patient demographic and disease characteristics were comparable between the 2 study arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0164563.t001">Table 1</xref>).

However, there was no overall difference between treatment arms with respect to rash-related dermatologic events (Lambda, 36.3%; Alfa, 38.3%), likely due to the use of TVR in both treatment regimens.</p><p>A comparable proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs (Lambda, 8.0%; Alfa, 8.3%). However, more patients discontinued treatment due to AEs during the first 4 weeks of therapy with Lambda than with Alfa, which contributed to the lower RVR observed in the Lambda arm.</p><p>Serious AE (SAE) rates were comparable across the 2 treatment arms (Lambda, 10.5%; Alfa, 9.7%), with the most common hepatobiliary-related AE, jaundice (considered an important medical event) occurring more frequently in the Lambda arm (Lambda, 2.7%; Alfa, 1.0%) and rash occurring more frequently in the Alfa arm (Lambda, 0.2%; Alfa, 2.4%).</p><p>Two deaths were reported, one due to pneumonia (Lambda arm at treatment week 24), which was considered not related to study treatment, and one due to hypoxia (Alfa arm at treatment week 40), which was considered related to study treatment.

In the Lambda arm, dose reductions occurred most commonly as a result of elevated liver function tests (10.2%), while in the Alfa treatment arm, dose reductions occurred most commonly because of hematologic toxicity (12.1%). The majority of RBV dose reductions were for hematologic toxicity and were substantially higher in the Alfa arm (40.8%) compared with the Lambda arm (9.5%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this comparison of Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR in patients with GT-1 chronic HCV infection, Lambda failed to demonstrate noninferiority to Alfa for the primary (SVR12 overall) efficacy endpoint. For the primary endpoint, the overall SVR12 rate for Lambda/RBV/TVR (76.2%) was lower than the SVR12 rate for Alfa/RBV/TVR (82.0%). SVR rates obtained in large, randomized, controlled trials with similar patient populations and similar regimens of Alfa/RBV/TVR have ranged from 72.0% to 83.0% [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the result from this study for the Alfa arm was in the upper end of this range.</p><p>In this study, patients from both treatment groups infected with HCV GT-1b responded with a higher SVR12 rate than those with HCV GT-1a. These results are consistent with published results on response of GT-1 subtypes to IFN/RBV/DAA combinations, including IFN/RBV/TVR [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also consistent with prior observations [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], patients from both treatment groups who had lower baseline HCV RNA levels had higher response rates than those with higher HCV RNA levels. In this study, SVR12 in prior relapsers to Alfa/RBV following retreatment with Lambda/RBV/TVR (84.2%) was higher than in HCV treatment-naive patients and comparable to the rate observed in the Alfa/RBV/TVR treatment arm (82.0%). This observation is consistent with the findings from other studies of Alfa/RBV/TVR therapy in chronic HCV infection, which have shown that response rates are generally higher in patients who relapsed after prior Alfa/RBV therapy than in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This observation is not surprising, as prior relapsers represent a relatively homogeneous group of patients who have responded to treatment previously and who would be expected to respond favorably to a retreatment regimen that includes a DAA. Finally, comparable responses were observed in the CC genotype and non-CC genotype patients treated with Alfa/RBV/TVR. <italic>IL28B</italic> genotype is a predictor of treatment response to a non-DAA interferon regimen; therefore, typically higher response rates might have been expected in the CC genotype patients. However, the increasing potency of treatment regimens, which include one or more DAAs, including TVR, has led to a diminished role of <italic>IL28B</italic> status in the prediction of treatment response.</p><p>A number of factors may explain the difference in response rates in patients receiving Lambda and Alfa in this study. Patients treated with Lambda experienced more relapses compared with patients treated with Alfa. Slightly more patients treated with Lambda were lost to follow-up during the study (patients lost to follow-up were considered treatment failures in the study analysis). In addition, although baseline disease characteristics were balanced in the study arms, slightly more patients had cirrhosis in the Lambda arm (7.5%) vs. the Alfa arm, (6.8%), and these patients appeared to have a lower SVR12 response.</p><p>Even though more relapses may have been observed in the Lambda arm as compared with the Alfa arm in this study, the relapse rate for Lambda is consistent with relapse rates observed in another TVR study [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and was lower than the relapse rates observed in the phase 2b EMERGE study of Lambda/RBV vs. Alfa/RBV in HCV GT-1 patients (19.6% with Lambda/RBV and 18.4% with Alfa/RBV) [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Like other studies with TVR, the addition of TVR reduced the relapse rate when compared with non-DAA interferon regimens.</p><p>The RVR with Lambda treatment was lower than with Alfa treatment, suggesting that Lambda was not as efficacious in suppressing HCV within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This finding is not consistent with the Lambda phase 2b EMERGE study, which demonstrated higher RVR rates for Lambda/RBV than for Alfa/RBV and comparable SVR rates [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During these first 4 weeks of treatment, discontinuations due to AEs were more frequent in the Lambda arm than in the Alfa arm and more patients in the Lambda arm discontinued due to hepatobiliary-related events, therefore limiting the opportunity for these subjects to achieve virologic control. Hence, the inability to complete the required treatment duration may have negatively impacted both the early viral suppression rates and SVR12 rates for patients receiving Lambda.</p><p>In terms of safety, the Lambda and Alfa behaved as expected based on the cellular distribution of their respective receptors: more hepatic-related events (including discontinuations due to AEs) were seen with Lambda, while more hematologic and systemic AEs were seen with Alfa. The frequency of grade 3/4 alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevations were higher with Lambda (11.7% and 7.3%, respectively) than Alfa (1.0% and 0.5%, respectively) but were also higher than that previously observed with Lambda/RBV (3%) [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The reasons for these elevations are unclear.</p><p>Although it might be expected that improved tolerability with Lambda would lead to higher response rates as compared with Alfa-based regimens, the goal of Lambda treatment was to provide a regimen that was comparable to Alfa treatment without the treatment-limiting side effects of Alfa, with higher response rates being an added benefit, if observed. In this study, side effects that are typically associated with Alfa treatment such as emergent cytopenic abnormalities, flu-like symptoms, and musculoskeletal symptoms were lower with Lambda treatment. However, higher hepatobiliary-related events occurred with Lambda treatment, which led to early discontinuation of therapy and may have negated any potential benefit of this treatment. The addition of TVR in both groups also contributed to the side effect profile and was consistent with effects as observed in other TVR studies. Regarding central nervous system (CNS) AEs related to IFN therapy, the mechanisms and the specific receptors involved are not well understood. Differences in CNS AEs between groups treated with Lambda and Alfa were not observed in the previous clinical phase 2b study with Lambda; therefore, in the present study, differences were not anticipated, nor were they observed.</p><p>Since the development of this study, treatment for chronic HCV infection has substantially evolved, with the approval of next generation, all-oral, IFN-free, direct-acting regimens that achieve high SVR rates with improved tolerability. Due to the diminished role of IFN-based regimens for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, the Lambda clinical development program has been discontinued. However, Lambda may be investigated to treat other viral infections such as chronic hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection. Moreover, the results of this study broaden the safety and efficacy information for Lambda as a therapeutic agent and are important to understanding the biology and tolerability of type III IFNs and the potential clinical importance of Lambda beyond HCV treatment. Although type I IFNs (alfa and beta) and type III IFNs (lambda) activate the same intracellular signaling pathway and possess many of the same biological activities, alfa receptors are broadly expressed on most cell types, while lambda receptors outside of the liver are largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0164563.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a result, treatment with Lambda was expected to provide improved tolerability with comparable SVR rates. However, results of the present study show that when Lambda and TVR are combined in a treatment regimen, any potential benefit based on biology may be offset by a more complicated safety profile. Although Lambda is no longer being evaluated as a therapeutic alternative to Alfa for the treatment of HCV infection, Lambda may be investigated for treatment of other diseases of infectious or noninfectious etiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this comparison of Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR for SVR12 in patients who were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or relapsers on prior treatment with Alfa/RBV, Lambda failed to demonstrate noninferiority.
