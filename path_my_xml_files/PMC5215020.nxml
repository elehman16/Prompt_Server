VTE is associated with a mortality rate exceeding 15% in first 3 months after diagnosis [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with survivors remaining at risk for development of recurrent PE and/or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The clinical benefits of thrombolysis have remained controversial in the absence of hemodynamic compromise at presentation, i.e., submassive PE.</p><p>Pulmonary emboli most often arise from the deep veins of the lower extremity and pelvis from where they dislodge to the pulmonary arteries causing abnormalities in hemodynamics and gas exchange depending on the size of the embolus, the patient&#x02019;s underlying cardiopulmonary status, and compensatory neurohumoral adaptations. In addition to physical obstruction, acute PE leads to the release of pulmonary artery vasoconstrictors and hypoxemia, with a subsequent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular (RV) afterload, dilatation, hypokinesia, tricuspid regurgitation, RV failure leading to a reduction of the cardiac output causing systemic hypotension and hemodynamic instability [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The association between elevated levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury and an adverse early outcome indicates that RV ischemia is of pathophysiological significance in the acute phase of PE [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Acute PE has been classified into three groups: non-massive or low risk, submassive or moderate/intermediate risk, and massive or high risk. Massive PE is defined as conglomerate of pulselessness, persistent bradycardia with rate &#x0003c; 40 bpm and signs of shock or sustained hypotension. Sustained hypotension includes systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &#x0003c; 90 mm Hg &#x0003e; 15 min, an SBP of &#x0003c; 100 mm Hg in a patient with a history of hypertension, or a &#x0003e; 40% reduction in baseline SBP in absence of dysrhythmia, hypovolemia, sepsis, or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Submassive PE is one with normal or near normal SBP (&#x02265; 90 mm Hg) with evidence of cardiopulmonary stress, including RV dysfunction or myocardial necrosis. RV dysfunction is defined by RV dilation on echo (RV diameter/LV diameter &#x0003e; 0.9), RV systolic dysfunction on echo, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) elevation (&#x0003e; 90 pg/mL), N-terminal pro-BNP (&#x0003e; 500 pg/mL) or electrocardiographic (ECG) changes (new RBBB, anteroseptal ST &#x02191;/&#x02193;, or anteroseptal T-wave &#x02193;). Myocardial necrosis is defined as elevation in troponin I or T over laboratory normal value or above patient baseline [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Non-massive PE is defined as no signs of clinical instability, hemodynamic compromise, or RV strain depending on echocardiographic finding or biomarker [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, single-center study conducted in the Department of Cardiology, LPS Institute of Cardiology, G.S.V.M.

A review of randomized trials indicated that thrombolysis may be associated with a reduction in mortality or recurrent PE in high-risk patients who present with hemodynamic instability. Clinical trials of thrombolysis in acute submassive PE have demonstrated more rapid, immediate hemodynamic improvement and clot resolution following thrombolysis, but unclear mortality benefits and therefore remains controversial [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Miller et al [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that streptokinase infusion over 72 h resulted in a significant reduction of SPAP, total pulmonary resistance, and the angiographic index of PE severity. In comparison, conventional heparin anticoagulation had no appreciable effect on the above parameters during the first 3 days. Goldhaber et al [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared alteplase (100 mg infusions over 2 h) to heparin alone among 101 patients based on echocardiographic indicators of RV pressure overload and dysfunction in the evaluation of PE severity. But it did not exclude patients with a normally functioning right ventricle on echocardiography. Therefore, particular focus on the patient population with submassive PE was lacking. They showed rapid improvement of RV function in the alteplase group as assessed by 24-h echocardiographic follow-up. However, thrombolysis was not shown to have any effect on survival, partly due to the low (2%) overall in-hospital mortality. No clinical episodes of recurrent PE were noted among rt-PA patients, but there were two fatal and three non-fatal clinically suspected recurrent PEs within 14 days in patients randomized to heparin alone. Konstantinides et al [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in MAPPET-3 trial (The Management Strategies and Prognosis of Pulmonary Embolism Trial-3) randomized 256 patients with submassive PE to receive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 100 mg over a 2-h period followed by UFH infusion or placebo plus heparin anticoagulation. Compared with heparin anticoagulation alone, tPA resulted in a significant reduction in primary study endpoint (escalation of therapy defined as catecholamine infusion, rescue fibrinolysis, mechanical ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or emergency surgical embolectomy). However, there was difference in mortality among both the groups. In accordance with the studies conducted by Miller et al [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Goldhaber et al [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], our study also showed significant reduction in PASP and improvement in RV function with thrombolytic therapy as compared to heparin group. Mean PASP decreased significantly in both groups but decrease in mean PASP at D7 was more in TNK than heparin group. Similarly, more improvement in RV function was seen in patients who received TNK than those receiving heparin. In contrast to MAPPET-3 trial, our study did not show any significant reduction in requirement for mechanical ventilation with thrombolytic therapy. Becattini et al [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in TIPES study which evaluated the effect of TNK on RV dysfunction assessed by echocardiography in hemodynamically stable patients with submassive PE showed that TNK had a significant reduction in RV dysfunction with no significant reduction in all cause mortality at 30 days, which is similar to our findings. Sharifi et al [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in MOPETT Trial (moderate pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis) of 121 patients with moderate PE randomized to receive a &#x0201c;safe dose&#x0201d; alteplase plus anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone. There was significant reduction in duration of hospitalization, bleeding during the index hospitalization, recurrence of PE and combination of death plus PE recurrence. Despite a positive trend in favor of a &#x0201c;safe dose&#x0201d; thrombolysis, no significant difference was noted in death rate. We did not find any difference in mortality in both groups, probably because overall mortality rate was low (4.6%). Rate of rehospitalization within 30 days and recurrent PE also did not differ significantly in both the groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Similar to MOPPET Trial, mean hospital stay was significantly reduced with thrombolytic therapy as compared to heparin only group. PEITHO trial [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (pulmonary embolism thrombolysis) which randomized 1,006 patients with intermediate-risk (submassive) PE to either systemic thrombolysis with weight adjusted TNK or to placebo, on a background of weight-based heparin. The primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or hemodynamic decompensation occurred in 2.6% of patients in thrombolysis arm compared to 5.6% of patients in the placebo group which was mostly driven by a decreased occurrence of hemodynamic instability although 30-day mortality alone did not differ between the groups. A meta-analysis which pooled data from eight trials containing 1,775 patients with intermediate-risk PE showed that thrombolysis was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.25 - 0.92), but significantly more bleeding events (OR: 3.19; 95% CI: 2.07 - 4.92) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our study, similar findings were noted as in PEITHO trial [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] though hemodynamic instability was more in our group in placebo arm. In PEITHO trial [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there was significantly increased risk of extracranial bleeding with thrombolysis as compared to heparin group (6.3% vs. 1.2%) and intracerebral hemorrhage (2.4% vs. 0.2%). In our study, there was no significant difference in major bleeding in both the groups as intracranial bleed was more in thrombolytic arm whereas extracranial bleed was more in placebo arm. Another finding was significantly increased the risk of minor bleeding in thrombolytic arm than placebo. Risk of stroke that might be a concern with thrombolysis did not differ in both groups.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study represents a single-center experience with limited

derive overall mortality benefit, recurrent PE and rehospitalization with thrombolytic therapy but had improved clinical course in form of decrease in hemodynamic decompensation, mean hospital stay,
