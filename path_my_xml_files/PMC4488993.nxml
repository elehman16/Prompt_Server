After reviewing 25 studies the results showed that rehabilitation interventions appeared to have stronger and more significant effects on reducing the impact or severity of reported fatigue compared to medication. Pharmacological agents, including fatigue medication, are important but often do not enable people with MS to cope with their existing disabilities.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Stretching exercises and yoga are recommended in patients with MS.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The benefits of regular exercise in patients with MS include improvements in mood (state of mind) and the ability to perform daily tasks.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Several studies and meta-analysis conducted to show the effectiveness of exercises on patients who involved to chronic disease. Although one fundamental consideration pertaining to any protocol aimed at increasing physical activity what remained to be questioned is if group-based activity is more effective or individually-based? For example, a health-care system may offer group-based educational classes or individual counseling for physical activity. Similarly, a worksite may offer an individually targeted internet intervention or regular fitness classes to promote physical activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Some reviews recommends that group based exercise is more effective for patients[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while in contrast other suggested individualized exercises.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Thus, considering the increasing number of MS patients, negative effects of fatigue on quality of life of patients, conflicting results regarding the effect of exercise in alleviating of fatigue in patients with MS, and that no indexed studies regarding the difference in effectiveness of individual with group based exercises in these patients have not been found as researcher knowledge, the researcher performed a study which aimed to compare the effectiveness of group and individual exercises on the level of perception of fatigue in patients with MS. The authors hypothesized the exercise significantly will decrease the fatigue level in MS patients and the level of fatigue in group and individualized exercise group will be significantly different.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study is a randomized clinical trial which was performed after obtaining formal permission from the ethical committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences whit code of 87694.

Therefore difference in fatigue after the intervention may be related to the effect of mild stretching exercises and basic yoga exercises in both group and individual exercises.</p><p>The results of present study showed that the mean perceived fatigue was decreased in compare to pre-intervention in the group exercise 11.35% in third week, and sixth week 11.98%, respectively, but, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.160).</p><p>In individual exercise group the fatigue level was decreased 13.2% at third week and 21.9% at sixth weeks after the intervention. In the study conducted with Plow <italic>et al.</italic>, (2009) comparing two individual rehabilitation and group health (seven training sessions) to promote physical activity and health in 50 patients with MS. The results showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of QOL, perceived fatigue, mental health and physical assessment. But fatigue, resting heart rate and physical activity were improved in both groups[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which is in harmony with our results, although the type of intervention was different in both groups. In findings of Veliconja and colleagues revealed that yoga was not effective on fatigue.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although this difference is explainable with different sample size and sessions in two study.</p><p>Freeman and Allison (2004) delivered 10 weeks exercise program with a counseling session at the end of each exercise session and their findings indicated that the mean perceived fatigue was decreased as 21.6%.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In their study the percentage of decrease in perceived fatigue was reported higher than the present study. This difference can be due to small sample size of their study (10 patients) also the patients received longer exercise sessions plus counselling in the end of each session.</p><p>The study of Rasova <italic>et al.</italic>, (2006) showed that after two months of intervention, one hour twice a week, perceived fatigue was in the aerobic exercise group 11.10% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and in the combination group of neurophysiological and aerobic exercise 8.67% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). They believed that the reason of difference between the four groups is related to the disability levels.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the present study a decrease of about 12% in perception of fatigue was observed which is in consistent with the study of Razova <italic>et al.</italic>, in the aerobic exercise group.</p><p>Kargarfard and colleagues[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that 8 weeks of exercise in water, three times a week significantly decreased perceived fatigue of patients significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). These differences may be is related to the nature of exercises (exercise in water), the frequency and duration of exercise in a week and used different tools to measure the fatigue.</p><p>Mean perceived fatigue had statistically significant difference in individual exercise group at the third and sixth weeks after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013), although there was no significant difference in the group exercise (<italic>P</italic> = 0.160). This result may explainable with considering the mean number of exercise sessions in individual group (10.6 &#x000b1; 1.5) which was more than group exercise (9.5 &#x000b1; 1.3), and according to self-report checklist, more subjects in individual exercise group (57.14%) regularly performed 12 sessions of exercises while in the group exercise only 34.48% were regular.</p><p>As a result, increasing self-efficacy and activity of patients leads to further decrease of fatigue perception in individual exercise group. This result is similar to the reported results in review conducted with Atienza,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] While it is in contrast with Shauna <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s findings.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In this study, the group exercise had to join to each session at certain time and in a certain sport gym which can be one of the reasons for the high rate of drop and the lack of significances in the effect of exercise on fatigue perception. The participants of individual exercise group was not involved with this kind of limitations and they could perform the exercise at home whenever they can.</p><p>Another reason could be due to the nature of MS symptoms. In this study, the samples were vary about the levels of MS and also both types of recurrence included. Due to the nature of the disease, being in a group and observing the problems of people during exercise, creates a negative impact on the morale of the patients.</p><p>The nature of exercises in this study was mild stretching and preliminary yoga, the exercises were safe for all levels of disability in these patients and caused satisfied feeling in the patients after exercise. The results also indicated a positive effect of the nature of this type of exercise in MS patients and despite of the negative consequences of being in a group the effect of exercise was significant in group exercise also.</p><p>In summary, according to the obtained results, the period of 6-weeks exercises is the minimum required time and longer time expected to show more significant results. Based on our findings, stretching exercises and selected preliminary yoga is a beneficial method to reduce fatigue in MS patients. Despite the perception of fatigue in both groups showed a significant decreases in fatigue of patients in compare to pre-intervention, this difference was not significant in team exercise group. Further studies needs to be performed among patients with MS considering the level of disability progression and separate exercise classes should be hold for each group.</p><p>Holding the group exercise sessions in different times give them to choose sessions according daily program. So that the patients attend for exercise when they are willing. Also, the long term effect of these interventions can be assessed by a follow-up program. Considering the effect of these exercises in reducing fatigue, survey on effectiveness of exercise on other signs of MS recommended.</p><p>This study involved with some limitations such as lack of control on physical activities of the subjects, selecting the samples with different level of disability, factors influencing on fatigue such as mental-psychological status, nutrition, etc.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study is result of a research thesis submitted to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences whit code of 87694.
