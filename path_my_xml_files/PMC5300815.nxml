walking among young adults after neuromuscular joint facilitation therapy. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects were twelve healthy young people (6 males, 6 females). A
neuromuscular joint facilitation intervention and nonintervention were performed. The
interventions were performed one after the other, separated by a 1-week interval. The
order of the interventions was completely randomized. The rotation of the tibia during
walking was evaluated before and after treatment. [Results] The neuromuscular joint
facilitation group demonstrated increased lateral rotation of the tibia in the overall
gait cycle and stance phase, and decreased medial rotation of the tibia in the overall
gait cycle, stance phase, and swing phase after the neuromuscular joint facilitation
intervention. In the control group, there were no significant differences. [Conclusion]
These results suggest neuromuscular joint facilitation intervention has an immediate
effect on the rotational function of the knee.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation</kwd><kwd>Knee</kwd><kwd>Rotation function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a technique used to improve lower-limb
muscle strength and gait function. Neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) is a new
therapeutic exercise based on kinesiology, which is used to increase strength, flexibility,
and range of motion (ROM). NJF integrates the facilitation element of PNF and the joint
composition movement, with the aim to improve the movement of the joint through passive
exercise, active exercise, and resistance exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Tibial rotation occurs at the time of knee bend. The characteristics of NJF emphasize the

All of the subjects were right-handed. The purpose and contents of this
research were explained to the subjects, and they gave their informed consent to participate
in the study. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the International
University of Health and Welfare (IUHW 12-197).</p><p>To measure the rotational function of the tibia during walking, subjects were asked to walk
at a self-determined velocity. The angular velocity of tibial internal and external rotation
was measured over the gait cycle. Eight-channel small wireless motion recorders (MVP-RF8-BC,
Microstone Inc.) were used to collect the tibial internal and external rotation data.
Six-axis motion sensors were set on the proximal portion of the femur lateral condyle and
the fibula head of the right lower limb. Strong double-sided tape and an elastic bandage
were used to affix the 6-axis motion sensor to subjects&#x02019; skin. In addition, two pressure
sensors set on the heel and toe of the right foot were used to separate the stance phase and
swing phase of the gait cycle.</p><p>In the control measurement, the subjects were asked to walk at a self-determined velocity,
and the degree of tibial internal and external rotation over 10 seconds was measured. Then
after a 5-minute rest, the subjects were asked to repeat the walk. The same measurements
were carried out.</p><p>In the NJF intervention measurement, 1 week after the control measurement, the same
subjects were asked to walk, and the degree of tibial internal and external rotation over 10
seconds was measured. Two knee patterns of NJF were used: the knee extension-tibial external
rotation (E-ER) pattern and the knee flexion-tibial internal rotation (F-IR) pattern. Each
pattern was performed three times at random as a passive exercise and as a resistance
exercise. In the NJF intervention group, both proximal resistance and distal resistance were
performed by a physiotherapist.</p><p>For data processing, one gait cycle was randomly selected from all data. The relative
angular velocity was calculated from angular velocity. When the heel of the right lower limb
was on the ground, the angle of the knee joint was set at 0&#x000b0;. The maximum relative angular
velocities of tibial internal and external rotation were measured over one gait cycle.</p><p>Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for statistically
significant differences, and the factors were intervention and measurement (control or NJF).
If any significant interaction was found, a paired t-test was performed to compare the
outcome indicators before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS software
ver. 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The threshold for statistical significance
was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The maximum relative angular velocities of tibial internal and external rotation are shown

cycle, the degrees, and the maximum relative angular velocities of tibial internal and
external rotation. The degrees of tibial internal rotation were reduced, and the degrees of
tibial external rotation were increased by the NJF intervention. The control measurement
showed no change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, novel angular velocity sensors were used to calculate the relative angular
velocities of tibial internal and external rotation, and the immediate effects of NJF
intervention on the knee movement pattern were demonstrated by objective data.</p><p>Compared with that in the control group, the degree of tibial internal rotation was
significantly reduced in the NJF group, the degree of tibial external rotation was
significantly increased, and the time of a gait cycle was significantly decreased. These
results may be attributable to the improvement of periarticular muscle function by the
application of proximal resistance. The alignment of the knee joint capsule, the function of
periarticular muscles of the knee joint, and the knee position sense were improved;
therefore, the maximum relative angular velocities of tibial internal and external rotation
and the time of the gait cycle changed significantly.</p><p>These results suggest that NJF with proximal resistance training can be used as a novel
form of exercise to improve knee joint function and walking ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Huo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: Neuromuscular joint facilitation.
