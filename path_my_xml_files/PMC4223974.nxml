After the research project was approved by the ethical committee of the University and research permission was issued in nursing and midwifery, and taking a written informed consent, sampling was started. The subjects were &#x0003e;18 years of age, and more than 3 months had passed from their hemodialysis indication and they have had hemodialysis by sodium bicarbonate through permanent vascular access, with no history of active hemorrhage, acute cardiac failure, and active infection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] If a patient developed hypotension and experienced dialysis complications during dialysis or the dialysis time was less than 4 h due to any reason, his/her data were not entered for analysis, although all subjects finished the study. After obtaining permission from the related university and hospital and through extraction of patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics from their medical files, the patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after they signed a written consent form. This is a cross-over clinical trial which was conducted in two sequences of dialysis session as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>The patients were assigned to two 16-subject groups through random allocation. One group was randomly selected to undergo hemodialysis through the first sequence and the other group through the second sequence. The results of three types of treatments in each group and between the groups were then compared. There was no washout period between the methods.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Each subject was also considered as its control in the study so that all subjects underwent three treatment methods, through which confounding factors such as body mass index (BMI), weight, sex, and vascular access were controlled. Each patient underwent hemodialysis for four sessions[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] by the routine method in which the concentration of sodium was fixed at 138 mmol/L with a fixed ultra filtration rate and a dialysis solution flow rate of 500 ml/min.</p><p>Then, they underwent dialysis for four sessions by stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles in which the concentration of dialysis solution sodium was initially 146 mmol/L which was reduced step by step and reached 138 mmol/L at the end of dialysis, while the ultra filtration level was reduced based on the sodium profile automatically and step by step during dialysis. Finally, they underwent four sessions of stepwise dialysis solution flow rate profile in which dialysis solution flow rate was initially 800 ml/min which automatically and in a step-by-step manner decreased to 500 ml/min at the end of dialysis. To calculate <italic>Kt</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio in each session, patients&#x02019; and treatment-related data were entered in the dialysis device in each session, through which <italic>Kt</italic>/<italic>V</italic> was automatically calculated and recorded in the checklist, and the obtained results of each treatment method were compared. Patients&#x02019; BP was measured and recorded in the checklist before, during, and after dialysis. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. In order to have an identical intervention, all subjects underwent hemodialysis by B. Braun hemodialysis device (Dialog model) made in Germany.</p><p>The dialysis solution was sodium bicarbonate with a temperature of 36&#x000b0;C-37&#x000b0;C and a blood flow rate of 300-350 ml/min. Identical filters were used for each of the subjects during the study.

The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups through random allocation. During the study, 192 dialysis sessions were held for each group (384 sessions for both groups). Mean age of the subjects was 56-62 (16.75) years. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test showed no significant difference in subjects&#x02019; mean age between the two groups. The most common etiology in renal patients was hypertension (31.2%) and diabetes (28.1%). Chi-square test also showed no significant difference in subjects&#x02019; vascular access between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

There was no significant difference between the three treatment methods concerning BP measurements before, during, and after dialysis (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Repeated measure ANOVA and LSD <italic>post-hoc</italic> tests showed a significant difference in the mean scores of dialysis adequacy in the three treatment methods is each group. Mean score of dialysis adequacy in the routine method was 1.239 (0.25), which was less than 1.407 (0.26) in stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles and 1.414 (0.25) in stepwise dialysis solution flow rate profile (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but the mean scores of dialysis adequacy showed no significant difference in the two profiles (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Therefore, using methods that can enhance dialysis adequacy is very essential. The obtained results showed that stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles and stepwise dialysis solution flow rate profile can improve dialysis adequacy in patients, compared to the routine method. Regarding stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles, Song <italic>et al</italic>., in their study on 11 patients undergoing hemodialysis with various stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles, concluded that sodium stepwise profile accompanied with stepwise ultra filtration profile resulted in prevention of hypotension during dialysis, better functioning of ultra filtration, and preservation of dialysis adequacy.</p><p>In their study, complications during dialysis occurred in 18 sessions in control (54.5%) out of 33 sessions, and in stepwise sodium and ultra filtration group, they occurred in 9 sessions (27.3%) out of 33 sessions, which showed a significant difference between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of sodium and ultra filtration profiles on hypotension in eight patients undergoing hemodialysis with a fixed concentration of sodium and sodium and ultra filtration profiles, stated that application of the latter profile can prevent osmotic imbalance of body fluids and, consequently, leads to a more stable hemodynamic status.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Ghafourifard <italic>et al</italic>. comparing the effects of three combined methods of linear sodium profile and linear ultra filtration profile, stepwise sodium profile and stepwise ultra filtration profile, and routine method on BP changes, it was concluded that application of sodium and ultra filtration profile was a simple and cost-effective method bringing about a stable hemodynamic status in patients during dialysis.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Tang <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of sodium linear profile method in 13 patients undergoing hemodialysis and concluded that application of this method reduced hypotension during dialysis by 62%, although dialysis adequacy showed no significant difference in these sessions compared to the routine method. Different number of subjects in this study and the present study, the imposed profile, and the different number of sessions and types of dialysis devices can be the reasons for this difference.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Generally, sodium and ultra filtration profiles seem to cause patients&#x02019; hemodynamic stability during dialysis, so that the patient can tolerate dialysis better and dialysis adequacy increases. Abbass, in a study on 28 patients undergoing hemodialysis based on the level of dialysis solution flow rate in two groups with dialysis solution flow rate of 500 ml/min and 800 ml/min, respectively, reported a significant difference in the mean scores of dialysis adequacy in the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) as the group with 800 ml/min dialysis solution flow rate had a better dialysis quality.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Ouseph <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of increasing dialysate flow rate on urea mass transfer area, concluded that when the level of dialysis solution increased from 500 ml/min to 800 ml/min, the filtration clearance level increased by 5.7%, and when the increase of dialysis solution was from 300 ml/min to 400 ml/min, the filtration clearance level increased by 4.1%.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Ward <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on defining the effect of dialysate flow rate on dialysis adequacy in 42 patients undergoing hemodialysis in two groups of dialysate flow rate of 600 ml/min and 800 ml/min, respectively, showed no significant difference in the mean dialysis adequacy between the two groups[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), possibly due to difference in the length and number of sessions, use of different filters, and <italic>Kt</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio measurement in that study and in the present study. Azar (2009), in a study comparing dialysate flow rates of 500 ml/min and 800 ml/min with high-flux and low-flux filters, showed that dialysis adequacy increased in sessions with high-flux filters, but the mean scores of dialysis adequacy in sessions when the patients underwent hemodialysis with low-flux filters showed no significant difference.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Different subject numbers in the two methods of the above-mentioned study and the higher number of subjects undergoing high-flux filters could be the reasons for the different results obtained compared to present study. Hauk believes that other methods used to increase dialysis adequacy are expensive and the best option is to increase dialysate flow rate.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Meanwhile, Ward <italic>et al</italic>. believed an increase in dialysate from 600 ml/min to 800 ml/min imposes 25% increase in consumed water. Therefore, dialysis solution flow rate profile was used in the present study, so as not to fix the dialysis solution flow rate at 800 ml/min during 4 h of dialysis to economize water. In the present study, dialysis solution flow rate was initially fixed at 800 ml/min, and then reduced step by step to 500 ml/min. The results showed improvement of dialysis adequacy as dialysis solution flow rate profile is a simple method which, with a higher steep of flow, enhances urea distribution and increases the urea clearance. Increasing the dialysis solution flow rate can also increase ultra filtration leading to a better clearance of poisons in the blood, as an increase in ultra filtration level brings about poisons&#x02019; shift to dialysis solution.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Generally, it can be concluded that application of stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles can lead to a better hemodynamic status in patients and, consequently, patients&#x02019; better tolerance of hemodialysis. On the other hand, dialysis solution flow rate profile can cause more distribution of urea and a better clearance of poisons in the blood, and these two mechanisms improve dialysis adequacy. Therefore, application of stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profile and stepwise dialysis solution flow rate profile is suggested to improve dialysis adequacy. It is suggested to conduct this study with a higher sample size and more number of dialysis sessions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to all the patients participating in this study and the personnel in dialysis centers affiliated with Isfahan university of Medical Sciences, who cooperated with us in carrying out this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname></name><name><surname>Nicola</surname></name></person-group><article-title>IN Heamodialysis</article-title><source>Text book of renal nursing</source><year>2008</year><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>SN Bailliere Tindall</publisher-name><fpage>204</fpage><lpage>5</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Soltania</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Acharya</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adequacy of hemodialysis in Nepalese patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis</article-title><source>JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc</source><year>2009</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19529051</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lindley</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chamney</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Wuepper</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ingles</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tattersall</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Will</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A Comparision of methods for determining urea distribution volume for routin use in on- line monitoring of hemodialysis edequacy</article-title><source>Nephrol Dial Transplant</source><year>2009</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>211</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18697799</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Melsungen</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Medical Technology Division/B | Braun.
