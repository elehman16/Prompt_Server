These patients may have nasal or oral intubation, but, nasotracheal intubation (NTI) should be avoided in patients with the fracture of base of skull and comminuted midfacial fractures as there is always a risk of complications such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, meningitis, and communication of nasal cavity with cranial fossa.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, the surgical reconstruction of nasoorbitalethmoid (NOE) complex is hampered with the presence of nasotracheal tube.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, orotracheal tube interferes with maxillomandibular fixation (MMF), compromising the reduction, and stabilization in these fractures.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Another technique for airway control is the tracheotomy, which is considered by many as the preferred route for airway management in patients with complex maxillofacial fractures.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, it is generally associated with a significant number of intraoperative and postoperative complications, including tracheal stenosis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, damage to laryngeal nerves, tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and scarring.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Submental endotracheal intubation (SMI) is an alternative form of intubation through the submental route. Altemir first described this procedure as an alternative technique of airway management in patients with maxillofacial injuries.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It is usually carried out under general anesthesia with or without fiberoptic assistance. However, holding the mask firmly over the face during induction of general anesthesia is often responsible for the displacement of comminuted fracture segments of maxilla and nasal bones. Furthermore, posteroinferior displacement of maxilla parallel to inclined plane of skull base can block the nasopharyngeal airway and cause fresh bleeding.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Patient's cooperation during awake fiberoptic orotracheal intubation may avoid these potential problems besides making the conversion to SMI easier. Despite being an easy to learn technique, SMI may be troublesome in children, obese and those with thyroid swelling.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Till date, there is no study where the comparison has been done between awake and asleep SMI. Most of the studies have either not mentioned the status of the patients at the time of SMI or conversion has been done subsequent to full induction and relaxation of the patient, later to the awake oral intubation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Hence, the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of awake versus asleep conversion of oral to SMI. The investigators hypothesized that awake SMI may ease the process and avoid the complications associated with asleep SMI. The specific aims of the study were: (1) time taken for conversion, (2) overall success rate, (3) ease of conversion, and (4) complications (if any).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>To address the research purpose, the investigators designed and implemented this prospective randomized clinical study following institutional ethical clearance. The study population was composed of all the patients presenting for elective surgical correction of facial fractures in the maxillofacial department of a tertiary care hospital over a period of 2 years (2013&#x02013;2015). To be included in the study sample, patients had to be aged between 18 and 55 years, mid facial fractures including Le fort I, II, III along with NOE, and mandibular fractures. Patients were excluded as study subjects if they have neurological damage, subnormal intelligence, thoracic trauma, mouth opening &#x0003c;2 cm, and local anesthetic allergy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram showing the allocation and analysis of the participants (Source: Original)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-7-202-g001"/></fig><p>Twenty-four patients included in the study were randomly divided into two groups of 12 patients each, asleep fiberoptic-assisted SMI (Group G; <italic>n</italic> = 12) and awake fiberoptic-assisted SMI (Group A; <italic>n</italic> = 12) by computer generated random numbers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>) with allocations concealed in sealed envelopes. The primary outcome variable was time taken for conversion, while secondary variables were overall success rate, ease of conversion, and complications (If any). Patient's demographic characteristics such as age, sex, weight, ASA grading, thyromental distance, and interincisor distance were also measured.</p><p>Emergency Airway Kit including surgical tracheostomy was kept ready as the backup in case of failure which was then analyzed according to intention to treat to basis. Patients were premedicated with ranitidine 50 mg, glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, and dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg loading over 15 min followed by 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h intravenously in both groups until conversion to SMI. During the procedure, the Anesthesiologist used the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) to assess the level of sedation. If the RSS was &#x0003c;2, rescue doses of up to 20 mg propofol were administered.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique of asleep (General Anaesthesia) fiberoptic-assisted submental intubation</title><p>The procedure was explained to the patient. The patient was preoxygenated for 3 min followed by anesthetic induction with propofol 2 mg/kg/iv. After confirming bag-mask ventilation, relaxation was achieved with succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg to facilitate oral fiberoptic endotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Technique of awake fiberoptic-assisted submental intubation</title><p>The procedure was explained followed by psychological preparation of the patient in the preanesthetic clinic initially and then on the day of surgery. Anesthesia of the airway was achieved using nebulization with 4% lignocaine, superior laryngeal nerve block, and transtracheal instillation of 2 ml of 2% lignocaine. The total dose was calculated and kept well below the threshold to avoid any kind of toxicity. The oxygenation was continued at a flow rate of 5 L/min through nasal prongs. The fibreoptic bronchoscope, adequately lubricated with 2% lignocaine gel was mounted with size 8.0 mm ID flexometallic endotracheal tube (ETT) subsequent to confirmation of the easy removal of ETT connector. Oral fibreoptic bronchoscopy was attempted with Berman airway held between the incisors followed by intubation and confirmation with end tidal CO<sub>2.</sub></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Technique of submental intubation</title><p>Using an aseptic technique, skin infiltrated with local anesthetic followed by 1.5&#x02013;2 cm skin crease incision in the submental region at a distance one-third way from symphysis just medial to the lower border of the mandible. The side opposite to the fracture was preferred. The mouth was kept open using dental prop to expose the floor of the mouth. A curved artery forceps was then utilized for blunt dissection toward the floor of mouth till there is sufficient space for the placement of the tube. Dissection of the tissue layers such as subcutaneous fat, platysma, investing layer of deep cervical fascia and mylohyoid muscle was kept close the lingual surface of mandible to avoid any injury to lingual nerve, submandibular gland and its duct. After a thorough dissection, tube connector was removed, pilot balloon deflated, grasped with the artery forceps and pulled out of the floor of mouth in the submental region. Then quickly, artery forceps was once again inserted through the submental incision and the tracheal tube pulled out. The connector was then re-attached, the cuff reinflated and the tracheal tube reconnected to the breathing circuit. The position of the tube was confirmed and noted using capnography and auscultation. The time from incision to capnographic tracing was taken as &#x0201c;time to conversion,&#x0201d; and it was taken as the primary objective for the purpose of sample size calculation. Tube was fixed using silk (2/0) suture and a circumferential adhesive tape [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The ease of conversion of oral to SMI was graded as; Grade 1: Pilot balloon assembly easily grabbed and pulled, ETT end pulled out easily with dental prop but without manipulation, Grade 2: Pilot balloon assembly easily grabbed and pulled, ETT end pulled out with dental prop but after manipulation in the form of tongue retraction, and Grade 3: ETT end cannot be pulled out. All SMI were done by the same anesthesiologist.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Shows submental intubation with endotracheal tube <italic>in-situ</italic> (Source: Original)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-7-202-g002"/></fig><p>At the conclusion of surgery, extubation through oral or submental route was dictated by the presence of MMF. In oral route, tracheal tube followed by pilot balloon was pulled intraorally. The submental incision was then closed with the interrupted sutures. Moreover, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg and injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg intravenously. The patient was allowed to regain consciousness and trachea was extubated after the return of protective reflexes and train of four of 0.9.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Sample size calculation on the basis that 50% change in mean conversion time would be a clinically relevant difference required the inclusion of 10 patients in each group (PS Power and Sample Size Calculator-Version 3.0.43; Dupont WD, Plummer WD, Department of Statistics of the Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA). Considering 10% dropout or failure, we included 12 patients in each group. The Type I error probability associated with this test, for the null hypothesis that there is no difference in conversion time of SMI between two groups was &#x003b1; = 0.05, while Type II error &#x003b2; = 0.8.

In our study, the overall success rate was found to be similar in both groups. However, conversion time and ease of SMI was found to be significantly improved in the awake technique.</p><p>Tracheostomy remains the option of choice when neither nasal nor orotracheal intubation is feasible.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, it is associated with significant morbidity and rarely mortality. Complications such as hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema, injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, tracheal stenosis, and postsurgical scar are sometimes associated with the procedure.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In the past few decades, a number of alternatives to tracheostomy have been proposed. In maxillofacial trauma which requires surgical reduction of nasal fracture or MMF, nasal tube switch to oral route can be done within few minutes without requiring extubation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Contrary to this, attempting nasal intubation in patients with frontobasilar fractures can lead to life-threatening complications such as intracranial introduction of tube, CSF leak, meningitis, or sepsis. Retromolar and SMI are another simple way to avoid NTI and interference with dental occlusion.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The SMI seems to be very suitable technique; apart from securing airway provides an unobstructed intraoral surgical field, avoids intra- and post-operative complications of tracheostomy, and overcomes disadvantages of NTI. Sch&#x000fc;tz and Hamed[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in their comparative study, between SMI and tracheostomy concluded that the SMI is associated with low morbidity and can replace tracheostomy in selected cases of maxillofacial trauma.</p><p>In this study, we compared the overall success rate which was similar in both groups, except two cases where tracheostomy has to be performed due to nasal bleed as a result of pressure by face mask during the process of general anesthesia. Fiberoptic intubation was not attempted in these two cases due to the presence of blood in the airway.</p><p>Ease of conversion from oral to SMI was easy in awake patients as compared to the patients under GA. This was probably because they followed the anesthetists command to pull the tongue in the mouth that allowed the easy manipulation of the ETT. None of the patients complained of any discomfort in the awake group or required additional sedation, which further suggest that the above-used doses of dexmedetomidine are sufficient for conscious sedation. In the GA group, even the dental prop and tongue retraction posed difficulty in grabbing the end of the ETT and pulling it out.</p><p>Similarly, conversion time to SMI was significantly shorter in awake patients. This again could be due to the cooperation of the patients during the conversion. Apart from this, inducing general anesthesia before securing the airway may cause displacement of comminuted fracture and may induce a fresh nasal bleed. To prevent such complications, one case report documents use of awake fiberoptic orotracheal intubation. However, they also converted oral to SMI under anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Literature shows that the complications of SMI are relatively rare and generally in the form of injuries to salivary gland, nerves such as lingual and marginal mandibular, infection, and unesthetic scars.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, accidental extubation, obstruction, and cuff damage are much more difficult to manage in cases of SMI. In this study, the pilot balloon assembly got damaged in one patient of the general anesthesia group during conversion to SMI, which was successfully replaced with the help of tube exchanger. Drolet <italic>et al</italic>. have successfully used ETT exchanger to facilitate SMI.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] There was no episode of desaturation (spO2 &#x0003c;90%) in any of the patients. The patients were followed up for 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Postoperative salivary fistula, as reported in the literature regarding the cases of prolonged ventilation was not seen in the present study.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The risk of sepsis or an abscess in the submental tunnel related to the passage of the possibly contaminated balloon and ETT during extubation is an important and dreaded complication, none of the patients in either group had such problem.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The scar remains healthy and not noticeable in any of the patients. Most of the patients were discharged in 2&#x02013;3 days postsurgery. However, the two patients with tracheostomy had a prolonged stay.</p><p>Despite these facts, our study has certain limitations, most of our patients had Le-Fort II fractures that does not involve the floor of mouth. All the patients were taken up on elective basis so the problem of edema of the airway and floor of the mouth associated with lower jaw fractures were not encountered. However, it can be a concern in patients of pan facial trauma posted as an emergent case.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Awake conversion of oral to submental endotracheal intubation improves the ease (&#x00394; = 53%) and decreases the procedure time.
