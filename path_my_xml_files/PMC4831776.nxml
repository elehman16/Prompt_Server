The primary aim of the present study was to compare performance 18 h after exhaustive cycling in a randomized diet-controlled study (175 kJ&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> during 18 h) when subjects were supplemented with protein plus carbohydrate or carbohydrate only in a 2-h window starting immediately after exhaustive cycling. The second aim was to investigate the effect of no nutrition during the first 2 h and low total energy intake (113 kJ&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> during 18 h) on performance when protein intake was similar. Eight endurance-trained subjects cycled at 237&#x000b1;6 Watt (~72% VO<sub>2max</sub>) until exhaustion (TTE) on three occasions, and supplemented with 1.2 g carbohydrate&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> (CHO), 0.8 g carbohydrate + 0.4 g protein&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> (CHO+PRO) or placebo without energy (PLA). Intake of CHO+PROT increased plasma glucose, insulin, and branch chained amino acids, whereas CHO only increased glucose and insulin. Eighteen hours later, subjects performed another TTE at 237&#x000b1;6 Watt. TTE was increased after intake of CHO+PROT compared to CHO (63.5&#x000b1;4.4 vs 49.8&#x000b1;5.4 min; p&#x0003c;0.05). PLA reduced TTE to 42.8&#x000b1;5.1 min (p&#x0003c;0.05 vs CHO). Nitrogen balance was positive in CHO+PROT, and negative in CHO and PLA. In conclusion, performance was higher 18 h after exhaustive cycling with intake of CHO+PROT compared to an isocaloric amount of carbohydrate during the first 2 h post exercise. Intake of a similar amount of protein but less carbohydrate during the 18 h recovery period reduced performance.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="25"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The project has no approval from Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethic, Norway for public deposition of the original data, and participants give no approval in signed consent form for public deposition of data.

It is well-documented that muscle glycogen is the major energy substrate during high intensity endurance exercise and it is also known that fatigue develops when muscle glycogen is depleted [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A high glycogen content in muscles is thus associated with improved performance [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and a repletion of glycogen stores is part of the recovery process after prolonged exhaustive exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Optimal glycogen repletion occurs with an intake of 1.2 g carbohydrate &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup> during the first hours and a total of 8&#x02013;9 g carbohydrate &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> during 24 h, which is now accordingly recommended [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Protein is normally not considered as an important energy substrate during exercise, although oxidation of leucine is known to increase during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, protein degradation is increased in glycogen-depleted muscles during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and protein breakdown continues in skeletal muscle after exercise if energy intake is not sufficient or if only carbohydrates are provided [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recovery of performance includes the removal and degradation of proteins damaged during exercise along with the proper resynthesis of proteins.</p><p>Dietary intake of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) after exercise reduces loss of amino acids from muscles and therefore spares muscle protein from degradation [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Intake of protein immediately after exercise has also consistently shown to increase protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], including synthesis of mitochondrial proteins [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while simultaneously protein degradation is decreased [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Importantly, it has been shown that protein intake in the early phase after intensive exercise stimulates protein synthesis more effectively than later [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When intake of proteins is combined with carbohydrate after exercise, activation of hypertrophic signalling molecules in skeletal muscles is achieved [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Protein intake is necessary for optimal recovery after exhaustive exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] requiring both glycogen and protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that the combination of carbohydrates with protein also increases the rate of glycogen synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite the proven effects of protein intake on protein synthesis rate, supplementation of proteins in addition to carbohydrates is not consistently associated with improved exercise performance. Several studies have reported that intake of protein after exercise improves subsequent performance [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] whereas other studies failed to observe such effects [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>These discrepancies may result from differences in the amount of protein supplied, its composition or that the exercise models used may not be adequate to detect the effects of protein intake on recovery of performance. Quite different protocols regarding intensity and duration prior to the diet intervention, and to assess performance after the intervention period have been used. An experimental design with similar exercise intensity prior to and after the diet intervention would represent a more appropriate approach for getting more coherent outcomes assuming that the physiological mechanisms causing fatigue during the initial bout of exhaustive exercise would limit performance capacity during the post exercise test.</p><p>In the present study, subjects were exercised to exhaustion at a load corresponding to ~72% VO<sub>2max</sub> (Watt<sub>72%</sub>), which depletes glycogen stores and such exercise has been used to demonstrate a positive effect of protein intake on recovery of performance [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The primary aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that protein/carbohydrate feeding during the first 2 hours after exhaustive exercise is superior to intake of an isocaloric amount of carbohydrate alone on recovery of performance 18 h later. Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, diet-controlled study in which subjects were given carbohydrate (1.2 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup>) or protein/carbohydrate (0.4 g/0.8 &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup>) during the first 2 h after exhaustive exercise with diet during the remainder of the recovery period standardized. Nitrogen balance, plasma glucose, amino acids and hormones were measured during recovery and an exercise performance test conducted the following day to determine whether changes in performance after protein intake immediately after exhaustive exercise are associated with distinct changes in energy and amino acid homeostasis.</p><p>To test the sensitivity of our protocol selected for investigating exercise performance recovery, we also investigated the effect of insufficient energy intake during recovery, which incompletely restores glycogen content [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, the second aim was to investigate if lack of energy intake during the first 2 h after exhaustive endurance exercise, and a ~50% reduction of total carbohydrate intake, reduces exercise performance after the 18 h recovery period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight male endurance-trained subjects using cycling as part of their weekly training participated in the study (age: 24&#x000b1;0.4 years; height: 182&#x000b1;3 cm; weight 75&#x000b1;3 kg; cycle training 2.9 &#x000b1;0.6 h weekly).

Subjects started at 100 or 125 W (Mean 109.4 &#x000b1; 6.6 W) and the load was increased by 25 Watt every 5 min. The final intensity was 237.5 &#x000b1; 9.4 W. VO<sub>2</sub> was measured on-line (Oxycon Pro; Jager Instruments, Hoechberg, Germany) over 1 min (from ~2.5&#x02013;4 min at each intensity level) and capillary blood samples were taken for lactate analysis (1500 Sport, YSI Inc., Yellow Spring Instruments Ohio, USA). The incremental test was terminated when the lactate concentration had increased &#x0003e; 2 mM. The mean lactate concentration at the final intensity level was 2.4 &#x000b1; 0.1 mM. Subjects selected a pedaling frequency between 85 and 95 rpm, and the self-selected pedaling frequency was used throughout the study. After 5 min of rest, maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was measured. Subjects started the VO<sub>2max</sub> test at the highest (last) load of the incremental test and intensity was increased by 25 W every 30 s until voluntary exhaustion. Maximal lactate concentration averaged 8.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 mM and RER was 1.11 &#x000b1; 0.02 at the end of the VO<sub>2max</sub> test. VO<sub>2</sub> was measured over 30 s periods, and the mean of the two highest measurements was defined as maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>). The subjects returned to the laboratory 2 to 4 days after the test of VO<sub>2max</sub> to complete a pretest in which subjects cycled 45 min at a load corresponding to ~72% of VO<sub>2max</sub>. This workload was calculated from the first incremental test (linear regression was used to establish the relationship between work and VO<sub>2</sub>). VO<sub>2</sub> was measured between 3&#x02013;5 min and the workload was adjusted to achieve a VO<sub>2</sub> corresponding to ~72% of VO<sub>2max</sub> (Watt<sub>72%</sub>). The defined load (Watt<sub>72%</sub>) was used in all tests at both day1 and day2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Diet interventions</title><p>Subjects recorded their dietary intake over the last 24 h prior to the first intervention period and were asked to follow the same diet prior to the two other interventions. No exercise was allowed for a minimum of 24 h before the exhaustive bout of exercise before the dietary interventions. Before the three diet intervention phases (Day1), subjects completed an exercise block with cycling until exhaustion. Subjects reported to the laboratory at 13.30 h and prepared for exhaustive bouts of exercise starting at 14.00 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153229.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The training session was initiated with a 3 x 4 min warm up at 50, 55 and 60% of VO<sub>2max</sub>. Subjects then cycled at Watt<sub>72%</sub> until exhaustion in 20 min intervals with 5 min rest between intervals. Exhaustion was defined as when subjects were unable to maintain the desired pedal frequency (self-selected pedal frequency &#x000b1; 5 rpm) at the desired workload despite the third verbal encouragement to maintain the pedal frequency. After voluntary exhaustion, subjects were given 5 min of rest before completing a maximal number of 1 min intervals at 90% of VO<sub>2max</sub> with 1 min rest between intervals. This protocol has been reported to reduce glycogen level in <italic>m vastus lateralis</italic> to a very low level [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. VO<sub>2</sub> and RER were measured after 4 min of the first interval and during the last 2 min of all intervals for calculation of carbohydrate oxidation. Capillary blood samples were taken before the first 20 min interval, immediately after each interval, at exhaustion and immediately after the last 1 min interval for measurements of lactate (described above) and glucose (HemoCue Glucose 201<sup>+</sup>, &#x000c4;ngholm, Sweden). Heart rate was measured continuously (Polar RS800CX, Kempele, Finland).</p><p>After the exhaustive exercise session, a catheter venflon was inserted into antecubital vein and a blood sample (7 ml) was taken.

For the first two hour of the diet interventions the subjects received a drink containing either: 1) 1.2 g carbohydrate (CHO) &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup>, 2) 0.8 g CHO &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.4 g whey &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x000b7; h<sup>-1</sup> (CHO+PROT) or 3) similar flavored placebo without energy (PLA) in random order. The drink was supplied in equal portions every 30 min to obtain the energy level described. The CHO drink contained 85 g/L of glucose (Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) and 85 g/L maltodextrin (Carbo Flex Pure, Star Nutrition, Gymgrossisten Trollh&#x000e4;ttan, Sweden). CHO+PROT drink contained 56.5 g/L glucose and 56.5 g/L maltodextrin and 57 g/L whey isolate protein (Lacprodan, SP-9225 Instant, Arla, Aarhus, Danmark). PLA was water. All drinks contained 0.7 g/L NaCl and were flavored by 100 g/L Fun light (Stabburet, Norway). Drinks were served in opaque flasks and were indistinguishable by taste.</p><p>The first blood sample was taken before drink consumption, and capillary and venous blood samples were taken after15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of the recovery period as described above. Resting metabolic rate was measured after the blood samples were taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of recovery according to the following protocol: subjects rested on a bed for 10 min before a V2 mask was used to collect air for 10 min.</p><p>After the first 2 h of the recovery period (and RER measurements) subjects had a standardized meal (composed of pasta, grained meat and tomato sauce). Energy content of the meal (and all other meals) was adjusted to body weight with macro nutrient content of: carbohydrate, 2.08 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; protein, 0.59 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; fat, 0.27 g&#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> (55.4 kJ &#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>). The subjects returned to their homes with additional drink and evening food. During the CHO and CHO+PROT trials, subjects received a drink containing 1.2 g CHO &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> at 19.30 h, whereas PLA received flavored drink without energy. At 21.30 h, subjects had sandwiches with the following energy content: carbohydrate, 0.82 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; protein, 0.27 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; fat, 0.27 g&#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> (28.5 kJ &#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>). Water was allowed ad libitum. Subjects were not allowed to eat food other than that provided.</p><p>The following morning, subjects reported to the laboratory at 7.30 h and resting metabolic rate was measured. Subjects were not allowed to do any exercise for transportation to the laboratory, and rested 10 min in the bed before resting metabolic rate was measured as described. Fasted venous and capillary blood samples were taken and subjects received a light breakfast at 8 h. The breakfast had the following energy content: carbohydrate, 1.05 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; protein, 0.17 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>; fat 0.18 g&#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> (27.4 Total kJ &#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>). During the diet intervention CHO and CHO+PROT were isocaloric (175 kJ &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>), but protein intake during the 18 h of recovery was 1.03 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> and 1.83 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> in CHO and CHO+PROT, respectively. The CHO and PLA interventions had the same intake of protein (1.03 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>) during the 18 h intervention, but carbohydrate intake was 7.55 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> and 3.95 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> in CHO and PLA, respectively. The study was designed with similar total energy intake in CHO and CHO+PRO during the 18 h recovery. Protein intake was higher in CHO+PROT (1.83 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>) than in CHO (1.03 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup>) with carbohydrates substituted for protein in CHO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153229.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Protein intake was the same in CHO and PLA, but carbohydrate intake was reduced by 48% in PLA compared to CHO.

CHO+PROT supplementation immediately after exercise increased plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, BCAA and a number of other amino acids. CHO supplementation also caused increases in plasma glucose and insulin, but the concentration of many amino acids decreased, probably caused by insulin effects on amino acid removal from plasma. Nitrogen balance during the recovery period was positive after intake of protein immediately after exhaustion (CHO+PROT), but was negative in CHO despite that 1.03 g protein &#x02219; kg body weight<sup>-1</sup> was provided during the 18 h recovery. Reducing the intake of carbohydrates (PLA) during the recovery period resulted in a more negative protein balance and reduced recovery of performance compared to CHO. Our results suggest that CHO+PROT during the first 2 h of an 18 h recovery period accelerates repair of protein function and possibly resynthesis of muscle glycogen stores [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] resulting in improved exercise performance at the end of recovery. Limiting carbohydrate intake during recovery also adversely affected recovery, and this may be related to the inability to recover sufficient muscle glycogen stores [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the present study cycling time to exhaustion after 18 h of recovery was longer after CHO+PROT supplementation compared to CHO, when the same workload (Watt<sub>72%</sub>) was used to induce exhaustion prior to dietary intervention and during the performance test the following day. The effect of CHO+PROT intake during the first 2 h after exhaustive exercise was convincing as all 8 subjects performed best after intake of CHO+PROT compared to both CHO and PLA. The findings of improved performance after ingestion of protein combined with carbohydrates immediately after exhaustion as compared to carbohydrates only are in line with those of several other studies using time to exhaustion as the performance test [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Saunders et al. also showed a dramatic effect of protein intake when subjects cycled to exhaustion at 75% VO<sub>2max</sub> and 16 h later used cycling to exhaustion at 85% VO<sub>2max</sub> to test recovery of performance [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, Ferguson-Stegall et al. found a significant increase in cycling time trial performance after 4 h of exercise recovery when a CHO+PRO supplement was provided as compared with an isocaloric CHO supplement or placebo [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, co-ingestion of protein with carbohydrate after exercise has not always been found to have a positive effect on recovery of performance [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, Rowlands et al. found a positive effect of protein supplementation post exercise on recovery of performance in some [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but not in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Berardi et al. also reported improved performance after CHO+PROT compared to CHO in one [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] but not in another study [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several reasons may explain the differences, which may include the type of exercise before the recovery period, the type of post-recovery performance test, the duration of the recovery period, and the amount and type of protein consumed.</p><p>The initial glycogen content is a determining factor for time to exhaustion at intensities of ~70% of VO<sub>2max</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and protein intake in combination with carbohydrate during the early phase of recovery has been shown in some studies to produce a higher rate of glycogen synthesis compared with carbohydrate intake alone [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, muscle glycogen was not measured, but plasma insulin tended to be higher in CHO+PROT compared to CHO whereas glucose concentration was higher in CHO compared to CHO+PROT during the first 2 hours of recovery suggesting a greater rate of glucose clearance and possibly glycogen synthesis during the CHO+PROT for this time period [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, there are no data supporting higher glycogen content 18 h after exhaustive exercise when fed CHO+PROT compared to isocaloric CHO. Resting RER normally correlates with glycogen stores [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and resting RER was higher in CHO than PLA as expected [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and resting RER was similar in CHO and CHO+PROT groups suggesting similar glycogen content. Assuming a glycogenolytic rate of ~1.0 mmol&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup> during cycling at ~ 72% VO<sub>2max</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the 14 min longer cycle time achieved in the CHO+PROT group would require that the glycogen content was higher by around 14 mmol&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>, which seems unlikely on isocaloric diets.</p><p>Blood glucose concentrations were reduced after the exhaustive exercise before the dietary interventions and at the end of the performance tests after the three dietary interventions. A decline in blood glucose normally stimulates glucagon secretion [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and plasma glucagon was elevated at exhaustion prior to the diet interventions. During the first 2 h of the diet interventions, glucagon dropped in CHO and CHO+PROT in conjunction with the increase in plasma glucose concentration, as glucagon remained elevated in PLA where plasma glucose remained low. During the performance test (Day2), plasma glucagon increased in CHO+PROT and PLA as expected. Surprisingly plasma glucagon did not increase in CHO. Indeed, blood glucose decreased to a similar level at exhaustion among all dietary interventions and it is not obvious why glucagon remained low in CHO during the exhaustive exercise. FFA increased similarly during the performance test for all dietary interventions, but the increase in FFA was less in CHO compared to CHO+PROT and PLA after exercise, which may indicate that carbohydrate availability at exhaustion was higher in CHO compared to CHO+PROT and PLA.</p><p>Exhaustive exercise promotes protein degradation and protein degradation continues after exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Intake of carbohydrate after exercise slows protein degradation [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas a positive protein synthesis can be obtained when protein is ingested [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study, subjects were in positive nitrogen balance after CHO+PROT despite higher plasma ornitine and citrulline during the first 2 h of recovery and higher total urea excretion. On the other hand, nitrogen balance was negative after CHO and PLA, and more negative in PLA than in CHO despite similar intakes of protein, supporting carbohydrate consumption immediately after exercise spares muscle protein by reducing protein degradation [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, the concentrations of BCAA and many other essential amino acids increased immediately after intake of CHO+PROT as expected [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which prevents loss of amino acids from muscles [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are not degraded in skeletal muscle and their release is used as a surrogate marker for protein degradation, but venous plasma data are difficult to interpret, and both amino acids increased in CHO+PROT whereas plasma phenylalanine remained similar in CHO and PLA.</p><p>Intake of protein immediately after exercise has consistently been shown to increase protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and gene transcription is dramatically influenced by this protein intake [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has been shown that protein intake in the early phase of recovery, as done in the present study, stimulates protein synthesis more pronounced than when provided later [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Amongst the BCAA, leucine plays a prominent role as it stimulates protein synthesis via activation of mTOR [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Importantly, intake of proteins together with carbohydrate after exercise increases activation of hypertrophic signalling molecules in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and stimulates synthesis of both myofibrillar and mitochondrial proteins [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The positive nitrogen balance after CHO+PROT may have resulted from both reduced protein degradation and increased protein synthesis, whereas the negative nitrogen balance in CHO and PLA results from a higher protein degradation compared to protein synthesis. The negative nitrogen balance suggests a catabolic state, and the nitrogen balance status has previously been suggested to determine performance outcome after dietary interventions [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our results, moreover, clearly indicate that a substantial amount of dietary protein is warranted soon after exhaustive exercise and for the remainder of the day. The daily protein requirement for endurance athletes has been reported to be 1.6 g &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which is twice the recommended daily allowance for the average young adult. During the complete recovery period (18 h), CHO and PLA received 1.03 g protein &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> and nitrogen balance was negative, whereas CHO+PROT received 1.83 g protein &#x000b7; kg<sup>-1</sup> and nitrogen balance was positive, agreeing with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>We designed our study so that the workload (Watt<sub>72%</sub>) during exhaustive cycling was the same both days assuming that the physiological mechanisms causing fatigue during the initial bout of exhaustive exercise would determine performance capacity during the post exercise test. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid as the metabolism in recovering muscles may change. Even though subjects cycled to exhaustion at the same workload prior to and after the different dietary interventions, fatigue may have resulted from different mechanisms for the two performance tests. The mechanisms resulting in exhaustion during prolonged cycling at 72% of VO<sub>2max</sub> is not well defined, but deletion of the mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase in mice skeletal muscle impairs endurance exercise capacity dramatically [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Branched chain amino acids are mainly metabolized in skeletal muscles [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and protein intake immediately after exercise increases leucine oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indeed, plasma valine was higher in CHO+PROT than in CHO prior to the performance test and it would have been attractive to speculate that mitochondrial function was better after intake of CHO+PROT compared to CHO. However, there were no significant differences in substrate selection during the performance test andthe concentrations of plasma lactate and amino acids did not differ between CHO and CHO+PROT. Skeletal muscles have a net uptake of glutamate during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and glutamate is a major contributor to Krebs cycle intermediates, particularly &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate. Plasma glutamate decreased during the performance test (Day2), but the statistical power was low and there was no treatment effect. However, the fact that exhaustion occurred faster in PLA and CHO than in CHO+PROT indicates a faster decline in glutamate in PLA and CHO compared to CHO+PROT. Since glutamate is a major contributor to Krebs cycle intermediates we speculate that fatigue may have been associated with a decline in key Krebs cycle intermediates due to a decline in plasma glutamate.</p><p>In the present study, time to exhaustion was much longer prior to the dietary interventions despite the exercise intensities being similar for both cycling tests. The cycling was performed as 20 min intervals prior to the dietary intervention to reduce mental effort, but was continuous after dietary intervention, and therefore time to exhaustion cannot be compared directly. However, Hermansen et al. found similar glycogenolytic rates during continuous cycling and cycling at 20 min intervals [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and we have in a pilot study seen that time to exhaustion is similar with intervals and continuous cycling (Jensen, unpublished). Our results, therefore, suggest that recovery of muscle function during the 18 h recovery period was incomplete even with high intake of protein.</p><p>Another interesting finding in the present study was that plasma uric acid increased after the exhaustive exercise prior to dietary interventions and more so in PLA compared to CHO and CHO+PROT during the recovery period. Uric acid is the product from AMP and GMP (pyridines) degradation and xanthine oxidase catalyses the final reaction where xanthine is converted to uric acid under formation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Several studies have reported that uric acid increases after exhaustive exercise [<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153229.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], but this is the first study to report that dietary intervention after exercise influences uric acid levels. Of note, plasma uric acid remained higher in PLA compared to CHO and CHO+PROT the day of the second cycling performance test and therefore nucleotide degradation may have been elevated during PLA. However, creatinine excretion was similar suggesting that degradation of phosphocreatine was unchanged and markers of muscle damage (CK, LDH and myoglobin) only varied minimally and were not influenced by the dietary interventions. These results suggest that recovery of performance was not linked to muscle damage or degradation of ATP/phosphocreatine system.</p><p>A major strength of the present study was that diet was controlled strictly during the whole recovery period and training and diet were controlled the last 24 h before the subjects entered the three dietary interventions. The present study was also randomized, double-blinded and conducted on well-trained subjects accustomed to forceful exercise and cycling training, which minimized the risk of lack of motivation and learning effects influencing the outcome. The study was demanding for the subjects with 6 exhaustive exercise sessions within 3 weeks, but the subjects remained highly motivated before all performance tests. Furthermore, motivation scores did not show a treatment or time effect and time to exhaustion was rather similar prior to the three interventions. A limitation of the study is that we did not take muscle biopsies and therefore there was no data on muscle glycogen or other metabolites/signalling molecules/mRNA, which could have helped explain differences in recovery performance. However, muscle biopsies were avoided to improve the quality and reproducibility of the performance tests. Another limitation in the present study was that a resting blood sample was not taken prior to the first exhaustive exercise bout or a fasted blood sample after a day without exercise.</p><p>In conclusion, intake of protein in combination with carbohydrate during the two first hours after exhaustive exercise results in a better and faster recovery of performance as compared to intake of carbohydrate only. The positive nitrogen balance observed in the CHO+PROT group provides evidence for an increased protein synthesis rate. Reducing carbohydrate intake during the recovery period, while maintaining protein intake, reduced time to exhaustion and caused a more negative nitrogen balance. Our results thus suggest that intake of protein immediately after exhaustive exercise stimulates recovery, which improves performance 18 h later. Ingestion of carbohydrate is also beneficial as opposed to fasting post exercise, potentially due to increasing muscle glycogen stores, reducing protein degradation or both.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Concentrations of organic acids in fasted condition the day after exhaustive exercise and diet interventions, and during and after the performance test.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Intake of macro nutrients during the 18 h of recovery during the three dietary interventions.</title><p>Subjects were supplied with standardized diet according to body weight.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Resting VO<sub>2</sub>, RER and carbohydrate oxidation during the first 2 hours recovery after ingestion of CHO, CHO+PROT and PLA.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Plasma amino acids after exhaustion before diet intervention and fasting morning values after the three diet interventions.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Plasma organic acids at exhaustion prior to the dietary interventions and the following morning (Day 2).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153229.s006"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Plasma LDH, CK and MYO after exhaustive exercise and during the recovery period and after the performance test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153229.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Astrid Bolling and David H&#x000e5;kensen for assistance with the experiments.
