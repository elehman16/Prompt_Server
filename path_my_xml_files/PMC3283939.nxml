Several problems, however, have been associated with the use of non-resorbable barrier membranes including the possibility of membrane contamination and/or infection and the need for a second surgical procedure for membrane removal. Several investigations have indicated that the outcome of GTR procedures can be affected by bacterial contamination of the non-resorbable devices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Furthermore, the removal of the membrane is associated with increased morbidity for the patient, time consuming, and can interfere with the maturation of the regenerated tissues during an early and delicate stage of healing. In addition, the optimal timing of resorbable membrane removal has not been unequivocally determined as the healing time and maturation time of hard tissues varies from individual to individual.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Research has led to the development of a second generation membranes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref>, which have certain advantages over first generation membranes such as enhanced biocompatibility, cell occlusiveness, tissue integration, semi-rigidity; thus space making, improved clinical manageability, and most importantly, resorbability, and therefore, eliminating the need for surgical removal of the membrane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Many studies done on human and experimental animals have demonstrated the formation of new attachment following guided tissue regeneration therapy in intrabony defects, class II furcations and recession defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In the present study, an attempt has been made to regenerate the lost periodontium in infrabony periodontal defects in human mandibular molar areas using a semi-rigid, resorbable membrane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The sample of the study included eight patients, seven males and one female, with bilateral and angular defects. Patients were treated in a split mouth design, and were followed-up for a period of six months. Two different approaches for the treatment of deep intrabony defects were compared in this randomized controlled clinical trial. The test group was treated with a semi rigid bio-resorbable barrier membrane<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref>, and the control group was treated with open flap debridement. Randomization was done using toss of coin method.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subject population</title><p>Following scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instructions, eight patients with good general health, volunteered to participate in this study with the age group of 30-55 years were selected.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

</p><p>In each patient, bilateral intraosseous predominantly one-walled defects located at the interproximal area were identified. Furthermore, the defects did not extend in to the interproximal region and the involved teeth were not carious, mobile, or non-vital. Baseline plaque scores (Silness and Loe 1964) were in the range of 0-1, and the patients were not under any medication for the past six months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>GTR membrane material</title><p>Membrane was made using poly lactic acid (PLA), poly glycolic acid (PGA), and lactide/glycolide copolymer (PLGA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Radiographic analysis</title><p>Intra-oral periapical (IOPA) radiographs were standardized by extended cone paralleling devise<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">&#x02021;</xref> with plastic grids, and the tube head angulation, the x-ray unit setting for kVP, mA was adjusted. Radiographs were scanned using a transmission scanner and subjected to volumetric analysis using AutoCAD 2000 software. The scanned images were enlarged uniformly to twice the original dimension for the ease of measurement and the area of interest was demarcated digitally so that the difference between pre- and post-operative radiographs could be easily compared and calibrated. Images were demarcated by drawing a line from the apices of teeth adjacent to the defect, line is continued coronally, parallel to the two roots, and then through the bottom of defect. This gives a quadrangle. Pre- and post-operative changes in the area of the quadrangle were calculated, and the difference gives defect fill. A Periodontist, who was unaware of the test and control radiographs, did the analysis. Further, a single examiner analyzed all the radiographs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Acrylic stent fabrication</title><p>A stone cast was prepared after the maxillary and mandibular impressions, and occlusal stents of clear auto polymerizing resin were fabricated by &#x02018;sprinkle-on method&#x0201d; for both test and control sites. Grooves were made at the suspected defect site near the interdental region so as to guide the UNC-15 probe. A reference marking was drawn on each stent at the lower border so as to get accurate and reproducible measurements at the time of surgery and subsequent re-entry at the end of six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>After local anesthesia, crevicular and inter-dental incisions were placed, followed by envelope flap preparation. Then full thickness mucoperiosteal (envelope) flap was elevated. The interdental papillae were preserved at all sites, as it allows for better coverage of the material interproximally. Pocket epithelium was excised to leave a fresh connective tissue bed in contact with the membrane material. The surgical site was debrided and root planing was done. The acrylic occlusal stent was placed and the measurement of the defect was recorded by using UNC-15 probe from the bottom of the defect to the fixed point on the stent [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Before placing the membrane at the defect site, a sterile surgical template was applied [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] and approximated for extensions onto the buccal and lingual aspects and trimmed accordingly. The membrane was removed from the sterile package and it was compared to the trimmed surgical template, reduced to the required dimensions. The membrane was now carefully tweezed through the interproximal contact area. The buccal and lingual extensions of the membrane were now inserted under the buccal and lingual flaps, so as to rest on sound bone [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. After the placement of the membrane, 4-0 vicryl sutures (absorbable) were used to close the flap with interrupted simple loop sutures were placed after the flap was taken as coronally as possible. A periodontal pack<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">&#x02020;</xref> was applied to the site and left for seven days. Post surgical instructions were given and patients were prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg, thrice a day, for five days, and analgesic, ibuprofen 400 mg, twice daily, for three days.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pre-operative measurement of depth of defect at the test site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Tin foil template on defect site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Membrane in place</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Procedure for surgical re-entry</title><p>At the end of six months, surgical re-entry was performed under local anesthesia on both the test and control sites, and measurements were recorded with the help of acrylic stents and UNC-15 probe.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean relative attachment levels (RAL) of both test and control sites at baseline was 8.12 mm [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].

However, most of the conventional periodontal therapies have resulted in unsatisfactory repair due to the rapid proliferation of gingival epithelium. After Nyman <italic>et al</italic>. reported findings on new attachments including bone and connective tissue by using a barrier to exclude epithelium from the defect sites; GTR therapy has been widely used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The membrane used in the study has special characteristics including interconnective porous structure which promotes good nutrient flow and blood vessel formation, cell occlusiveness, and biodegradability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>A number of GTR membranes have been evaluated in furcations and three-walled defects. Very few studies have been carried out in one-walled defects because the probability of regeneration is limited due to the inherent anatomical characteristics. The particular design characteristics of the membrane used in our study were conducive for one-walled defects. Hence, these defects were chosen and evaluated in our study.</p><p>In this present study, the clinical evaluation included two parameters namely, RAL and DOD. Both of these were measured using a UNC-15 periodontal probe and a customized acrylic occlusal stent which served as a fixed reference point. The fabrication of a groove in the stent for placement of the probe in the desired probing locations offer the advantage of providing a fixed reference point apico-coronally and mesio-distally.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Surgical re-entry at six months in both test and control sites was carried out to assess the efficacy of respective treatments. The re-entry which was performed along with a customized acrylic stent allowed the visualization of residual intrabony defects for the assessment of the amount of bone fill [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. This enabled accurate measurements of the levels of bone fill, but did not provide information about the level of new attachment, which can only be assessed through histometric analysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The distribution of the data obtained from the results showed a wide range of defect fill. Some defects appeared to have a substantial fill, compared to others. This was in accordance with a study conducted by Mellado <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The mean gain in RAL at test sites, after six months was 1.75 mm, while the control sites showed a statistically insignificant gain. However, it was found that the gain in RAL in the test group was statistically significant, when compared to the control groups.</p><p>The mean reduction in depth of the defect at test sites was 2.63 mm was achieved, which is in correlation with other studies by Christgau <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>], Garrett <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and Stavropoulos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] This gain in resolution of osseous defects is attributed to characteristics of the resorbable membrane such a tissue integration, cell occlusivity, clinical manageability, space making, and biocompatibility. A marginal gain was achieved at the control sites which could be due to natural regeneration.</p><p>Radiographic assessment of the hard tissue was done using the AutoCAD software, where the region of interest was demarcated on the scanned radiograph, and comparison was made with the demarcated images and percentages of defect fill/loss were analyzed [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>]. Using the above described radiological parameters, we found mean percentage defect fill in the test group was 15.54%, which is comparatively lesser than 39% of defect fill achieved by Cortellini, Piniprato and Tonetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The lesser defect fill percentage can be attributed to the fact that the above mentioned authors (clinicians) in their study had a longer follow-up study duration of 12 months, whereas this present study was followed and re-entered in a short span of time (six months).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Pre-operative radiograph of test site between 45 and 46</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g012"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Post-operative radiograph of test site between 45 and 46 at 6 months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g013"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Pre-operative radiograph of control site between 35 and 36</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g014"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Post-operative radiograph of control site between 35 and 36</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-393-g015"/></fig><p>From the results obtained we conclude that:</p><p>
