Written informed consent was obtained. Four were dropped from the trial as they were found to have depressive catatonia. One group received true ECT (thrice weekly, n=8) plus oral placebo while the other received sham ECT plus risperidone (4-6 mg/ day). Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was administered twice weekly to assess improvement in catatonic symptoms over a period of three weeks. The two groups were compared using two-way RMANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title> Results:</title><p>BFCRS scores reduced markedly over treatment course and this reduction was more profound in the ECT group (p=0.035). Shorter the duration of illness greater was the response (lower scores of BFCRS).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title> Conclusions:</title><p>Superior clinical efficacy of ECT over neuroleptics in catatonia is confirmed by this randomized clinical trial.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Electroconvulsive therapy</kwd><kwd>catatonia</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
