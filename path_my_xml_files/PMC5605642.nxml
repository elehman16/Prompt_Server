OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox Cosmetic; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) is approved for the treatment of glabellar lines (GL) in more than 70 countries, including Japan, and for the treatment of crow&#x02019;s feet lines (CFL) in more than 50 countries, including the USA and countries in the European Union.</p><p id="Par7">The efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of CFL has been demonstrated in trials conducted in predominantly non-Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In these trials, improvement in CFL severity with onabotulinumtoxinA treatment was evaluated using the Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, it has been noted that Asian facial skin has increased dermal thickness, collagen content, and melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and assessment of CFL morphology in Asian subjects has shown slightly different CFL pattern prevalence compared with predominantly Caucasian subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For these reasons, the FWS with Asian Photonumeric Guide (FWS-A) was designed to provide clinicians with a standardized, static method for assessing the severity of facial lines in Asian subjects. The present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA compared with placebo in Japanese subjects with moderate to severe CFL, with severity investigator-assessed using the validated FWS-A.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par8">This 13-month, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comprised 2 treatment periods: a 6-month placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a 7-month open-label period. Two doses of onabotulinumtoxinA (24 and 12 U) were evaluated for the treatment of moderate to severe CFL. These doses were compared with placebo in treatment period 1 (up to day 180), which consisted of an initial treatment (day 1) followed by up to 1 additional treatment. In treatment period 2 (starting on study day 180), all subjects received either onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U or onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U (up to 3 re-treatments) to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated treatments through the end of the study (day 390). All subjects could receive up to 5 total treatments based on meeting re-treatment criteria. The onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U doses were administered in a double-blind manner throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Treatments</title><p id="Par9">Eligible subjects were randomized at the day 1 visit to 1 of the following 4 treatment groups in a 2:2:1:1 ratio for treatment periods 1 and 2: onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U/onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U, onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U/onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U, placebo/onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U, or placebo/onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U. Subjects were assigned a randomization number (not disclosed to the study center), and randomization was stratified by baseline CFL severity at maximum smile. The study drug was packaged and labeled with kit numbers; each kit contained 1 vial of study drug. An interactive voice or web response system designed by Allergan Data Management provided a specific kit number for each subject, and the study center administered treatment. The same procedure was followed during subsequent study visits. During treatment period 2, subjects who received onabotulinumtoxinA in period 1 continued to receive the same treatment dose, and subjects who received placebo in period 1 received either onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U or onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U, as determined on randomization at day 1. Each treatment comprised a total of 6 intramuscular injections in the lateral aspect of the orbicularis oculi (3 injections per side; 0.1&#x000a0;mL per injection site). Two alternative treatment patterns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were available to the investigators, who selected a pattern based on the subject&#x02019;s pattern of CFL and on their own clinical judgment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Alternative injection patterns for treatment of crow&#x02019;s feet lines. <bold>a</bold> The first injection was in the orbicularis oculi at the level of the lateral canthus, at least 1.5&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;cm temporal to the lateral canthus and just temporal to the lateral orbital rim (marked as AX). The second injection was 1.0&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;cm above this first injection site, at an approximately 30&#x000b0; angle medially (marked as BX).

Additional efficacy endpoints based on the investigator-assessed FWS-A included the following: the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 1-grade improvement in CFL severity at maximum smile and at rest (responders) at day 30; the duration of effect, defined as the median time until loss of efficacy (from responder to nonresponder in treatment period 1 for day 30 responders), using the following FWS-A responder definitions: CFL severity of none or mild at maximum smile, at least a 1-grade improvement in CFL severity at maximum smile, and &#x02265;1-grade improvement in CFL severity at rest; and responder analyses at time points other than day 30 of treatment period 1.</p><p id="Par15">Several subject-reported outcomes were also assessed. The subject&#x02019;s global assessment of change in CFL (SGA-CFL) was evaluated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). On the self-perception of age (SPA), subjects reported if they perceived themselves as looking their current age, older than their current age, or younger than their current age. Subjects&#x02019; perception of the effect of their facial lines on their appearance was assessed using specific items from the 11-item Facial Line Outcomes (FLO-11) Questionnaire including the psychological impact items 2 (&#x0201c;look older&#x0201d;), 5 (&#x0201c;look less attractive&#x0201d;), and 8 (&#x0201c;look tired&#x0201d;). Responses were based on a scale wherein 0 indicates &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; and 10 indicates &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d;; responders were subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement for items 2 and 5 and at least a 3-point improvement for item 8. Subject Assessment of Satisfaction with Appearance was based on a 5-point scale (1&#x000a0;<italic>=</italic>&#x000a0;very unsatisfied; 5&#x000a0;<italic>=</italic>&#x000a0;very satisfied), and a responders were defined as subjects who rated their satisfaction as improved (ie, from neutral or worse at baseline to very satisfied or satisfied after treatment). Satisfaction with treatment was assessed by the Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire (FLSQ) overall satisfaction item. Responses were based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02212;2 (very dissatisfied) to +2 (very satisfied); responders were subjects who were &#x0201c;mostly&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very&#x0201d; satisfied. Finally, subjects&#x02019; perception of onset of effect was assessed by asking subjects at weeks 1 and 2 if they noticed an improvement in CFL appearance; those who answered yes were asked when (in number of days) the improvement was first noticed.</p><p id="Par16">Safety measures were adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), physical examination, urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential, and neurologic assessments (focused symptoms questionnaire and focused neurologic examination).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="Par17">Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population (all subjects who were randomized) and safety population (all subjects who received &#x02265;1 injection of study drug).

Between-group baseline and demographic comparisons were performed using the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test. For the FWS-A, FLO-11, satisfaction with treatment (FLSQ), and satisfaction with appearance, the comparison of the proportion of responders was performed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test stratified by baseline CFL severity at maximum smile.

</p><p id="Par29">Four subjects (1 with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U; 2 with onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U; 1 with placebo) experienced events that were identified as possible spread of toxin: blurred vision (1 subject each with onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U and placebo); eyelid ptosis (1 subject with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U); and muscular weakness (1 subject with onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U). Safety adjudication of each event determined that the events of blurred vision and eyelid ptosis in onabotulinumtoxinA subjects were local events consistent with the known pharmacology of onabotulinumtoxinA, while the events of blurred vision (with placebo) and muscle weakness (with onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U) did not represent the distant spread of toxin.</p><p id="Par30">Two subjects were discontinued from the study after receiving onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U because of TEAEs considered unrelated to study drug (back pain and angina pectoris). No subject died during the study. Seven subjects experienced a serious TEAE (2.0% [3/151] with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U, 2.1% [3/143] with onabotulinumtoxinA 12 U, and 1.0% [1/97] with placebo). None of the serious TEAEs were considered to be related to the study drug by the investigators. No clinically meaningful findings were reported from the neurologic assessment. All subjects were negative for neutralizing antibodies at baseline and at the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">In this pivotal phase 3 study of onabotulinumtoxinA in Japanese subjects, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U and 12 U for up to 5 treatments over 13&#x000a0;months was effective in reducing the severity of moderate to severe CFL. Improvements were observed as early as week 1 of treatment 1 and throughout both treatment periods. Overall, the results indicate that a greater proportion of onabotulinumtoxinA-treated subjects experienced improvement in the appearance of their CFL compared with placebo subjects, by all responder definitions, as assessed by the investigator using the FWS-A. The magnitude and time course of effects of onabotulinumtoxinA on responder rates for improvement in CFL severity, as assessed at maximum smile, was consistent over both treatment periods. Indeed, the proportion of responders in treatment cycle 3 was similar among treatment-naive subjects and those who received onabotulinumtoxinA in treatment period 1.</p><p id="Par32">Subject-assessed satisfaction and perception of improvement were consistent with the assessments of the investigators. Significant differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U vs placebo) in the duration of effect and in the SGA-CFL and SPA favored onabotulinumtoxinA, as reported by subjects; this underscores the clinically meaningful benefit experienced by onabotulinumtoxinA-treated subjects. These results were complemented by significant improvements in the level of satisfaction with appearance and satisfaction with study drug treatment in onabotulinumtoxinA-treated subjects versus placebo subjects. In addition, the median duration of effect with onabotulinumtoxinA treatment was consistent with that reported in previous studies of CFL treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Repeated treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 and 12 U, with up to 5 treatment cycles over 13&#x000a0;months, was safe and well tolerated, with no new safety findings or cumulative deleterious effects. Few TEAEs considered related to treatment, serious TEAEs, or discontinuations because of TEAEs were reported. This safety profile was consistent and reproducible across treatments.</p><p id="Par34">The proportion of subjects achieving CFL severity of none or mild at maximum smile with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U at day 30 (68.3%) is consistent with that observed in a phase 3 study conducted in non-Asians (66.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Duration of effect based on the responder definition of none or mild in CFL severity at maximum smile was 95&#x000a0;days in this study of Japanese subjects and 118&#x000a0;days in the previous non-Asian study. Duration of effect using the definition of at least a 1-grade improvement at maximum smile (118&#x000a0;days) was consistent with findings from the non-Asian study (125&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in Japanese subjects has been demonstrated for the treatment of glabellar lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our results, along with the established efficacy for treatment of glabellar lines, reinforce that onabotulinumtoxinA is a safe and effective esthetic treatment in Japanese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Certain study limitations deserve mention. Because of the frequency of re-treatment, the number of subjects in each treatment group decreased considerably after day 90, potentially limiting data interpretation beyond day 90. Additionally, only placebo-controlled treatment 1 in treatment period 1 was analyzed to assess the duration of effect. Because the study design allowed re-treatment to occur without a required return to baseline and as early as day 90, the duration of effect may have been shortened.</p><p id="Par36">In conclusion, results indicate that repeated treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA (24 and 12 U) is effective and well tolerated in improving the appearance of CFL by reducing CFL severity at maximum smile in Japanese adults, with no new safety findings identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Emily H.
