Training of informal caregivers can significantly affect the quality of care to these patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective:</title><p>The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two caregiver training strategies on prevention of bedsores among bedridden patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods:</title><p>The study was carried out in Chandigarh. The study center was at PGIMER, Chandigarh. Seventy-eight bedridden patients being taken care in their homes were identified. These were randomly allocated into two groups. Group A received Prevention Package I, i.e., self-instruction Manual (SIM), training, and counseling. Group B received Prevention Package 2, i.e., only SIM. All these patients were followed up periodically for 1 year. During each follow-up, patients were observed for bedsore development. Braden scale was used to assess the risk factors of bedsores. Katz scale was used to evaluate the level of functional dependence of patients. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage reduction of number of patients at risk of bedsore development as per various domains of Braden Scale was more in Group A as compared to Group B on each successive visit. There was 100% improvement in mobility level in the patients who were totally dependent in both the groups. However, in moderately dependant patients, the improvement in mobility level was more (87%) in Group A as compared to Group B (75%). All the caregivers complied fully with instructions postintervention.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Training of caregivers for the prevention of bedsores among the bedridden patients was effective in improving the practices of the caregivers and also in reducing the risk factors of bedsores.

By 2026, the number of elderly people would raise to 173 million.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As the age advances, there is decline in physical functions. The person becomes susceptible to various health problems. Many remain bedridden in the last years of their lives. Apart from this, many young people also become bedridden due to various problems such as posttraumatic paralysis.</p><p>Bedsores are the most prevalent wound among the bedridden patients. These are caused by unrelieved pressure over the bony prominences.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] More than 80% of the bedridden patients ever develop bedsores.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The incidence varies from 0.4% to 38% in hospitals and 2.2%&#x02013;23% in long-term care settings.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Bedsores are one of the most costly and physically debilitating complications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Because of the scarcity of hospital beds, many bedridden patients are provided care by the family caregivers in their home care settings. Although the disabled enjoy a better quality of life when they are cared for at home, however, the quality of care provided by the informal caregivers is questionable. They are usually untrained and unprepared to new roles and responsibilities and lack basic knowledge about care provision. Hence, they are constantly challenged to solve problems and make decisions as per the needs of the patients.</p><p>The extent of the problem can be minimized if the family caregivers are trained on simple measures to prevent and manage bedsores. Pressure-induced injuries start developing within 1&#x02013;2 h of pressure exposure. Repositioning the patient every 2 h and making use of various comfort devices such as pillows, hand rolls, cotton rings, the alternating air mattresses, etc., have been shown to reduce the development of bedsores. Majority of the studies regarding the prevention of bedsores have been carried out in hospital settings.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>No study is available on the efficacy and impact of home-based care of bedridden cases on the incidence and natural history of bedsores in India.

It involves the assessment of the patient on six parameters, i.e., "sensory perception," "moisture," "activity," "mobility," "nutrition," and "friction and shear." The maximum score is 23, and the minimum score is 6. The patient is considered to be "at risk" of developing bedsore if the score is between15 and 18, at "moderate risk" if the score is 13&#x02013;14, at "high risk" if the score is 10&#x02013;12 and at "very high risk" if the score is 9 or less.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Self-instructional manual on prevention of bedsore</title><p>A self-instructional manual (SIM) in two languages (English and Hindi) containing the information regarding the prevention of bedsore was developed after reviewing the appropriate literature.

Following this, the prevention plan was discussed with the caregivers and implemented. The patients included in Group A received Prevention Package I (PP1), i.e., SIM, training, and counseling. The various components involved in training included positioning the patient, changing the posture of the patient, changing the bed sheet and clothes of the patient, feeding the patient, etc. The caregivers were counseled and encouraged regarding the need of regular care of the patient. The patients included in Group B received Prevention Package 2 (PP2), i.e., only the SIM.</p><p>The caregivers were advised to change the bed sheet of the patient daily, to perform the range of motion active and passive exercises at least twice in a day, and to change the position of the patient every two to three hourly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Follow-up</title><p>All the patients and the caregivers were informed regarding the frequency of follow-up visits at the time of enrollments.

Once developed, these could be difficult to treat. They often result in pain, disfigurement, prolonged hospitalization, and additional costs. In such patients, mortality is considerably high due to complications if these are not managed timely and effectively. Hence, prevention of bedsores is always better than treating the complications associated with it. Prevention is a key intervention that is neither novel nor expensive. However, it is still ignored in the most clinical settings as evidenced by approximately 10% incidence of bedsore reported in bedridden patients admitted in top ranking hospital.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Basic nursing care has a definite potential to save the thousands of patients and the caregivers from unnecessary harm.</p><p>In Indian settings, the majority of the stable bedridden patients are managed in the homes only. Hence, the informal caregivers have an important role to play in the care provision to such type of patients. It increases the responsibility of the family caregivers. They have to spend a significant amount of time in providing care and interacting with their patients. A wide range of activities is to be undertaken by them. An analysis of knowledge, attitude, and perception of the caregivers regarding care of bedridden patients in the home care settings will help in devising strategies to improve the care of such patients. There is very little research on this issue. One important concern is lack of training of caregivers on proper care practices for bedridden patients. Although they provide extraordinary uncompensated care to the bedridden, they often feel untrained and unprepared to carry out the task of care giving.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] As such, hardly, there is any caregiver training programs to train the caregivers. Thus, a need was felt to prepare an educational intervention package to enhance the knowledge and skills of the caregivers regarding proper care provision for prevention and management of bedsores.</p><p>Assessment of risk factors among the bedridden patients is one of the important strategies to prevent the development of bedsores. If the patients are assessed for the risk of development of bedsore, its incidence can be reduced.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the current study, Braden scale was used to assess the risk factors of bedsores among the patients. The patients were categorized as having high risk of developing bedsores and low risk of developing bedsores as per the Braden score of &#x02264;9 and &#x02265; 10, respectively. The high-risk patients turned independent (mobile) in their activities of daily living (ADL) postintervention and reduced in number from baseline to the end line visit. Although the intervention was training of the caregivers regarding prevention of bedsores, the purpose of using Braden scale was to objectively assess the risk factors of development of bedsores among the bedridden patients included in the study.</p><p>In moderately dependent patients, the improvement in mobility level was in more number of patients in Group A than Group B, i.e., 87% versus 75%, respectively. However, at 11<sup>th</sup> follow-up visit of the patients in Group A, it was observed that more number of patients had "impaired" mobility with Braden Score &#x0003c; 9. That could have been the probable reason for more number of the patients in Group A who developed Grade I bedsore as compared to Group B. At the last follow-up visit, none of the patients in either group had bedsore.</p><p>Position change in the bedridden patients is recommended after 2&#x02013;3 h.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In fact, the prolonged pressure on an area for more than 2&#x02013;3 h causes disturbances in the nerve impulses and causes decreases in blood supply. It diminishes the nutrition to that particular part which leads to necrosis and ulcerations. The caregivers in the current study were trained in all the domains such as providing active and passive exercises, proper positioning of the patients, regular inspection of the bony prominences, providing high protein diet, and gently massaging over the bony prominences. They complied fully with all these instructions postintervention. The results are supported by similar other type of studies carried out in other countries.</p><p>A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out by Moya and Morisonto see the effectiveness of home-based educational program in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers in adults with progressive neurological conditions. The sample constituted 100 caregivers of these clients. There was a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcer from 7% before educational program to 5% posteducation.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another study was carried out by Eljedi <italic>et al</italic>. to determine the effectiveness of an educational program on a family caregiver's prevention and management of pressure ulcers of bedridden patients after discharge from hospital. The study revealed effectiveness of this educational-training program in managing and preventing pressure ulcers for bedridden patients by caregivers at their homes. It was recommended that application of this preventive program should be extended to cover all the rehabilitative and governmental hospitals of the region to reduce the burden of pressure ulcers on the families and the health-care system.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Alhosis <italic>et al</italic>. have also emphasized that the implementation of the educational program for caregivers showed a remarkable increase and improvements of the caregivers&#x02019; knowledge regarding preventive measures of pressure ulcers. The various preventive measures were skin care, positions, nutrition, and exercises.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Farrell and Dempsey[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] point toward that written prevention protocols for education of patients, family, and health-care personnel are crucial to reduce or eliminate factors contributing to the development of pressure ulcer. The study of Wilson and Williams.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] approved the benefit of the patients&#x02019; educational materials such as pamphlets and brochures to teach patients about the prevention and care of skin and pressure ulcers in urban hospitals, home care agencies, and public clinics in the Midwest in the United Kingdom. Bours <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] recommended the use of guidelines for prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers as importance of changing position every 2 h, well-balanced nutrition, use of support surfaces, and effective implementation of these guides to prevent pressure ulcers. Tetterton <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of delivering high-quality, easily accessible geriatric education, and training program for direct care providers and other practitioners to prevent and treat pressure ulcers. Evaluation of the program revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers from 1996 to 2000. Another RCT has shown that the use of alternating-air mattress or a water bed lowers the incidence of pressure ulcers by more than half among the hospitalized patients.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Both the interventions in the current study were effective in improving the ADL of the patients. Before intervention, the majority of the patients had limitation specifically in activities such as bathing, toileting, and transferring in both the groups. In our study, comparatively more number of patients became independent in Group A, the caregivers of whom were given the personal training along with self-care manual. Hands on training usually have a better and a long-lasting effect. The dependency level of the patients in Group B also improved as the caregivers of these patients too was given the self-care manual, and the regular follow-ups might also have its own contribution in improving the health status of the patients. This indicates the need for training of caregivers for homecare of bedridden patients.</p><p>Our results signify that two types of efforts are needed for the training of caregivers, i.e., preparation of SIM, and one-to-one training. Here, package A is more labor intense as it involved one-to-one training and counseling in addition of distribution of SIM. Package B involving the distribution of SIM only was also reasonably effective. Hence, health-care administrators may decide as per the resources available to adopt a particular type of strategy.</p><p>It is recommended that various educational interventions regarding care of bedridden patients should be planned and implemented in the hospital itself to be taught to all the caregivers of bedridden patients to minimize the incidence of bedsores in the home care settings.</p><p>The current study has a limitation that there was no control group with the routine care. It is further recommended that three group designs may be taken up in the future research.</p><sec id="sec2-19"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-20" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><source>National Institute of Social Defence.
