the recovery of lumbosacral sagittal alignment (LSA) and in the control of low back pain.
[Subjects and Methods] A total of 102 chronic low back pain patients were divided into two
groups, a physical therapy group and a sling exercise group. In both groups, programs were
conducted thrice a week for twelve weeks. With respect to LSA, pelvic tilt (PT), sacral
slope (SS), and pelvic incidence (PI) were measured with plain radiography. Pain was
measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). [Results] Differences were found in visual
analogue scale, delta score of visual analogue scale, pelvic tilt, delta score of pelvic
tilt, and delta score of pelvic incidence between sling exercise therapy and physical
therapy groups. VAS, pelvic tilt, and pelvic incidence was positively changed after sling
exercise. However, only the visual analogue scale was found to be improved after physical
therapy. [Conclusion] Sling exercise therapy and physical therapy were effective in
reducing pain. However, pelvic tilt and pelvic incidence were positively changed after
sling exercise therapy for Lumbosacral Sagittal Alignment, but were unchanged after
physical therapy. Therefore, sling exercise therapy is more effective than physical
therapy for the recovery of Lumbosacral Sagittal Alignment in patients with chronic low
back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sling exercise</kwd><kwd>Lumbosacral</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 80&#x02013;90% of Koreans experience low back pain (LBP) at least once during their
life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, acute low back pain
(ALBP) can be cured in 10&#x02013;12 weeks with conservative treatment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, 60&#x02013;75% of patients who recover from acute back pain
experience recurrence, and 7&#x02013;10% of those have somatoform disorders caused by chronic low
back pain (CLBP)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported
that to reduce LBP, exercise therapy for muscle strengthening of the lumbosacral area is
more effective at stabilizing the pelvis than conservation physical therapy or
pharmacotherapy, which could be considered passive treatment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy is based on scientific knowledge, and clinical
practitioners in various medical sectors perform medical activity, using field specific
knowledge. They also offer medical services of attending to initial cues from their
patients, assessing the medical conditions, and managing the treatment of patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that sling exercises may reduce
pain by increasing the intervertebral disc space<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, LBP may recur and increase when the muscular strength of
the lumbosacral area is weakened<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
sling is a device with a swaying rope that is used to reduce the individual&#x02019;s weight load,
similar to performing exercises in water<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, the active research area has found that normal spinal alignment is more effective
than the recovery of muscular strength for patients with CLBP.</p><p>Spinal alignment is represented by pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS) and pelvic incidence
(PI). PI is a constant parameter that is an important anatomic factor for sagittal balance
regulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. If spinal alignment is
above the normal range, pain can be caused by localized compression in vertebra joints and
intervertebral discs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the recent
increase in sedentary lifestyle, the lumbosacral-pelvic sagittal alignment (LSA) of average
individuals is above the normal range and there has concurrently been an increase in
LBP<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was conducted to
observe how sling exercise therapy affects the lumbosacral alignment (LSA) and pain in
patients with CLBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients who did not get spinal surgery or did not have a
fracture, tumor, inflammation, and metabolic disease in HO hospital which is located in
Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.</p><p>The patients were divided into a sling exercise group (SEG, n=53), whose mean age, height,
weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 49.5 &#x000b1; 10.6&#x02005;years, 165.9 &#x000b1; 8.6&#x02005;cm, 64.9 &#x000b1; 13.6&#x02005;kg,
and 23.3 &#x000b1; 3.1&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and a conservation physical therapy group
(PTG, n=49), whose mean age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 50.5 &#x000b1;
9.1&#x02005;years, 164.5 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm, 61.6 &#x000b1; 7.0&#x02005;kg, and 22.7 &#x000b1; 1.3&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.
There were no significant differences between groups with respect to baseline
characteristics. All patients read and signed informed consent forms in accordance with the
ethical standard of the Declaration of Helsinki. The two treatment programs, consisting of
sling and conservation physical therapy, were conducted thrice a week for twelve weeks. The
sling exercise program was based on a lumbar stabilization exercise that works on part of
the trunk, and a pelvic stability exercise series that consisted of six movements:
trunk-pelvis stretching, a hip-trunk bridging exercise, a pelvic tilting exercise (anterior,
posterior, lateral side), a lower crossed exercise, a trunk rotation exercise, and an
oscillating trunk-pelvis exercise. These were carried out in the supine position. Each
action was performed 10&#x02013;15 times for one set and the set repeated three times, there was a
90-second rest period after each set. In the event of pain or muscle paralysis, exercise was
suspended. Each action was described to the patient verbally. In addition, a superficial
heat pack was applied for 15 to 20 minutes. This was followed by five minutes of ultrasound
treatment (SM-250, Samson Med, Seoul, Korea) at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz using a
five&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> in ultrasound head at an intensity of 1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> in
continuous mode. Patients received 15 to 20 minutes of Interferential Current (IFC)
treatment (SM-850P, Samson Med, Seoul, Korea) at an intensity of 25 mA. When patients felt
that they needed extra exercise 15 to 20 minutes of traction treatment less than 50% of
bodyweight was also given. Finally, light walking at a speed of 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;km/h for less than 10
minutes was allocated to the patients. The PI was measured with plain radiography
(R-630-150, Dongkwang, Korea) of the lumbar region and magnifying the images 3 times by
using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS; Infiniff, Korea). Each patient
underwent a 30 &#x000d7; 90&#x02005;cm lateral radiograph of the lumbosacral region, with the individual
standing, knees extended, and arms flexed in front. Radiographs were printed on acetate.
Care was taken to ensure that the radiograph included both femoral heads. If the femoral
heads did not overlap in the radiograph, the midpoint of the line connecting the isocenter
of both femoral heads was taken as a reference point. The pelvic incidence (PI) was defined
as the angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral plate and the line connecting the
midpoint of the sacral plate to the bicoxofemoral axis. The PI is a morphological parameter,
which stays constant, independent of the spatial orientation of the pelvis. The sacral slope
(SS) corresponds to the angle between the sacral plate and the horizontal plane, and SS is a
positional parameter, varying according to pelvic positioning. The pelvic tilt (PT)
corresponds to the angle between the line connecting the midpoint of the sacral plate to the
bicoxofemoral axis and the vertical plane. Like the SS, the PT is also a positional
parameter.</p><p>The degree of low back pain is measured with the VAS, which was developed in 1974 by
Huskisson<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects check the degrees
of subjective pain on a 10&#x02005;cm line, on which 0&#x02005;cm indicates &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d;: at the left end and
10&#x02005;cm indicates &#x0201c;very severe pain&#x0201d; at the right end. The VAS score is determined as the
measurement from the left side, with a higher score meaning more severe pain intensity. Data
were statistically analyzed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Program (version
22.0). All data using paired and independent t-tests were performed for intra and intergroup
comparisons of PI, PT, SS, and VAS. To evaluate the pre and post change rate in each group
the % delta score was calculated % delta score was calculated, Statistical significance was
accepted at values of &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The VAS scores in the SEG were significantly higher than in the PTG before treatment

addition, SEG was significantly higher than PTG in delta score of VAS (p=0.000), while SEG
was significantly higher than PTG in PT (p=0.007). SEG had high delta scores of PT and PI

The reason of LBP is the change of L1 to S1 joint angle.
When it changes, the intervertebral disc is deteriorated and the spinal nerve could be
compressed which causes the spinal pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>ALBP caused by strain and sprain can be recovered in twelve weeks and the prognosis is
usually good<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, CLBP has a poor
prognosis, with long-lasting pain which has a bad influence on a patient&#x02019;s social and
psychological stability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to
maintain normal LSA, normal curvature and balance is needed in the sagittal plane. The
curvature normally takes the form of a cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar
lordosis. These curves reduce impact and aid the effective function of spinal muscle<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar lordosis (LL) is also closely related to SS and PI<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A decrease in lumbar lordosis is an important factor causing
various spinal diseases, and can lead to sagittal spinal imbalance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It causes pain in specific parts of body from local
pressure in lumbar intervertebral discs and spinal joints (Mac-Thiong). This kind of
structural problem is known to affect lumbosacral angle, and a lumbosacral angle above the
normal range is related to LBP<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the interventions aimed at normalizing spinal alignment in patients with CLBP, the
effects of laser, massage, and spinal manipulation therapy are temporary. Moreover, aquatic
therapy, magnetic therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound,
acupuncture, and Pilates were reported to have no effect or unclear effect<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise therapy does not help ALBP;
however, in CLBP it can reduce pain and improve function, in some cases even raising the
possibility of returning to work<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
exercise therapy, adding elasticity and weight to the rope sling exercise can be used in
various ways to stabilize the muscles and balance of a LBP patient. These methods can
relieve pain by stimulating improved proprioception in the neuromuscular system, helping to
maintains posture<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Twelve weeks of the
Neurac sling exercise, a vibration stimulus exercise using a hanging rope, helps to
stabilize the lower back and improve posture and balance in the CLBP patient<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, six weeks of sling exercises
and push-ups were more effective for LSA than sling exercises alone<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study shows that, doing sling exercises for twelve weeks is more beneficial in VAS,
PT, and PI than physical therapy. Sling exercises reduced VAS more than physical therapy.
VAS decreased more after doing sling exercises than after physical therapy. After performing
sling exercises the PT angle had decreased, but after physical therapy the PT angle was
either increased or without change. The PI angle increased after sling exercise; however,
after physical therapy the angle was either decreased or without change.</p><p>The average Korean LSA was reported as SS 38.1 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x000b0;, PT 11.0 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x000b0;, PI 48.5 &#x000b1; 10.9&#x000b0;<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there were some differences in
the angle of LSA by race. Caucasian SS 39.9 &#x000b1; 8.1&#x000b0;, PT 12.0 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x000b0;, PI 51.9 &#x000b1; 10.7&#x000b0;, Asian
SS 36.3 &#x000b1; 7.8&#x000b0;, PT 11.5 &#x000b1; 5.3&#x000b0;, PI 47.8 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x000b0;, and American SS 41.9 &#x000b1; 7.8&#x000b0;, PT 11.9 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x000b0;,
PI 53.2 &#x000b1; 10.3<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although in this study and those of Chung KH<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> and Z&#x000e1;rate-Kalf&#x000f3;pulos et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> there were differences of LSA between races, after sling exercises.
LSA recovered to normal values (SS 35.7 &#x000b1; 6.1&#x000b0;, PT 12.5 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x000b0;, PI 51.5 &#x000b1; 11.3&#x000b0;) in contrast
to physical therapy. Summing up the result of this and previous studies, sling exercises are
more effective for recovery of LSA than physical therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>EY</given-names></name></person-group>: Effects of the Hand Acupressure and Lumbar Strengthening Exercise on
