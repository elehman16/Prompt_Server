Although normal in infants, drooling usually stops when at 15&#x02013;18 months of age and is considered pathologic if present after age 4 years. The most common cause of sialorrhea is neuromuscular dysfunction; other causes are hypersecretion and sensory or anatomic dysfunction, eg, failure of lip closure or infrequent swallowing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-015">1</xref> In children with cerebral palsy and other neuromuscular conditions, drooling may be due to hypersalivation and/or oral motor dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-8-015">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-8-015">3</xref></p><p>The prevalence of moderate-to-severe sialorrhea in developmentally disabled individuals is estimated at 10%&#x02013;37%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-015">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-tcrm-8-015">6</xref> Among children with cerebral palsy who attended special schools, the incidence was 58% (93 of 160 children), 33% of whom drooled severely.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-tcrm-8-015">7</xref> In a survey of parents of 1437 children with cerebral palsy, 34% reported that drooling was an occasional problem, and an additional 16% found it to be a frequent problem, requiring daily changes of clothing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-8-015">8</xref></p><p>Complications of sialorrhea can be both physical and psychological and can have a negative impact on quality of life. Drooling can result in perioral chapping, irritation, and maceration, with secondary infection of the facial skin, dehydration due to chronic loss of fluids, and increased risk of silent saliva aspiration that can result in recurrent respiratory infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-015">9</xref> Moreover, drooling increases wetness, clothing odor, and social embarrassment; lowers self-esteem; and limits vocational opportunities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-015">9</xref> In the school setting, children may be unable to share books or computer electronics,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-015">1</xref> and levels of care and dependency may increase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-tcrm-8-015">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-8-015">11</xref></p><p>Treatment options explored to control drooling in children and adults include behavioral approaches, such as prompts to swallow or wipe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-8-015">12</xref> or preventing individuals from putting their fingers or objects into their mouths;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-015">13</xref> surgery to decrease salivary flow,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-015">14</xref> intraglandular injection of botulinum toxin type A,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-tcrm-8-015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-8-015">16</xref> and anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, glycopyrrolate, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, and scopolamine patches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-8-015">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-8-015">17</xref></p><p>Glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium bromide) is a synthetic quaternary ammonium anticholinergic agent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-8-015">11</xref> with poor penetration of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, as shown by the direct measurement of radiolabeled glycopyrrolate in anesthetized dogs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-tcrm-8-015">18</xref> thus reducing the ability of glycopyrrolate to cause central nervous system effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-8-015">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-8-015">20</xref> Glycopyrrolate was first approved for clinical use in 1961. Currently approved indications in the US include adjunctive treatment of peptic ulcer disease in adults and as a preoperative or intraoperative medication in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is used preoperatively to inhibit salivation and excessive secretions of the respiratory tract. Additionally, glycopyrrolate has been used for children with tracheostomies who have difficulty managing secretions. Off-label use of commercially available oral glycopyrrolate tablets has been shown to decrease drooling in children with cerebral palsy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-8-015">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-015">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-8-015">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-8-015">22</xref> However, these tablets require compounding to dose pediatric patients, and the highly variable pharmacokinetics of glycopyrrolate resulted in wide-ranging doses and adverse events, leading to treatment discontinuation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-015">9</xref> These findings have encouraged the development of a novel liquid formulation of glycopyrrolate, oral glycopyrrolate solution (1 mg/5 mL), providing more accurate pediatric dosing and titration. We have performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of this new formulation in managing problem drooling associated with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions in children. We also assessed the effectiveness of a training manual, designed to help educate patients and caregivers to identify adverse events (AEs) secondary to treatment with oral glycopyrrolate solution and to manage dosing regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Male and female patients weighing at least 27 lb (12.2 kg) and previously diagnosed with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or another neurologic condition associated with problem drooling were eligible for enrollment. Problem drooling was defined as drooling in the absence of treatment such that clothing became damp approximately 5&#x02013;7 days/week. Patients with oral feeding problems or who used a tube for feeding were included. Female patients of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test at the pretreatment visit and were counseled on the importance of not becoming pregnant.</p><p>Patients were excluded if their extent of drooling was wetness of the lips and chin but their clothes did not become damp on most days; if they had used glycopyrrolate liquid within approximately 24 hours of baseline; if they had used any anticholinergic or cholinergic medications prohibited by the protocol within three plasma half-lives of that medication prior to baseline; or if they had medical conditions contraindicating anticholinergic therapy or treatment with the study medication.</p><p>The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in full compliance with the World Assembly Declaration of Helsinki and its most recent amendments.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The initial treatment dose was calculated based on body weight and assigned at the randomization visit. The initial dose was 0.02 mg/kg three times a day, and was titrated according to schedule over a 4-week period to optimal response, with a maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg, three times a day, whichever was less. Since high-fat foods reduce the oral bioavailability of glycopyrrolate oral solution administered shortly after a meal, we advised that the test liquid be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals at 7&#x02013;8 am, 1&#x02013;2 pm, and 7&#x02013;8 pm. Parents/caregivers were instructed on how to measure dose levels using an oral syringe and a dosing cup; for patients with gastrostomy feeding tubes, Luer lock syringes were provided. The FDA-required training manual, which included the dose titration schedule, was provided to each parent/caregiver; it was also used to facilitate the recognition of AEs and the need for dose adjustments.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was responder rate, based on change in degree (severity and frequency) of drooling, as measured by parents/caregivers, using the modified 9-point Teacher&#x02019;s Drooling Scale (mTDS), which was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. The mTDS is scored from 1 (dry, never drools) to 9 (profuse: clothing, hands, tray, and objects become wet; frequently). At the request of the FDA, the primary endpoint was changed to &#x0201c;dichotomized mTDS,&#x0201d; which defined responders as those having an increase &#x02265;3 units on the mTDS.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Secondary outcome measures included daily mean parent/caregiver mTDS scores at weeks 2, 4, and 6; AUC analysis of all mTDS evaluations from screening to week 8; proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy; global assessments by the parent/caregiver, by patients deemed cognitively capable by the investigator, and by physicians, performed at week 8 or at the last visit, using a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) in response to the statement &#x0201c;This is a worthwhile treatment&#x0201d;; assessments using a modified Behavioral and Medical Rating Scale (mBMRS);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-8-015">23</xref> and tabulation and description of all AEs.</p><p>The mBMRS is a scale that measures the frequency of 28 prespecified symptoms at each study visit using a scale of 1 through 4, where 1 represents not at all; 2, just a bit; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much. This scale can be used by parents/caregivers to identify possible AE-related behaviors and physiologic effects in patients taking study drug. The mBMRS score at each visit was the average of nonmissing responses to the 28 symptoms; the score was calculated only if none of these symptoms was missing. The behavioral and symptom subscales of the mBMRS were the means of the first 12 and last 16 symptoms, respectively. A positive change reflected improvement, and a negative change reflected worsening.</p><p>We also assessed the effectiveness of the training manual, &#x0201c;Glycopyrrolate Liquid for the Treatment of Problem Drooling Associated with Cerebral Palsy or Other Neurologic Conditions in Children: For Parents and Caregivers of Patients,&#x0201d; to educate parents and caregivers about drooling. The most frequent AEs and the beneficial effects of glycopyrrolate oral solution in these patients were also identified.</p><p>Safety was evaluated by physical examination, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory test results, and urinalysis, assessed at baseline and at week 8 or study discontinuation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Prospective patients were screened within 3 weeks of dosing. Those receiving anti-sialogenic compounds or other medications with anticholinergic or cholinergic activity underwent a washout phase prior to baseline, beginning 8 days before randomization. Doses of study medication were titrated over a 4-week period to optimal response, after which patients remained on that dose for an additional 4 weeks.</p><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral glycopyrrolate oral solution or matching placebo oral solution (similar in color and taste) three times a day. During the first 4 weeks, doses were titrated weekly to the optimal tolerated response for each study participant, but not exceeding 1.5&#x02013;3.0 mg per dose based on weight, with the optimal tolerated dose reached by week 4. Five dose levels (0.02 mg/kg three times a day, 0.04 mg/kg three times a day, 0.06 mg/kg three times a day, 0.08 mg/kg three times a day, and 0.1 mg/kg three times a day) were evaluated. After the optimal dose level was reached, patients continued to receive the same medication and dose, for a total of 8 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>As patients receiving placebo would be expected to continue drooling chronically, caregivers of patients in this group were specifically encouraged to keep patients in the study until at least the end of the 4-week titration period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data from all centers were combined. All percentages were based on the total number of patients in each group (two-sided <italic>P</italic> values). Patients who dropped out before the end of the study had the lowest rank carried forward. All statistical hypothesis tests used a type I (alpha) error of 0.05. All statistical calculations were performed using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (v 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p><p>According to the statistical analysis plan, all patients who received at least one dose of study drug were to be included in the safety population, and all randomized patients were to be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of efficacy. In practice, two patients were randomized to treatment before the protocol was amended to set an upper age limit, and these patients no longer met the inclusion criteria. Thus, efficacy was assessed in a modified ITT (mITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who were within the age range of the final, amended protocol and received at least one dose of study medication. Consequently, these two patients were included in the analyses of safety but not of efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study was conducted between November 2002 and April 2007.

More than 85% of patients in this study had cerebral palsy, classified as spastic and quadriplegic; were developmentally disabled; had impaired speech; resided at home with a parent or foster parent/guardian; and had no history of oral glycopyrrolate use. In addition, both investigators and parents/caregivers assessed glycopyrrolate oral solution as superior to placebo in controlling drooling.</p><p>In this trial, the maximum recommended dosage of glycopyrrolate oral solution was 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg TID, whichever was lower, according to the dose titration schedule.

A positive change reflected improvement, and a negative change reflected worsening. The most common AEs observed with glycopyrrolate oral solution are related to its mechanism of action as an anticholinergic agent. Glycopyrrolate oral solution is contraindicated in patients with conditions that preclude anticholinergic therapy, including glaucoma, paralytic ileus, unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon, complications of ulcerative colitis, and myasthenia gravis; in patients taking solid oral potassium chloride; and in those with constipation or intestinal pseudo-obstruction.</p><p>Four prior studies have assessed glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea in children with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions; two were open-label,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-8-015">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-8-015">22</xref> one a retrospective review,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-8-015">8</xref> and one a prospective, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-015">9</xref> In the randomized trial, 39 children aged &#x02265;4 years were assigned to one of two dosage regimens based on weight. Children &#x0003c;30 kg were started at 0.6 mg, with weekly increases to 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg, whereas children &#x0003e;30 kg were started at 1.2 mg, with weekly increases to 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, and 3.0 mg. In that trial, commercially available glycopyrrolate tablets were ground up and placed into gelatin capsules. If the child could not swallow the capsule, the parent was allowed to take the capsule apart and place its powdered contents into the child&#x02019;s food. In that study, almost all children demonstrated a marked improvement in drooling. AEs also increasd as the dose increased, with 20% of the children stopping glycopyrrolate due to behavioral problems, constipation, excessive oral dryness, or urinary retention.</p><p>In children with cerebral palsy, neurodevelopmental delays may disturb lip closure, intraoral tongue suction, and swallowing, resulting in sialorrhea due to disturbed coordination of tongue mobility, not to hypersalivation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-8-015">24</xref> A recent meta-analysis of surgical management of drooling found most evidence to be of low quality and heterogeneous, with varying levels of success.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-015">14</xref> Use of botulinum toxin is not likely to supplant surgical treatment due to its temporary effects, but it may be useful in empirically selected candidates for durable surgical treatment of the major salivary glands.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-015">14</xref></p><p>Although the number of patients in this trial was small, most clinical studies of orphan drugs do not include large numbers of subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-8-015">25</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with glycopyrrolate oral solution significantly improves problem drooling in children aged 3&#x02013;16 years with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions. Using the mTDS as the primary outcome measure, children treated with individually optimized doses of glycopyrrolate oral solution showed a significantly better clinical response rate than did children who received placebo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank BelMed Professional Resources, New Rochelle, NY, for editorial support, with funding provided by Shionogi Inc.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-tcrm-8-015"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Robert S Zeller, MD, has served as an advisor to Shionogi Inc.
