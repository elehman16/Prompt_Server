Reviewers questioned the primary analysis method which yielded an LDL improvement of 8.9&#x02005;mg/dL for the GMC arm compared with usual care (p=0.03), and requested an alternative, and seemingly plausible but less powerful analysis that yielded an LDL improvement of 7.2&#x02005;mg/dL for the GMC arm compared with usual care (p=0.15). Thus, the interpretation of the intervention effect varied significantly depending on the analytic technique used. Based on this experience and others of a similar nature, clarification of methods available as well as analysis recommendations is warranted and may be useful, not only to statistical analysts, but clinical researchers evaluating longitudinal RCTs.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Longitudinal study designs</title><p>In many longitudinal RCTs, research participants are measured at the same follow-up measurement occasions and the number of follow-up occasions is small, for example, 2&#x02013;4. Typically, baseline outcomes are measured prior to randomisation. In analyses, baseline outcomes can be ignored, used to calculate change scores, used conditionally as covariates or can be part of the outcome response vector. In this design, how should baseline values be handled? Is the question of interest conditional, given one's baseline what is the difference in outcome between treatment arms, or is the question unconditional, what is the treatment difference in change? Or does it matter? These fundamental questions and their implications on the method of analysis were introduced over 50&#x02005;years ago in a sentinel paper by Lord<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> subsequently leading to the term &#x02018;Lord's paradox. In Lord's hypothetical example, the difference between the conditional and unconditional questions and how analyses are applied yielded different answers and statistical inference when applied to the same data set. In spite of extensive literature<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> for this type of data, there remains a lack of clarity in biomedical research applications regarding longitudinal statistical analysis.</p><p>As the issue is addressed here, a major complication requiring consideration in the analysis strategy of a longitudinal RCT is missing data. Attrition (dropout) or intermittent missingness occurs even in studies with few measurement occasions as we are addressing. Reducing the quantity of missing data in an RCT enhances the reliability of results;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> however, rarely is it possible to eliminate missing data completely? The assumptions and methods applied for handling missing data when analysing &#x02018;change&#x02019; in a longitudinal RCT can greatly affect the robustness, validity and power of results and need to be clearly understood.</p><p>The general consensus in the statistical literature for a longitudinal RCT is that the conditional approach, that is, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), is the most powerful and robust method<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> to address the fundamental questions of interest. We take this view, and elaborate on its implementation, taking into account the additional complication of missing data, and enumerate the benefits of unconditional constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) models, illustrating that they generalise the ANCOVA approach in the longitudinal trials&#x02019; setting.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Analysis strategies</title><p>In a longitudinal RCT of the type addressed here, the outcome of interest is measured at each of the defined assessment periods of the trial (each participant in each arm of the trial). In this setting define the outcome as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013096ileq1.jpg"/></inline-formula> , the assessed value at each time point, t for each individual i (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013096ileq2.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In its simplest form, a longitudinal RCT is a pre/post-type of study where there are assessments at two time points, one pre-treatment baseline, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013096ileq3.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and one post-treatment, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013096ileq4.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>In the more general longitudinal RCT study design with multiple but few follow-up time points, response profile modelling<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> also known as mixed model repeated measures<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> is generally used as it allows for arbitrary patterns in the mean responses over time (ie, time is dummy coded) as well as for the covariance of responses and can be used for fitting ANCOVA, cLDA or longitudinal data analysis (LDA) models. From a modelling perspective, the pre-treatment baseline assessment can be viewed as either a fixed predictor of post-treatment outcome or as an outcome assessment. For the former, the conditional ANCOVA approach yields estimates of treatment differences over time given the observed baseline values where post-treatment outcome measurements are the response variables. For the latter, an unconditional model (LDA or cLDA) yields estimates of treatment differences unconditionally, and in the context of a longitudinal RCT, both the pre-treatment and post-treatment outcome measurements are response variables.</p><sec id="s1b1"><title>Conditional versus unconditional models</title><p>A fundamental difference between a conditional or unconditional analysis is in the modelling of the pre-treatment assessment. In unconditional analysis, baseline is part of the response vector requiring additional assumptions for modelling baseline. In an LDA, there are no modelling constraints on the baseline; separate baseline means are assumed and fit for each randomised group. The general test used for treatment difference over time in LDA is equivalent to a change score type of analysis; comparing change from baseline to follow-up between randomised groups. In contrast for cLDA baseline means are constrained to be equal between the randomised groups; a common baseline mean is assumed and fit across randomised groups. In an RCT, baseline precedes any treatment deliverance and under expectation the baseline means are equal. The test for treatment difference over time in the cLDA is essentially equivalent to a test for treatment difference in an ANCOVA when no outcome data are missing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

The estimation procedure used in the mixed model framework for longitudinal analysis yields unbiased estimates of parameters when missing outcomes are assumed to be ignorable, that is, when missing values are related to either observed covariates or response variables but not to unobserved variables.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

The estimated treatment differences diverge across analysis methods as well as statistical significance using a &#x003b1;=0.05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013096TB2">table 2</xref>). ANCOVA and SACS are equivalent to completers analyses, as the 38 cases with either a missing baseline or 12-month LDL-C are deleted. ANCOVA and cLDA methods no longer have equivalent estimates of treatment differences. All 233 participants contribute at least one measurement to cLDA analysis so that participants missing either a baseline or 12-month LDL-C contribute to estimated treatment difference of an 8.9&#x02005;mg/dL lower mean LDL-C at 12&#x02005;months in GMC compared with usual care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013096TB2">table 2</xref>). The discrepancy in the estimated treatment difference between ANCOVA and cLDA is due to missing data and assumptions that are made about missing data. As discussed previously, mixed-effect models yield unbiased estimates of treatment effects under the assumption that the missing data are conditional on observed quantities. Although this assumption cannot be specifically tested, the discrepancy in estimates between ANCOVA and cLDA model yields some evidence that data are missing conditional on observed quantities. If data were missing completely at random (not conditional on observed quantities) then estimated treatment differences between ANCOVA with case deletion and cLDA should be similar. Similarly, differences in estimates from the POST-only as well as LDA models between completers only and participants using all available data provide evidence that participants with missing observations may not be a completely random sample from the study population. Therefore, any analyses based on completers only (including the ANCOVA model) may be biased.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016013096TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>All available data (n=233 participants)&#x02014;pre/post analyses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome (Y<sub>t</sub> and/or C<sub>t</sub>)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMC</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Usual care</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMC vs usual care (95% CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-only</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months (Y<sub>12</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">204</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">96.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;6.9 (&#x02212;14.2 to 0.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SACS</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months<bold>&#x02212;</bold>baseline (C<sub>12</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">195</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;12.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;10.1 (&#x02212;22.0 to &#x02212;0.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ANCOVA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months (Y<sub>12</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">195</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">94.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;11.2 (&#x02212;19.2 to &#x02212;3.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.006</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDA*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline (Y<sub>0</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">233</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">96.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months (Y<sub>12</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">93.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;7.2 (&#x02212;17.2 to 2.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">cLDA*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline (Y<sub>0</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">233</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months (Y<sub>12</sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;8.9 (&#x02212;16.7 to &#x02212;1.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.03</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Baseline LDL-C is missing for 9 participants and 12-month LDL-C is missing for 29 participants.</p></fn><fn><p>ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; cLDA, constrained longitudinal data analysis; GMC, Group Medical Clinics; LDA, longitudinal data analysis; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; SACS, simple change score analysis.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>As shown for ANCOVA and cLDA, LDA and SACS methods estimated differences are discrepant due to missing data and assumptions that are made about missing data.

<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> on the inference and interpretations of results. In general, the implications of how missing data are handled in a trial range from sample size and statistical power loss to potentially biased estimates of treatment effects. Olsen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> discuss principled methods for handling missing data in longitudinal sleep disorder trials that are relevant to the types of longitudinal RCTs we are discussing. The default method for handling missing data in many software packages is case deletion; if any variable or outcome is missing for a participant, then the participant is deleted from analysis. In order for estimates of treatment effect differences to be unbiased when case deletion occurs, we have to assume that the subset of participants with complete data is a random sample of the entire study sample. Therefore, for ANCOVA, SACS and SPO analysis above, we are making this assumption. For many longitudinal RCTs it is likely that the probability of dropout is related to some observable characteristic or quantity (eg, treatment arm assignment) and therefore the subset of participants with complete data is not a random sample of the entire study. Under this assumption unbiased estimates of treatment effects can be achieved with mixed-effect models or by performing multiple imputation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Methods for handling missing data when we cannot assume that missing data can be characterised by observable quantities are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The choice of whether to use multiple imputation is up to the analyst and based on the untestable assumption that all predictors of missing data can be included in the mixed-effect model. In many longitudinal RCTs it is a reasonable assumption that treatment group assignment, time of assessment and available outcome assessments along with potential baseline stratification variables would be the predictors of missing outcome data. If the number of potential predictor variables of missing data is expansive and unreasonable to include in the mixed-effects model then it may be necessary to perform a multiple imputation analysis.</p><p>Multiple imputation is a more complicated process for handling missing data that is also based on the untestable assumption that all predictors of missing data are included in the imputation model.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the multiple imputation framework, comparisons of conditional and unconditional models would be equivalent to what was discussed above for no missing baseline or follow-up data. Once imputed data sets are created, there are no missing outcome data; the uncertainty from estimating imputed values is accounted for in the SE estimates.</p><p>For ease of implementation and robustness of results<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> mixed-effect models with maximum likelihood estimates are a good first-line choice for handling missing data. Even when applying mixed-effects models, the treatment of baseline values can impact results because of differences in case deletion. In the pre/post design if the baseline is a covariate (ANCOVA), participants with the missing covariate will be deleted. Similarly, with only one follow-up time, if the follow-up time is missing then there is no outcome data for the participant to be included. However, with unconditional models since both baseline and follow-up are part of the outcome vector, if a participant is missing either measurement, their available data will be included and participant is not deleted. When missing data occur and mixed-effect models are used, cLDA models are the optimal choice for providing the most precise estimate of treatment differences under a reasonable assumption that missing data are related to observable characteristics. Finally, it should also be noted that these methods will not diverge for every data set to which they may be applied to&#x02014;however as certain missing data assumptions cannot specifically be tested, cLDA models are the optimal choice across a range of conditions and data sets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Summary</title><p>It does not appear widely appreciated that cLDA can often be regarded as the method of choice for the analysis of a longitudinal RCT with few measurement occasions. Except for small samples it is equivalent to ANCOVA when there are no missing data, and cLDA is an appropriate generalisation of ANCOVA under reasonable missing data assumptions. Without question, potential baseline imbalance between treatment arms has implications for the analysis of longitudinal RCTs and is a source of confusion. In an RCT, baseline differences can be attributed to random chance assuming there were no problems or issues with the randomisation process and no significant measurement error issues. LDA or CHANGE score analysis is sometimes viewed as a more intuitive analysis; however, for an RCT most often the best method is an ANCOVA as far as bias, precision and power.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In a longitudinal RCT, when within-participant correlations are not high, change score or LDA (an unconditional analysis) is not the most powerful analyses. Frison and Pocock<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> found that ANCOVA treatment difference estimates have small bias under the assumption that measurement error is a small proportion of the between-participant variance; however, bias in a change score analysis may be somewhat larger especially if correlations between pre- and post-measurements are small.</p><p>cLDA is sometimes erroneously viewed as more problematic when there is baseline imbalance in outcomes between treatment arms. However, cLDA and ANCOVA are equivalent when analysing complete data. cLDA generalises the ANCOVA approach and both are superior to an LDA in many cases. Therefore, the primary analytic issue is not necessarily whether or not to perform conditional analysis. ANCOVA is a conditional analysis and cLDA is an unconditional analysis, yet both are powerful methods that can be applied to examine treatment differences over time in a longitudinal RCT. In practical applications, cLDA is the most straightforward to implement and under reasonable missing data assumptions will yield robust estimates of treatment effect differences and inferential statistics. In most cases, it is the method of choice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The primary author is a senior statistician in the Biostatistics Unit of the Durham VA Health Services Research and Development group and an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Duke University Medical Center.
