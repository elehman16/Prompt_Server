patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [Subjects] Thirty-one patients with
neck pain and a diagnosis of PTSD were enrolled. [Methods] Neck exercise training was
performed with the experimental group and neck self-exercise (using a modification of the
McKenzie exercise) was used with the control group. Both groups performed their exercises
for 30 minutes at a time, three times per week. To compare the effects of the
interventions, the threshold of neck tenderness and depression levels were measured at
each period. [Results] The pain threshold of both sides of the trapezius showed a
significant difference between the two groups at the three measurement periods. In the
experimental group, the threshold increased by 19.7% on the left and 18.3% on the right
after the intervention compared to before. Depression levels significantly differed in the
experimental group between the three measurements. [Conclusion] This study has important
implications for therapeutic strategies, as it provides strong evidence for a method of
improving symptoms of neck pain; furthermore, it is effective for subjects with
psychological problems such as PTSD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In their lifetimes, without accounting for special cases of major incidents, most people
will experience a traumatic event that threatens their life or to cause physical harm. Among
the general population of the US, 50&#x02013;90% will experience some form of traumatic event at
least once in their lifetimes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a general anxiety disorder that occurs after
exposure to a traumatic event. It was first introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies on PTSD using computed tomography
have reported that most PTSD patients&#x02019; frontal and temporal lobes, which control emotions,
fear, and problem solving skills, are severely damaged.</p><p>The positive effects of exercise as a form of physical therapy on symptoms of PTSD are
currently being studied. Diaz and Motta<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that in 91% of child subjects, the symptoms of PTSD decreased significantly after a
walking exercise. Manger et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> found
that aerobic exercise reduced PTSD symptoms in a group of adults, while Newman et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that after 8 weeks of aerobic
exercise, children with PTSD showed a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms, depression, and
anxiety after exercise, despite little decrease in symptoms in the early days of the
intervention. Kim et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
after 8 weeks of meditation and respiration exercise, PTSD Checklist scores decreased
significantly while cortisol levels increased.</p><p>The treatment of PTSD has so far been limited to drug therapy and psychotherapy (e.g.,
cognitive behavioral therapy). The physical symptoms are treated by respiration, meditation,
and relaxation exercises. However, among studies on the psychological and social problems
associated with PTSD, such as depression and anxiety, studies on problems of the neck&#x02014;which
is the most common musculoskeletal problem in people with PTSD&#x02014;is lacking. Direct contact
with a person who has experienced traumatic events has its limits and can cause subjects to
feel external pressure or resistance. To compensate for these disadvantages, in this study,
we present a treatment that relies on the sling system.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the impact of six weeks of a neck exercise intervention on
neck pain levels, upper trapezius pressure threshold, and depression in patients with PTSD
and neck pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study targeted 31 patients living in G city who had neck pain and a diagnosis of PTSD.
Patients who understood our description of the study and could answer the questionnaire were
selected. To participate, subjects had to give their written consent to participate in the
study with their own hand. This study was approved by the center, and all the participants
provided their written informed consent. The specific criteria for selecting subjects are as
follows. First, according to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV, subjects had to have
more than a certain number of the three major symptoms of PTSD&#x02014;re-experiencing, avoidance,
and arousal&#x02014;lasting for at least a month. Second, subjects had to have neck pain for more
than 3 months and a neck dysfunction index of lower than 15. The study was performed using a
pre-posttest control group design. In the T center located in G city, 31 subjects who met
the selection and exclusion criteria for neck pain among patients diagnosed with PTSD (n =
58) were selected. Using a coin toss, subjects were divided randomly into the neck exercise
group (experimental group) and neck self-exercise group (control group). Neck exercise
training using a sling system was used for the experimental group whereas a neck movement
self-exercise (specifically, a modification of the McKenzie exercise) was used for the
control group. We checked in with both groups weekly to determine whether they had performed
the exercises. Both groups performed their exercise for 35 minutes at a time, 3 times per
week. The total intervention period was 6 weeks. To compare the effects of the exercises,
the threshold of neck tenderness and depression were measured before and after the
intervention and at a follow-up.</p><p>The neck exercise of the experimental group involved the sling system presented by
Kirkesola<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The warm-up before the
exercise for the experimental group was 10 minutes of treadmill running and stretching
(stretching was also performed after the exercise as a cool-down). First, in the main
exercise, subjects, while supine, actively move to the left and right while an inelastic
band holds their heads in a neutral position. Second, subjects performed a
curvature-extension of the neck: while supine, they hold their head in a neutral position
and slowly extend it using the elastic band until they are bent into a lying down position.
Third, subjects performed an extensional movement: while supine, they hook the sling to the
back of the skull using the inelastic band and pull the jaw, holding this for 30 seconds.
Fourth was a neck stabilization exercise: with the elastic band, subjects hook the sling to
the pelvis and shoulders from the knee-high, and with the inelastic band, they hook the
sling to their occipital bones and pull the jaw forwards, after which they hold this
position. The first movement was performed for 5 to 10 minutes and the second movement was
performed repeatedly 15 times in 3 sets (each set involved holding the position for 30
seconds and resting for 10 seconds). The third and fourth movements were performed in 3 sets
(each set involved holding the position for 30 seconds and resting for 10 seconds). All of
the interventions were performed 3 times per week for a total of 6 weeks. The control group
was educated on neck self-exercise using McKenzie exercise therapy<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the education, verbal explanations and
demonstrations by the therapist were provided along with handouts.</p><p>In this study, to evaluate the threshold of upper trapezius pressure and joint working
range, we used an algometer. To evaluate the degree of depression, we used a self-report
questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each measurement and evaluation was performed a total of three
times: before the intervention, just after the intervention (6 weeks from the start), and 12
weeks of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To compare the changes in neck pain between two groups over the measurement period, we
compared the pain threshold of each group.</p><p>The pain threshold of the left trapezius showed a significant difference between two groups
at the three measurement points. It increased by 19.7% in the experimental group after the
intervention compared to before the intervention. At follow-up, it had increased by 20.0% in
the experimental group (p &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to before the intervention. In the control
group, it increased by 6.59% after the intervention compared to before it, while at
follow-up, it had increased by 6.5% compared to before. Accordingly, the interaction between
group and measurement time was significant (F = 4.1, p &#x0003c; 0.01). The pain threshold of the
right trapezius showed significant differences across the three measurements between the
groups. In the experimental group, the pain threshold increased by 18.35% after the
intervention compared to before it, and at follow-up, it had increased by 15.9% (p &#x0003c;
0.05) compared to before the intervention. In the control group, pain threshold increased by
2.6% after the intervention compared to before it, while at follow-up, it had only increased
by 1.74%. Accordingly, the interaction between group and measurement time was significant (F
= 7.1, p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>To compare the changes in depression level over the measurement period between two groups,
we compared the Hopkins Symptom Checklist scores between the groups across the measurement
period.</p><p>Depression level showed significant differences in the experimental group across the three
measurements. It decreased by 18.0% after the intervention compared to before it, and
decreased by 15.2% at follow-up compared to before the intervention. In the control group,
depression level decreased by 2.3% after the intervention compared to before it, and at
follow-up, it increased by 3.0% compared to before the intervention. Accordingly, the
interaction between group and measurement time in depression level was significant (F =
23.5, p &#x0003c; 0.01) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the pressure threshold of the trapezius muscle and depression between

on the neck pain and depression levels of patients with PTSD and to identify the utility of
this intervention for clinical practice.</p><p>The results indicated significant differences in pain threshold on both sides of the upper
trapezius muscle and in depression level across the measurement period for subjects with
PTSD who had undergone an exercise intervention with the sling system.</p><p>It has been reported that people who have neck pain have poor neck strength and
endurance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these people, use of a
neck exercise therapy has been reported to increase neck strength and decrease pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A major cause of neck pain is problems in
the upper muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the measurement of the
threshold of the upper trapezius muscle between a trapezius asymmetric group and a symmetric
group. The results indicated that the asymmetric group&#x02019;s right and left trapezius threshold
values were 3.27 &#x000b1; 0.8&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> and 2.90 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In
contrast, the symmetric group&#x02019;s right and left thresholds were 4.68 &#x000b1; 1.3&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>
and 4.41 &#x000b1; 1.2&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively; these latter numbers are similar to what was
found in the present study.</p><p>The subjects of this study differed from people with neck pain alone, as they had neck pain
with psychological problems. PTSD is caused by traumatic events and can damage the same
muscles treated in physical therapy for whiplash injury. Ursano et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the incidence of chronic and acute PTSD between a
group severely injured by car accidents and a group injured by other traumatic events on the
basis of disability for 3 months. The results indicated that PTSD incidence increases in
subjects with a history of the disorder. Mishaels et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> performed psychological evaluations on 35 people hospitalized due
to a car accident both one month and 5 months after the accident. In less than a month, 34%
of subjects had been diagnosed with acute PTSD; after 5 months, 38% had been diagnosed with
chronic PTSD. It has been reported that subjects who have suffered a trauma experience
symptoms related to depression such as fear, anxiety, depressed mood, lethargy,
hopelessness, and feelings of self-deprecation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sabin et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that for at least 4&#x02013;6 months after a trauma, 11% of the 30% of the sample who
showed PTSD symptoms had high levels of depressive symptoms. Additionally, in Agaibi and
Wilson&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, higher levels of PTSD
after a trauma were associated with more severe symptoms of depression. However, in the
study by Bryant et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, there was no
relationship between level of impairment and depression. PTSD and anxiety symptoms, however,
were reported to be associated. Among those who had experienced trauma and who had been
diagnosed with PTSD, 48&#x02013;55% were found to have a major depressive disorder<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment for PTSD is mainly psychological, and musculoskeletal
problems are often overlooked. Higher percentages of neck pain have been reported among
people with psychological problems<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
People who have neck pain can experience discomfort and restrictions in daily life and
develop further psychological problems<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has important implications for therapeutic strategies, given that it describes
an intervention that can improve symptoms of neck pain in subjects who have psychological
problems such as PTSD. Furthermore, it provides preliminary results for a specific
intervention for psychological problems and musculoskeletal pain, which has recently been
studied.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>FH</given-names></name><name><surname>Slone</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name></person-group>: The epidemiology of trauma and PTSD.
