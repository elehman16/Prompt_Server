TSH measurement is not a part of routine screening guidelines in pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In our center, TSH is measured routinely in all pregnant women. Haddow JE <italic>et al</italic>. have found that routine TSH testing is performed in 48% of all prenatal care practices and 76% of urban obstetric practices.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Furthermore, percentage of number of hypothyroid women at our center was higher (9.04%) compared to that reported in literature.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>As patients were divided into two groups: prepregnancy and hypothyroid diagnosed during pregnancy, this enabled us to assess the effect of hypothyroidism on various pregnancy clinical, biochemical, and outcome parameters. Prepregnancy hypothyroid women presented at an earlier gestational age thus indicating good awareness about the disorder. This group had 51% patients with elevated TSH levels at time of conception in spite of being on treatment. Our findings are similar to a study in Sweden in which 50.9% patients with known hypothyroidism on treatment had an elevated TSH at the time of conception.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Thyroxin dose requirement was higher in prepregnancy hypothyroid group as this group had more number of overt hypothyroid cases. Anti-TPO antibody positivity has been shown to have several adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes independent of thyroid dysfunction. Autoimmunity increases risk of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, and low 1<sup>st</sup> min Apgar score.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In euthyroid women increased the risk of miscarriage has been associated with anti-TPO positivity in some[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but not all studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Negro <italic>et al</italic>. showed that anti-TPO positivity increases risk of first trimester miscarriage independent of thyroid function.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, anti-TPO was strongly associated with premature delivery, rate of abortion/fetal loss, and low birth weight. However, there was no significant association between anti-TPO positivity and rate of cesarean section.</p><p>Hypothyroidism is known to be associated with increased rate of cesarean sections.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, the rate of cesarean section was more compared to normal deliveries (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). However, there was no difference between the two groups. Hypothyroidism also is shown to increase risk of lower birth weight, fetal death, and premature labor.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, we did not have comparative data of low birth weight, fetal loss/abortion, and premature labor from normal population.</p><p>There were no significant differences between two groups (Group I and II) in incidences of premature delivery, abortion and low birth weight babies. Thus, timing of diagnosis of hypothyroidism did not have any bearing on pregnancy outcomes. In each group, there was no difference in pregnancy outcomes between subclinical and overt hypothyroidism.</p><p>The combination of diabetes and hypothyroidism is associated with higher rate of infertility, cesarean sections, preterm deliveries, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Similarly, pregnancy induced hypertension are independently associated with increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal pregnancy outcomes.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, in our study, diabetes with hypothyroidism was associated with risk of low birth weight and cesarean section but not with premature delivery and miscarriage and fetal loss. Preeclampsia was not associated with any of the adverse pregnancy outcomes. This could probably be due to very small numbers with diabetes and hypertension and also that those were well controlled.</p><p>Significant proportions (15.48%) of patients in our study were treatment noncompliant as suggested by raised trimester-specific TSH levels in spite of treatment. In one study, 54% primary hypothyroid nonpregnant patients had out of range TSH even on treatment.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This underscores the importance of reinforcement of adherence to treatment. 7.07% rate of overtreatment in our study highlights the fact that patient education regarding regular TSH monitoring is required.</p><p>There are many strengths of our study such as prospective design and large sample size.
