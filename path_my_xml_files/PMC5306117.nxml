This often involves intensification with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) initially, followed by other agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), with the majority of patients eventually requiring insulin therapy. Therefore, this trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of IDegLira (combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide) in controlling glycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled on a GLP-1RA and OADs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this 26-week open-label phase 3b trial, patients on maximum-dose GLP-1RA therapy (liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily) with metformin alone or with pioglitazone and/or sulfonylurea were randomized 2:1 to IDegLira once daily (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;292) or to unchanged GLP-1RA therapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;146), continuing OADs at the pre-trial dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 26 weeks, HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions were superior with IDegLira versus unchanged GLP-1RA; estimated treatment difference &#x02212;0.94% (&#x02212;10.3&#x000a0;mmol/mol), <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001.

Insulin remains the most efficacious glucose-lowering therapy, and is typically initiated when patients are unable to achieve glycemic control with lifestyle changes, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), and GLP-1RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. GLP-1RAs can offer significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a low risk of hypoglycemia and significant weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of using basal insulin and GLP-1RAs together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and their co-use is supported by treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, intensification with basal insulin is seen as a natural progression for patients whose blood glucose is not controlled by a GLP-1RA and OADs.</p><p>Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is the first combination of a basal insulin (insulin degludec) and a GLP-1RA (liraglutide). The complementary modes of action of the two molecules can help to control both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG). IDegLira is available as a single once-daily injection that can be taken at any time of day, but preferably at the same time each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IDegLira is administered and titrated in a treat-to-target manner as dose steps, with each dose step containing 1&#x000a0;unit (U) of insulin degludec and 0.036&#x000a0;mg of liraglutide, up to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50&#x000a0;U insulin degludec and 1.8&#x000a0;mg liraglutide) daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The DUAL phase 3 clinical trial program investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in patients with type 2 diabetes. DUAL I and its 26-week extension showed that IDegLira provided clinical advantages and improved glycemic control compared with its monocomponents given alone in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. DUAL II investigated the contribution of liraglutide in IDegLira in insulin-experienced patients, with patients on IDegLira achieving superior glycemic control versus those on insulin degludec (which was capped at 50&#x000a0;U per day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. DUAL IV investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea with or without metformin, where it demonstrated superior glycemic control versus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. DUAL V compared IDegLira with the uptitration of insulin glargine 100&#x000a0;units/mL in patients who were inadequately controlled on 20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;U of insulin glargine 100&#x000a0;units/mL, with IDegLira resulting in superior HbA<sub>1c</sub>, a lower rate of hypoglycemia, and weight loss versus insulin glargine 100&#x000a0;units/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of the DUAL III clinical trial was to confirm the superiority of IDegLira compared with continuing on unchanged GLP-1RA therapy in controlling glycemia in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve adult patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with the maximum approved or tolerated dose of a GLP-1RA and OADs. The secondary objective of the trial was to compare the general efficacy and safety of IDegLira with unchanged GLP-1RA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial Design and Participants</title><p>This was a 26-week, multi-center, randomized, open-label, two-group parallel, treat-to-target trial conducted at 81 sites in five countries (Australia, France, Hungary, Slovakia, and the United States) between August 2012 and March 2014. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01676116), and was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before they were included in the trial.</p><p>Insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled if they were inadequately controlled with a GLP-1RA and OADs (metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone and/or sulfonylurea). Pre-trial patients were treated with the maximum dose (according to the local label) or the maximum tolerated dose of either liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily, and OADs at stable dose for at least 90&#x000a0;days before screening. Patients were included if they were &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age, had an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.0&#x02013;9.0% (53&#x02013;75&#x000a0;mmol/mol, both inclusive), and a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The starting dose of IDegLira was 16 dose steps (16&#x000a0;U insulin degludec and 0.6&#x000a0;mg liraglutide). Adjustment of IDegLira dose was performed twice weekly based on the three preceding pre-breakfast self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. The IDegLira dose was titrated to an FPG target of 4.0&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L (72&#x02013;90&#x000a0;mg/dL) (Table&#x000a0;S2 in the ESM). IDegLira could be titrated up to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50&#x000a0;U insulin degludec and 1.8&#x000a0;mg liraglutide).</p><p>Patients randomized to the unchanged GLP-1RA treatment continued their pre-trial treatment schedule without making any changes. Liraglutide (Victoza) was administered once daily using a 6.0&#x000a0;mg/mL solution provided in a 3-mL prefilled pen. Exenatide (Byetta) was administered twice daily using a 250&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL solution provided in 1.2-mL or 2.4-mL prefilled pens. All previous OADs (metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea) were continued at pre-trial doses in both groups unless there was a safety concern. OAD dose reduction was allowed for safety reasons (including hypoglycemic events) based on the judgment of the investigator.</p><p>At the screening visit, each patient was provided with a blood glucose monitoring meter in order to perform regular SMBG; this was used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline after 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included responders for HbA<sub>1c</sub> [predefined targets of &#x0003c;7% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol)] after 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, change from baseline in body weight, laboratory-measured FPG, and nine-point SMBG profile.</p><p>Safety variables included the number of treatment-emergent adverse events and episodes of confirmed hypoglycemia. Confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as plasma glucose &#x02264;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/L (&#x02264;56&#x000a0;mg/dL) or severe hypoglycemia which required third-party assistance. Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as confirmed hypoglycemia occurring between 00:01 and 05:59, inclusive. Other safety endpoints included clinical evaluation (physical examination, fundoscopy, blood pressure, ECG, and pulse) and laboratory variables (including lipid profile, amylase, lipase, and calcitonin).</p><p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were measured using the treatment-related impact measure&#x02014;diabetes (TRIM-D) and diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire status (DTSQs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The TRIM-D questionnaire was used to measure the treatment-related impact of the diabetes medication, whereby a higher TRIM-D total score indicated a better health state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The DTSQs consisted of a questionnaire consisting of eight items; items 2 and 3 were perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively, and were analyzed individually in the data analysis. A higher score for these items reflected a higher perceived frequency of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The treatment satisfaction score was based on the sum of the remaining six items of the questionnaire. A higher score in the DTSQs treatment satisfaction scale total indicates higher patient satisfaction with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistics</title><p>The trial was powered to the primary objective of demonstrating superiority using a two-sided <italic>t</italic> test of size 5%, under the assumptions of a 0.4% treatment difference with a 1.2% standard deviation. From these assumptions, a total of 429 patients were randomized 2:1 to IDegLira and unchanged GLP-1RA in order to obtain a nominal power of 90%.</p><p>The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized subjects, and was used to analyze HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, SMBG, hypoglycemia, and body weight. The safety endpoints were summarized using the safety analysis set (SAS), which included all randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of the investigational product. Missing values were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). The primary endpoint was also analyzed for the per protocol analysis set (all subjects in the FAS who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, had not violated any of the exclusion criteria, had HbA<sub>1c</sub> values from screening, randomization and after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and were exposed to the trial product for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks), completers analysis set (all randomized subjects who completed the trial), and using a repeated measurement analysis (missing data were imputed using a mixed-model repeated measurement technique rather than utilizing LOCF, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of using LOCF).</p><p>Change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the FAS. Treatment, pre-trial GLP-1RA, and region (Australia, Europe, or North America) were included as fixed effects with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as covariate. IDegLira was to be considered superior if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference was below 0.</p><p>Other continuous variables (mean of the nine-point SMBG profile, FPG, and body weight) were also analyzed by ANCOVA. Attainment of HbA<sub>1c</sub> target &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) was analyzed using a logistic regression model on the FAS population using LOCF, with treatment, pre-trial GLP-1 RA, and region as fixed factors and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> value as covariate.</p><p>Hypoglycemia was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model based on the FAS population, with treatment, pre-trial GLP-1RA, and region included as fixed factors and the logarithm of the time period in which an episode was considered treatment emergent as offset.</p><p>TRIM-D and DTSQs questionnaires were completed at baseline, visit 14, and the end of the trial.

A commonly used approach is the initiation of a GLP-1RA after one or more OADs fail to keep a patient at the target HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There are currently several options for treatment intensification in patients on a GLP-1RA, and the addition of basal insulin is a recognized option in the ADA/EASD guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Initiating basal insulin, and therefore the use of IDegLira, is a natural progression in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for those uncontrolled on a GLP-1RA, where beta-cell failure continues and endogenous insulin secretion declines. This trial investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on a GLP-1RA. It demonstrates that when transferring from maximum dose GLP-1RA to the IDegLira starting dose of 16 dose steps, there was no deterioration in blood glucose during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. After 26&#x000a0;weeks, patients on IDegLira achieved superior HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and had a statistically significant reduction in FPG and nine-point SMBG profile compared with those who continued unchanged GLP-1RA therapy. IDegLira also enabled significantly more patients to reach the HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets of &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol).</p><p>Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of IDegLira was consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Initiation of IDegLira resulted in a statistically significantly increase in weight and a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with unchanged GLP-1RA, however, this is to be expected following the introduction of insulin, and has been observed in other trials of insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the rate of hypoglycemia was low in both groups. The concomitant use of sulfonylurea in ~23% of the patients in the IDegLira group may have also contributed to the hypoglycemia and weight gain. A post hoc summary showed that hypoglycemia was more frequent in the IDegLira plus sulfonylurea-treated patients versus those on IDegLira without sulfonylurea; this was also observed with unchanged GLP-1RA. This is consistent with the results of the DUAL IV clinical trial, where IDegLira was investigated as an add-on to sulfonylurea therapy and the rate of hypoglycemia was higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] compared with other IDegLira trials where concomitant sulfonylurea treatment was not part of the background OAD therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is recognized that insulin and sulfonylurea is a frequently used combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. According to the IDegLira prescribing information, a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea should be considered when IDegLira is added to sulfonylurea therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], whereas pre-trial doses were maintained during this trial unless there was a safety concern. The DUAL III trial had an FPG target of 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mmol/L. In DUAL IV, the FPG target was 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mmol/L (72&#x02013;108&#x000a0;mg/dL) and the rate of confirmed hypoglycemia with IDegLira plus sulfonylurea was 3.5 versus 1.4 episodes per PYE with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The ADA have recently raised their glycemic target from 3.9&#x02013;7.2 to 4.4&#x02013;7.2&#x000a0;mmol/L (70&#x02013;130 to 80&#x02013;130&#x000a0;mg/dL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we can speculate that lower rates of hypoglycemia may be observed in real-life clinical practice with IDegLira, where sulfonylurea doses would be reduced and glycemic targets individualized if the patient experienced hypoglycemia. The frequency of nausea was low with both treatments (occurring in 3.1% with IDegLira and 4.1% with unchanged GLP-1RA); a low frequency of nausea has also been observed with IDegLira in other clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Overall, IDegLira treatment had a positive impact on PROs compared with unchanged GLP-1RA. The change from baseline score for TRIM-D in the IDegLira group was greater than that in the unchanged GLP-1RA group. In the DTSQ, patients treated with IDegLira reported greater treatment satisfaction versus those on unchanged GLP-1RA. According to the DTSQs, patients on IDegLira perceived the frequency of hypoglycemia to be higher and hyperglycemia to be lower than in patients on unchanged GLP-1RA. This is in line with the clinical results of the trial.</p><p>A limitation of this trial is that IDegLira was compared to an unchanged pre-trial comparator, and it would be interesting to compare the initiation of IDegLira in patients uncontrolled on a GLP-1RA with an active comparator, e.g., basal insulin. Also, due to the open-label nature of the trial, an improvement in PRO may be expected in the patients receiving the trial product compared with those continuing their existing therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, in patients inadequately controlled on maximum dose GLP-1RA and OADs, IDegLira resulted in a superior HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction and enabled patients to achieve a lower FPG and nine-point SMBG profile compared with patients continuing unchanged GLP-1RA therapy. Patients treated with IDegLira gained more weight and experienced more hypoglycemia versus unchanged GLP-1RA therapy; these results are consistent with previous findings on GLP-1RA intensification with insulin-containing therapy. Treatment with IDegLira resulted in a low rate of nausea and improved PROs versus unchanged GLP-1RA. IDegLira represents an efficacious and simple approach to intensifying therapy in patients uncontrolled on GLP-1RAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
