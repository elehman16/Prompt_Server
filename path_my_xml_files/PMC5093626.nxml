<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients with HFpEF are generally older, more often women, have a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and atrial fibrillation and are less likely to have coronary artery disease than those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the substantial burden from HFpEF appears to be similar to that from HFrEF, measured by exercise intolerance, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mortality, increased hospital admissions and higher healthcare costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref></p><p>Although there has been increasing success of pharmacological and device therapy to improve outcomes in HFrEF, prognosis in HFpEF remains unchanged, with no individual large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating significant treatment benefits.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although no pharmacological therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in HFpEF, pharmacological therapy of HFpEF does demonstrate quantifiable improvements in exercise capacity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown promising evidence for the benefit of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in HFpEF.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The most recent meta-analysis of 6 RCTs in 276 patients found exercise-based CR significantly improved exercise capacity and HRQoL compared to usual care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Notwithstanding that this evidence base consists of small RCTs of short follow-up (typically follow-up of 6-months or less); there were two other important limitations. First, there remain uncertainties in the mechanism of action in exercise-based CR interventions for HFpEF; no significant changes have been observed in the systolic or diastolic function with exercise-based CR in HFpEF patients. Second, the CR programmes undertaken in these RCTs were predominantly supervised and delivered in centre-based settings. There is increasingly recognition for the possibility of alternative delivery models of CR, such as telehealth and home-based programmes in order to overcome suboptimal rates of CR uptake seen with HF.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> European research indicates that only a minority of eligible HF patients are receiving exercise-based CR.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) programme of research was designed to develop and evaluate a health professional facilitated home-based self-help rehabilitation intervention to improve self-care and HRQoL in people with HF and their caregivers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>A core element of the REACH-HF intervention is exercise training which will be invested to better understand the mechanisms by which exercise intervention can improve exercise tolerance in HFpEF. In HFrEF patients, exercise intervention has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness though cardiac<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and extra cardiac mechanisms.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The cardiac mechanisms include reverse left ventricular remodelling<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and improvement in diastolic function.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The ability of exercise interventions to improve early diastolic relaxation has also been shown in elderly individuals<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and in patients after a myocardial infarction with a pre-existent abnormal relaxation pattern. Diastolic dysfunction is an important feature of exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Despite this, little is known about the impact of exercise training on diastolic function in HFpEF. This study will allow the opportunity to assess diastolic function and LV filling in more detail to better understand mechanisms of exercise intervention in HFpEF. As bloodborne biomarkers can offer objective and biologically relevant and mechanistic insights that complement the findings of echocardiographic measurements, we propose to measure biomarkers of distinct mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of HF.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>AIM</title><p>The overarching aim is to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention in patients with HFpEF. Specific aims of the study were to estimate recruitment and retention of participants (patients and caregivers); and to evaluate components of the study process: feasibility of outcome data collection processes, and outcome burden and completion/attrition rates for participants (patients and caregivers). Specific objectives of the study were (1) to collect views of participants (patients and caregivers) on acceptability of the study design; (2) to assess the feasibility and experience of the addition of the REACH-HF intervention to usual care for participants (patients and caregivers) and intervention facilitators; (3) to identify barriers to participation and adherence to the intervention and study procedures; (4) to inform a definitive study sample size by assessment of the variance in study outcomes; (5) to assess methods for the collection of data on resource use and costs associated with the delivery of the intervention; (6) to develop the framework for cost-effectiveness analyses for any future full trial and economic evaluation; (7) to assess the fidelity of REACH-HF manual delivery by intervention facilitators and (8) to undertake a mechanistic substudy using echocardiographic and bloodborne biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This protocol is reported in accord with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 guidance for protocols of clinical trials.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><sec id="s3a"><title>Design</title><p>A parallel two-group randomised controlled pilot trial with individual participant allocation to the intervention or control group with a nested mixed methods feasibility evaluation and mechanistic substudy.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>an exercise training programme, tailored according to initial fitness assessments, delivered as a walking programme or a chair-based exercise DVD, or a combination of the two (as selected by the patient);</p></list-item><list-item><p>managing stress /breathlessness /anxiety;</p></list-item><list-item><p>heart failure symptom monitoring (and associated help-seeking);</p></list-item><list-item><p>understanding HF and taking medications.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The REACH-HF manual was originally designed for patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction &#x0003c;45%). There was limited evidence to guide the development of the REACH-HF manual for HFpEF patients; it has been adapted for this pilot study to allow evaluation in patients with HFpEF (ejection fraction &#x02265;45%). The section on medications has been revised to make it relevant to HFpEF patients, and an additional section has been added on the nature of causes and treatment of HFpEF. The majority of the self-care advice in all other sections of the REACH-HF manual is relevant to all patients with HF and corresponds to national HF guidelines.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Patients will be advised to use the Progress Tracker, which is designed to encourage patients to monitor their own condition over the period of the intervention and to make associations between improvements in self-care and improvements in symptoms/well-being. It includes sections in which patients can record changes in physical and mental state, intensity of exercise and self-reported walking speed, physical activity, engagement in enjoyable activities, frequency of self-weighing (to monitor fluid build-up) and frequency of use of stress-management techniques. The Family and Friends Resource, a manual for use by caregivers, includes advice on providing support for a person with heart failure, becoming a caregiver, managing the caregiver's own health and well-being and getting help.</p><p>Intervention delivery may be discontinued at any time at the request of a participant or by the intervention facilitator if the intervention is no longer deemed appropriate, for example, altered clinical condition.</p><p>Adherence by facilitators to the intervention protocols will be measured through fidelity assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Usual care</title><p>In accord with findings of our national survey,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> HF patients typically do not receive CR, despite national recommendations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The choice of a usual care (no CR) comparator in this therefore reflects of the current situation for the vast majority of HF patients in UK. Intervention and control group patients will receive usual medical management for HF according to national and local guidelines. Data related to health service usage and medication use will be captured at each follow-up through participants' completion of healthcare resource use questionnaires and by collection of concomitant medication usage as reported by participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome data will be collected at 4 and 6&#x02005;months postrandomisation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012853TB1">table 1</xref>).

Investigators will also check that participating patients have not developed contraindications to exercise testing before conducting the incremental shuttle walking tests. The echocardiography examinations at rest will be conducted at baseline and 6&#x02005;months, unless an appropriate echocardiography examination has been conducted within 2&#x02005;weeks prior to the clinic visit, and the patient agrees to the data being used for the study. Echocardiographic measurements will include diastolic and systolic parameters. Blood samples collected for determination of NT pro-BNP levels) will be dispatched to a central laboratory (Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust). Blood samples collected for the analysis of bloodborne biomarkers will be analysed at the recruiting site. Biomarkers of distinct mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of HF will be measured (growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15); ventricular remodelling (soluble ST2); myonecrosis (highly sensitive troponin T (hsTnT)) and wall stress (NT-pro-BNP)).<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Accelerometer devices will be worn for 8&#x02005;days then returned by participants using postage-paid to the CTU for data extraction.

Completed CRFs will be checked and signed at the research sites by a member of the research team before being sent to the CTU. Original CRF pages and completed questionnaire booklets will be posted to the CTU at agreed time points for double-data entry in to the study database. Accelerometer data will be imported directly into the study database. All forms and data will be tracked using a web-based trial management system. Double-entered data will be compared for discrepancies according to a data management plan held in CTU.

Investigators will ensure that the participants' anonymity is maintained on all other documents. Within the CTU, anonymised and identifiable study data will be stored separately, to prevent the identification of participants from research records, in locked filing cabinets within a locked office. Data will be collected and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Electronic records will be stored by the CTU in a secure and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted web-based database maintained by the University of Plymouth with daily back up.

The contact sheet will also ask the intervention facilitator to make notes immediately after the patient contact about what was covered, what went well in the session; what worked less well; what s/he could have performed differently and what we could improve about the intervention materials or the delivery process. The importance of completing these sheets was emphasised in the facilitator training session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>In this pilot study, we will estimate the additional resource use and related costs, associated with the delivery of the intervention, and assess the methods used to collect participant level data on healthcare services used and other related resource use. Data on these areas of resource use will be collected within trial, using reported input by intervention facilitators, and self-report (interviewer administered) participant resource use questionnaires (eg, primary and community healthcare, hospital-based healthcare). In any future economic evaluation, alongside a full trial, the primary perspective of the evaluation is expected to be that of factors related to collecting clinical and resource-use data within the trial will be evaluated. The primary perspective will be that of the UK NHS and personal social services (consistent with the reference case approach used in the UK by NICE),<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> with a broader perspective, addressing partial patient and societal resource use, explored in sensitivity analyses. That will therefore be the guiding perspective for data collection in the current pilot study perspective. Informed by CRFs, methods for estimating the resource use and costs associated with delivery of the intervention will be developed and tested. Alongside the data collection on resource use, consideration will be given to outcomes, including the anticipated primary economic end point of the EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and to the development of the framework for future within trial and longer term cost-effectiveness analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All analyses, quantitative and qualitative, will be conducted according to best practise and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting of clinical trials and appropriate guidelines for reporting process evaluations and qualitative research.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46&#x02013;48</xref></p><sec id="s3l1"><title>Pilot study outcomes</title><p>Given the feasibility objectives of this pilot study, the focus of data analysis will be descriptive.

All protocol deviations along with reasons and number of missing items on questionnaires will be reported.</p><p>Intervention fidelity checklist scores will be summarised using simple descriptive statistics (means and SDs) and collated as an overall total score, individual item scores and (total and item) scores for each facilitator. Examples of good practice will be flagged, transcribed and extracted as audio clips or transcripts (with the facilitator's permission) to inform future training. Checklist items will be scored for each recording.</p><p>Participant interview data will be analysed using descriptive, thematic analysis to identify salient themes from the interview transcripts. The data will be analysed with the aim of addressing the study aim and the study objectives, that is, to seek the views of patients, caregivers and facilitators on the acceptability of intervention manual and/or the intervention delivery processes and to collect the views of patients and caregivers on the study design.</p></sec><sec id="s3l2"><title>Primary, secondary and economic outcomes</title><p>Baseline sociodemographic and health-related variables will be reported descriptively by treatment arm. For all the primary and secondary outcome variables, we will report descriptive statistics only (total number of observations available, with mean and SD, or median and IQR, as appropriate), at baseline, 4-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up. All analyses will be conducted by a statistician who is blinded to treatment allocation and will be performed on an intention-to-treat, complete case basis. Given the pilot nature of the study, we will report levels of missing of data (and reasons for loss) but we will not undertake any imputation analyses.</p><p>While we do not seek to formally estimate cost-effectiveness in this pilot study, estimates of intervention cost will inform exploratory modelling and estimates of the resources and costs needed to run a future trial. In any future definitive RCT, cost-effectiveness analysis is expected to involve within trial analysis and evidence synthesis with decision-analytic modelling, to assess the longer term consequences of the intervention (eg, changes in outcomes, events avoided, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years gained). It is expected that this modelling will use/adapt existing economic models on outcomes for HF, and the subsequent cost-effectiveness of interventions. This pilot study will be used to consider how best to construct such analyses and to develop an economic evaluation plan for any future definitive RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Data monitoring and quality assurance</title><p>The site principal investigators (CCL, KS) or authorised delegate(s) will check completed CRFs for missing data or obvious errors before the forms are sent to the CTU. Data will be monitored centrally for quality and completeness by the CTU, and every effort will be made to recover data from incomplete forms where possible.</p><p>The CTU data manager will oversee data tracking and data entry and initiate processes to resolve data queries where necessary. The CTU trial manager(s) (CH and VE) will devise a monitoring plan specific to the study which will include central monitoring strategies and study site visits as appropriate. The participating site will be required to permit the CTU trial manager or deputy, or representative of the sponsor, to undertake study-related monitoring to ensure compliance with the approved study protocol and applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs), providing direct access to source data and documents as requested. All study procedures will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and according to the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). Procedures specifically conducted by the CTU team (eg, data management, study management and study monitoring) will be conducted in compliance with CTU SOPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title>Trial management and independent committees</title><p>Team members directly involved with the day-to-day running of the trial at site will meet regularly to discuss trial progress, teleconferencing with external members of the REACH-HF management team on a monthly basis with email and telephone exchange as necessary between. The Programme Management Group including health economics, statistics, process evaluation and patient and public representation will meet on a quarterly basis to review status of the overall programme, including trial progress.</p><p>The REACH-HF Programme Steering Committee (Chair: Professor Martin Cowie and four other independent members including a patient and public involvement representative) have formally agreed to adopt the role of Trial Steering Committee and will oversee the conduct of the trial with safety and ethics review by a fully independent Data Monitoring Committee (Chair: Dr Ann-Dorthe Zwisler and two other independent members). Evidence for treatment differences in the main efficacy outcome measures will not be monitored through review of accumulating outcome data, and no interim data analyses will be conducted.</p><p>The Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee meet one to two times per year. Detailed descriptions of the remit and function of the oversight committees are documented in specific charters held in the Trial Master File by CTU.</p><p>The Independent Adjudication Committee (Professor Ian Squire (Chair), De Sern Lim and Dr Francisco Levya) will independently assess all hospitalisations and deaths of patient participants during the study for their relatedness to HF in accordance with the study-specific procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with ICH GCP and in accordance with the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, Second edition (2005). The study is sponsored by Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust (Research Development and Innovation Department, Royal Cornwall Hospital, Treliske, Truro, Cornwall, TR1 3LJ). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to study enrolment. Participants enrolled into the study are covered by indemnity for negligent harm arising from the management, design and conduct of the research through standard NHS Indemnity arrangements. The study is approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service (ref 15/ES/0036). Any subsequent amendments will be made using the Integrated Research Applications System in order to maintain ethical approval and NHS permissions. Amended documents will be provided to the investigator site by CTU. In the event of changes to study design requiring significant amendment to the content of the participant information sheet, participants will be required to provide renewed informed consent.</p><p>The ISRCTN number was granted on 7 July 2015 following significant correspondence between the Trials Unit, the permissions team in Scotland and the South West Peninsula CRN team, with regard to the ISRCTN registration. The first participant was randomised on 2 July 2015 in good faith by the trial team following green light from the sponsor. It took 1&#x02005;month to ascertain that the UKCRN was unable to support an ISRCTN registration and that the sponsor would need to apply and pay independently, as the study was not going to be network adopted. The 5-day period between randomisation and ISRCTN registration accounts for 1 patient out of a planned 50 patient sample size. No changes to any trial procedures or protocol were made during or as a result of this recruitment period and the trial protocol was already registered with the Trust, sponsor and ethics committee.</p><p>Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at local, national and international meetings and conferences to publicise and explain the research to clinicians, commissioners and service users. A final report will be submitted to the National Institute for Health Research which will be available on request to any interested others.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot trial aims to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention (a manualised home-based rehabilitation intervention designed to improve self-care and HRQoL) in patients with HFpEF and their caregivers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The REACH-HFpEF pilot trial was designed by CCL, KS, HMD, RST, JW, KJ, RD, PD, JA, RVL, SS, CA, NB, CG, CJG, KP and SB.
