There are abundant data on sodium fluoride&#x02019;s (NaF) ability to foster remineralisation of tooth enamel.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> NaF-containing tooth varnish preparations are the recommended vehicle for delivering topical fluoride for dental caries prevention and lesion arrest in children younger than 6 years&#x000a0;according to guidelines from the American Dental Association, American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry and US Preventive Services Task Force.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> In children younger&#x000a0;than 6 years&#x000a0;at high risk for dental caries, the recommendation is application of NaF varnish every 3 months.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Fluoride varnishes have been shown to be safe in young children.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>Topical fluoride alone, however, is not enough to thwart tooth decay in high-risk populations. Caries researchers for some time have suggested strategies that combine an antiseptic with topical fluoride to reduce or eliminate tooth surface colonisations by cariogenic bacteria in addition to topical fluoride which primarily remineralises enamel.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Povidone iodine (PVP-I) is a widely used over-the-counter antiseptic and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intraoral and extraoral use. For the oral flora, iodine has preferential activities against streptococcal species, including <italic>Streptococcus</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>mutans</italic>, pathogens implicated in the causation of dental caries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Moreover, iodine's effectiveness may last as long as 6 months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>Studies have examined suppression of <italic>S. mutans</italic> by PVP-I in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC). In one study, the teeth of children 2&#x02013;6 years of age with S-ECC were treated topically with PVP-I or saline following surgical dental treatment under general anaesthesia for S-ECC.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> were significantly reduced up to 3&#x02009;months in the PVP-I group (p&#x0003c;0.001). A second study demonstrated suppression of <italic>S. mutans</italic> up to 90 days in children with S-ECC who received a single application of PVP-I followed by a topical application of 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride foam and surgical elimination of caries lesions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>A study of babies in Puerto Rico who were at high risk for S-ECC&#x000a0;because they were all colonised by <italic>S. mutans</italic> and had decay-promoting feeding behaviours demonstrated that PVP-I applied bimonthly prevented the development of early tooth decay lesions in the maxillary primary incisors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a randomised clinical trial, PVP-I applied bimonthly reduced recurrent dental decay assessed at 6 months following surgical treatment for S-ECC.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>Two prospective cohort studies tested the effect of sequentially applying PVP-I followed by 5% NaF varnish. In these studies, children in one school setting received the combination treatment, and the outcome was compared with that of children in a similar school setting in the same community who received only application of the 5% NaF varnish. There was no randomisation of children or schools. The first study assessed the effect of protecting erupting first&#x000a0;permanent molars from developing dental caries in children 5&#x02013;6 years old<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; the second studied the effect on the primary dentition of children 12&#x02013;30 months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Both demonstrated that treatment with PVP-I reduced the incidence of new decay over NaF varnish alone (p&#x0003c;0.002&#x02009;and p&#x0003c;0.02, respectively).</p><p>This phase II&#x000a0;randomised controlled trial assesses the efficacy of a combination PVP-I and NaF dental varnish (test varnish) to determine if it is superior to a varnish containing only NaF (active control) in the prevention of new caries lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a single-centre randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial.

Children attending these programs are the participants enrolled. The parent or legal guardian of the potential participant was approached at the school after drop off or prior to pick up by a study assistant who explained the study and obtained written informed consent. There were 299 consents. After the consent, a study assistant collected healthy history information, and the final decision whether to enrol the child was made by a study dentist after a review of the history. Seven children were excluded because they were too young. Enrolment began 22&#x000a0;March&#x000a0;2017 and was completed on 7&#x000a0;April&#x000a0;2017: 285 children were examined, and 284 aged 48&#x02013;84 months old were randomised and received the first study treatment. The child who&#x000a0;was examined and not randomised was determined not to be able to cooperate with the study treatment because of developmental delays.</p><p>The Micronesian islands are quite isolated, and children do not change schools or move from the islands readily. To maintain participation, we will regularly provide healthy snacks at the centres and hold end of year study parties for parents and children at the centres to reduce drop-outs. Families whose children completed the first treatment visit received a $35 gift card to a local grocery store as an incentive. Families whose children complete a year in the study will receive another $35 gift card; families whose children complete 2&#x02009;years in the study will receive a third $35 gift card. In addition, the children received a study backpack including a set of school supplies. To be more inclusive, all children in the programmes received a free study t-shirt, irrespective of whether they are enrolled in the study. The incentive levels were determined based on advice from the Department of Health.</p><p>The Western Institutional Review Board (designated IRB) and the Institutional Review Board of the College of Micronesia-FSM approved all study procedures.

One and 2&#x02009;years shelf life of the varnish has been established according to FDA Guidance for Industry Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (Revision 2, November 2003). The active control varnish is the same NaF varnish without PVP-I. There is no difference in the test and control varnishes except for the PVP-I. Both varnishes were prepared by Cascade Custom Chemistry (Eugene, Oregon, USA). A maximum of 0.2&#x02009;mL of varnish is applied topically to the teeth with a dental applicator.

The children were visually examined using a mouth mirror and artificial light in a portable dental chair. No explorers were used. Examiners did not use dental radiographs. At follow-up, examiners will be recalibrated and will not have access to the results of the first examination to avoid detection bias.

The randomisation was stratified on school and used randomly permuted blocks of size 2 and 4 selected with &#x000be; and &#x000bc; probability to maintain balanced assignment within each school and concealment of the varnish assignment. The study biostatistician created the randomisation lists for each school using the &#x02018;sample&#x02019; function of the R statistical software (V.3.3.0; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2016). For the first varnish application, lists were prepared for A and B assignments separately for each school, and these lists were used when the varnish is applied. Small groups of children from the lists were called from their classroom for varnish application. The drug containers were marked clearly, and in each case, a second staff member verified that the participant received the correct varnish. The same procedure will be followed for the additional treatments.</p><p>All study personnel except for designated personnel in the data centre are blinded to the participant treatment assignment. In order to maintain blinding, the caries scoring examinations preceded the application of test varnishes at baseline. The staff members applying these varnishes do not perform the caries scoring examinations in order to eliminate examiner bias and ensure blinding to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Planned analysis</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Analysis of primary outcome</title><p>The primary analysis will be conducted in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle, and multiple imputation procedures will be used to account for missing caries information.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For the primary outcome, incremental dental caries based on d<sub>2-3</sub>mfs/DMFS, the unit of analysis will be the child, and the mean dental caries increment will be compared between the two interventions separately at 1 and 2&#x02009;years post baseline using a two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances. This approach assumes the distribution of dental caries increment is approximately symmetrical, which is often true in high-risk caries populations.
