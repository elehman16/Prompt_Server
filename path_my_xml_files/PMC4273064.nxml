stimulation (TENS) and interferential currents (IFC) on induced ischemic pain in healthy
volunteers. [Subjects] The subjects were 36 volunteers (18 male, 18 female) without known
pathology that could cause pain. Their mean age was 24.5&#x000b1;2.2&#x02005;years. [Methods] A
single-blind and parallel-group method was used. Subjects were randomly allocated to
receive each 50&#x02005;Hz TENS, 50&#x02005;Hz IFC, 100&#x02005;Hz TENS, and 100&#x02005;Hz IFC. This study experimentally
induced ischemic pain in otherwise pain-free subjects using a modified version of the
submaximal effort tourniquet technique. Subjects completed twelve cycles of the
ischemic-induced pain test. The primary outcome measure was the change in self-reported of
pain intensity during one of four possible treatments. [Results] There were significant
effects for Time, which were attributed to a significant reduction in pain intensity for
all groups. There were no significant effects for groups or group-time interaction. The
50&#x02005;Hz IFC treatment was more comfortable than the other treatments in the present study,
and it is likely to be better accepted and tolerated by patients. [Conclusion] We conclude
that there were no differences in the analgesic effects of the four treatments under the
present experimental conditions. The 50&#x02005;Hz IFC treatment is more comfortable than the
other treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</kwd><kwd>Interferential current</kwd><kwd>Ischemic pain model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Electrical stimulation is a popular treatment used by physiotherapists for muscle
strengthening, endurance, spasticity management, pain control, circulation promotion and

nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential current (IFC) are widely used for relief of
chronic and acute pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is believed that IFC excites deep tissue and that TENS excites superficial tissue. TENS
machines are usually relatively inexpensive, portable, battery operated devices, while IFC
machines tend to be more expensive, are not portable, and require an electrical power
source<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Experimental pain models provide a useful representation of clinical pain and make it
possible to control variables such as pain intensity and duration. Clinical trials can be
expensive and time consuming, while the intensity, location, and duration of clinical pain
can be difficult to control. Experimental pain models can thus guide subsequent clinical
trials, potentially saving time and money. Different experimental pain models exist
utilizing different types of pain stimulus such as cold, mechanical, electrical, and
ischemic pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The frequencies of 50&#x02005;Hz and 100&#x02005;Hz have a high analgesic effect<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Experimental
pain models using the same frequencies for TENS and ICT analgesic effects have been
compared, but the analgesic effects are unclear<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus far, there have been few studies that have compare the
analgesic effects of TENS and IFC with these two frequencies.</p><p>The ischemic pain model is a method commonly used to validate analgesic effect. The
modified version of the submaximum effort tourniquet technique (SETT) can cause pain that is
similar to clinical pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, this study used the ischemic pain model to compare the analgesic effects of
50&#x02005;Hz TENS, 50&#x02005;Hz IFC, 100&#x02005;Hz TENS and 100&#x02005;Hz IFC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 36 university student volunteers (18 male, 18 female) without known

All subjects who expressed interest in participating in the study were
briefed on the experimental procedure (both verbally and in written form) and were screened
for contraindications to the experimental procedure or electrotherapy. These
contraindications included any illness or pathology such as peripheral vascular
abnormalities, hypertension, hypotension, peripheral neuropathies, recent trauma, and
menstruation problems. Subjects who were taking any medication or who were likely to take
any medication during the period of study were excluded.</p><p>The investigator also checked each subject&#x02019;s nondominant arm for signs of previous trauma
and recorded the subject&#x02019;s blood pressure from the nondominant arm (because the
effectiveness of TENS and IFC is dependent on normally functioning nerves in the skin) using
a sphygmomanometer.</p><p>Outcome measurements were recorded from the nondominant arm so that subjects could use the
dominant arm when completing visual analog scales (VASs). All subjects who expressed an
interest in the study met the criteria and agreed to participate. Subjects were required to
sign a consent form and were reminded that they had the right to withdraw from the
experiment at any time.</p><p>All subjects gave informed consent according to the methods outlined by Sahmyook
University&#x02019;s institutional review board. This study protocol and procedures were also
approved by Sahmyook University&#x02019;s ethics committees.</p><p>Each subject attended our research laboratory on four separate occasions with a 24-, 48-,
or 72- to 96-hour interval between visits. During each visit, ischemic pain was induced over
a 12-minute period using the SETT. Self-reported pain intensity was recorded at 1-minute
intervals during the ischemic pain test using a VAS in which 0&#x02005;cm represented &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and
10&#x02005;cm represented &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;. Analgesia was induced by one of four treatments:
50&#x02005;Hz TENS, 50&#x02005;Hz IFC, 100&#x02005;Hz TENS or 100&#x02005;Hz IFC.</p><p>At the end of the fourth testing session, participants were asked, &#x0201c;Which of the two
modalities, if either, seemed more effective?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Which of the two modalities, if either,
felt more comfortable?&#x0201d; The subjects were given the opportunity to comment.</p><p>During the SETT, a sphygmomanometer cuff is usually applied above the subject&#x02019;s elbow and
inflated to 200&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. During pilot studies in our laboratory, we found that most subjects
experienced widespread paresthesia in the arm rather than pain. Thus, we modified the SETT
by applying the sphygmomanometer cuff to the forearm 5&#x02005;cm below the elbow crease, because
this placement of the sphygmomanometer cuff produced a dull aching pain that was localized
to the area of the cuff in all subjects.</p><p>Before the start of the experiment, maximal grip force was determined using a dynamometer
(Martin Vigorimeter*) fitted with a medium bulb. Seventy-five percent of the maximal grip
force was calculated and identified on the dynamometer scale. Ischemic pain was induced in
the following manner. Subjects raised their nondominant arm vertically above their head for
1 minute to decrease the volume of blood the limb. The sphygmomanometer cuff (15&#x02005;cm in
length) was then inflated to above 200&#x02005;mmHg at a rate of 40&#x02005;mmHg per second. Full cuff
inflation was taken as time 0, and subjects rated the intensity of pain in their raised arm
using the VAS. The forearm was then returned to rest in the horizontal position on a
polystyrene box that was designed to support the forearm and hand without applying pressure
to the sphygmomanometer cuff. This was to ensure an even distribution of pressure throughout
the cuff. Subjects then performed 20 hand-gripping exercises at 75% of their maximal grip
force for a period of one minute (squeeze for two seconds and rest for two seconds). Pain
intensity was recorded on completion of these exercises and at one minute intervals for the
remainder of the experiment. The cuff was deflated over a period of two minutes to allow the
volume of blood to increase in the limb, and the final pain intensity rating was taken one
minute after cuff deflation. No signs of trauma were observed in the arms of any subjects
following the ischemic pain test<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On each visit to the laboratory, subjects were randomly allocated to one of four
treatments: 50&#x02005;Hz TENS, 50&#x02005;Hz IFC, 100&#x02005;Hz TENS and 100&#x02005;Hz IFC. All subjects received 22
minutes of uninterrupted treatment. A single-blind experimental approach was used whereby
the subjects were not aware of which treatment they were being given. Four self-adhesive
electrodes (each electrode 4.5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>) were applied before the start of the
experiment, and treatment was switched on 10 minutes and 40 seconds before the arm was
raised above the head. Electrode sites were chosen to target afferents emerging from the
ischemic area. We were concerned that afferents under the cuff might be unable to fire due
to pressure block from the cuff. However, all subjects reported that they experienced a
strong but comfortable electrical paresthesia, suggesting to us that afferents remained
active.</p><p>Electrodes were applied in a quadripolar manner to the anterior and posterior aspects of
each subjects&#x02019; forearm so that electrical currents would intersect at the midpoint of the
cuff. The distal electrode for channel A was attached to the anterior surface of the forearm
5&#x02005;cm proximal to the first wrist crease. The distal electrode for channel B was attached to
the posterior surface of the forearm directly beneath the distal electrode for channel A.
Proximal electrodes were applied directly above the cuff. Subjects in the IFC group were
told that to produce an effect, the intensity of the stimulator must be maintained at a
&#x0201c;strong but comfortable level&#x0201d; at all times. Initially, when the IFC device was switched on
for the first time, the &#x0201c;comfortable level&#x0201d; was obtained by increasing the current amplitude
so that the subjects reported either that the currents were uncomfortable or that the motor
threshold had been reached. High analgesic effects of bursts at 50&#x02005;Hz and 100&#x02005;Hz generated
by 4-kHz sinusoidal waves were applied<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TENS is usually applied using a single-channel device via two electrodes. The TENS in our
study was delivered via four electrodes using a dual-channel device in order to standardize
the amount of current administered by the two modalities. Electrodes were applied to the
anterior and posterior aspects of the each subjects&#x02019;s forearm in an identical manner to that
for IFC. To minimize interference of currents from the two channels, both distal electrodes
were attached to channel A of the TENS device, and both proximal electrodes were attached to
channel B. The &#x0201c;comfortable level&#x0201d; was obtained using the same procedure as that described
for IFC. The high analgesic effect of a 125-microsecond phase duration at a frequency of
50&#x02005;Hz and a 200-microsecond phase duration at a frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz were applied<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 19.0 software. Data were
analyzed by calculating the change in pain intensity rating during the treatment between
measurements. Treatment effects were determined by a two-way repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) of the change in pain intensity during treatment for VAS ratings 4 through
9 and all VAS ratings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After completing the four interventions, there were significant effects for time, which
were attributed to a significant reduction in pain intensity during treatment, for VAS
ratings 4 through 9 and all VAS ratings (VAS 1&#x02013;12) (p&#x0003c;0.05). There were no significant
effects for groups or group-time interaction in pain intensity during treatment for VAS
ratings 4 through 9 and all VAS ratings. There were significant time effects that could be
attributed to the increase in pain intensity in all groups during cuff inflation and
hand-grip exercises (VAS 1&#x02013;3) and a decrease in pain intensity immediately upon cuff
deflation (VAS 10&#x02013;12). This result means pain intensity was significantly increased by the
treatment in all groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). But there was no significant difference between the
groups (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Pain intensity rating for treatments

were analyzed to investigate the usefulness of electrical stimulation on ischemic-induced
pain.</p><p>In this study, pain intensity was significantly increased during treatment in all groups.
But it was not significantly between the groups during the treatment.</p><p>Johnson and Tabasam used 100-Hz stimulation and found a greater effect with TENS than IFC
in a cold pain model, but the difference between treatments was not significant. The
measured difference was not statistically significant, but the study only had seven
participants in each, group so the lack of significance could have been due to low
statistical power<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. With methods similar
to this study, Shanahan et al. reported an experimental study using a crossover design with
larger participant numbers. They found that TENS at a frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz had a greater
analgesic effect than premodulated IFC at a beat frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>The balance of evidence thus indicates that IFC is less effective than TENS. Cheing and
Hui-chan reported no significant difference between treatments in a heat pain model<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Johnson and Tabasam reported no
significant difference between treatments in an ischemic pain model<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Johnson and Tabasam reported a statistically significant
result, with 100&#x02005;Hz TENS being more effective than premodulated 100&#x02005;Hz IFC<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ward et al. remarked that the controversy
over the effect of pain relief between TENS and IFC resulted from lack of statistical power
in published papers due to inadequate sample sizes<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ward et al. found that the effects of TENS and IFC at 50&#x02005;Hz on the pain threshold was
significantly increased and that there was no significant difference between TENS and IFC in
a cold pain model<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Johnson et al. found
that higher frequencies of pulsed current (above 50&#x02005;Hz) resulted in a lesser hypoalgesic
effect<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The between-frequency
differences in the study by Johnson et al. were not statistically significant, possibly due
to a small sample size, but a downward trend was clearly evident above 40&#x02005;Hz<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ward et al. speculated that a short burst
duration prevents or severely restricts multiple firing of sensory nerve fibers and instead
produces one action potential per burst<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hypoalgesic effects are thus equivalent to TENS. Thus 50&#x02005;Hz IFC
and 50&#x02005;Hz TENS are equally effective in alleviating cold-induced pain in healthy
subjects<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in previous
studies, there was a debate that not significant difference between the different types of
electrical stimulation. However, analgesia was significantly increased during electrical
stimulation. The results of our study were similar to those of previous studies and also
showed a statistically significant difference between the different types of electrical
stimulation, but analgesia was significantly increased during electrical stimulation in all
groups.</p><p>Ward et al. reported that subjects experienced the most analgesia from electrical
stimulation and the greatest comfort at a frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz with IFC, as was the case in
our study<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current results and
previous TENS and IFC comparative studies strengthen the conclusion drawn that
low-duty-cycle, burst-modulated AC is more comfortable than conventional low-frequency
pulsed current<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. That 50&#x02005;Hz IFC is an
acceptable treatment is likely a consequence of the lesser discomfort.</p><p>We conclude that there were no differences in the analgesic effects of the four
interventions under the present experimental conditions. However, 50&#x02005;Hz IFC is more
comfortable than other interventions and is likely to be better accepted and tolerated by
patients. Further clinical investigation is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Sahmyook University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tiktinsky</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Narayan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Electrotherapy: yesterday, today and
