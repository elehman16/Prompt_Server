Our study aims to contribute to that evidence base by investigating the effectiveness of combining two complementary approaches for control of STH: periodic mass administration of albendazole, and delivery of a community-based WASH programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>WASH for WORMS is a cluster-randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a community-based WASH intervention integrated with periodic mass distribution of albendazole will be more effective in reducing infections with STH and protozoa than mass deworming alone. All 18 participating rural communities in Timor-Leste receive mass chemotherapy every 6&#x02005;months. Half the communities also receive the community-based WASH programme. Primary outcomes are the cumulative incidence of infection with STH. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of protozoa; intensity of infection with STH; as well as morbidity indicators (anaemia, stunting and wasting). Each of the trial outcomes will be compared between control and intervention communities. End points will be measured 2&#x02005;years after the first albendazole distribution; and midpoints are measured at 6&#x02005;months intervals (12&#x02005;months for haemoglobin and anthropometric indexes). Mixed-methods research will also be conducted in order to identify barriers and enablers associated with the acceptability and uptake of the WASH programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the human ethics committees at the University of Queensland, Australian National University, Timorese Ministry of Health, and University of Melbourne. The results of the trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals presented at national and international conferences, and disseminated to relevant stakeholders in health and WASH programmes.

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Continued international interest in parasitic disease control, as embodied by the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) in 2012, saw several pharmaceutical companies and global health institutions announce their commitment to meet the revised target of 75% deworming coverage of school-age children at risk by 2020, with significant donations of anthelminthic drugs promised.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>As adult worms, STH inhabit the host intestine where they are able to survive for several years and produce large numbers of eggs starting 5&#x02013;11&#x02005;weeks after infection.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Once passed during defaecation, <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>T. trichiura</italic> eggs can remain viable in the soil for several months, and hatched hookworm larvae for several weeks.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> STH infections occur through accidental ingestion of&#x000a0;<italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>T. trichiura</italic> eggs and through oral ingestion or penetration of the skin by hookworm larvae.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Transmission of protozoal parasites can be direct through person-to-person and animal-to-person contact, or via the ingestion of water or foods contaminated with faeces containing protozoal oocysts and cysts.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Deworming treatment only has immediate impacts on killing the adult parasites within the human host and does not prevent rapid reinfection if the host contacts an environment contaminated with infective stages of the parasites.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Therefore, in the absence of improved sanitation and personal hygiene, the prevalence of infection will return to pretreatment levels within 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;months of a single round of deworming.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;25</xref> Chemotherapeutic interventions successfully act to reduce morbidity caused by STH infection in the short term, however, for longer term control, deworming interventions must be repeated periodically.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Another concern associated with the scale-up of periodic deworming campaigns is the risk for drug resistance to occur, similarly to what has been reported in veterinary parasitology.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> For longer term and sustainable reduction in parasite-associated morbidity due to STH, additional control strategies, based on improved water access, sanitation and hygiene, are required.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> On the other hand, there are limited studies rigorously quantifying the additional benefit of WASH on STH infections,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>

<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> When considering the three components of WASH, the only sufficiently powered RCT, to date, reported on a school-based WASH intervention describing a 44% reduction in <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> reinfection in the intervention arm (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00), but no effect on <italic>T. trichiura</italic> or hookworm.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported RCT adequately powered to evaluate the impact of integrated community-based WASH and mass chemotherapy programmes on gastrointestinal parasitic infections, although there are two similar intervention studies under way in Kenya and Bangladesh.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>In order to address these key evidence gaps, the WASH for WORMS trial aims to test the hypothesis that a community-based WASH programme integrated with mass chemotherapy with the benzamidazole anthelmintic drug, albendazole, will reduce infections with gastrointestinal parasites above that achieved through mass deworming alone.

Cluster units are small rural communities in Manufahi district, Timor-Leste. This design was deemed appropriate because in this study the WASH programmes are implemented at the community level. All participating communities receive mass chemotherapy with single dose of albendazole 400&#x02005;mg every 6&#x02005;months, in accordance with WHO guidelines. Half the communities also receive the community-based WASH programme. The follow-up period is 2&#x02005;years following the first albendazole distribution, during which four additional (6-monthly) rounds of chemotherapy are delivered. The study was initiated in May 2012, and field work will end in April 2016. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Registration number ACTRN12614000680662). This study was registered after the baseline surveys were conducted, due to logistical and human resources constraints, but did not impair the study quality, nor the ethical procedures described below. At the time of registration, only baseline data had been collected, and no study outcomes had been measured; furthermore, the study has been managed throughout according to protocols developed prior to data collection.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009293F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the proposed cluster-randomised controlled trial.

<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Malnutrition and infectious diseases (including pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, dengue and tuberculosis) are major child health problems.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> A recent national STH survey, carried out in all 13 districts of the country in 2012, revealed a national infection prevalence of 29% in children aged between 7 and 16&#x02005;years of age, with Manufahi being one of the six districts with the highest prevalence of STH infection.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The high prevalence of STH infection in Timor-Leste strongly supports the need for an STH control programme. In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) initiated a deworming programme, with support from WHO, known as &#x02018;<italic>Lumbriga&#x02026;Mak Lae Duni</italic>&#x02019; (Worms, no way!); the programme ceased in 2008 due to a shortage of funding. The MoH recently developed a National Integrated Plan for NTD control, which includes STH infections. Funds required for 2014 are estimated at US$1.3 million followed by US$1 million per year for subsequent years. Owing to limited available resources, the MoH plans to restart the implementation of the programme in 2015 in a limited number of districts.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Integrated intervention</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Community-based WASH programme</title><p>The non-governmental organisation (NGO), WaterAid Australia, has been working in Manufahi since 2012 on the improvement of the water and sanitation infrastructure, and is the implementer of the WASH intervention being evaluated in this trial in terms of impact on STH infection. The WASH intervention has three main elements:
<list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Providing access to safe, adequate and convenient water supplies. WaterAid adopts a Community Management approach aimed at sustainable and optimal use of available water resources.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> WaterAid, through its local NGO partners, supports the community with the water supply system design and construction. During the Community Action Plan (CAP), a staged series of meetings that includes historical and gender analysis, WASH situation analysis, awareness raising and capacity building; there is the establishment of the Water User Group (also called the Grupu Maneja Facilidade (GMF) committee), consultations on the water supply system and technology options and, finally, planning of the construction of the water system. The majority of the water supply systems built are gravity-fed schemes whereby water is transmitted down to communities from higher water sources (eg, springs or small unpolluted streams). In areas where elevated water sources are not available, groundwater supply systems (eg, borehole with hand pump) are selected as one of the options. On gravity-fed schemes, the water is tapped, dammed and protected at its source before being piped to storage tanks near, or in, communities. Distribution pipes then feed protected tap stands, thus allowing water to be accessed by the community, with the maximum distance between each dwelling and collection point of 200&#x02005;m (or less than 5&#x02005;min round trip walking time). The construction process can take up to 10&#x02005;months to complete, dependent on the community motivation and the water supply system size. During this process, the technical staff from the local NGO partner work together with the community on a daily basis with regular (at least once in a fortnight) support and mentoring from WaterAid technical staff.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing access to sanitation, particularly household latrines. This is achieved by increasing demand for improved sanitation, using a strategy inspired by the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) process. CLTS was pioneered by WaterAid and Village Education Resource Center in Bangladesh in 2000, and is now used in many countries as a technique for mobilising communities to eliminate open defaecation through social awakening rather than merely providing toilets.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> A key feature of the CLTS technique is the &#x02018;triggering&#x02019; process which comprises several community activities, ideally culminating in the community deciding not to practise open defaecation, and to build their own latrines. In its original form, CLTS attempts to &#x02018;trigger&#x02019; people's disgust and shame at open defaecation practices.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> WaterAid and local NGO facilitators convene the &#x02018;triggering&#x02019; and engagement meeting, which usually lasts 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;days, prior to the CAP described above. The community activities comprise a transect walk through the community with the residents to identify open defaecation sites; creating a community map (usually on the ground with coloured chalk) of village boundaries, roads, residents&#x02019; houses, water points, open defaecation sites and any toilets; as well as presentations of various WASH-related health messages. After options for hygiene improvement are discussed, agreement with communities is reached to end open defaecation, and regarding the predicted schedule for household latrine construction. The most common types of latrine that are built are simple direct pit latrine, and the offset pit pour-flush latrine. The pits are generally at least 2&#x02005;m deep, and completely above the water table. WaterAid and partners explain how to build a squat slab covering the pit, which should be strong and easy to clean, and with a lid to prevent flies coming into contact with faeces. These may be precast away from the pit and then placed over it, and can be used for direct and offset pit latrines. Slabs made from local timber and compacted earth are also often used. A shelter using local materials is then built to provide privacy and shelter. Care is taken to ensure that water resources are not compromised by sanitation activities through follow-up guidance to communities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improving hygiene behaviour, especially hand washing with soap at critical times. WaterAid and local partner NGOs use a combination of approaches to hygiene promotion, in addition to CLTS messaging, that target various target groups including households, children, women and community clusters, as well as the community in general, using various Information, Education and Communication materials (eg, flashcards, flipcharts, posters, snakes and ladders games, songs and video).

All these activities are conducted within a period of 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;months usually once in every 2&#x02005;weeks by the community hygiene promotion volunteer and partner NGO staff with regular support from WaterAid's staff.</p></list-item></list></p><p>While the WASH intervention is being implemented, there is monitoring of the construction of the household latrines and hand washing stations by local NGO staff and the community Water User Group leader.

Furthermore, WaterAid verifies the completion of the water supply system and carries out physical and microbiological water quality tests. Finally, every 6&#x02005;months, for 2&#x02005;years after the WASH intervention is completed, there are Post-Intervention Monitoring and Evaluation visits, where WaterAid, along with the Department of Water Services, assists the community Water User Group to conduct maintenance activities of the water supply system, and monitors the household latrine and hand washing station status.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Mass administration of albendazole</title><p>Albendazole is offered to all eligible members of the community regardless of whether they participate in the study. Children under 1&#x02005;year of age, and pregnant women in the first trimester, are excluded. Administration of a single oral dose of 400&#x02005;mg albendazole (Albenza, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA) is observed by the study team for each participating individual. Children under 2&#x02005;years of age take half the dose.</p><p>In the intervention communities, the first round of mass distribution of albendazole was triggered by a sanitation intervention threshold, that is, 80% of households having a latrine. This information was provided by WaterAid based on routine visits to the intervention communities by their local NGO partners. In the control communities, albendazole administration was timed such that the lag between the baseline surveys and mass chemotherapy was as close as possible to that of the intervention communities. Thus, the first round of mass chemotherapy involved a second visit to each community that happened between 2 and 6&#x02005;months after the baseline surveys. For the four follow-up surveys, albendazole is administered directly after collection of faecal specimens, meaning, that each community is visited once per round.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes are 6-month cumulative incidence of infection with <italic>Ascaris</italic> spp, <italic>T. trichiura</italic>, <italic>N. americanus</italic> and <italic>Ancylostoma</italic> spp (undifferentiated), measured at each of the four follow-ups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009293TB1">table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, our choice of estimate of impact had the following rationale: (1) it would not be logistically feasible in our setting to run a trial capable of detecting smaller intervention effects (eg, it would require a number of clusters that exceeds implementation capacity of WaterAid) and (2) we believe that the scale-up of WASH interventions as tools for STH control is not likely to occur if there is not a sufficiently large benefit compared to the MDA only.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Selection of communities and randomisation</title><p>WaterAid works from the Timor-Leste government's district water infrastructure plan, which includes all villages that require assistance with water facilities, and prioritises them according to need.

Additionally, two intervention and two control clusters were replaced given that the originally selected clusters did not meet the inclusion criteria: one intervention and one control cluster were deemed too close, thus posing high risk of contamination; another control had high latrine coverage, and the other intervention community was targeted by the government to receive a water intervention. The replacement clusters were randomly allocated to the intervention and control arms from a replacement list of four communities assessed by WaterAid.</p><p>During the follow-up period, one of the intervention communities withdrew due to the fact that the previously identified water sources were deemed to have an insufficient water debit for WaterAid to implement the planned water intervention.

Once at the community, the trial was initially discussed with community leaders: the objectives and design of the study were explained to them, and their support and commitment was sought. At the end of the &#x02018;triggering&#x02019; meeting, where community members are assembled at a central location (a school, health centre or house of the community leader), the WASH for WORMS trial was explained to the assembly, facilitated by the trial staff, assisted by community leaders and WaterAid staff. The GMF committee elected in each cluster by the community, as per WaterAid suggestion, was recruited to also work as the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) for the research study. In control communities, a similar approach was implemented by the trial field team (initial meeting with the community chief, followed by community assembly and election of CAC).</p><p>Baseline parasitological surveys were then conducted in each community.

This was staggered over an 18-month period in 2012 and 2013, due to WaterAid implementation capacity, and, to avoid temporal confounding due to seasonal variation in transmission of gastrointestinal parasites, surveys conducted in intervention communities were alternated with surveys conducted in control communities. All members of the selected communities (over 1&#x02005;year of age) were eligible for inclusion in the trial at baseline, provided that they, or a parent or guardian, were able to provide informed consent. During the follow-up visits, new residents or babies who turned 1&#x02005;year, were invited to participate.
