<bold>BACKGROUND:</bold> Five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is used for fluorescence-guided resections of malignant glioma at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg; yet, it is unknown whether lower doses may also provide efficacy.</p><p>
<bold>OBJECTIVE:</bold> To perform a double-blinded randomized study comparing 3 different doses of 5-ALA.</p><p>
<bold>METHODS:</bold> Twenty-one patients with suspected malignant glioma were randomly assigned to 0.2, 2, or 20&#x000a0;mg/kg 5-ALA. Investigators were unaware of dose. Intraoperatively, regions of interest were first defined in tumor core, margin, and adjacent white matter under white light. Under violet&#x02013;blue illumination, the surgeon's impression of fluorescence was recorded per region, followed by spectrometry and biopsy. Plasma was collected after administration and analyzed for 5-ALA and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) content.</p><p>
<bold>RESULTS:</bold> The positive predictive value of fluorescence was 100%. Visual and spectrometric fluorescence assessment showed 20&#x000a0;mg/kg to elicit the strongest fluorescence in tumor core and margins, which correlated with cell density. Spectrometric and visual fluorescence correlated significantly. A 10-fold increase in 5-ALA dose (2-20&#x000a0;mg/kg) resulted in a 4-fold increase of fluorescence contrast between marginal tumor and adjacent brain. t<sub>max</sub> for 5-ALA was 0.94 h for 20&#x000a0;mg/kg (0.2 kg: 0.50 h, 2 mg/kg: 0.61 h). Integrated PPIX plasma levels were 255.8 and 779.9 mcg*h/l (2 vs 20&#x000a0;mg/kg). Peak plasma concentrations were observed at 1.89 &#x000b1; 0.71 and 7.83 &#x000b1; 0.68 h (2 vs 20&#x000a0;mg/kg; average &#x000b1; Standard Error of Mean [SEM]).</p><p>
<bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> The highest visible and measurable fluorescence was yielded by 20&#x000a0;mg/kg. No fluorescence was elicited at 0.2 mg/kg. Increasing 5-ALA doses did not result in proportional increases in tissue fluorescence or PPIX accumulation in plasma, indicating that doses higher than 20&#x000a0;mg/kg will not elicit useful increases in fluorescence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="keywords"><kwd>Fluorescence-guided resections</kwd><kwd>Malignant glioma</kwd><kwd>5-ALA</kwd><kwd>Aminolevulinic acid</kwd><kwd>Randomized study</kwd><kwd>Spectrography</kwd><kwd>Histology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><def-list><title>ABBREVIATIONS</title><def-item><term>5-ALA</term><def><p>five-aminolevulinic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b.w.</term><def><p>body weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p>central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GBM</term><def><p>glioblastoma multiforme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KPS</term><def><p>Karnofsky Performance Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIH</term><def><p>National Institute of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPIX</term><def><p>protoporphyrin IX</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>Standard Error of Mean</p></def></def-item></def-list><p>
<bold>F</bold>ive-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) elicits the accumulation of fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in malignant glioma tissue and is used for fluorescence-guided resections.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>However, little is known regarding PPIX pharmacokinetics after administration of 5-ALA, which is employed at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight (b.w.) for brain tumor surgery. The use of lower doses of 5-ALA for brain tumor surgery has been reported. For example, Haj-Hosseini et al<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> administered only 5 mg/kg b.w. 5-ALA for detecting tumor fluorescence using a touch pointer with a diode laser light source and 405 nm light for fluorescence excitation. We have used 10 mg/kg in our initial experience but felt 20&#x000a0;mg/kg to be better without providing firm evidence.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thus, it is unknown whether lower doses of 5-ALA might be equally efficacious for eliciting visually perceivable fluorescence and where the lower threshold for a useful dosage is.</p><p>5-ALA is not without systemic side effects, especially at high doses, at which nausea, vomiting, and cardiovascular reactions have been noted.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Even at 20&#x000a0;mg/kg, patients may develop skin phototoxicity and a significant but temporary increase in liver enzymes.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Therefore, lower doses of 5-ALA might be preferable. Here we address the question of whether lower doses of 5-ALA elicit enough fluorescence for macroscopic detection of residual tumor, ie, through the operating microscope. Due to the many confounders such a study might have, we have designed a randomized, double-blind study investigating 0.2, 2, and 20&#x000a0;mg/kg b.w. of 5-ALA, determining fluorescence accumulation both macroscopically and spectrometrically, correlating these findings with tumor cell density, and determining the usefulness of the observed fluorescence for supporting fluorescence-guided resections. A secondary focus was on toxicological side effects.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, 3-dose level phase I/II trial was performed in accordance with good clinical practice and sponsored by Medac, Hamburg, Germany. The study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, Germany (Project-No. 029/00) and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02755142). The dose levels 0.2 and 2 mg/kg of 5-ALA are below the approved dose in Europe and thus off label. No approval for 5-ALA is available in the United States as yet.</p><p>The study included males and females aged 18 to 75 years, a Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of &#x02265;70%, with magnetic resonance imaging suggestive for malignant gliomas WHO grade III or IV, for whom surgical treatment was indicated and who had had no other operation or tumor-specific pretreatments. Patients with porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrins, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or malignomas (except for basaliomas) were excluded. Each patient's written informed consent was required.</p><p>All patients received 3 &#x000d7; 4 mg of dexamethasone at least 2 days prior to surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study Objectives</title><p>The primary study objective was to detect a dose&#x02013;efficacy relationship between drug dose and overall tumor fluorescence as perceived by the surgeon under the operating microscope (NC4 OPMI Fluoro, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For tumor resection, the surgeon could alternate freely between white and blue illumination. After resection of necrotic tumor regions, the global fluorescence impression of residual solid core tumor (as identified under white light illumination) was determined. It was estimated whether approximately 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 of the tumor core as identified under white light revealed fluorescence (irrespective of fluorescence quality). In addition, the surgeon assessed the general fluorescence quality in the tumor core on a 3-tiered scale (&#x0201c;strong,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;weak,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; fluorescence).</p><p>Secondary objectives encompassed spectrographic measurements of fluorescence in 3 predefined tissue regions: viable (non-necrotic) tumor core, marginal tumor, and adjacent, normally appearing tissue. These measurements were correlated with the macroscopic fluorescence impression and histology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In detail, 3 different tissue regions were identified under white light and the microscope subsequently switched to blue light. Macroscopic fluorescence impressions were recorded in the predefined regions, followed by spectrographic measurements at 2 sites, which were averaged, followed by 1 biopsy in each region. If different fluorescence qualities (weak, strong, or no fluorescence) were perceived in a single-tissue region, these qualities were assessed individually, ie, with 2 spectrographic measurements and 1&#x000a0;biopsy each.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Procedure for sampling and spectrometry. In a first step, after removal of necrotic tumor, regions of interest were identified under white light consisting of non-necrotic solid tumor (core), marginal tumor, and normal adjacent tissue under normal white light illumination.

Because this was a double-blinded, randomized study and it was unknown to what extent fluorescence would be visible in a given patient, it was not permissible to define the areas for spectrographic measurement by the fluorescence impression.</p><p>Spectrography was performed in Situ using the D-Light System (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) coupled to a fiber probe array consisting of a centrally arranged 400-&#x003bc;m detection fiber surrounded by 6400-&#x003bc;m excitation fibers (TuiLaser AG, Munich, D), as previously described.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The detection fiber was coupled to an S2000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Eerbeek, the Netherlands). Excitation light was filtered by a longpass filter (435 nm) to block reflected excitation light. Measurements were performed in freshly exposed tissue to minimize fluorophore degeneration by photobleaching. Three spectra were obtained at each individual site and averaged. All spectra were normalized relative to a fluorescent, nonbleaching reference object that fluoresced in the range of the porphyrin spectrum. Reference measurements were obtained prior to each tissue measurement to account for short-term fluctuations in excitation light.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>PPIX exhibits characteristic peaks at 635 nm, which is in the visible red range, and a smaller peak at 704 nm. The latter peak is in the near infrared range and not clearly visible to the human eye. For this reason, the 635-nm peak was used for quantifying fluorescence. To closely approximate visually perceived fluorescence, no corrections were performed for tissue autofluorescence background, absorption, or scattering.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Histology</title><p>Biopsies were analyzed for cell density by estimating the range (min/max) of densities on each histological section. For statistical evaluations, the arithmetic mean of the biopsy-specific minima and maxima was calculated. These means were used to calculate the arithmetic mean of the biopsy-specific means within each fluorescence quality, and within each location (tumor core and tumor margin) for each patient.

The timing of drug administration was initially derived from animal experiments,<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> in which peak tumor fluorescence was noted at 6 h. The dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg, however, was chosen empirically. Higher doses (30-60 mg/kg b.w.) weight have not been used for central nervous system (CNS) tumors and have been reported to have side effects, eg, skin reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms, hemodynamic changes, and increases in liver enzymes.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>In the first published experience,<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> a lower dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. appeared to elicit useful tumor fluorescence. After the first series of patients had been operated on successfully, we increased the dose to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg b.w.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> hoping to evoke more fluorescence and increase contrast to normal tissue. The fluorescence yield from 20&#x000a0;mg/kg was felt to be sufficient, and no additional increments were considered. We did not perform a systematic comparison of 10 and 20&#x000a0;mg/kg b.w. at the time, and with the earlier study we did not obtain spectrometrical measurements of fluorescence to compare earlier patients to the present cohort. Furthermore, the microscope used for the early cohort was a prototype modified from an OPMI 2 with different optical characteristics from our present microscope.</p><p>On the other hand, others have reported useful, albeit spectrographically detected fluorescence with 5 mg/kg b.w.,<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and it is unknown whether lower doses may be equally efficacious, in theory avoiding some of the side effects reported for 20&#x000a0;mg/kg (eg, temporary skin phototoxicity or elevated liver enzymes).</p><p>The present study provides a more systematic approach for answering the question of whether lower doses of 5-ALA might elicit useful fluorescence. An answer to this question is not easily given, as many confounders exist that render such a study difficult, eg, inherent heterogeneity in the fluorescence.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Second, it is unclear how the surgically relevant levels of fluorescence should be determined for such a study. There are objective strategies for quantifying porphyrins and the ensuing fluorescence, such as extraction of porphyrins or by spectrometry with corrections for absorption or scattering.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> However, these assessments may give different results compared to the subjective, visual impression of the neurosurgeon using the microscope due to factors such as illumination geometry and tissue characteristics.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Also, on a microscopic level, there is marked heterogeneity of fluorescence levels in tumor tissue, as again demonstrated in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The influence of fluorescence heterogeneity, illumination geometry, and tissue characteristics lead us to (a) include objective measures, such as spectrometry and semiquantitative blinded histology; (b) perform a randomized, double-blinded study; and (c) to choose exponential rather than linear dosage increments to avoid underpowering the study, reasoning that smaller increments would not allow the detection of significant differences due the many variables influencing fluorescence.</p><p>Higher doses than 20&#x000a0;mg/kg b.w. were not considered due to the previously described side effects. In retrospect, this decision was well justified, because we found a 10-fold increase in ALA dose (2-20&#x000a0;mg/kg) to result in only a 4-fold increase in the fluorescence ratio or contrast between marginal tumor and adjacent brain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). Discrimination of marginal tumor from normal brain is the most decisive advantage of fluorescence-guided resections.</p><p>Correspondingly, our pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that the AUC of PPIX in plasma also only increased by a factor of 3 with the 10-fold 5-ALA dose, and the maximal concentration of PPIX increased by a factor of 3.7. The comparably weak increase in PPIX yields was not the consequence of less bioavailability of 5-ALA at higher doses. The AUC for 5-ALA was almost proportional to the applied dose. Thus, it is unlikely that exposure to more 5-ALA simply translates into more PPIX. Rather, the capacity of PPIX accumulation as a response to excess exogenous 5-ALA appears restricted. This was our past experience<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and the experience of others<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> with cell lines incubated continuously in 5-ALA. In these experiments, fluorescence began to plateau after 120 min. Heme biosynthesis under physiological circumstances is governed by specific feedback inhibition of ALA synthetase. As this step is overcome by simply administrating excess 5-ALA, physiological inhibition does not explain the restrictions to this accumulation. To our knowledge, there is no other known specific, receptor-mediated inhibition of any of the other enzymes involved in porphyrin synthesis. Therefore, we must conclude that the downstream build-up of porphyrins at some point simply prevents further synthesis via the enzymes.</p><p>Another important finding was the time of plasma PPIX maxima. This was observed at 8 h, which was later than our in Vivo experiments, in which maximal brain tumor fluorescence was observed at 6&#x000a0;h<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> with lower levels at 3 and 9 h. Similar time frames were observed in skin (maximum between 6.5 and 9.8 h)<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and blood cells (between 4 and 8&#x000a0;h).<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although attempts at extrapolating plasma levels to tumor tissue in the brain are speculative, they are supported by observations in renal and bladder cancer. Inoue et al (2103)<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and Ishizuka et al (2011)<sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> find that only patients with tumor showed increases of plasma PPIX in response to 5-ALA administration. This indicates that plasma porphyrins originate in the tumor. Measuring porphyrins within malignant gliomas tissue would have been a preferable way for assessing the kinetics of tumor porphyrins, but any such measurements over hours in patients would not have been wrought with insurmountable hurdles.</p><p>Overall, however, we believe that our observation of peak PPIX levels at 8 h after administration suggests that 5-ALA might be given earlier than previously recommended, ie, 4 to 5 h prior to anesthesia.</p><p>Finally, peak ALA concentrations in plasma were observed within 1&#x000a0;h, falling rapidly thereafter. This observation corroborates that 5-ALA, a small molecule with 131 daltons, is rapidly absorbed from the digestive tract. This observation mitigates concerns regarding the application of 5-ALA in significant volumes of tap water 3 h prior to anesthesia and questions any necessity for an intravenous application. Others have found peak concentrations at 30 min using 40 mg/kg.<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Histology and Fluorescence</title><p>The present study confirms the high positive predictive value of fluorescence<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> revealing infiltrating tumor of a cell density as low as 25%.

In addition, the surgeons&#x02019; assessments of the magnitude and distribution of fluorescence may appear somewhat crude and less objective than spectrography.
