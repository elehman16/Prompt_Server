Postoperative (POP) pain is the most common complaint after surgery. Pain after midline laparotomy is derived from multiple origins, for example, the abdominal wall and viscera, and from peritoneal irritation. Therefore, a single agent or pain-relieving technique is seldom sufficient for POP pain management. Thus, multimodal analgesia is usually applied. Multimodal treatment of POP pain may include nonopioid analgesics, paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), regional blocks, and opioids.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Opioid analgesics are needed for moderate and severe pain and are especially effective for controlling nociceptive and visceral pain. However, people differ significantly in their responses to opioid analgesics. People who regularly use opioids for chronic pain conditions or who are rapid metabolizers may need larger doses to obtain sufficient analgesic efficiency. By contrast, some people are highly sensitive to opioids and are thus at increased risk of developing adverse effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Purely opioid-based analgesic techniques are not preferred in abdominal surgery. Opioid peptide receptors are widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract, and so opioid analgesics impair bowel function.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Opioids are associated with a risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia which may deteriorate patients&#x02019; recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>To overcome problems associated with higher doses of opioid analgesics, regional blocks are increasingly used.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Rectus sheath block (RSB) is an appropriate technique for midline laparotomy. Nerves enter the midline of the abdomen wall from both sides of the spinal cord roots following dermatomes Th6-L1. These nerves pass between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. They branch and communicate widely within the transversus abdominis plane and around the deep inferior epigastric artery. RSB aims to block these nerves when they pass from the posterior layer of the rectus sheath to the rectus muscle. Nerves from dermatomes Th7-L1 innervate the skin and fascia at the midline.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>The data are inconsistent concerning RSB's analgesic efficacy and POP opioid-sparing efficacy. Therefore, we designed the present study, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RSB in midline laparotomy. We compared 3 different local anesthetic modalities for administering RSB. The primary objective of our study was to evaluate whether RSB has an opioid-sparing efficacy, evaluated by the rescue opioid consumption with iv-patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and plasma oxycodone concentrations, in POP pain management during the first 48 POP h. The secondary outcome was to determine whether RSB could enhance patients&#x02019; satisfaction with POP analgesia. The safety of RSB was determined by analyzing the plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine and by recording all adverse events (AEs) during the hospital stay. Our study's hypothesis was that RSB might decrease opioid need, enhance pain relief, and improve patients&#x02019; satisfaction after midline laparotomy without compromising patient safety.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study design was a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with 4 parallel groups. The study was conducted at Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland, between June 2012 and December 2015. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital District of Northern Savo, Kuopio (No. 120//2011) and was registered with EudraCT (2011-005136-25) and the Clinical Trials database (NCT02869841). The Finnish Medicines Agency was notified (128/2011). The study received institutional approval and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All the subjects gave an informed consent.</p><p>Patients undergoing midline laparotomy were eligible for this study. The surgeries were gynecological, prostate, urinary bladder, and colorectal cancer operations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Participants were enrolled by the investigators. We did not enroll patients who were aged under 18 or over 80 years, who had a body mass index &#x0003c;18 or over 35&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who were pregnant or nursing, or who had contraindications to local anesthetics or opioid analgesics or their excipients. We did not enroll patients who required a relaparotomy during the same hospital stay and those who were unable to use an iv-PCA pump.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient demographics and the type of surgery (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;57).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9968-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The patients were randomized into 4 groups: single-dose, repeated-doses, continuous infiltration, and control groups. The randomization was computer generated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">www.randomization.com</ext-link>) and was concealed until the end of the surgery using the sealed opaque envelope method.</p><p>Endotracheal anesthesia was standardized. Patients were given midazolam 1 to 2&#x0200a;mg i.v., and thiopental and propofol i.v. were used to induce anesthesia. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 0.5&#x0200a;mg i.v. To ensure an adequate level of anesthesia, response entropy indexes were kept between 40 and 60 throughout the anesthesia by adjusting the inhaled desflurane concentration accordingly. Remifentanil infusion 0.5 to 2.0&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg per min was used for intraoperative analgesia. The lungs were ventilated with oxygen 35% in air with positive pressure ventilation. At the end of anesthesia, muscle relaxation was reversed with sugammadex. Remifentanil infusion 0.1&#x0200a;mg/h was continued for the first POP hour in the recovery room. The patients&#x02019; vital parameters, blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, central temperature, neuromuscular block, anesthetic gases, oxygen, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure were monitored continuously (Carescape B650, GE Healthcare Finland, Helsinki, Finland) during the anesthesia.</p><p>In all groups except the control group, 2 rectus sheath catheters (InfiltraLong, Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) were inserted bilaterally before wound closure through separate skin punctures 4 or 5 cm cephalad to the incision using disposable blunt rods with sheaths. All surgeons placing the catheters were adequately trained and experienced with surgical placement of RSB catheters. Rod insertion was guided by the surgeon's hand in the abdomen to prevent posterior sheet perforations and aim toward the space between the muscle and the posterior sheath in the lateral half, where the nerves enter the muscle. All patients except those in the control group received 25&#x0200a;mg/20&#x0200a;mL levobupivacaine (Chirocaine 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL AbbVie, Espoo, Finland) in both catheters for a total dose of 50&#x0200a;mg (flow chart, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9968-g002"/></fig><p>In the single-dose group, the rectus sheath catheters were removed after the first dose, and the incisions were covered with wound dressings. Similar wound dressing was used for the control group.</p><p>After the initial dose, the patients in the repeated-doses group received levobupivacaine 12.5&#x0200a;mg/10&#x0200a;mL in both catheters for a total dose of 25&#x0200a;mg every 4 h for the first 24 to 48&#x0200a;h postoperatively. In the infusion group, a local anesthetic infusion of levobupivacaine 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL was started with Autofuser pumps (ACE Medical, Seoul, Korea) at a rate of 5&#x0200a;mL/h for both catheters for a total dose 12.5&#x0200a;mg/h immediately after the initial dose and was continued for 48&#x0200a;h or until discharge, whichever was sooner. The patients in the control group did not receive any local anesthetic injections or infiltrations.</p><p>A patient-controlled analgesia pump with a bolus dose of 2&#x0200a;mg of oxycodone, a lock-out interval of 10&#x0200a;min and a maximum dose of 12&#x0200a;mg/h was used for rescue analgesia. For background analgesia, the patients were given i.v. paracetamol 4&#x0200a;g/24&#x0200a;h or 3&#x0200a;g/24&#x0200a;h if the patient weighed &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;kg.</p><p>Pain at rest, dynamic pain experienced when the wound area was pressed with 20&#x0200a;N force and pain when coughing were measured in the recovery room and surgical ward using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no pain, 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;most pain).<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Patients&#x02019; satisfaction with the analgesia was determined at 48&#x0200a;h after surgery using the NRS (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;totally unsatisfied, 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;totally satisfied).</p><p>Blood samples for plasma levobupivacaine concentration analysis were taken at anesthesia induction and postoperatively 15 and 30&#x0200a;min and 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24&#x0200a;h after the first dose. In the infusion group, blood samples were also taken for analysis 15 and 30&#x0200a;min and 1, 2, and 4&#x0200a;h after the end of the infusion. In the repeated-doses group, a blood sample was taken 2&#x0200a;h after the last dose. The blood samples were centrifuged at 2500g for 10&#x0200a;min and EDTA-blood 1000g for 15&#x0200a;min at 20 to 25&#x000b0;C and stored at &#x02212;72&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>Levobupivacaine concentrations were measured using quantitative liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection (LC/MS/MS). The LC/MS/MS method was based on the previously published method by Hoizey et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> The lower limit of quantification in plasma samples for levobupivacaine was 12.5&#x0200a;ng/mL. This LC/MS/MS method was selective, accurate, and precise for concentrations within a calibration range of 12.5 to 5000&#x0200a;ng/mL for plasma. Plasma oxycodone concentrations were analyzed in the blood samples taken at 12, 24, and 48&#x0200a;h after surgery, and the cumulative oxycodone consumption was recorded at the same time points. The method of oxycodone analysis has been described elsewhere.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>The primary outcome measure was the amount of rescue analgesic required during the 48&#x0200a;h postoperatively. As secondary outcomes, we recorded pain scores and patients&#x02019; satisfaction. As a safety outcome, we measured plasma levobupivacaine concentrations and oxycodone concentrations 24&#x0200a;h after surgery, and all AEs were recorded during the hospital stay.</p><p>A sample size calculation indicated that to obtain a 30% decrease in the assumed opioid need of 20&#x0200a;mg (standard deviation 5) of oxycodone during the 24&#x0200a;h postoperatively with a desired power of 0.9 and a significance level of 0.05, 15 patients were needed in each group.</p><p>The data were entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS 23.0 (International Business Machine Corporation, Armonk, NY). To analyze the differences between groups, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. For continuous variables; we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Group differences at different time points were tested using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Kruskall&#x02013;Wallis test, as appropriate. The results are presented as medians with range because the distributions were skewed. Data were analyzed by the intent-to-treat approach.

In 2 cases, the midline laparotomy was changed to a minimally invasive procedure. In 1 patient, the analgesia was changed to epidural block. Thus, a total of 57 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis, 12 in the control group, 16 in the single-dose group, 12 in the repeated-doses group, and 17 in the infusion group.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Protocol deviations</title><p>The adherence rate to the study protocol was high and data were available for all patients for entire 48&#x0200a;h study period. There were a few protocol deviations unlikely to affect the study results. One patient in the control group received the CYP 3A4 inductor medication carbamazepine. Her oxycodone consumption during the first 24&#x0200a;h was 173&#x0200a;mg, and her plasma oxycodone concentration 49&#x0200a;ng/mL, noroxycodone was 41&#x0200a;ng/mL, noroxymorphone was 21&#x0200a;ng/mL, and oxymorphone was 0.8&#x0200a;ng/mL. For 1 patient in the single-dose group and 1 in the control group, the PCA was stopped on the second POP afternoon due to protracted nausea. In the single-dose group, 1 patient lost the venous catheter on second POP day, and PCA was considered unnecessary and stopped at 47&#x0200a;h.</p><p>There were problems with rectus sheath catheters in 6 patients and with 7 catheters. One catheter of a patient in the infusion group and one of a patient in the repeated-doses group leaked. The catheters of 3 patients in the infusion group (1 patient's first catheter on the first POP morning and her second catheter at 36&#x0200a;h, 1 patient's catheter on the first POP evening, and 1 patient's catheter on the second POP morning) were accidentally detached. One catheter of a patient in the infusion group was constricted with sutures, leading to uneven dosing during the 48&#x0200a;h postoperatively.</p><p>One patient randomized to the continuous infusion group accidentally received 5&#x0200a;mg/mL, not 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL levobupivacaine as the starting dose (40&#x0200a;mL, for a total dose of 200&#x0200a;mg), which exceeded the safety limit of 150&#x0200a;mg but did not prompt any local or systemic toxic reactions. Infusion was postponed for 9 h, after which she was followed and treated in compliance with the study protocol. Her recovery was uneventful and she was totally satisfied (NRS 10) with the pain treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Oxycodone consumption and plasma concentrations</title><p>During the first 12&#x0200a;h postoperatively, oxycodone consumption was less in the infusion and repeated-doses groups than in the single-dose and control groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.07). Thereafter the median oxycodone consumption was similar up to the 48 POP h for the 4 groups, but in numerical values it was less in the repeated-doses group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Interindividual variation in the oxycodone consumption was high, but the variation was lowest also in the repeated-doses group.

Although oxycodone consumption during the first 48 POP h was found to be similar in all 4 groups, the repeated-doses group performed better than the control and the single-dose groups during the early phase of recovery. The dynamic pain scores were low in the repeated-doses group compared with other groups at 4&#x0200a;h and pain scores at rest also at 12 and at 24&#x0200a;h after surgery compared with the control group and the single-dose group, respectively. The patients&#x02019; satisfaction was also highest in the repeated-doses group.</p><p>Conflicting results regarding the efficacy of RSB have been published. Consistent with our findings, in 2 recent studies, RSB has been used as an aspect of multimodal analgesia. In both studies, RSB showed opioid-sparing efficacy and led to low pain ratings in patients undergoing laparotomy; in one of these studies, RSB was performed with repeated doses,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> while the other study used a single dose.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> In the repeated-doses study,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> patients were given both paracetamol and NSAID for background analgesia compared with our study where only scheduled paracetamol was used as NSAIDs were considered contraindicated in early phase of recovery after major abdominal surgery. Contrary to these positive results as a part of multimodal approach, in Padmnabhan's study where nonopioid analgesics were not used, bilateral RSB with bupivacaine 50&#x0200a;mg/20&#x0200a;mL in both catheters at every 8&#x0200a;h for 48&#x0200a;h did not reduce opioid consumption or pain scores compared with the normal saline injections given to the control group.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> In the present study and in Bakshis study,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> the RSB injections were readministered at every 4&#x0200a;h indicating that the 8&#x0200a;h dosing interval in Padmanabhan's study<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> may have been too long to provide constant analgesic efficacy. In agreement with our data, Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> found no opioid sparing efficacy and pain scores were lower only at 1 h after a single-dose RSB block but not thereafter compared with control group with no block.</p><p>Our data indicate that multimodal treatment with RSB may yield greater patients&#x02019; satisfaction, although the use of opioids did not diminish that much. The importance of patients&#x02019; satisfaction has been emphasized in recent years, and healthcare systems seek interventions that may improve patients care.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the patients&#x02019; satisfaction with pain treatment was highest among the patients who received repeated doses. High satisfaction was reported even though the pain ratings were relatively high among some of the patients in this group. An earlier study assessing patients&#x02019; satisfaction with pain treatment after various surgical procedures showed that although 62% had severe POP pain, 87% were satisfied with pain management.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Other studies have also reported this paradoxical finding.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Patients&#x02019; satisfaction depends on many factors. For example, the nature of the disease and the success of the operation may influence patients&#x02019; mental status and experience of pain, as many of our patients underwent surgery due to malignancy. Repeated boluses may be associated placebo effect also. However, to support our data, experience on epidural analgesia shows that bolus doses may result in better distribution of local anesthetic solution and enhanced analgesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>Local anesthetic toxicity is a concern in all regional analgesia techniques that use large doses or continuous infusions. In the present study, neither toxic concentrations nor signs or symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity were observed. This indicates that with the doses used in our study, bilateral RSB with levobupivacaine is a safe technique. The highest levobupivacaine concentration, 1.9&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL, was observed after 48&#x0200a;h of infusion. It decreased to 1.6&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL at 4&#x0200a;h after the cessation of infusion. In the repeated-doses group, the median of C<sub>max</sub> after the fifth injection (0.44&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL) was 2 to 3 times greater than after the first injection (0.19&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL). In the present study, the plasma levobupivacaine concentrations were like those reported by others. After doses were delivered to paired catheters at a total dose of 50&#x0200a;mg, the highest plasma levobupivacaine dose was 0.55&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL; this dose is proportional to that reported for patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, for which C<sub>max</sub> was 0.95&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL at 60 min after RSB injection of levobupivacaine 2.5&#x0200a;mg/kg.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> In that study, C<sub>max</sub> was lower and the increase in plasma concentrations was slower after RSB than after transversus abdominis plane block. This indicates that the local anesthetic toxicity may not be as serious concern with RSB as it is with other high-volume/high-dose blocks. However, after continuous infusion, there is a risk of local anesthetic accumulation. Our data indicate that after continuous infusion, the plasma concentration of levobupivacaine decreases rather slowly, as the plasma concentration at 4&#x0200a;h after the cessation of infusion was only one-fifth lower than that at the end of 48&#x0200a;h of infusion. This decrease is less than expected as the elimination half-life after i.v. dosing of levobupivacaine is relatively short, 1.3&#x0200a;h.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Levobupivacaine has some vasoconstrictive properties that decrease absorption from the infusion site, and rectus sheath space may perform as a reservoir for local anesthetic solutions. These may cause the slow decrease in levobupivacaine concentrations after infusion that was observed in the present study. A special concern relates to plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine when RSB is used for longer than 48&#x0200a;h.</p><p>Plasma oxycodone concentrations were like those reported earlier in patients undergoing cholecystectomy.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the minimum effective concentrations of oxycodone were between 20 to 30&#x0200a;ng/mL, and the highest individual concentration was 85&#x0200a;ng/mL, which is like that reported previously for patients undergoing abdominal surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The main metabolic was noroxycodone, which has weak or no &#x003bc;-opioid receptor activity. Plasma concentrations of active metabolites, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, were much lower, indicating that they probably do not contribute to the analgesic effects of oxycodone.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>One of the main limitations of the present study was the lack of blinding of the different dosing regimens that is challenging in this type of trials. We decided not to use an invasive placebo, thus, the control group did not undergo RSB catheterization. To conceal single-dose and control grouping, similar wound dressings were used in the same places in these 2 groups. The blinding between the control, single-dose, and repeated-doses groups could have been performed using normal saline injections. However, there have been questions regarding the use of invasive placebos with saline and their possible effects on inflammatory mediators and AEs.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup></p><p>Another limitation of the study was the small number of patients in the different groups. Unfortunately, for logistical reasons, we could not recruit a proper sample size of patients. In addition, the selection of surgical operations varied as we had gastrointestinal, gynecological, and urological cases, which reflects the situation in normal clinical practice. However, similar midline approach into the abdominal cavity was used and similar RSB catheterization technique was used in all cases that should have decreased the variability.</p><p>Levobupivacaine 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL was used in the study. Although 2.5&#x0200a;mg/mL concentration could have been expected to give a more prolonged effect, the 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL gives at least as fast an onset of effect with less motor block. Moreover, with levobupivacaine 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL solution, larger volume could be used. That could provide more extensive spread of local anestehtic in dose administration.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In addition, the oxycodone consumed with the iv-PCA may have disturbed the validity of pain enquiries. Some patients did not tolerate the bolus dose of 2&#x0200a;mg that well and some patients, on the other hand, may have benefit a larger dose than the used in this study, 2&#x0200a;mg/10&#x0200a;min. Moreover, the patients underwent different types of surgery and POP pain could be different after gastrointestinal than that after gynecological surgery. Duration of surgery varied a lot and may have affected POP pain, also. However, the distribution of surgical cases and duration of surgeries was similar across the groups.</p><p>Our data could be applied to clinical practice. Data indicate that bilateral RSB with either repeated doses of 10 mL to each side at every 4&#x0200a;h or as a continuous infusion of 5&#x0200a;mL/h for both sides with levobupivacaine 1.25&#x0200a;mg/mL is a feasible option for POP pain management as a part of multimodal pain management protocol after midline laparotomy. With this approach extensive doses of opioids can be avoided and patients&#x02019; satisfaction to pain treatment could be improved.</p><p>In conclusion, pain relief and patients&#x02019; satisfaction were superior in the repeated-doses RSB group. Early opioid consumption for rescue analgesia was less in the repeated-doses and continuous infusion groups than that in the single bolus and control groups. Some very high oxycodone requirements were found in the single-dose and control groups but not in the repeated-doses or continuous infusion groups. The use of RSB may be a feasible aspect of multimodal analgesia treatment after midline laparotomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the oncologic gynecologists of KUH for their strong dedication to this study.
