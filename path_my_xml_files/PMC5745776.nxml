As public support is crucial for policy change, public health advocates need to be equipped with strategies to offset the impact of anti-policy messages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of theory-based public health advocacy messages in generating public support for sugary drink/alcohol policies (increased taxes; sport sponsorship bans) and improving resistance to subsequent anti-policy messages typical of the sugary drink/alcohol industry.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted a two-wave randomised online experiment assigning Australian adults to one of four health policies (sugary drink tax; sugary drink industry sports sponsorship ban; alcohol tax; alcohol industry sports sponsorship ban). Within each health policy, we randomised participants to one of five message conditions: (i) non-advocacy based message about the size and seriousness of the relevant health issue (control); (ii) standard pro-policy arguments alone; (iii) standard pro-policy arguments combined with an inoculation message (forewarning and directly refuting anti-policy arguments from the opposition); (iv) standard pro-policy arguments combined with a narrative message (a short, personal story about an individual&#x02019;s experience of the health issue); or (v) standard pro-policy arguments combined with a composite inoculation and narrative message. At time 1, we exposed participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6000) to their randomly assigned message. Around two weeks later, we re-contacted participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3285) and exposed them to an anti-policy message described as being from a representative of the sugary drink/alcohol industry. Generalised linear models tested for differences between conditions in policy support and anti-industry beliefs at both time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Only the standard argument plus narrative message increased policy support relative to control at time 1.

The tobacco, food, beverage, and alcohol industries direct substantial resources into lobbying against policy reforms that would have an adverse impact on their commercial interests, making it difficult for public health advocates to compete in terms of the volume of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As public support is crucial for policy change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], advocates need to be equipped with strategies to offset the strong opposing arguments propagated by industry groups.</p><p id="Par17">Two theory-based approaches may offer utility in these efforts. First, inoculation messages operate on the premise that people can be protected from future attempts at persuasion by messages that warn them of the impending threat to their attitude and refute anticipated opposing arguments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Key mechanisms posited to be involved in the inoculation process include an increase in perceptions of threat (in this study conceptualised as a threat to the freedom to make up one&#x02019;s own mind about an issue) and greater counter-arguing against persuasive attacks when they are subsequently encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A meta-analysis found inoculation messages to be more effective than one-sided messages (i.e. those that only present arguments in support of a proposition) or no-exposure controls at increasing resistance to subsequent counter-frames [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Inoculation effects can occur irrespective of the direction and strength of pre-existing attitudes toward an issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While originally designed to confer resistance to counter-messages, inoculation messages may also provide an initial persuasive effect by positively influencing attitudes and beliefs immediately following exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Second, narrative messages take the form of a story and focus on the experiences of one or more characters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Narrative messages may lead to persuasion by generating emotional connections with story characters and/or creating high levels of story engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The process of being deeply engaged with a narrative can affect audiences by increasing emotional responding and reducing negative cognitive responses (such as counter-arguing) to the message [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The persuasive impact of narratives can increase over time, suggesting they may be well-suited for competitive framing situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Two recent meta-analyses found that narratives have persuasive effects on changes in attitudes, intentions and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Prior studies conducted in the United States have examined the impact and resilience of separate, print-based inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and narrative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] messages on policy support within a competitive message environment. The present study builds on this research by testing the impact of public health advocacy messages that include inoculation and narrative persuasive components, both separately and in combination, in Australia. To assess the potential benefits for advocates of using inoculation and/or narrative strategies when promoting health policy changes, we compared these messages to a standard advocacy message and to a control message (non-advocacy based message about the relevant issue). We delivered all messages as a simulated radio segment in light of evidence suggesting that audio and video messages, which are common modes of communication for public health advocates, can produce stronger effects for narratives than messages delivered via text [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Two key areas of current policy debate between public health and industry centre on preventing obesity and reducing alcohol-related harms, providing an opportunity to study the efficacy of advocacy messages across multiple topics. Across both issues, public health advocates have emphasised the need for population-level approaches requiring government intervention, such as taxation and restrictions on advertising and sponsorship for unhealthy foods and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In response, these industries typically highlight the role of personal responsibility and attempt to position themselves as being &#x02018;part of the solution&#x02019; by promoting self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The contribution of sugary drinks in driving obesity rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] has been a particular point of contention, with the sugary drink industry employing &#x02018;social responsibility&#x02019; campaigns to protect against claims from the health sector that their products pose serious health concerns and should be subject to stronger legislative controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of advocacy messages containing inoculation and/or narrative components in (a) generating support for four different health policies related to sugary drinks/alcohol, and (b) improving resistance to subsequent anti-policy messages typical of the sugary drink/alcohol industries. Based on theory and prior research, we hypothesise that inoculation and narrative messages (delivered separately and in combination) will produce immediate persuasive effects by increasing policy support and anti-industry beliefs relative to the control message directly after exposure (H1). We further predict that exposure to an inoculation message will provide protective effects by reducing the impact of a subsequent industry anti-policy message, resulting in greater policy support and stronger anti-industry beliefs compared to exposure to the control message at a two-week follow-up (H2). Unlike inoculation messages, narratives are not specifically designed to confer resistance to counter-messages. However, given evidence that the persuasive effects of narrative messages can increase over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we test whether exposure to an advocacy message that only incorporates narrative components offsets the impact of a subsequent industry anti-policy message, delivered around two weeks later (RQ1). We further explore whether inoculation and/or narrative effects are specific to the health policy being explicitly addressed in the message or if they spill-over to other policies related to the same health issue (RQ2). Finally, we test whether inoculation and/or narrative messages produce stronger effects than a standard advocacy message (RQ3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par22">We conducted a two-wave between-subjects online experiment whereby we randomly assigned Australian adults to one of four public health policies: (a) a 20% tax on sugary drinks; (b) removal of sugary drink sponsorship from sport; (c) a volume-based tax on alcohol; or (d) removal of alcohol sponsorship from sport. Within each health policy, we randomised participants to one of five message conditions: (i) non-advocacy based message about the size and seriousness of the relevant issue (control); (ii) standard pro-policy arguments (Standard); (iii) Standard + inoculation (Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;I); (iv) Standard + narrative (Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;N); (v) Standard + inoculation + narrative (Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;I&#x02009;+&#x02009;N). At time 1 (t1), we exposed participants to their randomly assigned message and then asked them questions assessing policy support and anti-industry beliefs to test for immediate persuasive effects of the advocacy messages. Around two weeks later (time 2 (t2)), we exposed participants to an anti-policy message opposing the proposed health policy, then re-assessed policy support and anti-industry beliefs to test for protective effects of the advocacy messages.</p><p id="Par23">We presented all messages in audio format as mock radio segments. We wrote and recorded all messages specifically for the study, with content informed by policy statements and other public materials (including news articles) on both sides of the four health policy debates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Message conditions</title><p id="Par24">All participants heard a short statement read by a radio presenter introducing obesity (sugary drink policies) or alcohol-related harms (alcohol policies) as a major issue in Australia before listening to their assigned message at t1. Participants in the control condition heard nothing other than this introductory statement (mean length across the four health policies: 18.5&#x000a0;s; range: 15&#x02013;22&#x000a0;s). In the Standard condition, the introductory statement was followed by an interview with a fictional public health advocate who presented arguments for why the particular policy proposal should be introduced in Australia (mean length: 186.5&#x000a0;s; range: 175&#x02013;202&#x000a0;s). In the Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;I condition, additional interviewer questions allowed the public health advocate to deliver the inoculation components. The inoculation components included (a) warning the listener that the sugary drink/alcohol industry will try to persuade them to oppose the policy, (b) illuminating the practices and motives of the industry and emphasising that they cannot be trusted, and (c) refuting anticipated industry arguments against the policy (mean length: 246.3&#x000a0;s; range: 230&#x02013;256&#x000a0;s). The Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;N messages featured interviews with both the public health advocate presenting the standard pro-policy arguments and a fictional mother relating her own personal story (i.e. narrative). The mother described her efforts to protect her teenage daughter from harms associated with sugary drink/alcohol consumption, and how they were being undermined by the marketing of these products and their low cost and ready accessibility (mean length: 308.5&#x000a0;s; range: 290&#x02013;330&#x000a0;s).

Both are non-probability based online panels comprising members initially sourced in a variety of ways such as computer-assisted telephone interviews, face-to-face research and online market research databases, and offer members points for completing surveys that can be redeemed for a variety of rewards such as gift cards.

While this finding may appear disappointing at first glance, it does highlight the need to consider experimental designs that accommodate exposure to competing arguments and assessment of responses at multiple time points relative to initial, single message exposure when testing the potential impact of advocacy messages in the real world. As noted earlier, public debates about policies targeting powerful industries (like the sugary drink and alcohol industries) are almost certain to feature widespread exposure to anti-policy arguments propagated by these industries. It is therefore essential to identify message strategies that are successful at countering these anti-policy arguments over time.</p><p id="Par48">Our observation that narrative messages provided resistance to a subsequent anti-policy message runs counter to one previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but is congruent with other experimental work showing delayed persuasive effects of fictional narratives, albeit in the absence of competition from opposing messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is possible that the strong performance of the narrative messages in the present study stems from the fact they induced increased levels of perceived threat to freedom among participants (as per the inoculation message). While the narrative messages were not intentionally designed to influence perceptions of threat to freedom, they may have prompted this response from participants due to the mother describing how her efforts to protect her daughter were being undermined by industry marketing. However, as all participants received the industry anti-policy message at t2, we are unable to separate out protective effects from persuasive effects that grow over time. The mode of delivery may also have been a contributing factor, with suggestions that audio narrative messages are better able to evoke emotions and transport audiences into the story compared to print-based messages, which may be more conducive to rational processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Research that involves manipulation of both the delivery channel and timing of subsequent exposure to the competing message is needed to better understand the comparative short- and long-term effects of print- and audio-based narrative messages in the face of opposing arguments.</p><p id="Par49">Overall, policy support and anti-industry beliefs were lower following exposure to the industry anti-policy message at t2. The inability of the inoculation and/or narrative messages to fully offset the persuasive impact of opposing arguments from the sugary drink and alcohol industry is likely reflective of the strength and recency of the anti-policy message. In general, public opinion is most strongly influenced by the framing of the most recently received message, with the influence of earlier message frames diminishing over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">From this study, there does not appear to be any value in including both inoculation and narrative components within the one advocacy message. It is possible that the combined message did not provide the same protective effect for anti-industry beliefs as the separate inoculation message due to it prompting increased counter-arguing of the advocacy message. The combined message was also around six minutes long and so those exposed to it may have been more easily distracted or more challenged by the task of processing all the differing message elements compared to those exposed to shorter, less cognitively demanding messages. While the literature suggests that longer text narratives are more effective than short text narratives, similar differences in persuasive impact based on message length are not apparent for audio-based narratives (i.e. the communication mode used in our study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further, the influence of message length on the effectiveness of inoculation messages remains unknown, with no studies examining the role of this factor in resistance. Future experiments testing inoculation messages should consider designs that enable the effects of message length to be explored.</p><p id="Par51">There was limited evidence that using inoculation and narrative strategies would provide additional benefit over and above standard pro-policy arguments in garnering public support for policy change when competing against strong industry opposition. However, while the standard advocacy message alone did not protect against the anti-policy message undoing otherwise unfavourable beliefs about the industry, the messages that also included the narrative or inoculation elements did protect against this. It may be that the inoculation and narrative sections were not prominent enough within the broader advocacy message, featuring a public health advocate conveying traditional arguments in support of the policy, to elicit a sufficiently strong persuasive advantage. Indeed, the manipulation check indicated that the narrative message did not successfully reduce counter-arguing of the advocacy message. Avoiding the undermining of negative beliefs about the industry is, however, an important end in itself, especially in light of well-funded efforts by the sugary drink and alcohol industries to cultivate a favourable public image and previous evidence that unfavourable beliefs about these industries are a strong predictor of support for a wide-range of health policies targeting these industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, supplementing standard pro-policy arguments with inoculation or narrative messages may be critical if those messages can reduce favourable attitudes toward these industries.</p><p id="Par52">A number of study limitations should be acknowledged. First, we recruited participants from two non-probability based online panels and achieved a low follow-up rate, with high non-response and dropout attrition also recorded at both time points. Thus the sample cannot be considered representative of the general Australian adult population. However, with the exception of age group (which was included as a covariate in the analyses), the sample profile was comparable across message conditions, suggesting that demographic characteristics did not confound the experiment. Second, to avoid priming and possible carryover/memory effects, we chose not to collect baseline measurements of policy support. Consequently, we could not examine whether participants&#x02019; prior policy attitudes moderated the magnitude or direction of the message effects. Third, in order to test the effects of advocacy messages as they would be implemented in the real world, there was substantial variation in message length across conditions which, due to collinearity, could not be accounted for in our analyses. Nonetheless, our finding that the longest message (i.e. Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;I&#x02009;+&#x02009;N) was not the most effective suggests that additional content did not automatically increase message effectiveness. Fourth, no pilot testing of the advocacy messages or response measures was undertaken. The advocacy messages were, however, modelled upon those used in a previously published study that found effects of inoculation and narrative messages in the context of public health advocates seeking to implement policies to limit the marketing practices of the soda, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, all our response measures were adapted from prior studies assessing the persuasive effects of health messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Fifth, inoculation and narrative are theorised to have multiple but distinct pathways of influence. In an effort to manage respondent burden, we chose not to measure all of these mechanisms, relying on a single manipulation check for each message (perceived threat to freedom for inoculation; reduced counter-arguing for narrative). As noted above, exposure to the narrative conditions did not reduce counter-arguing of the advocacy message as theory would suggest. Nevertheless, exposure to the narrative condition (i.e. Standard&#x02009;+&#x02009;N) produced greater pro-policy attitudes at both t1 and t2 than the control group, suggesting the possibility that other (unmeasured) mechanisms may have been operating. Finally, the advocacy messages were audio-based, so readers should take caution in generalising the results to other message channels (e.g. print, video).</p><p id="Par53">A strength of the present study was that we tested the advocacy messages across two distinct industries and two distinct policy tactics, thus providing stronger evidence regarding the potential utility of inoculation and/or narrative messages for public health advocates than if we had focused on a singular industry and policy tactic. Further, while examination of the covariate results in our regression analyses indicated that participant levels of policy support and anti-industry beliefs did significantly vary according to health policy assignment, we were importantly able to demonstrate, through interaction testing, that the advocacy messages produced comparable effects across policies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The findings from this research highlight the value of designing studies to replicate the real-world competitive messaging environment surrounding health policy issues. Specifically, it was demonstrated that important message effects can be overlooked when focusing solely on the immediate effects of exposure to advocacy messages. There is promising evidence that dissemination of advocacy messages that use inoculation or narrative strategies can make the public more resistant to future efforts at persuasion by industry groups. Future competitive framing research will help to further elucidate the particular conditions under which these effects may occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
