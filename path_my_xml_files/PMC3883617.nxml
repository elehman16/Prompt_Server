Systane Gel Drops is intended for use by patients in need of extra protection against symptoms of severe dry eye. Systane Gel Drops and the original Systane Lubricant Eye Drops have similar concentrations of the demulcents polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 (0.4%) and propylene glycol (0.3%), but Systane Gel Drops has a higher concentration of one of its excipients (hydroxypropyl guar). Systane Gel Drops is formulated with a pH of 7.0 and a relatively low viscosity; once exposed to the higher ocular pH, cross-linking of hydroxypropyl guar with borate results in the formation of a gel that helps to adhere the demulcents to the ocular surface.</p><p>This randomized study investigated the change in sodium fluorescein (NaFl) corneal staining of patients with dry eye after 6 weeks of treatment with PEG-containing lubricant eye drops (PEG 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%; Systane Gel Drops) or carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC)-containing lubricant eye drops (CMC 1%; Refresh Liquigel).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Investigators from 10 study sites in the US recruited patients aged &#x02265;18 years with a NaFl corneal staining sum score &#x02265;3 in either eye and best-corrected visual acuity of 0.6 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better in each eye who were already using a lubricant eye gel or ointment at least once weekly over the previous month. Key exclusion criteria included any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude safe administration of treatment or affect the results of the study, including inability to discontinue use of concomitant topical ocular drops during the study period (no washout period was required before the screening/baseline visit), previous ocular or intraocular surgery, intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component in the study medications, ocular infections within the last 30 days, temporary punctal plugs, permanent punctal plugs inserted &#x02264;30 days before screening, punctal occlusion performed &#x02264;30 days before screening, use of systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye (unless on a stable dosing regimen for &#x02264;30 days before screening), active iritis or uveitis, or unwillingness to discontinue contact lens wear starting one week or more before screening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind, 6-week clinical trial of patients with dry eye using PEG-containing lubricant eye drops (PEG 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%; Systane Gel Drops) or CMC-containing lubricant eye drops (CMC 1%; Refresh Liquigel). The protocol was approved by all relevant institutional review boards, and the study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>At the screening/baseline visit, patients were assessed for eligibility, and an ophthalmic examination was conducted using best-corrected visual acuity, evaluation of ocular signs (eyelids, conjunctiva, iris, anterior chamber, and lens), NaFl tear film break-up time, lissamine green conjunctival staining, and NaFl corneal staining. NaFl corneal staining was evaluated using the National Eye Institute scale (five areas: 3 maximum points per area; 15 total points). Patients also completed the Single Symptom Comfort Scale and the Ocular Symptoms Questionnaire at the screening/baseline visit.</p><p>Eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two eye drops and instructed to instill one drop four times daily in both eyes for 6 weeks. At the week 1 visit (7&#x000b1;2 days), week 2 visit (14&#x000b1;2 days), and week 4 visit (28&#x000b1;3 days), patients were assessed by NaFl tear film break-up time, NaFl corneal staining, and lissamine green conjunctival staining, and completed the Single Symptom Comfort Scale and the Ocular Symptoms Questionnaire. At the week 6 visit (42&#x000b1;3 days), patients were assessed by best-corrected visual acuity, evaluation of ocular signs, NaFl tear film break-up time, NaFl corneal staining, and lissamine green conjunctival staining; patients also completed the Patient Global Assessment of Improvement, Single Symptom Comfort Scale, Ocular Symptoms Questionnaire, and Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life (IDEEL) Treatment Satisfaction/Treatment Bother Questionnaire. Patient compliance was assessed at all on-therapy study visits by asking study participants about the frequency of use of their assigned study treatment since their last visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Efficacy parameters included ocular staining, tear film breakup time, and patient-reported outcomes. The primary efficacy outcome was mean change from baseline to week 6 in NaFl corneal staining.

Investigators were instructed to wait at least 3 minutes before evaluating the staining using a slit lamp through a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, for the conjunctival lissamine green staining, 5 &#x003bc;L of nonpreserved lissamine green dye were instilled. Investigators were instructed to wait 2&#x02013;3 minutes before examining the staining using a slit lamp with low intensity white light.</p><p>Safety outcomes comprised solicited and unsolicited adverse events.

All patients who received study medication were included in the safety population. All data analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat population (defined as all randomized patients with post-baseline data). Missing data were not imputed. If both eyes were eligible for the study both were treated with study medication but only the eye with the worse total corneal staining score at baseline was selected for analysis (if equal, the right eye was used).</p><p>Estimates of the differences in treatment means and the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of differences from two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were provided for observed change from baseline data for NaFl corneal staining, lissamine green conjunctival staining, NaFl tear film break-up time, Symptom Comfort Scale, and Ocular Symptoms Questionnaire.

Methods for diagnosis and evaluation of dry eye have not been standardized; however, certain tests produce information that is indicative of the condition of the ocular surface. Corneal and conjunctival staining, for example, are recommended as the best means of assessing ocular surface damage and dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-8-157">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-8-157">14</xref> Staining is particularly useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of more severe dry eye.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-8-157">3</xref> The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind clinical study was to evaluate mean change from baseline to week 6 in NaFl corneal staining scores, as a sign of dry eye, in patients receiving PEG-containing or CMC-containing eye drops. Patients taking either type of eye drop showed significant reductions in corneal staining scores at week 6 compared with baseline, but improvements with PEG eye drops were significantly better than with CMC eye drops. These results indicate that ocular surface damage may be ameliorated to a greater degree with this PEG restorative eye drops formula than with CMC eye drops after 6 weeks of treatment. However, changes in conjunctival staining scores, tear film break-up time, and patient-reported outcomes were not significantly different between groups. Because dry eye is a multifactorial disease, a treatment difference observed in a single study parameter may not translate to a clinically meaningful difference in the management of dry eye symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated.</p><p>Generic patient-reported outcomes and dry eye-specific patient-reported outcomes can be used to better differentiate efficacy data between dry eye treatments. Patient questionnaires are recommended for screening and diagnosis of dry eye, and these questionnaires can be used to guide treatment because results of subjective assessments of patient symptoms are repeatable over time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-8-157">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-8-157">17</xref> In the current study, a majority of patients using PEG-containing eye drops reported improvement in dry eye at week 6, with a slightly higher percentage of patients indicating symptom improvement with PEG versus CMC eye drops in the Patient Global Assessment of Improvement. Changes in the Single Symptom Comfort Scale and Ocular Symptoms Questionnaire were similar between groups. A majority of patients indicated satisfaction with PEG eye drops in the IDEEL Treatment Satisfaction questionnaire, with the exception of the question relating to complete elimination of dry eye symptoms; scores on this scale were similar between groups, except that a lower percentage of patients in the CMC group indicated blurriness after drop installation compared with those in the PEG group.</p><p>There are a few limitations to the current study design. A comparator was used rather than a placebo control. Although this study design is a commonly used approach for evaluating drops for dry eye,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-8-157">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-8-157">18</xref> it does not allow direct comparison with untreated individuals. Also, use of separate patient populations for each treatment group (ie, a non-crossover design) raises the possibility that the results may be attributable to intrinsic differences in the two populations (eg, concomitant disorders); however, general baseline characteristics (eg, age, race) were similar between treatment groups. Further, corneal surface defects were evaluated solely with NaFl staining, which may not be a specific or sensitive measure of dry eye symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-8-157">19</xref> In addition, because patients enrolled in clinical trials may be more compliant with treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-8-157">16</xref> the improvements in dry eye symptoms observed in this trial may not be directly generalizable to all patients treated for dry eye. Long-term studies may be needed to assess the safety and efficacy of PEG-containing drops for extended use.</p><p>In summary, patients with dry eye receiving four times daily PEG-containing eye drops showed better NaFl corneal staining that was statistically significant and a somewhat improved adverse event profile compared with those receiving CMC-containing drops after 6 weeks of treatment. These data are consistent with the mechanism of action of PEG-containing drops, which is to provide ocular surface protection. Results of conjunctival staining, tear film break-up time analysis, and patient-reported outcomes were not significantly different between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated, and no safety issues were identified.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was funded by Alcon Laboratories Inc (Fort Worth, TX, USA).
