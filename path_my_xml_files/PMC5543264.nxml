Our objective was to determine whether implementation of a hospital-initiated smoking cessation intervention would reduce mortality and downstream healthcare usage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 2-group effectiveness study was completed comparing patients who received the &#x02018;Ottawa Model&#x02019; for Smoking Cessation intervention (n=726) to usual care controls (n=641). Participants were current smokers, &#x0003e;17&#x02005;years old, and recruited during admission to 1 of 14 participating hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Baseline data were linked to healthcare administrative data. Competing-risks regression analysis was used to compare outcomes between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intervention group experienced significantly lower rates of all-cause readmissions, smoking-related readmissions, and all-cause emergency department (ED) visits at all time points.

The greatest reduction in risk of all-cause ED visits was at 30&#x02005;days (20.9% vs 16.4%; ARR, 4.5% (0.4% to 8.7%); p=0.03). Reduction in mortality was not evident at 30&#x02005;days, but significant reductions were observed by year 1 (11.4% vs 5.4%; ARR 6.0% (3.1% to 9.0%); p&#x0003c;0.001) and year 2 (15.1% vs 7.9%; ARR, 7.3% (3.9% to 10.7%); p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Considering the relatively low cost, greater adoption of hospital-initiated tobacco cessation interventions should be considered to improve patient outcomes and decrease subsequent healthcare usage.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cessation</kwd><kwd>Health Services</kwd><kwd>Priority/special populations</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000226</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STP - 53893</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p><fig id="video1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><caption><p>Video abstract</p></caption><media id="media1" xlink:href="tobaccocontrol-2015-052728supp001.mp4" xlink:role="external-host-filename" content-type="play-in-place height-270 width-480" orientation="portrait" position="anchor" mimetype="video"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052728.video01</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="media-player-id">BMJ Journals Video Player</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" content-type="media-stream-id">tobaccocontrol2015052728media1</object-id></media></fig></p><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco smoking remains the leading cause of premature death worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is unparalleled in producing early and preventable disease, disability and death, particularly related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancer.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The magnitude of the excess morbidity, mortality and healthcare usage caused by tobacco addiction is immense.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Sadly, smoking remains a widespread condition that &#x02018;presents such a mixture of lethality, prevalence and neglect despite effective and readily available interventions&#x02019;.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In every jurisdiction, healthcare systems are experiencing the growing burden of chronic diseases and are under pressure to reduce &#x02018;avoidable&#x02019; hospital readmissions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For example, the English Department of Health introduced a policy in 2011 restricting payments of certain emergency readmissions that occur within 30&#x02005;days of an initial hospital discharge.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the USA, the Hospital Readmissions Reductions Program was introduced as part of the Affordable Care Act; consequently, thousands of hospitals will have Medicare payments deducted by up to 3% in 2015 if patients with certain conditions (eg, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) return to hospital within 30&#x02005;days of discharge.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In Canada, smokers average twice as many hospital days as never-daily smokers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Given the number of smokers admitted to hospitals, the relevance of smoking to their illness, the realities of nicotine addiction, and the challenges of withdrawal, hospitalisation presents a significant and strategic opportunity to deliver cessation interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> There is abundant evidence that hospital-based interventions are highly effective at helping patients quit, particularly when pharmacotherapy is provided in association with counselling and postdischarge support (risk ratio (RR), 1.37 (1.27 to 1.48); 25 trials).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The &#x02018;Ottawa Model&#x02019; for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) is a systematic approach to tobacco dependence treatment delivered within healthcare settings that has been integrated within over 120 hospitals across Canada. It involves: identifying and documenting the smoking status of all patients; providing brief counselling and inhospital pharmacotherapy to smokers; and, offering follow-up support posthospitalisation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The model has been found to improve long-term cessation by an absolute 11% (from 18% to 29%; OR, 1.71 (1.11 to 2.64); p=0.02) among general hospital patients.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Evidence of the health benefits of smoking cessation is overwhelming, particularly for younger people without existing disease, but also for higher risk individuals with smoking-related illnesses.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> A small number of investigations have assessed the health and healthcare consequences of cessation interventions delivered in hospital. They have relied on self-report, assessed only condition-specific outcomes, or used mathematical modelling to obtain outcomes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref></p><p>Our investigation assessed the direct effects of a hospital-initiated smoking cessation intervention (the OMSC) on mortality, rehospitalisation, emergency department (ED) use, and physician visits using healthcare administrative data.

First, an evaluation committee, including all study investigators and a third party chair, was formed prior to study commencement. The committee documented all real and potential conflicts of interest and approved the study design, outcomes, covariates, analysis plan, and dissemination plan. Once analyses were completed, the committee reviewed the study findings to verify that all plans had been followed. To reduce potential analyst bias, an initial, blinded analysis of the data was completed. A &#x02018;blinded&#x02019; test data set was created by an analyst (Analyst 1) who removed identifying information (eg, dates, group assignments), randomly added observations to the smallest group in order that groups be identical in size, and randomly assigned new group numbers. The study's primary investigator (Analyst 2) and an arm's length analyst (Analyst 3) used this test data set to independently complete blinded analyses of the study's main outcomes. Results of their independent analyses were reviewed by Analyst 1, and any necessary corrections were made. Once consensus was reached (ie, statistical coding and final outputs matched), the primary analyses were repeated independently by Analysts 2 and 3 using the actual study data set to obtain final results.</p><p>The consecutive nature in which patients were recruited to the study was intended to limit selection bias, and several planned sensitivity analyses were completed to investigate potential sources of bias within the data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We examined consistency of our results for 2-year mortality and all-cause readmissions by stratifying each covariate and assessing stratum-specific HRs. To consider the specificity of our results (ie, whether between-group differences were specific to hospitalised smokers and could be attributed to intervention exposure, rather than secular temporal trends unrelated to the intervention), we compared the 2-year probabilities of all-cause mortality and readmission between two consecutive samples of non-smoking patients who were recruited alongside the control and intervention smoker-patients. The intervention could not conceivably have influenced outcomes in the non-smokers, so any observed trends would suggest that external factors were at play. Further, we assessed whether quitting smoking improved outcomes on a subsample of smokers in both groups who consented to a 6-month follow-up call after their index hospitalisation. These participants responded yes or no to: &#x02018;Have you smoked any form of tobacco in the past 6&#x02005;months?&#x02019;. We combined the quitters and continued smokers from each group and continuous smoking abstinence was the main independent variable in a competing-risks regression analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants</title><p>Of the 1649 eligible smokers screened, our final study dataset included 641 control (86.5% of smokers screened) and 726 intervention smokers (80.0% of smokers screened).

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We are aware of two studies that examined rates of hospital readmission following a hospital-based cessation intervention.

The above studies relied on self-reported readmission data. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare health outcomes of smokers who received an inhospital cessation intervention to controls by directly linking to healthcare administrative data.</p><p>Our study found that attenuation of the risk of death and of hospital readmission improved during the 2-year study period; whereas, the impact on ED-visits decreased.

The OMSC intervention was highly effective among low-SES patients.

We did not have information about specific usage of cessation medications, nor did we have information related to exposure to other cessation services patients may have experienced. Smoking abstinence data were only available on a subsample of patients. We had no information about second-hand smoke exposure, nor did we have smoking history information for the non-smokers.
