Similarly, although debate continues over whether a &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; diet exists for weight control, meta-analyses suggest little difference in outcomes between diets differing markedly in macronutrient composition, particularly over the longer-term. Thus a more important question is how best to encourage adherence to appropriate lifestyle change. While brief support is effective, it has on-going cost implications. While self-monitoring (weight, diet, physical activity) is a cornerstone of effective weight management, little formal evaluation of the role that self-monitoring technology can play in enhancing adherence to change has occurred to date. People who eat in response to hunger have improved weight control, yet how best to train individuals to recognise when true physical hunger occurs and to limit consumption to those times, requires further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>SWIFT (Support strategies for Whole-food diets, Intermittent Fasting, and Training) is a two-year randomised controlled trial in 250 overweight (body mass index of 27 or greater) adults that will examine different ways of supporting people to make appropriate changes to diet and exercise habits for long-term weight control. Participants will be randomised to one of five intervention groups: control, brief support (monthly weigh-ins and meeting), app (use of MyFitnessPal with limited support), daily self-weighing (with brief monthly feedback), or hunger training (four-week programme which trains individuals to only eat when physically hungry) for 24&#x000a0;months. Outcome assessments include weight, waist circumference, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), inflammatory markers, blood lipids, adiponectin and ghrelin, blood pressure, diet (3-day diet records), physical activity (accelerometry) and aerobic fitness, and eating behaviour. SWIFT is powered to detect clinically important differences of 4&#x000a0;kg in body weight and 5&#x000a0;cm in waist circumference. Our pragmatic trial also allows participants to choose one of several dietary (Mediterranean, modified Paleo, intermittent fasting) and exercise (current recommendations, high-intensity interval training) approaches before being randomised to a support strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>SWIFT will compare four different ways of supporting overweight adults to lose weight while following a diet and exercise plan of their choice, an aspect we believe will enhance adherence and thus success with weight management.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=367447">ACTRN12615000010594</ext-link>.

The inability of many individuals to lose significant weight by themselves or for most to keep it off is due to a myriad of factors including making changes to lifestyle that are too drastic and therefore not sustainable, the widespread availability of energy-dense foods and sedentary past-times, changes to work and leisure-time energy expenditure, and insufficient support structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, considerable debate and confusion also exists in both lay and scientific literature regarding whether there is an &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; dietary composition for weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Low-carbohydrate diets in particular have long been purported to have metabolic and clinical advantages over other dietary patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It makes mechanistic sense that lower carbohydrate diets <italic>could</italic> promote greater weight loss, principally because of a reduction in insulin levels reducing the storage of body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, at the practical level, recent meta-analyses suggest little difference in weight and health outcomes between diets differing quite markedly in macronutrient composition, particularly over time frames longer than 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Instead, a far more relevant factor appears to be the degree of <italic>adherence</italic> to the prescribed diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], an aspect that is insufficiently measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Such findings have led expert groups to recommend that the most suitable diets are not those that include a specific nutrient composition per se, but rather ones that entail moderate energy restriction which participants are willing and able to follow long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is becoming clear that several acceptable dietary patterns that differ quite markedly in terms of macronutrient composition are suitable for weight loss. The more important question then becomes how best to encourage and support long-term compliance with one, or more, of these patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, while adherence to dietary change is viewed as a cornerstone of non-communicable disease prevention and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], little practical guidance is available identifying which specific factors enhance adherence to dietary advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The short-term nature of most studies, marked differences in terms of how adherence is assessed, and overall low trial quality limits firm conclusions being drawn about the most efficacious factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Strong social support is considered an important adjunct to successful weight loss or maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The use of personalised support with nutrition and activity specialists is known to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], however it is expensive and rarely accessed. Alternative forms of low-intensity but regular support, delivered by non-specialists can result in similar benefits, at a fraction of the cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Brief monthly support, such as is found in many commercial weight loss programmes, also appears to maintain weight loss better over 2&#x02013;3 years than other forms of support including interactive websites and self-directed control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, because such support cannot continue indefinitely, and ongoing development of innovative technology, determining the efficacy of other, low-cost strategies is currently of great interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Self-monitoring of weight, food intake and/or activity levels has been shown to be one of the most effective strategies employed for successful weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, monitoring of food and activity is time-consuming and adherence dramatically declines over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The advent of mobile &#x0201c;apps&#x0201d; may offer a more effective way of monitoring food/ activity patterns due to instant feedback of a wealth of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While self-monitoring strategies are a common component of the myriad of commercially available apps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], whether they are effective at encouraging behaviour change has rarely been examined, despite their widespread use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although the top five self-monitoring apps each have a user base of more than 10 million people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], only one appears to have been tested in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Laing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] recently demonstrated that use of MyFitnessPal alone, with no accompanying dietary or exercise advice, did not produce significant weight change over 6&#x000a0;months in comparison with usual care. The apparent lack of effect may be due in part to the sharp declines in adherence to app use after the first month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Perhaps this is not surprising given that the response of individuals to self-monitoring can vary considerably, ranging from the &#x0201c;well-disciplined&#x0201d; who endorse this approach, to those that have &#x0201c;diminished support&#x0201d;, where other co-existing factors take precedence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Compared with monitoring of diet or activity, monitoring of body weight is both straightforward and quick. Although weekly or monthly weighing has traditionally been recommended, observational studies suggest that daily weighing may promote weight loss better than less frequent weighing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, few studies have examined the efficacy of daily self-weighing in comparison to less frequent weighing via randomised controlled trials. Steinberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported a weight loss of 6.6&#x000a0;% over a 6-month period in the daily weighing group compared with only 0.4&#x000a0;% in wait-list controls. It may be that more frequent weighing offers further advantages; Oshima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] demonstrated that twice-daily weighing resulted in greater weight loss than once-daily weighing in a small group of overweight adults. How these changes related to changes in actual body composition is unknown, but important given that it is widely acknowledged that fat loss, rather than weight loss, provides the key health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Whether such frequent weighing produces adverse psychosocial effects is a matter of concern. However, the limited data to date suggest that no adverse effects, and potentially even some benefits, have been observed, at least over 6&#x02013;18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>One of the major barriers to effective weight management is that we eat for a variety of complex and interrelated reasons other than hunger, including taste, social interaction and emotional cues. Observational studies demonstrate that many environmental and situational cues influence our eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], but those who eat in response to hunger, recognise satiety signals, and give themselves unconditional permission to eat foods of their choosing (intuitive eaters), are more likely to be a healthy weight than those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. While people can be trained to eat more intuitively (in response to hunger and satiety), whether this increases weight loss relative to other techniques remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. An alternative type of <italic>hunger training</italic> has been suggested, where subjects are trained over a few weeks to identify actual (physiological) hunger by connecting the physical feelings of hunger with blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This training has been shown in one small study to produce significant weight loss compared with a conventional approach which required constant dietary restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Whether this approach is a viable way of training individuals to eat to their appetites requires further examination, particularly in terms of its ability to work over longer time frames.</p><p>Testing the effectiveness of different support strategies should theoretically occur with all participants following the same diet. However, we know that one of the major difficulties in trials which randomise people to follow specific dietary patterns is that any particular diet cannot possibly suit every individual, which undoubtedly influences adherence. Behavioural choice theory posits that outcomes are improved when participants receive the treatment they prefer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It thus seems feasible that tailoring a diet on the basis of individual personal and cultural preferences (i.e. choice) may therefore have the best chance for long-term success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], perhaps through enthusiasm, a better fit with their overall lifestyle, or supporting personal autonomy. However, whether choice of intervention group versus randomisation affects adherence and outcomes in weight loss studies has been examined infrequently, and the findings do not generally support the theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There was no evidence of a difference in outcomes from having a preference for a certain intervention in terms of group versus individual treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], low fat versus low carbohydrate diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], or choice of commercial diet programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The remaining study found significantly greater weight loss in those randomised to a diet than in those who were allowed to choose a diet, although clinically important weight losses were observed in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, many of these studies were relatively small and were unable to provide precise estimates of effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], or lasted less than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Thus further examination of the impact of being able to <italic>choose</italic> which diet or activity plan to follow is warranted, particularly given the high drop-out rates typically observed in randomised controlled trials of dietary interventions. This is particularly true given under real-world conditions, people seeking to lose weight select their own dietary and/or physical activity approach(es). Moreover, in reality, switching between weight loss strategies will occur even when a particular approach has been suggested by a health professional or within randomised trials.</p><p>Two promising and popular dietary approaches, despite relatively little research around their use in humans, include paleolithic diets and intermittent fasting. Paleolithic diets are based on evolutionary principles and include meat, fruit, vegetables and nuts/seeds while eschewing grains, dairy, and processed foods. Early small studies have provided encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, whether overweight adults can adhere to paleolithic-type diets in the longer-term requires study. Intermittent fasting is usually defined as normal food intake 3&#x02013;5 days a week and dramatically reduced intake (down to 2&#x000a0;MJ from typical intake of 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;MJ) for 2&#x02013;4 days. Anecdotally this is believed to be much easier than reducing energy intake by a smaller amount (usually 2&#x000a0;MJ/day) <italic>every</italic> day, which forms part of the current guidelines. While a wealth of animal data supports the effectiveness of intermittent fasting for weight control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], research in humans is less certain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, the small amount of data available does show modest evidence of effectiveness for treatment of obesity and cardioprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Exercise produces more successful weight loss than dietary change alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], seems particularly important for weight maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and has many additional health benefits, over and above that relating to energy balance. Regular physical exercise is associated with an approximate halving in the risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], can decrease the incidence of diabetes by up to 50&#x000a0;% as part of lifestyle counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and even decrease insulin resistance in those with established metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, a major public health challenge is how best to encourage people to be physically active on a regular basis. Although evidence that regular physical exercise is beneficial is overwhelming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], adherence remains a major issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], with lack of time often cited as a major barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Thus there has been increasing interest in ascertaining the minimum amount of exercise required that might produce effective health benefits. An alternative to meeting moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) guidelines may be the promotion of high intensity interval training (HIIT). In HIIT, brief periods of high-intensity exercise are interposed with recovery periods at a much lower intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Although HIIT regimes typically include 10&#x000a0;minutes or so of intense exercise performed three times per week, as little as 3&#x000a0;minutes of intense exercise per week has been shown to produce cardiovascular and metabolic improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], although effects on body composition are less certain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Although HIIT holds promise, virtually all research to date has been conducted in the laboratory and it is uncertain whether these findings will translate into community settings. If people cannot complete HIIT by themselves, its efficacy as a public health approach is very limited. Whether participants can adhere to a HIIT training regime long-term is also not currently known.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The goal of our study is to determine whether allowing participants to choose from a selection of appropriate diet and exercise plans, within the context of a randomised controlled trial evaluating four different support strategies, enhances adherence and promotes greater weight loss and positive health outcomes. Giving people the choice of which diet and exercise regime is best incorporated into their particular lifestyle is expected to improve adherence, reflects real-world conditions, and is consistent with the lack of evidence for meaningful differences between diet modalities. Acknowledging this concept in conjunction with testing different support strategies offers a unique opportunity to determine how best to support individuals to make dietary and exercise changes under real-world conditions.</p><p>The primary aim of our study is to determine the effectiveness of different support strategies (control condition, brief support, daily self-weighing, app use, hunger training) on weight loss at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months.

In practice, this usually means a small breakfast (e.g. plain porridge), no or limited food during the day, and non-starchy vegetables only for the evening meal, although other variations are possible.

Standard printed resources available from the Ministry of Health will be used for counselling with this group. Typical recommended activities include walking briskly, exercise classes, and gardening but no mention is made of HIIT type activities (brief sessions of very high intensity exercise).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Home-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</italic> &#x02013; Those choosing HIIT attend a private 1-hour training session which includes focused medical evaluation and HIIT training (cycle ergometer) using rating of perceived exertion in combination with heart rate monitoring. This typically includes 3 intervals of durations of up to 30&#x000a0;seconds, including two maximal sprint intervals. Fitness is likely to vary amongst participants at baseline, so clinical judgment is required to adapt the initial training of participants who have low baseline cardiorespiratory fitness or other significant issues influencing exercise tolerance. However, it is intended that all participants experience at least one observed interval that achieves 80-90&#x000a0;% of their estimated maximum heart rate which allows the participant to recognise the required intensity, and for further identification of any undisclosed cardiac symptoms. Participants then use heart rate monitors to record unsupervised HIIT sessions for another week, ensuring further confirmation that the required intensity is being achieved. Training and resources are then provided outlining how HIIT can be achieved at home. Four different protocols are provided including a &#x0201c;beginners&#x0201d; HIIT protocol (e.g. 10&#x000a0;second intervals at 90&#x000a0;% intensity repeated 3&#x02013;5 times), and then three harder options. These include maximal (90&#x000a0;% maximum heart rate) and submaximal (80&#x000a0;%) options, involve a variety of interval lengths (e.g. 30&#x000a0;seconds to 4&#x000a0;minutes), and number of repeats (3&#x02013;10 times) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In general, participants will be encouraged to gradually increase their HIIT from a beginners level to ultimately being able to complete three approximately 15-minute (allowing for warm-up and cool-down) sessions of HIIT each week following one of the submaximal or maximal options. A variety of possible exercises are suggested including sprinting, stair climbing, exercise equipment such as exercycles or rowing machines, and activities such as star jumps, burpees and the like, as long as it is &#x0201c;exercise that uses most of your body and is very hard to do within seconds&#x0201d;.

Our protocol is based on that of Ciampolini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] but adapted slightly following piloting. In the original method, participants are only able to eat if blood glucose is less than 4.7&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our pilot testing showed that use of an individualised blood glucose cut-off (average of fasting blood glucose over two days) rather than 4.7&#x000a0;mmol/L improved adherence to testing and reduced eating when blood glucose was not below the cut-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Before every desired eating occasion, participants will be instructed to note their intensity of hunger on a&#x000a0;100mm visual analogue scale and their measured blood glucose. If their blood glucose is higher than their personal cut-off, they are advised to engage in some other activity as a distraction and wait at least one hour. At this time, they assess their feelings of hunger again and repeat the measurement if they still want to eat, until their blood glucose is under their individualised cut-off. Over time, participants learn to relate physical feelings of hunger with their blood glucose and to eat only when physically hungry. Participants will be advised to follow this procedure for two weeks. In weeks 3 and 4, the blood glucose testing is optional, but all other recording (intensity and type of hunger, and resulting food intake) continues. Participants will be in regular contact with support staff, who will advise them how to proceed, answer any queries and provide encouragement. In months 2&#x02013;12, participants will be advised to repeat the recording process (with or without fingerprick blood glucose testing) for one week of every month.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>Outcome assessments will occur at 0 (baseline), 6 (mid-point of intervention), 12 (end of intervention) and 24 (end of follow-up) months as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

A more pressing issue thus becomes determining how best to support people to follow one of these approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Determining whether high-intensity exercise can be a viable public health approach to improving weight and health is also warranted, particularly given an intriguing recent finding that MVPA is more consistently associated with body weight than is diet quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The SWIFT trial aims to compare five (including a control group) different ways of helping people to follow one of several possible dietary and exercise combinations, a choice that we believe should enhance adherence and thus success with weight management. We believe our trial offers a pragmatic way of assessing whether simple support strategies, that require limited to no expert involvement, are viable ways for overweight adults to successfully manage their weight over a two-year period.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RT is the Principal Investigator of SWIFT, will have overall responsibility for the project, and wrote first and subsequent drafts of the manuscript.
