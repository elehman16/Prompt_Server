Compulsivity is defined as the repetitive, irresistible urge to perform a behaviour, the experience of loss of voluntary control over this intense urge, the diminished ability to delay or inhibit thoughts or behaviours, and the tendency to perform repetitive acts in a habitual or stereotyped manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) are characterised by repetitive thoughts, impulses or images (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and typically have onset in late childhood or early adolescence and mid-adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by persistent deficits in (1) social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, and by (2) restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities. ASD have their onset prior to age 3&#x000a0;years, and a strong persistence over time in childhood, over adolescence and into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>This study is part of a large, translational project funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement number 278948, TACTICS (Translational Adolescent and Childhood Therapeutic Interventions in Compulsive Syndromes). It aims to identify the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tactics-project.eu/">http://www.tactics-project.eu/</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Compulsivity and compulsivity-associated disorders</title><p>Compulsivity and the closely associated impulsivity trait are characterised by behavioural disinhibition maintained by maladaptive fronto-striatal brain circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Current neuroanatomical models posit the existence of separate but intercommunicating compulsive and impulsive fronto-striatal circuits, differentially modulated by neurotransmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the compulsive circuit, a striatal component (caudate nucleus) may drive compulsive behaviours and a prefrontal component (orbitofrontal cortex, OFC) may exert inhibitory control over them. Increased activity within the striatal components or decreased activity in the prefrontal components may thus result in an increased automatic tendency for executing impulsive or compulsive behaviours, depending on the sub-component affected. Childhood OCD has recently been associated with decreased prefrontal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], fitting with reduced prefrontal control over the striatum. Interestingly, glutamatergic imbalance in fronto-striatal regions has also been observed in childhood OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, earlier work has shown reduced volume of the striatum in children with ASD that relates to repetitive and compulsive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Glutamatergic mechanisms and fronto-striatal circuits</title><p>The fronto-striatal circuits implicated in compulsivity and impulsivity are notable for their relatively rich glutamatergic receptor density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, glutamate modulates the metabolism and function of the fronto-striatal circuits. Glutamatergic projections to and from the various frontal sub-regions (OFC, infralimbic cortex and prelimbic cortex) to the striatum play a key role in the regulation of various compulsive behaviours in humans including: (1) the feeling of loss of control (OCD), (2) repetitive motor behaviours (stereotypy in ASD), and (3) a maladaptive habitual pattern (addiction). Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that glutamatergic projections between the various frontal sub-regions and the striatum play a key role in the regulation of compulsive behaviours in humans ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Compulsivity has been associated with increased glutamatergic activity in the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex in clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Glutamatergic medication in the treatment of compulsivity/impulsivity</title><p>Despite the effectiveness of serotonergic compounds in the treatment of OCD, treatment-resistant symptoms remaining in 40 to 60&#x000a0;% of patients present a pressing clinical problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of conceptually novel pharmacological strategies. Consistent with the hypothesis of the role of glutamatergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of OCD, agents targeting glutamate neurotransmission, such as memantine (and riluzole), represent promising candidates (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Open-label studies in children and adults have provided supportive evidence for the effectiveness of these glutamate-modulating compounds for OCD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There are currently no drugs that have been shown to effectively treat the core impairments of ASD. Although studies of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics have suggested improvement of repetitive behaviour in ASD, this has yet to be proven in placebo-controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Emerging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests: individuals with ASD show an imbalance of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)). Such regionally specific abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission may vary across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Ghanizadeh reviewed investigations of amino acid levels in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from ASD patients and reported both increased levels of glutamate and homocysteine and decreased levels of glutamine and tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Systematic literature review and choice of investigational compound</title><p>A systematic literature review (Mechler et al., in preparation) has recently been performed within the TACTICS network, in preparation for this exploratory &#x02018;Glutamatergic medication in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder&#x02019; (GOAT) trial. It focused on the evaluation of glutamatergic substances with potential benefit for the treatment of paediatric patients in multi-centre studies aiming at compulsivity-related disorders. In summary, there were a total of 21 trials (paediatric randomised controlled trials and open-label trials). Six substances were evaluated: D-cycloserine, memantine, minocycline, modafinil, <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, and riluzole. The most substantial information appeared to be available for the compound memantine. Memantine is an <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, clinically used as a &#x02018;cognitive enhancer&#x02019;, regulatory-approved for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia in a number of countries. It has successfully been used and further been studied in children diagnosed with ASD for the treatment of cognitive, behavioural, and memory dysfunctions, in open-label and controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; cf. a recent clinical development program (memantine) sponsored by Forest Laboratories/Merz Pharmaceuticals, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). Memantine has also been explored for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]). However, additional research examining the efficacy/effectiveness and tolerability/safety of memantine, e.g. placebo-controlled clinical trials, is needed. Findings on memantine suggested clinical effectiveness in ASD and OCD symptomatology and appeared to offer the best risk-benefit profile for multi-centre trials with paediatric patients suffering from compulsivity-related disorders. Considering the current state of knowledge and assessing available findings on effectiveness, tolerability/safety and feasibility of study implementation, the subgroup of experts in paediatric psychopharmacology from the TACTICS consortium jointly decided to apply the compound memantine for this paediatric pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Molecular-genetic factors involved in compulsivity, in ASD and OCD</title><p>Compulsivity-related disorders such as OCD and ASD are assumed to be highly heritable but genetically complex, with multiple genetic variants of small effect contributing to disease in most patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Genes encoding the SLC1A1, SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 glutamate transporters are candidate genes for both OCD and ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Genes encoding the NMDAR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and NMDAR2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] subunits of the postsynaptic NMDA glutamate receptor are associated with ASD and those encoding the NMDAR2B subunit with paediatric OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Novel approaches are needed to facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors for brain disorders and related traits, like compulsivity. One such approach is the study of intermediate phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has been shown that using intermediate phenotypes indeed did improve the chance of establishing significant findings in genetic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Biomarkers &#x02013; proteomics of compulsivity and associated disorders</title><p>Symptoms of compulsivity-associated disorders such as OCD, ASD and ADHD frequently co-occur in the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Quantitative and molecular genetics, cognitive and imaging studies indicate that this clinical overlap is due to common genetic factors and/or common underlying neural and molecular mechanisms (review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). Indeed, it has been shown that alterations in brain development, mitochondrial function, immune system and oxidative stress pathways as well as dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems may be involved in several or all of these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The biological determinants that contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions, however, are poorly defined, and currently, no well-characterised biomarkers are available. One major positive impact of this study &#x02013; as integral part of the TACTICS project &#x02013; may lead to a greater insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of compulsivity and compulsivity-associated disorders and potentially facilitate the development of much needed differential diagnostics, improved drug discovery and clinical development, and designs based on biomarker-based segmentation of patients. This may allow for earlier diagnosis and personalised medicine strategies for more effective treatments in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Aims and objectives</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary objectives</title><p>To investigate: clinical effectiveness of the glutamatergic compound memantine in paediatric patients with OCD (GOAT-1) and ASD (GOAT-2) with respect to symptoms of &#x02018;compulsivity&#x02019; (assessed as total score of the Children&#x02019;s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>])) and to explore tolerability and safety (based on, e.g. laboratory measures, electrocardiography (ECG), adverse events) of the compound memantine in these clinical indications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To explore: the effects of glutamatergic interventions at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRS), in subgroups (e.g. disorders, age range).</p><p>To collect: blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers.</p><p>To explore: additional clinical outcomes, disorder-specific outcomes (e.g. core symptoms, response rates, social functioning).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Tertiary objectives</title><p>To explore: the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits.</p><p>To explore: biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a multi-national, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled add-on trial with three study periods: study period I will be a 2-week screening (and washout) period, study period II will be a 12-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled period, and study period III will be a double-blind 1-week down-titration period.

The aim of COMPULS is to identify neural, neurocognitive, genetic, and biomarker mechanisms underlying compulsive behaviours in high-risk subjects and controls. The primary objectives are to examine whether (1) structural and functional abnormalities of the fronto-striatal circuits are related to the development of compulsive and impulsive behaviour in ASD and OCD, and (2) the glutamate system is a key modulator in these fronto-striatal circuits. The COMPULS study has a mixed cross-sectional longitudinal design with assessments at two time points. Measurements are: MRI (structural MRI, functional MRI, resting state MRI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)), MRS (spectroscopy), plus multiple tasks reflecting cognition and behaviour (cf. website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tactics-project.eu/">http://www.tactics-project.eu</ext-link>; WP04).</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Vital signs</title><p>Vital signs including body temperature, heart rate (pulse), and blood pressure will be recorded as specified in the study SOE (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Height and weight</title><p>Height and weight will be recorded as specified in the study SOE (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); measurements will be performed according to standardised procedures across study sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</title><p>ECGs will be performed following standard procedures at the visits outlined in the SOE (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Medication and dosing</title><p>The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the investigational agent(s) to the patients and parents, verifying that instructions are followed properly, maintaining accurate records of study drug dispensing and collection, and of returning all unused medication at the end of the study.</p><p>This study involves a comparison of an active drug (memantine) with matching placebo. During study period II, medication will be initiated and modified according to the weight group of the patient at BL (visit 3). Dosing may then be increased (or decreased) by 5&#x000a0;mg/day increments, respectively, at specified visits/dates according to the weight of the subject (cf. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Stepwise up-titration is recommended to the target dose or the highest tolerable dose by week 4, accordingly. Dosing should remain stable during the last 4&#x000a0;weeks of study period II unless a dose reduction is necessary for tolerability or safety reasons. In case of dose-adjustments due to AEs unscheduled visits can be performed (for stepwise down-titration). Patients who cannot tolerate the minimum daily dose specified (5&#x000a0;mg/day) will be discontinued from the study. Investigator decisions on dose changes (up or down) will only be permitted at study visits (or, due to AEs, at unscheduled visits for down-titration). Study medication will be given once daily in the evening, with or without food.</p><p>Based on the dosing information from the published literature and considering earlier and ongoing trials with memantine (sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Forest Laboratories, Berlin, Germany) in this age group, dosing was chosen weight-based, accordingly, also taking into account dose-unit availability in Europe (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Production, packaging of the medication</title><p>All study medication will be identical in appearance and will be dispensed to patients or their parents by trained site personnel. A cooperation partner (H. Lundbeck A/S Pharmaceuticals, Copenhagen, Denmark) will provide the primary study material consisting of tablets containing 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg of memantine each and tablets containing placebo (in identical appearance). Study medication will be dispensed to the patient/parent at the investigator&#x02019;s study site. Study medications will be packaged in blister packs or bottles. Clinical trial materials will be labelled according to the country&#x02019;s regulatory requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Concomitant therapy</title><p>In general, concomitant medications with primarily central nervous system activity are not permitted in this study. A protocol attachment contains a list of medications and classes of medications that are or are not permitted during this study (depending and in accordance with the SPC for memantine, used in GOAT-1 and GOAT-2). Upon assent/consent by the patient and patient&#x02019;s parent, the medications that are not allowed should be tapered off and stopped by visit 2, and be completely washed out by visit 3. Investigators should follow clinical guidelines with respect to duration of washout periods (minimum of five half-lives). Concomitant medication will be reported with compound, length of use, and doses in the clinical report form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Treatment compliance</title><p>Patient compliance with study medication will be assessed at each visit by direct questioning of parent and/or patient. Patients/parents will be asked to return both used (including empty) and unused blister cards distributed on the previous visit. Any deviation from the prescribed dosage regimen will be recorded. Final drug accountability reconciliation will be performed at the end of treatment or discontinuation.</p><p>During the double-blind treatment phase (study period II), a patient will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she misses more than two consecutive days of study medication (full doses), or fails to take at least 80&#x000a0;% of prescribed doses of study medication (full doses) during two or more visit intervals. Similarly, a patient will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she intentionally or repeatedly takes more than the prescribed amount of medication as judged by the investigator.</p><p>If a patient is noncompliant during an interval, the patient and parent will be counselled regarding the importance of compliance in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec44"><title>Clinical efficacy data</title><p>The end of the treatment phase will be taken as the primary endpoint. Change from BL in CY-BOCS total score will be used as the primary efficacy variable. As a secondary outcome measure a binary response score will be composed based on the change in CY-BOCS total score and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale at the end of the treatment phase (at least 30&#x000a0;% reduction in CY-BOCS total from BL and a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) in CGI-I scale). Additional symptom severity scores will be used as secondary efficacy measures.</p><p>General linear models will be applied on the CY-BOCS change score to compare the two treatment groups (active drug, placebo). Gender, age, investigational site and BL measurement will be included as covariates. Furthermore, diagnosis and diagnosis by treatment interaction will be entered in the model. A significant interaction effect will be followed up by separate analyses of the two diagnostic groups. In the presence of a high drop-out rate methods for missing data (e.g. last observation carried forwards (LOCF), mixed effect model repeat measurement (MMRM)) will be applied and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess whether efficacy results are stable across different analysis methods. Logistic regression analyses will be performed to evaluate the effect of treatment on the binary response score. To study the impact of moderating factors on the outcome measures general linear models and logistic regression analyses will be applied, as appropriate. Gender, age, diagnostic group and investigational site will be included as covariates in all analyses. Multivariate statistical analysis of all data will be applied, reducing the chances of identifying false positives. This method can incorporate different types of predictors (clinical patient characteristics as well as neuropsychological and neuroimaging data, genetic and protein data). All analyses will be corrected for multiple testing as appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Tolerability/Safety data</title><p>To analyse tolerability and safety of the medication logistic regression analysis will be performed on the indicator variables for AEs, and Poisson regression will be used for the number of AEs.

Drug treatment for children and adolescents with these indications has been a challenging issue because there have only been few placebo-controlled studies with glutamatergic compounds so far. In general, there is a lack of solid information on the effects of these drugs in children and adolescents; therefore, placebo-controlled studies will contribute to determine the tolerability/safety and efficacy/effectiveness in this population.</p><p>Due to a very limited budget as one of multiple projects within the TACTICS study, several cost-saving measures and solutions had to be implemented in the GOAT study design reflecting the pilot character of this study but not limiting scientific quality or jeopardising patients&#x02019; safety. This challenge has also been previously noted in other projects funded by the European Union, e.g. the Paediatric European Risperidone Studies (PERS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In TACTICS GOAT, e.g. interpretations of ECG and blood sample analyses as well as site monitoring will be performed locally at each study centre by qualified specialists rather than by a centralised system or clinical research organisation, respectively. This will be coordinated centrally by the leading study centre and performed in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all sites. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark, became a member of the TACTICS consortium and will provide the medication free of charge. Cooperation between academia and pharmaceutical companies is one of the overarching objectives of European Union-funded projects. For packing, blinding, drug accountability and labelling we were able to find a collaborator in the Clinical Trials Unit of the Pharmacy at the University Hospital Heidelberg which supports investigator-initiated and publicly funded trials in a cost-saving yet professional manner.</p><p>Patients treated with glutamatergic compounds and their parents will have the benefit of potential medication effects on their symptomatology and the related burden of illness (reductions), plus of respective improvements in health-related quality of life. Equally important, all patients and parents can benefit from the high frequency and intensity of care &#x02013; offered via the study visits by experienced child and adolescent psychiatry staff &#x02013; that in general clearly extends beyond routine care settings.</p><p>An acute treatment period of as long as 12&#x000a0;weeks was chosen in order to increase the chance to reflect change/improvement based on medication treatment. With applying the respective adequate instruments, clinical outcome parameters will reflect compulsivity symptom clusters, but also comprehensive information on psychosocial functioning and health-related quality of life relevant in child and adolescent development. Contrasting findings across the patient populations will allow the assessment of disorder-related variation.</p><p>It is believed that the proposed project &#x02013; with performing this pilot clinical trial in populations of children and adolescents with compulsivity disorders &#x02013; will help to elucidate efficacy/effectiveness and tolerability/safety of glutamatergic medications, further to explore effects of moderating and mediating factors on the response to these compounds. Also, findings will allow assessment of medication effects on biomarkers and neural mechanisms underlying compulsivity. In addition, these pilot data will be made available to be used for potential future Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) directed trial applications.</p><p>Respective MRI/MRS findings (from subgroups of patients, combined with the data from the TACTICS project&#x02019;s COMPULS study) will help to clarify which mechanisms count for the compulsive behaviours in the considered disorders and subsequently to understand the links between compulsivity, impulsivity and addiction. These understandings will provide a basis for prospectively developing a guide for clinicians as to whether children are at high risk for negative outcome as severe compulsive behaviours and addictive behaviours in adolescence and adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, ERB approval for the leading site at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany (15 January 2015) plus German regulatory agency approval (BfArM, 26 June 2015) have been obtained.
