SSB consumption is linked to adverse health consequences and contributes to health inequalities, given greater consumption amongst the most deprived. One possible intervention is to reduce the available sizes of SSB packaging but there is an absence of evidence that this would reduce consumption. Based on evidence from studies targeting food consumption that people consume less when exposed to smaller package sizes, we hypothesise that presenting SSBs in smaller containers reduces consumption. We are planning a crossover randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of presenting a fixed volume of SSB in different bottle sizes on consumption at home. To reduce the uncertainties related to this trial, we propose a preliminary study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention and intervention procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Households which purchase at least 2&#x000a0;l of regular cola drinks per week and live in Cambridgeshire, UK will have a set amount of a cola SSB (based on their typical weekly purchasing of cola) delivered to their homes each week by the research team.

A crossover design will be used in which households will each receive all four of the week-long interventions (the four different bottle sizes) over time, randomised in their order of presentation.

Specifically, the intake of such sugars at high levels leads to weight gain and an increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the development of dental diseases, particularly, dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such concerns have led the World Health Organization (WHO) to advise limiting the consumption of free sugars to less than 10&#x000a0;% of total daily caloric intake, with reductions below 5&#x000a0;% highlighted as having additional health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, global intake of free sugars exceeds these recommendations, with the largest source in the diet being sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. SSBs are consumed widely around the world, including in the UK and USA, with carbonated drinks being the predominant product. For example, in 2013, carbonated drinks were purchased by 91&#x000a0;% of households in the UK and USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also in 2013, the average consumption of carbonated drinks per person in the UK was 103&#x000a0;l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and approximately 170&#x000a0;l in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>SSBs contain free sugars, including sucrose, high fructose corn syrup and other energy-containing sweeteners. A 330-ml portion of a carbonated SSB typically contains approximately 35&#x000a0;g (i.e. seven teaspoons) of sugar and provides approximately 140&#x000a0;cal, generally without any nutritional value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In recent decades, consumption of SSBs has increased globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given that consumers do not tend to reduce their energy intake to compensate for the additional energy provided by SSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], SSB consumption increases total daily energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], has thus been linked to weight gain and the development of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], metabolic syndrome and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], as well as hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], dental diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], gout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and is associated with an estimated 180,000 global deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. SSB intake may also contribute to observed inequalities in health outcomes, as it is socially patterned: In high-income countries, heavy consumption and purchasing are more common amongst adults and children of lower socio-economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the UK, for example, approximately 25&#x000a0;% of the population of regular SSB consumers live in the most deprived areas (i.e. areas ranked in the most deprived quintile based on their Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) compared to 15&#x000a0;% who live in the least deprived areas (i.e. areas ranked in the least deprived quintile based on their IMD scores) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Given the contribution of free sugars, especially from SSBs, to the rise in chronic disease and to health inequalities, curbing their intake has been identified for public health action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Identifying effective interventions is recognised as key to this action. Reducing the size of containers in which SSBs are available is one possible intervention. In the USA, a recent attempt to regulate the size of products in order to reduce their consumption comprised a ban on the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16&#x000a0;oz (473&#x000a0;ml) in many out-of-home settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The proposal has yet to be approved. In the UK, there are recent examples of companies reducing the portion sizes of sugary drinks as part of their voluntary pledges under the government&#x02019;s Public Health Responsibility Deal in England (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/about/">https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/about/</ext-link>). This intervention, increasing the availability of smaller portion sizes, has not been evaluated for its impact on beverage consumption or purchasing. In theory, several, often conflicting, mechanisms have been suggested as underlying the impact of the size of products, including beverages, on consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. One possibility is that people are guided by available external cues and so perceive the amount served to them as representing an appropriate portion size (a norm). They therefore consume less when offered smaller portions and more when offered larger portions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Perception of appropriate portion sizes might in turn be influenced by individuals&#x02019; personal and social norms about what constitutes a suitable amount to consume. As larger portions have become more prevalent and normalised, smaller portions might be considered less appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and therefore fail to reduce consumption. Contrary to this is the suggestion that smaller sizes might reduce consumption, regardless of whether they are considered a suitable portion, by making additional consumption more effortful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] or due to people&#x02019;s tendency to consume a specific number of product units in any one episode of consumption regardless of the unit size (referred to as the &#x02018;unit bias heuristic&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>From the above, it is clear that the theoretical literature on this issue is complex and does not allow for confident predictions to be made regarding the impact of bottle size on the consumption of SSBs. However, a large number of studies have examined the effects of portion and package sizing on the consumption of foodstuffs (such as cereal and snack foods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and a recent Cochrane review on this topic found that people consume less food the smaller the package size to which they are exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is unclear whether such findings are generalizable to beverage consumption, as there are no studies, to our knowledge, that examine the effects of manipulating the package size of drinks. The lack of relevant studies is also confirmed by the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Based on the aforementioned finding, however, we hypothesise that presenting SSBs in smaller containers will reduce consumption.</p><p>To assess this hypothesis and address the absence of relevant evidence, we are proposing a crossover randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of presenting a fixed volume of sugar-sweetened beverages in different bottle sizes on consumption in homes. The focus of this study is on the size of bottles containing cola, given that cola is the most consumed carbonated drink in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and is available in a wide range of container sizes. However, prior to conducting this trial, there is a need to reduce key uncertainties related to its design, including the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention to households and replacing existing SSBs and the feasibility of assessing consumption. There are also uncertainties relating to the specific bottle sizes the trial should focus on. As such, we are initially proposing a preliminary study with the aim of assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention and intervention delivery of the aforementioned randomised controlled trial.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p>The aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial of the impact of bottle size on consumption of cola in homes.</p><p>The specific objectives of the current study are to describe and assess the following:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>Feasibility of recruiting participants from eligible households into the trial, including estimating the recruitment rate</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p>Characteristics of recruited households, to judge the likelihood of recruiting a sample varied in potential effect modifiers (i.e. socioeconomic factors)</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii.</label><p>Bottle sizes that are most appropriate for use in the planned trial</p></list-item><list-item><label>iv.</label><p>Feasibility and practicalities associated with delivering the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><label>v.</label><p>Acceptability of the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><label>vi.</label><p>Awareness of the purpose of the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><label>vii.</label><p>Possible effect size, to inform sample size calculations for the planned trial</p></list-item><list-item><label>viii.</label><p>Feasibility and acceptability of the assessment procedures</p></list-item><list-item><label>ix.</label><p>Feasibility of collecting end - point data</p></list-item><list-item><label>x.</label><p>Loss-to-follow up rates</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>The proposed feasibility and acceptability study will be conducted in a community setting comprising residential households, located in Cambridgeshire, UK, including Cambridge City, South Cambridgeshire and East Cambridgeshire, which have a total population of 363,800.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>We propose to use a crossover design in which general population households will each be exposed to four intervention conditions over time, randomised in their order of presentation. The unit of randomisation is the household. The four conditions will comprise receipt of a given quantity of a carbonated cola sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB), sub-divided into bottles of one of four different sizes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2015_37_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e528"/></fig></p><p>A within-subjects, crossover design is being used because of the variability between households, which will vary considerably by size, as well as their social and psychological characteristics.

In order to evaluate recruitment rates, we will initially approach 100 eligible households with the aim of assessing how many would be interested in taking part in the study and how many would complete the run-in period (see &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Procedure</xref>&#x02019; section for details). We assume that households completing this period would be likely to continue, completing at least one intervention period. Of the households completing the run-in period and expressing a willingness to continue with the study, we will invite 16 to continue their participation and undergo the intervention periods.

This fixed volume will be determined with reference to the volume of cola households purchased during a 2-week baseline period, as assessed by till receipts and by self-report, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 3&#x000a0;l. For example, if households purchased 2&#x000a0;l per week, they will receive 3&#x000a0;l during each intervention period; if they purchased three and a half litres, they will receive 6&#x000a0;l etc. Households purchasing amounts already consisting of a multiple of 3&#x000a0;l will receive this exact amount (e.g. if they purchased 3&#x000a0;l, they will receive 3&#x000a0;l). Volumes consisting of multiples of 3&#x000a0;l are needed to avoid the total quantity varying systematically between intervention periods, thereby confounding the effect of altering the bottle size with volume. During each intervention week, households will be given the opportunity to receive additional deliveries should they want these.</p><p>All participating households will receive all interventions according to a pre-specified random order (see &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Randomisation</xref>&#x02019; section for details). During the first intervention period, four households will receive cola in each of the intervention bottle sizes, subsequently crossing-over to the other conditions during the remaining three intervention periods, until all households have been exposed to all conditions. All intervention periods will be conducted during school term times, in order to avoid increased consumption during any specific period due to the increased presence of children in the homes. During the intervention periods, a researcher will visit participating households to deliver the total volume of the cola (Coca-Cola<bold>&#x000ae;</bold> or Pepsi Cola<bold>&#x000ae;</bold> depending on their preference) SSB for the forthcoming week. The researcher will remove any existing SSB products that are in the household, with financial compensation provided for any removals. At the end of each week, households will be requested to pay for the SSB drinks they consume at their usual purchasing rate. During the intervention periods, households will be requested to continue to keep all bottles whether the contents are consumed, partially consumed or not consumed. They will be told that the reason for this is to accurately estimate how much they need to pay for their drinks, based on the amount they consumed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation will be restricted to ensure that (a) equal numbers of households receive each of the four bottles sizes at each intervention period (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and (b) each bottle size is equally likely to be preceded and followed by each other bottle size. These conditions are imposed to ensure that the order in which the interventions are presented is counterbalanced and that outcomes are not affected by potential order and carry-over effects. In a larger trial, such as the future one we are planning, we do not foresee the need for imposing such restrictions, as randomisation of a large number of households is expected to minimise the chance of imbalances in the order of the interventions.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of households allocated to each bottle size during each intervention period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Bottle size</th></tr><tr><th/><th>250&#x000a0;ml</th><th>500&#x000a0;ml</th><th>1000&#x000a0;ml</th><th>1500&#x000a0;ml</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intervention period 1</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention period 2</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention period 3</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention period 4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We will initially randomly select four sequences (out of 24 available sequences) dictating the order in which households receive each bottle size.

If only 16 households agree to continue their participation, all will be invited to complete these additional stages.</p><p>Each household will receive &#x000a3;150 worth of shopping vouchers at the end of the study for completion of all intervention periods and follow-up assessments. This amount was determined based on the national minimum wage rates per hour and the level of commitment and amount of time spent participating in the study (approximately 25&#x000a0;h during 5-week period). Households completing the run-in period but not invited to continue their participation, or not interested in continuing, will receive &#x000a3;30 worth of shopping vouchers.</p><p>Households will not be fully informed at recruitment of the purpose of the interventions and of the study&#x02019;s aim, as it is assumed that such knowledge could potentially influence the outcome. Instead, household representatives will be told that the study involves a consumer research exercise aiming to determine whether and how different bottles affect people&#x02019;s consumption experiences. Specifically, they will be told that the study will explore whether different bottle sizes influence perceptions of taste, level of enjoyment and satisfaction associated with beverage consumption, perceived product quality and likelihood that the product will be purchased in the future, as well as attitudes towards different bottles, including their appeal and user - friendliness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Baseline assessments</title><p>At enrolment, household representatives (i.e. individuals who are recruited from each household to provide the necessary data) will be asked to give written informed consent on behalf of their household for participating in the study and for adhering to the study procedures. Following this, they will be requested to complete a questionnaire to record their household&#x02019;s demographic characteristics, including the number of adults and children living in their home, their age, gender, highest educational qualification and annual household income. They will also be asked to indicate how much cola per week their household usually buys for in-home consumption, as well as the total amount their household drinks outside the home. The amount of cola typically consumed per week by each household will also be estimated based on grocery shopping till receipts, which household representatives will be asked to collect during a 2-week period. Discrepancies between amounts indicated by till receipts and self-report will be discussed with household representatives, in order to determine the household&#x02019;s typical weekly consumption as accurately as possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Follow-up assessments</title><p>At the end of each of the intervention weeks, household representatives will be asked to estimate the amount of SSB their household consumed in the preceding week and to indicate whether any SSB was consumed by non-household members (i.e. visitors).

Awareness of the study&#x02019;s aim will also be assessed during interviews with household representatives, which will be conducted after the end of all intervention periods. Household representatives will be fully debriefed on the study aims at the end of this final assessment session. The debriefing process will include an explanation of the study&#x02019;s scientific aim and the reasons for not revealing this at recruitment (i.e. that awareness of the intervention&#x02019;s purpose was expected to influence the outcome), as well as information regarding the adverse consequences of excessive SSB consumption. This information will be provided both verbally by a member of the research team, as well as in writing. At this point, household representatives will be given the opportunity to make any enquiries regarding the study and address any related issues they might have. They will also be asked to provide written consent for their household&#x02019;s collected data to be used having been informed of the scientific aims of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcomes and measures</title><p>Feasibility outcomes<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Recruitment rates</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of households discontinuing participation at follow-ups</p></list-item><list-item><p>Awareness of the study aim, assessed through (i) questionnaire and (ii) qualitative interviews</p></list-item><list-item><p>Practical problems associated with<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025e6;The randomisation procedure</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Delivering the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Collection of consumption-related data</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p>Acceptability outcomes assessed through qualitative interviews<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Acceptability of the<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Interventions</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Study procedures</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Assessment procedures</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p>Other outcomes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Characteristics of participating households, assessed through questionnaire<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Index of Multiple Deprivation scores (derived from postcodes)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Total household income</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Household composition (number of adults; number of children)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Highest education qualification obtained by any person within the household</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Gender of all household members</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025e6;Age of all household members</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Volume of cola in millilitres consumed by the household during each of the week-long intervention periods, measured<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>Objectively, by recording the numbers of empty and remaining full bottles.

Curbing SSB consumption, which has increased rapidly around the world in the last decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], has accordingly become a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], with recent research focusing on identifying effective interventions.</p><p>A number of interventions aiming to reduce SSB consumption exist and have been assessed in recent studies. These include the use of education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the provision of caloric information through labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, the effects of these have been, at best, modest with the latter being observed in one study to increase, rather than decrease, consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To achieve significant reductions in SSB consumption, it has been argued that regulatory approached are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], such as increases in the price of SSBs through taxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Although there is some evidence to suggest that in principle, an SSB tax could reduce consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], further evidence is needed based on observed rather than modelled effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Preliminary results of the effects of an SSB tax in Mexico (constituting approximately a 10&#x000a0;% increase in price per litre) shows a 10&#x000a0;% decline in purchases in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The policy awaits further evaluation. Discussions regarding implementation of taxes on SSBs in other countries have been met with objections, such that it would unfairly penalise low-income individuals and households and would unfairly single out one type of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This highlights the need to also explore further, potentially more acceptable ways of reducing SSB consumption. Another potentially effective regulatory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] that might be more acceptable than taxation is to restrict serving sizes. However, the impact of such an intervention has yet to be thoroughly examined. Simulation studies suggest that the introduction of a restriction on available beverage sizes, such as the ban proposed by the mayor of New York City on sales of SSBs larger than 16&#x000a0;oz (473&#x000a0;ml), could have favourable effects on consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, there is currently a lack of experimental evidence&#x02014;as opposed to evidence from simulation studies&#x02014;to support the use of such an intervention. In addition, the impact of presenting the same total amount of a beverage in multiple, smaller packages on SSB consumption is unknown.</p><p>The current feasibility and acceptability study is designed to finalise the design and conduct of a future, full-scale trial to assess whether reducing the size of the bottles in which SSBs are presented can reduce consumption. Its primary purpose is to address key design uncertainties for the trial, including the feasibility of recruiting eligible households, the practicalities of delivering the intervention to households and replacing existing SSBs and the feasibility of assessing consumption, as well as the specific bottle sizes that should be targeted. It will be the first study to our knowledge to explore the use a package-size intervention for reducing SSB consumption. Its robust experimental design and naturalistic setting are expected to enhance the value of the findings, whilst inclusion of a qualitative component will also provide a detailed understanding of the acceptability of the intervention. It should be noted,however, that as this is a feasibility study, findings will require replication in larger and more representative samples.</p><p>The success of this feasibility and acceptability study will be judged on a number of criteria, including (i) our target sample size is met by approaching 100 households, (ii) recruited households match the deprivation level of typical SSB consumers in the UK (i.e. 50&#x000a0;% are from areas falling under the fourth and fifth IMD quintile), (iii) the majority of participants are not aware of the study&#x02019;s scientific aim and (iv) at least 12 households out of 16 complete the first intervention period. Should some of these indicators of success not be met, we will consider changes to the study design and procedures before deciding whether and how to proceed with the trial. Specifically, we will consider additional recruitment methods and perhaps widen the target recruitment areas and/or modify the specified eligibility criteria. Larger than expected attrition rates will be accounted for in the trial sample size calculations. Knowledge of the study&#x02019;s scientific aim could affect the results. Therefore, if we find that most participants are aware of the study aims, we will consider an alternative cover story.</p><p>In conclusion, evidence regarding the effectiveness of sizing interventions for reducing SSB consumption is currently lacking. The proposed study will provide information needed to finalise the design of a future crossover randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of reducing bottle size on in-home consumption of SSBs. This trial will provide the best estimate to date of the potential effect of altering the packaging size of SSBs on consumption and thereby inform policy concerning the use of such interventions to reduce consumption to improve population health and reduce health inequalities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Residential postcodes will be used to calculate IMD scores.
