recent years in line with the increase in the number
of adults who are treated with fixed orthodontic
treatment. Ceramic brackets have considerable
aesthetic advantages in comparison to metal
brackets. However, they may lead to problems
such as pain, bracket breakage and enamel damage
(cracks, breakage) during debonding due to high
bonding resistance and their high elastic modulus
in comparison to metal brackets as well as their low
flexibility and higher fragility (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Using specialized hand tools and utilization of
various techniques such as ultrasonic or electrothermal
debonding have been suggested in order to overcome
such problems encountered during debonding (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, lasers are used experimentally for
ceramic bracket debonding. Lasers are effective in
softening the adhesion at the bracket/resin interface
by producing heat energy. Therefore, problems
such as enamel break, bracket detachment and pain
experienced during debonding can be solved (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In
addition, lasers have advantages over other debonding
methods such as decreasing debonding force and
shortening debonding time. Widespread use of laser systems today has been
evaluated in various studies by considering variables
such as effectiveness of lasers in debonding process,
energy levels, bracket type, resin type and the force
magnitude (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On the other hand, the type of laser
used in most of the previous studies is CO2 laser,
which can be easily absorbed by ceramic brackets
(<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Remaining few studies have suggested the use
of Nd:YAG laser. However, it was reported that 69%
- 75% of the laser beam would reach to the enamel
surface. In addition, this type of laser could cause
damage on the tooth surface and pain experienced
during debonding may increase (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are only
two studies illustrating the usage of Er:YAG laser for
debonding purpose. In the first of these, Mundethu et
al. (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported that 95% of the ceramic brackets on
the 3rd molar teeth were debonded by using Er:YAG
laser (600 mJ). In the other, &#x000d6;ztoprak et al. (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)
successfully debonded ceramic brackets on bovine
lower incisor teeth with Er:YAG laser (4.2 W, 9 sec.)
scanning.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate
the effectiveness of Er: YAG (3 W, 6 sec.) that was
used in debonding procedure of polycrystalline
ceramic brackets in human lower incisor teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Twenty extracted, intact, lower incisor teeth
(central and lateral) were used. Possible plaque
and soft tissue remaining on the teeth surface was
removed by the aid of water and brush and the teeth
were kept in 0.1% thymol solution. Subsequently the
teeth were evaluated in stereomicroscope (Olympus
SZ61; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) at X10
magnification in terms of cavity or enamel crack
presence.</p><p>The teeth with cavity, restoration and surface
anomalies were not included in the study. The cleaned
and dried enamel surfaces were etched with 37%
phosphoric acid for 30 sec. and then washed with water
and dried. Twenty polycrystalline alumina brackets
(Transcend series 6000, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA,
USA) were used. The brackets with Transbond XT
adhesive (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, ABD) placed
in their bases were brought to a proper position on
the labial surfaces of the lower incisor teeth, pushed
lightly and the excess adhesive was cleaned with a
sharp curette. The adhesive was light polymerized for
10 seconds from four sides of the bracket reaching a
total of 40 seconds for each specimen (Demetron LC,
SDS Kerr; light output: 400 mW/cm2). Teeth were
embedded in acrylic blocks (Orthocryl, Dentaurum,
Ispringen, Germany) so that the enamel surfaces were
exposed. Before the test stage, the samples were kept
in 370<sup>C</sup> distilled water for 48 hours.</p><p>The samples were divided into 2 groups randomly.
In Group 1 which is the control group, no process
was performed prior to the breaking test (SBS &#x02013; Shear
Bond Strength test) (n=10). In group 2, prior to SBS
test, scanning was made on the enamel surface (n=10)
by Er:YAG laser (Fotona, At Fidelis, Ljubljana,
Slovenia) with the following parameters: 2940-nm
wavelength, MSP (maxi short pulse) mode, pulsation
width:100 microseconds (&#x003bc;s), pulsation frequency:10
Hertz (Hz), power:3W. The equipment was used at
the mode of contact with air and water, with 120 mJ
(millijoule) pulsation energy, 1 mm away from the
bracket surface by a single researcher for 6 sec. The
scanning was made starting at the upper distal wing
of the bracket by moving horizontally and parallel to
the bracket slot, and subsequently, at the upper mesial
wing, bracket slot, low distal wing and finally to end
at the low mesial wing (reverse letter S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The bonding resistance of the samples was
evaluated by universal test equipment (Shimadzu
Autograph AG-IS, Kyoto, Japan). The knife edge shaped metal tip of the Instron device was placed
parallel to the tooth-bracket mid surface to apply a
0.5mm/min to perform the SBS test. The value at
the moment of separation of bracket from the teeth
surface was calculated in Newton (N) unit and it
was converted to megapascal (MPa) (MPa=N/mm2
x 0,980665). All measurements were performed by
the same operator (S.E.) under standard clinical
conditions. After the brackets are separated, in
order to determine the breakage region and type,
breakage surfaces were examined in stereomicroscope
(Olympus SZ61; Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan)
with X10 magnification and they were scored between
0 and 3 according to ARI (adhesive remnant index)
system (score 0: there is no adhesive remaining at
the tooth surface, &#x0003c;%10; score 1: there is less than
50% adhesive remaining at the tooth surface; score
2: there is more than 50% adhesive remaining at the
tooth surface; score 3: all adhesive is left at the tooth
surface, (&#x0003e;90%).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Laser application.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jiufd-050-024-e001"/></fig><sec id="s2a"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>MS Excel 2003 (MS Excel 2003 &#x000a9; 1985-2003

orthodontics should be between 6MPa to 8 MPa to
prevent possible damages from occurring to teeth
and periodontal tissues (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). On the other hand, it
was reported that when ceramic brackets are used,
this force could reach 20 MPa and cracked-breakages
could develop in the enamel and breakage could
occur in the brackets (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Recently, lasers which
minimizes enamel damage during the debonding of
ceramic brackets and facilitates the debonding process,
are used as an alternative to mechanical methods.
When lasers are used for debonding, they destroy
the structure of the adhesive at the bracket/resin
interface by thermal softening, thermal ablation or
photo ablation (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Briefly, thermal softening takes
place at low laser power levels (the transmitted heat is
absorbed in the bracket first and it affects the adhesive
indirectly) whereas at high laser power levels, when
laser is applied to the resin directly, thermal ablation
or photo ablation occurs (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It was reported that
monocrystalline and polycrystalline ceramic brackets
have shown different reactions to laser light at different wavelengths due to different optic characteristics (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
Successful results were reported with CO2 (10600 nm),
Nd:YAG (1060 nm), KrF (248 nm), XeCl (308 nm)
lasers and debonding force, as well as enamel damage
risk, were found to decrease significantly (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our findings are consistent with those of previous
studies which showed that the lasers are effective
in debonding of ceramic brackets by smoothing
adhesive resin (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 12, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Er:YAG laser
(3W) disrupted the resin structure and diminished SBS
force. However, higher ARI scores were observed in
the study group in comparison to the control group.
This illustrates that there is a negative correlation
between the bonding resistance and ARI scores which
is consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>CO2 lasers were used in most of the previous
studies owing to their high wavelengths and well
absorption rate by ceramic brackets (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Tocchio
et al.(<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) applied CO2 laser at 3-33 W/cm2 force and
at the wavelengths of 248nm, 308nm and 1060nm for
3, 5 and 24 seconds for ceramic bracket debonding,
and no enamel or bracket damage were observed in
any of the samples. Ma et al.(<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Rickabaugh et al.
(<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) used modified debonding clips along with CO2
laser, and they found significant differences between
the tensile debonding forces of the samples in the
study and control group samples. They reported that
the brackets can be extracted from the tooth surface
by the debonding clip until reaching the adhesive
softening temperature of the brackets. They showed
that immediate extraction of the brackets at the
softening temperature has prevented the heat energy
stored in the bracket to be transmitted to the teeth
thereby preventing the temperature rise (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Obata
et al. (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) investigated the bonding and debonding
of ceramic brackets by super-pulsating and normalpulsating
CO2 laser both in vivo and in vitro. In
the in vivo study, following the laser application to
each tooth, rotation forces were applied by the aid
of clips and the brackets were removed. In the in
vitro study, shearing forces of CO2 lasers with 2 W
and 3 W forces were measured. It was concluded
that using super pulsating CO2 laser (2 W and 3 W)
for debonding was more beneficial than using it for
bonding (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Feldon et al. (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) examined shearing
bonding resistance by using diode laser of 2 and 5 W/
cm2 force for 3 second for debonding monocrystalline
and polycrystalline ceramic brackets and they reported
that laser application did not reduce the required forces
for the removal of polycrystalline ceramic brackets,
and it diminished the force magnitude required for debonding of monocrystalline ceramic brackets.</p><p>Thermal softening by CO2 lasers increases the
temperature in the inner pulp chamber and may lead
to pulp damage. Hayakawa et al. (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) used Nd:YAG
laser that could affect resin structure directly by the
thermal ablation and photo ablation effects. They
showed that Nd:YAG laser is more effective in ceramic
bracket extraction at 2 Joules and that it decreased the
polycrystalline ceramic brackets bonding resistance
more than it does for monocrystalline brackets (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). They showed that high pulsating Nd:YAG laser
had lower ceramic absorption levels in comparison
to CO2 laser and, after laser application, the ceramic
brackets were removed by thermal ablation or photo
ablation (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thermal ablation or photo ablation
occurs when higher power laser beam interacts with
adhesive material. This process causes the disruption
of adhesive structure (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is believed that laser beam
transmittance is significant without resin energy loss
by means of the bracket for thermal ablation or photo
ablation to take place (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For this purpose, Hayakawa
et al. (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) applied laser energy under the wing of each
bracket for the ceramic bracket to the labiolingual
direction for gingiva which are the thinnest part and
for the coronal surface to correspond to the midpoint
mesiodistally. It was shown that Nd:YAG laser caused
disruption and collapse at the base of the bracket
and the remaining adhesive caused localized changes
similar to carbonization and black remains and these
burned parts verified that Nd:YAG laser had enamel
permeability more than that of CO2 laser (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In
addition, it was reported that since Nd:YAG laser
gives this high energy during the short application
period, inner pulp temperature increase was only
5.1 0C (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, Strobl et al. (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) extracted
alumina ceramic brackets with monocrystalline and
polycrystalline structure by using Nd:YAG (1060nm)
and CO2 (10600 nm) laser in their study, and reported
that both types of laser application for debonding
purpose warmed the labial surface of the bracket and
this heat dispersed through the resin from inside of
the bracket and softened adhesive resin thermally and
facilitated debonding. Moreover, they illustrated that
monocrystalline brackets needed less laser energy
in comparison to polycrystalline brackets (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In
the usage of Nd:YAG laser for debonding purpose,
length of the application period and heat transmittance
amount should be cared for. Further, it would have
been better to evaluate intrapulpal temperature change
in conjunction with the SBS values. There are only two
studies in orthodontic literature evaluating debonding effectiveness by using Er:YAG laser. In the first study
conducted by &#x000d6;ztoprak et al.(<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), ceramic brackets
pasted to cattle low incisors were removed by using
Er:YAG laser (4.2 W, 9 sec.) and it was reported that
there was lower SBS values in the group which was
applied laser (9.52 MPa) in comparison to the control
group (20.75 MPa). Although the results of this study
were in line with our results (laser applied group was
8.47 MPa, control group was 13.42 MPa), usage of
cattle teeth instead of human teeth (different enamel
contents) and different power and application period
of the used laser makes the comparison of this study
and our study difficult (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although a decrease in
SBS values in laser application similarly and the
closeness of the average SBS values in the group
where laser is applied, our SBS values of the control
group teeth were lower. The other study was conducted
by Mundethu et al. (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and it was shown that the
brackets pasted to 3rd molar teeth were extracted
effectively by Er:YAG laser. In this study, usage of
3rd molar teeth with curved surface caused differences
in composite thickness and therefore differences in
SBS values and this makes the comparison difficult
(<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, although the results of our study are
in line with the results of the previous studies as the
laser application of the previous studies by using CO2,
Nd:YAG and Er:YAG laser was an effective method in
bracket debonding, other than the different laser types
and application techniques, we think that differences
can be seen depending on the bracket type, adhesive
type and pasting technique and the comparison of the
previous studies would not be appropriate (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, ARI scores were found to
be higher in the study group samples where Er:YAG
laser scanning was made. In the laser applied study
group samples, owing to the low SBS values, brackets
were removed easily and on the other hand ARI scores
were found to be high. This meant that there was
more adhesive left at the enamel surface and this
increased the cleaning period of teeth surface and
made their cleaning more difficult. Moreover, inner
pulp heat increases could occur during the cleaning
of remaining adhesive. Therefore, it is necessary that
studies are needed evaluating thermal effects on the
pulp during remaining adhesive cleaning at debonding
and afterwards with the debonding SBS value prior
to the application of Er:YAG laser in vivo conditions.</p><p>Different studies reported that inner pulp heat
increase could occur during debonding of the brackets
by laser at between 5.5 0C and 28.7 0C (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It
was reported that as long as the heat increase at the
pulp room does not go over the acceptable limits
determined by Zach and Cohen (5.5 0C) (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), it would
not cause a permanent damage in the pulp. CO2 laser
usage in the extraction of ceramic brackets could
lead to excessive heating (150 0C) of pulp tissue
(<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, different laser types started to be
preferred. In the studies examining Nd:ref-type="bibr" rid="b laser
effect on pulp, conflicting results were observed.
(<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) Shoji and Horiuchi (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) determined in their
study conducted with Nd:ref-type="bibr" rid="b that 4 weeks after the
laser application, they determined low level calcified
tissues in the pulp and reported that as the energy level
increased, dentin repair tissue amount of the pulp
increased as well. In the previous studies comparing
the effects of Er:ref-type="bibr" rid="b and Nd:ref-type="bibr" rid="b laser systems,
which are used for debonding, on the pulp, it was
reported that although both laser systems had similar
effects on adhesive resin, Er:ref-type="bibr" rid="b laser caused less
intrapulpal heat increase in comparison to Nd:ref-type="bibr" rid="b
laser (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In a study investigating intrapulpal heat
increase in Er:ref-type="bibr" rid="b laser usage during debonding, it
was reported that heat increase did not go over 5.5
0C and ceramic brackets can be removed without
damaging the enamel and pulp tissue and that 6 sec
scanning method as the application time was ideal
(<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, it was also reported that another
crucial point to prevent pulp heat change during the
debonding of ceramic brackets was performance
of the 2nd laser application after giving minimum
5 minute interval if the bracket was not able to be
extracted during the first 5-6 -second application (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).
Therefore, instead of application of Er:ref-type="bibr" rid="b for 6
sec. and applying laser application at a single point,
we preferred to do it as a scanning starting from the
upper distal corner in order to prevent excessive heat
increase in the pulp although it takes a longer time
and in order to allow tissue cooling.</p><p>Another factor affecting SBS values is the
thickness of the composite material. However, no
special method was able to be found to standardize
the composite material thickness in the previous
studies (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We did not use any standardization
method for composite material thickness in our
study, however, since we used lower central and
lateral incisor teeth with smoother buccal surface in
comparison to other teeth, we think that the composite
layer is relatively thin and its thickness is relatively
equal along the entire surface.</p><p>There are studies investigating the effect of laser
debonding process on SBS value at the same time
with bracket extraction and laser application, right after laser application and a few hours before the
application (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The common result of these
studies is that by shortening the time between the laser
application and extraction phase as much as possible,
more successful results are achieved. In Abdul-Kader
and Ibrahim&#x02019;s study (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) where laser application period
is ignored, ceramic brackets were extracted right after
laser application and 1 minute after laser application,
and SBS values were compared. It was reported that
lower enamel resistance was required when brackets
were extracted right after laser application. They
explained these results based on the fact that bonding
softened up right after laser application and therefore
the brackets were extracted by less force (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In our
study, we preferred to debond the brackets by SBS
test right after the laser application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Application of Er:YAG laser thermally softened
adhesive resin structure, lowered the bonding
resistance of ceramic brackets, and enabled their
debonding. However, ARI score increased by
laser application, extended the remaining adhesive
cleaning time and can lead to temperature increases
within the pulp. Therefore, thermal effects of Er:YAG
laser application on pulp tissue should be further
investigated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Source of funding:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Azzeh</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Feldon</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laser debonding of ceramic brackets: A comprehensive review</article-title><source>Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop</source><year>2003</year><issue>1</issue><volume>123</volume><fpage>79</fpage><lpage>83</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1067/mod.2003.2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12532067</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bishara</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Trulove</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparisons of different debonding techniques for ceramic brackets: An in vitro study.
