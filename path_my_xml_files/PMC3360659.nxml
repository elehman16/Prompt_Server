Because this variant is most strongly associated with ovarian cancer risk in patients from hereditary breast and ovarian families (HBOC), and with the risk of premenopausal triple negative breast cancer, we evaluated the association of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant with women with personal histories of both breast and ovarian cancer, referred to as double primary patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Design</title><p>Germline DNA from double primary patients was tested for the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>232). Confirmation of pathologic diagnoses, age of diagnoses, interval between ovarian cancer diagnosis and sample collection, additional cancer diagnoses, and family history were obtained when available. All patients were tested for deleterious <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant was significantly enriched in uninformative (<italic>BRCA</italic> negative) double primary patients, being found in 39&#x00025; of patients accrued within two years of their ovarian cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant was found in 35&#x00025; of uninformative double primary patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer post-menopausally, and was significantly associated with uninformative double primary patients with a positive family history. The <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant was also significantly enriched in uninformative patients who developed more then two primary cancers, being found in 48&#x00025; of women with two breast primaries plus ovarian cancer or with triple primary cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings further validate the importance of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant in breast and ovarian cancer risk, and support the association of this variant as a genetic marker for HBOC families previously considered uninformative.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome is an inherited cancer-susceptibility syndrome marked by an increased risk of developing both ovarian cancer and breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Antoniou1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Families generally considered as having HBOC syndrome are those with multiple family members that have one of these cancers, especially at young ages, or an individual with a cancer in both organs, a &#x0201c;double primary&#x0201d; patient. While this is a relatively rare presentation, a substantial number of women develop both breast and ovarian primaries over their lifetime. While <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> are strongly associated with HBOC syndrome <xref rid="pone.0037891-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, a large number of HBOC families and women with double primary cancer do not have detectable genetic mutations (herein referred to as &#x0201c;uninformative&#x0201d; patients).</p><p>The chances of identifying a mutation causative for HBOC increase when testing individuals diagnosed with double breast/ovarian primaries <xref rid="pone.0037891-Fishman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037891-Cvelbar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, a recent report suggests that the rates of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations are not higher in a patient with a double primary without a family history than that for isolated first degree relative pairs with single primaries (14&#x00025; versus 17&#x00025; with mutations, respectively) <xref rid="pone.0037891-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This supports the importance of family history even in patients with double primary cancers. Although <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations were found in 49&#x00025; of double primary patients in this recent analysis, it should be noted that this indicates that over half of double primary patients do not have a known genetic cause for their disease. This is consistent with other reports of these patients <xref rid="pone.0037891-Fishman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037891-Cvelbar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Many women diagnosed with premenopausal breast cancer undergo testing for <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations, and many do this to gain information on their future ovarian cancer risk <xref rid="pone.0037891-Fishman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037891-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For these women this may be the most important role of genetic testing, as positive testing could allow prevention or early detection of ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Stadler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that women with breast cancer who are negative for <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations are not at an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer in the absence of a significant family history of ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Metcalfe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Previously, there have not been additional genetic markers associated with risk of disease in both the breast and the ovary besides <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>. However, a functional germline variant in the 3&#x02032;UTR of the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene (<italic>rs61764370</italic>) has been recently identified and reported to be associated with increased risk of both invasive epithelial ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Ratner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Paranjape1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> in clinically well-annotated cohorts. The association of the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant with ovarian cancer was most significant for uninformative women from HBOC families, and the association with breast cancer was significant for premenopausal women with triple negative breast cancer, also often indicative of an HBOC family.</p><p>The goal of this study was to determine the association of the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant with women with double primary breast and ovarian cancer, to further validate the association of this variant with HBOC families.

<bold>Table 5</bold>
</xref>). The <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant was most enriched in women who were tested within two years of their ovarian cancer diagnosis, likely reflecting the increased risk of interim death of <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant positive ovarian cancer patients with longer accrual times <xref rid="pone.0037891-Ratner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant was significantly associated with <italic>BRCA</italic>-uninformative patients who developed ovarian cancer post-menopausally (as estimated by age &#x0003e;52 years), and with <italic>BRCA</italic>-uninformative patients with a positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Finally, the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing a third, independent cancer in addition to breast and ovarian cancer, being found in 43.8&#x00025; of patients with triple primary cancers, most of whom had uninformative <italic>BRCA</italic> testing. It is possible that a small proportion of cases considered <italic>BRCA</italic>-uninformative may harbor a large rearrangement mutation, known to account for about 10&#x00025; of deleterious <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations <xref rid="pone.0037891-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037891-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> given the lack of screening in many cases. However, this would not have altered the significance of the primary observations in this report. These findings further confirm that the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant is indeed a bona fide marker for uninformative HBOC families, and also highlights some similarities as well as some differences between <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant patients and <italic>BRCA</italic> mutant patients.</p><p>Because the great majority of <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant double primary patients in this study developed breast cancer before their ovarian cancer, it appears that there could have been an opportunity for ovarian cancer prevention through chemoprevention (oral contraceptives) and/or prophylactic oophorectomy for these women. In addition, the association of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant primarily with postmenopausal ovarian cancer suggests that oophorectomy might be reasonable delayed in these patients compared to recommendations for women with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations, where oophorectomy is recommended at 35 or upon completion of childbearing. Currently, women with premenopausal breast cancer who are uninformative for <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations without a family history of ovarian cancer are told that they have no increased risk of ovarian cancer, based on a study of hereditary breast cancer families <xref rid="pone.0037891-Stadler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our findings here indicate that women with the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant are also at an increased risk of subsequently developing ovarian cancer, and should be managed accordingly.</p><p>The finding that the prevalence of the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant is significantly higher in women tested within two years of ovarian cancer diagnosis likely reflects the fact that these patients have worse ovarian cancer specific survival and a higher risk for interim death over time <xref rid="pone.0037891-Ratner2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, the significant association of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant with early onset triple negative breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0037891-Paranjape1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the most deadly form of breast cancer, would also have likely diluted the prevalence of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant in these cohorts, as these women would be more likely to die of their breast cancer before development of ovarian cancer. Regardless, the prevalence of the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant remained significantly enriched in these patients even when studying the group as a whole. Importantly though these findings highlight the necessity of carefully considering study design when analyzing markers that predict aggressive tumor biology, such as the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant. Erroneous conclusions will otherwise be reached when using prevalence as a measure of the association with cancer risk if the populations studied have long ascertainment times. Such disparities in these and other areas of study cohort and design likely explain the failure to find the association between the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant and sporadic ovarian cancer risk in a prior publication <xref rid="pone.0037891-Pharoah1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, it is also important to highlight that the association found in this study is again strongest in women with a personal and family history most consistent with HBOC.</p><p>The finding that the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant is associated with uninformative women with double primary cancer is important, as it further confirms that 1) the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant is associated with uninformative HBOC families, 2) appropriate intervention for patients with the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant who develop breast cancer may allow prevention of future ovarian cancer and 3) women with cancer that have the <italic>KRAS-</italic>variant may benefit from screening to detect additional cancer development at its earliest stages. Overall, this work continues to support the importance of the <italic>KRAS</italic>-variant broadly in cancer biology, and specifically in women&#x02019;s health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ken Offit for contribution of his patient samples.
