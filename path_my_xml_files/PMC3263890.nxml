Insulin-resistant first-degree relatives have reduced insulin-mediated myocellular glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and glycogen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), and also may exhibit lower unidirectional flux through myocellular ATP synthase (fATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), but elevated muscle and liver fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Lower insulin-stimulated fATP has been observed in overt type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), suggesting that altered ATP production could be involved in the progression of insulin resistance to diabetes.</p><p>In lean, insulin-resistant first-degree relatives, intensive endurance exercise training reduced insulin resistance by increasing insulin-stimulated G6P and glycogen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Such improvement of insulin resistance also has been associated with greater mitochondrial density and/or function in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the response of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function to exercise training may be dissociated depending on age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and endocrine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition, only one group of first-degree relatives (responders) can improve their insulin sensitivity and fATP after 1 week of endurance exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The responder status was linked to the G/G single nucleotide polymorphism rs540467 in the <italic>NDUFB6</italic> gene, which encodes a subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain, relates to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and is less expressed in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether long-term endurance training can overcome this gene effect in nondiabetic first-degree relatives. Although intensive resistance exercise training also may ameliorate insulin resistance by increasing glucose transport and storage in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), this also has not been reported in first-degree relatives. In addition to the type of exercise, frequency also affects the metabolic outcome of training programs. Lower training frequencies (i.e., twice weekly) may improve insulin resistance using either resistance training in older men with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or endurance training in obese women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Because training regimens may provide higher exercise adherence and practicability for sedentary people, we tested the hypotheses that long-term but moderate exercise training <italic>1</italic>) improves fATP and insulin sensitivity and <italic>2</italic>) overcomes the impact of the <italic>NDUFB6</italic> gene polymorphism observed during short-term exercise and that <italic>3</italic>) endurance training is superior to resistance training in increasing fATP in glucose-tolerant, nonobese first-degree relatives.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four (50% female) eligible, glucose-tolerant, nonobese subjects with at least one parent with type 2 diabetes, confirmed by hyperglycemia or glucose-lowering treatment, were recruited from a group of first-degree relatives who had participated in a previous 1-week study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). By design, the 26-week exercise training immediately followed the 1-week exercise training. Four of these first-degree relatives declined to participate in the training study, and another four subjects (two from the endurance training group and two from the resistance training group) did not finish the study because of missing motivation (<italic>n</italic> = 2), depression (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and viral infection (<italic>n</italic> = 1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1426/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). Consequently, 16 (50% female) subjects with one (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or two (<italic>n</italic> = 4) parents with type 2 diabetes completed the study.</p><p>Subjects underwent medical history and physical examinations, including measurement of body weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and 12-lead electrocardiogram; blood and urine analyses; and oral glucose tolerance testing. Exclusion and inclusion criteria have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Women were neither taking hormonal contraceptives nor were they studied in the luteal phase of their cycle. Inclusion required written informed consent by the volunteer to the study, which was approved by the local institutional ethical board and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Then, participants were randomly assigned to either endurance or resistance training interventions.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Dietary assessment</title><p>Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and during weeks 13 and 27 with a modified interviewer-administered, 107-item, open-ended food frequency questionnaire adjusted for local dietary habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed for 150 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) to assess the dynamic insulin sensitivity with the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (OGIS). OGIS, obtained from a model-derived equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isib.cnr.it/bioing/ogis/home.html">http://www.isib.cnr.it/bioing/ogis/home.html</ext-link>), describes glucose clearance and has been validated against the clamp and other insulin sensitivity indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

In brief, after warm-up and familiarization, the volunteers were instructed to maximally push and pull through the full available range of motion (20&#x000b0; to 90&#x000b0;). Every test included two reciprocal bouts with a 10-s rest period after each bout and a 2-min resting period between the preset test velocities (30&#x000b0;/s and 60&#x000b0;/s). The highest absolute peak torques obtained at each velocity from both limbs were recorded for extension and flexion movements.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Exercise testing (incremental tests).</title><p>This test was performed using an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport; Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands) at 70 revolutions per min in an upright position to the limit of tolerance.

From incremental tests power output, oxygen uptake (<italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was determined at maximum load and at the aerobic threshold (respiratory compensation point; RCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Experimental protocols</title><p>All participants were advised to refrain from any physical exercise and to ingest carbohydrate-enriched meals during the 3 days before the start of all tests. In the evenings prior to the tests, the participants consumed identically composed carbohydrate-enriched dinners at identical times and then fasted for 12 h. On day 1, participants did not consume any calories except for the glucose provided during the OGTT until the end of the MRS. They underwent baseline blood sampling, OGTTs, and MRS. On day 2, they performed isokinetic strength tests, and 2 h later they performed the incremental exercise tests. On days 3 and 5, they exercised on a cycling ergometer. On day 7, measurements of day 1 were repeated in identical fashion as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thereafter, participants were randomly assigned to individually controlled endurance or resistance training, which started 1 week later, with every session supervised and documented by a coach. Blood checks and OGTTs were repeated in week 13.

Despite no overall improvement of insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function across all first-degree relatives, one subgroup (responders) exhibited greater muscular fATP after 26 weeks, which related to the presence of the G allele in the <italic>NDUFB6</italic> gene.</p><p>This study unmasks a dissociation between the effects of long-term exercise training on fATP and insulin sensitivity and extends our previous observation that the G allele, but not the A allele, in the <italic>NDUFB6</italic> gene associates with increases in both fATP and insulin sensitivity after short-term high-intensity exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This single nucleotide polymorphism in the <italic>NDUFB6</italic> gene nominally associates with risk markers of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), a disorder with impaired insulin-stimulated fATP in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Moreover, the function of <italic>NDUFB6</italic> is subject to epigenetic regulation by age in human skeletal muscle and by high-fat diet in rat adipose tissue, both of which also impair mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These and the current studies suggest that the response to chronic exercise training is independently modulated by mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. Inherited factors at least partly control this response and may thereby contribute to the success of physical activity in relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A dissociation between the stimulation of oxidative capacity, mitochondrial function, and insulin sensitivity has been reported recently. Aerobic training for 10 weeks increased oxidative capacity and muscle citrate synthase activity independently of changes in insulin sensitivity in obese humans with or without type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This group further reported similar intrinsic mitochondrial respiration at lower insulin sensitivity in men with type 2 diabetes despite improved insulin resistance after 10 weeks of aerobic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). On the other hand, 9 days of intensive exercise training increased fATP and citrate synthase but not whole-body insulin sensitivity in relatives of mothers with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Likewise, increased mitochondrial capacity also is present in severely insulin-resistant Asian Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), suggesting inherited variability of myocellular mitochondrial function, which is not necessarily coupled to insulin sensitivity.</p><p>In the current study, the responders were slightly older and had moderately greater WHR after the training period compared with the nonresponders, but they were not different in any other measured variable. Responders exhibited only nonsignificant trends toward lower resting fTAP and higher HCL, independent of insulin sensitivity and likely corresponding to their older age. Because increasing age and body fatness can be expected to rather reduce the responses of fATP, the finding of increased fATP after exercise training is unlikely to be from nongenetic causes.</p><p>Despite successful improvement of the specifically trained exercise capacities after 26 weeks, we could not support our hypothesis that endurance training is superior to resistance training in improving insulin sensitivity and fATP. In line with previous data, circulating adiponectin also did not change during exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Of note, <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> increased significantly only in responders, suggesting that the nonresponders&#x02019; inability to raise <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> despite improved maximum power output reflects their inability to increase fATP upon exercise training.</p><p>The training intensity for endurance training (80&#x02013;90% of Wkg<sub>RCP</sub>) was chosen to allow for sufficient stimulation of both glucose and lipid oxidation, which should subsequently decrease myocellular lipid metabolites and IMCL, thereby improving insulin signaling and glucose transport/phosphorylation (i.e., insulin sensitivity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Shorter-duration exercise (~115 min per week) was less effective in improving insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Low-intensity exercise (~40% of heart rate reserve) modestly raised <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> but failed to increase insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) in line with the current study. Although larger training effects have been demonstrated mainly in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), both dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and independent of weight loss or fat distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), less is known about their nonobese relatives. Perseghin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) reported substantially increased insulin-stimulated myocellular G6P and glycogen synthesis but no effect on glucose oxidation after 6 weeks of endurance training in first-degree relatives. The relatives of the current study showed no response in insulin sensitivity but evidence for greater oxidative metabolism in a subgroup, which could be attributed to their lower degree of insulin resistance. In overweight daughters of patients with type 2 diabetes, 7 weeks of endurance training increased the OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity index more than in female subjects without a family history of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, OGTTs were performed only 15&#x02013;24 h after the last exercise bout, indicating acute rather than sustained exercise effects. Finally, subclinical hypothyroidism also may attenuate exercise training&#x02013;induced improvements of insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), but all participants of this study had normal thyroid function.</p><p>This study evaluated the effects of a long-term, supervised individual&#x02013;regulated training, at twice weekly frequency, which is more realistic to be implemented in everyday life. Of note, twice-weekly training frequency was shown to improve insulin resistance using either resistance training in older men with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or endurance training in obese nondiabetic women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). On the other hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), recent studies found no change in insulin-mediated glucose uptake but increased muscular citrate synthase activity after intensive exercise training for 9 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) or 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The participants of the latter study were older, more obese, and had lower insulin secretion capacity compared with the relatives in our study. In younger relatives, insulin sensitivity also dissociated from <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> responses after 10 weeks of exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). After intensive endurance training for 6 weeks, young first-degree relatives showed a similar incremental improvement of whole-body insulin sensitivity, along with greater muscular insulin-stimulated glucose transport/phosphorylation, but failed to normalize insulin-stimulated muscular glycogen synthesis compared with matched control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Even patients with overt type 2 diabetes can normalize their muscular mitochondrial capacity upon 12 weeks of exercise training and still have lower insulin-stimulated nonoxidative glucose disposal than nondiabetic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Finally, the HERITAGE study provided evidence that even 20 weeks of exercise training only gradually raised insulin sensitivity, with a broad variability and a surprisingly low rate of ~42% of responders regarding insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest the existence of an exercise resistance in first-degree relatives, which might relate to impaired insulin signaling and specific abnormalities in nonoxidative glucose metabolism (glycogen synthesis) in their skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, other factors, such as differences in local perfusion, muscle fiber composition, and myocellular concentrations of triglycerides and lipid metabolites, also may be involved.</p><p>Despite the strengths of this study, such as the continuously supervised, diet-controlled intervention, noninvasive phenotyping, and meticulous exclusion of acute exercise action, possible limitations have to be addressed. The frequent-sampling OGTT was used instead of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, which is considered the gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity. Nonetheless, OGIS has been repeatedly shown to be equivalent to clamp-derived parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and exhibited similar behavior as fasting insulin levels in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Because no muscle biopsies were taken, we cannot differentiate whether changes in fATP were a result of different mitochondrial function or content. Furthermore, fATP measures demand-driven ATP synthesis at rest, not necessarily reflecting maximal mitochondrial capacity as assessed with postexercise phosphocreatine recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, twice-weekly exercise training for 26 weeks improves exercise performance but may not suffice to increase insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, muscular ATP synthase flux increases depending on genetic predisposition but independently of the mode of exercise and insulin sensitivity. These findings underline the relevance of gene-environment interactions for the efficacy of lifestyle interventions.</p></sec>
