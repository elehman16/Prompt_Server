Therefore, the present randomized controlled clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid (HA) in combination with bioresorbable membrane for the treatment of human infrabony defects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Twenty four infrabony defects in 20 systemically healthy patients were randomly assigned to test (HA in combination with bioresorbable membrane) and control (bioresorbable membrane alone) treatment groups. Probing pocket depth (PPD), relative attachment level, and relative gingival margin level were measured with a computerized Florida disc probe at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Radiographic measurements were also evaluated at baseline and at 6 months of postsurgery.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>At 6 months, the mean reduction in PPD in test group and control group was 4.52 mm and 2.97 mm, respectively. Significantly higher clinical attachment level with a gain of 2.20 mm was found in the test group as compared to control group. In addition, statistically significant greater reduction of radiographic defect depth was observed in the test group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Regenerative approach using hyaloss in combination with GTR for the treatment of human infrabony defects resulted in a significant added benefit in terms of CAL gains, PPD reductions and radiographic defect fill, as well as LBG, compared to the GTR alone.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Guided tissue regeneration</kwd><kwd>hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>infrabony defects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human case studies and studies using discriminating animal models have pointed to a considerable native biologic potential for regeneration of the periodontal attachment, that is, formation of new cementum, alveolar bone, and a functionally oriented periodontal ligament (PDL).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Critical clinical components for successful outcomes are: (1) Wound stability during the early healing sequence, (2) space provision to allow the migration and proliferation of cells from the PDL and alveolar bone along the periodontally exposed root and (3) conditions favoring primary intention healing, that is, the wound space remains protected from bacterial contamination and infection.</p><p>A large body of clinical studies has applied the principles of guided tissue regeneration (GTR) to resolve periodontal infrabony defects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Outcomes from such studies have been rather variable, suggesting that the understanding of the fundamental biology for periodontal regeneration is incomplete, or its clinical application is difficult to master or complicated by events compromising periodontal wound healing.</p><p>In the last few years, various biomaterials have been tested to achieve periodontal regeneration in different types of periodontal defects. Polypeptide growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]) are the most thoroughly studied growth factor in periodontics. The results of a pilot human clinical trial using recombinant human PDGF BB (rhPDGF-BB) has shown mitogenic and chemotactic potential for PDL cells and bone cells thereby promoting regeneration of bone, PDL, and cementum.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are another family of substances indicated as potential candidates for periodontal regenerative therapy. Studies in animal models showed their potential for periodontal tissue regeneration.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, one of the main issues for these materials is their release kinetics and need for a suitable carrier to keep the BMPs and growth factors <italic>in situ</italic> and to ensure space maintenance.</p><p>Recently, research has focused on a new substance, hyaluronic acid (HA), which is widely applied in other medical specialties such as ophthalmic and orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] HA has a number of embryological and bone healing properties, including the facilitation of cell migration and differentiation during tissue formation and repair.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] HA shares bone induction characteristics with osteogenic substrates such as bone morphogenic proteins.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Recent studies demonstrated that HA aids in the repair process of both soft and hard tissue.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It has been recently reported that HA increases osteoblastic bone formation <italic>in vitro</italic> through increased mesenchymal cells differentiation and migration. Pirnazar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated that HA may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds when used in GTR surgery. However, few studies have examined its possible regenerative effects in dentistry, particularly in Periodontics.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, the aim of the present randomized, controlled clinical study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HA in combination with bioresorbable membrane (poly lactic acid/poly glycolic acid [PLA/PGA]) for the treatment of infrabony defects in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 20 patients with moderate chronic periodontitis in the age range of 20&#x02013;40 years (mean age 32.16 &#x000b1; 8.12 years) were selected from the outpatient Department of Periodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College (Sawangi), Wardha using following inclusion and exclusion criteria:</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

These measurements were recorded at 6 sites of the selected teeth: Mesiobuccal, mesiolingual, distobuccal, distolingual, midbuccal, and midlingual. Only one measurement per defect, the deepest site of the selected defect at the baseline was included in the result calculations.

Prior to surgery, selected defects were randomly assigned by a coin flip to test and control groups each consisting of 12 defects, according to randomized parallel design. The test group was treated by HA in combination with bioresorbable membrane (PLA-PGA), while the control group was treated by bioresorbable membrane (PLA-PGA) alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Prior to the surgical procedure, the patients were instructed to rinse their mouth with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate solution (Hexidine, ICPA Health Products Ltd., India) for 1 min.</p><p>After infiltration with local anesthetic, intracrevicular (sulcular) incisions were given using Bard&#x02013;Parker surgical blade #15 and 12 on the buccal and lingual aspects. Full thickness flap was reflected, and alveolar bone in the area of osseous defect was exposed. The osseous defect and inner surface of the flap was debrided of granulation tissue. The root surfaces were planned until a smooth hard consistency was obtained. At this stage, direct measurements of the vertical BDs, and the number of bony walls present were recorded. If BD was &#x02265;3 mm vertically, final subject eligibility was confirmed. At this stage, the defects at test sites were treated with PLA-PGA membrane + HA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Procedure for test group (hyaloss + bioresorbable membrane)</title><p>Complete isolation and hemostasis of the defect was achieved. A sterile aluminium foil was utilized to obtain the approximate dimension and shape of the membrane. The bioabsorbable membrane (BioMesh-S<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Biodegradable GTR barrier, Samyang Crop., Korea) was trimmed in such a way that it completely covers the bony defect and extend at least 2 mm beyond the defect on all sides. Prior to the membrane placement over the defect, intramarrow penetration was performed with a half round bur. The flap was presutured without tying the knot to allow rapid flap closure after membrane placement.</p><p>The membrane was folded in half and then passed interproximally beneath the interdental contact and stabilized over the defect under the flap. Hyaloss matrix (HA &#x02013; Esterified HA in the form of fibers, Hyaloss matrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Meta, Italy) was mixed thoroughly with a few drops of physiological solution, in the sterile mixing container. The flap along with membrane was lightly raised on one side to fill the defect with hyaloss matrix. On contact with fluid, hyaloss matrix became gel and filled the BD, the excess gel was removed. The flap was coronally repositioned and sutured in such a way that the flap margin was located 1&#x02013;2 mm coronal to CEJ, thereby completely covering the membrane. A combination of vertical mattress suture and interproximal sutures (4-0 nonresorbable surgical sutures, braided black silk, Mersilk, Ethicon, Johnson Ltd., India) was used to secure the flap in position. Slight pressure was applied to the area with saline-soaked gauze for approximately 2 min, to adapt the soft tissue well to the tooth surface and eliminate any space in which a clot might form and disrupt re-attachment. The surgical site was dressed with periodontal dressing (Coe-Pak<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, GC, Inc., Alsip, IL, USA) on buccal and lingual aspects.</p><p>Surgical procedure for the GTR group was identical to the GTR + HA group except the omission of placement of hyaloss matrix.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>After surgery, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, consisting of combination of ibuprofen 325 mg and paracetamol 400 mg, 3 times a day along with antibiotic consisting of amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times a day was prescribed for 5 days during postsurgical period. Patients were instructed not to brush the teeth in the treated area. All the patients were instructed to rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hexidine, ICPA) twice daily, for 1 min, for a week. They were instructed not to disturb the pack and to avoid undue trauma to the treated site.</p><p>One week following surgery, periodontal pack and sutures were removed. Patients were instructed to clean the treated site with cotton pellet saturated with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for additional 2&#x02013;3 weeks in an apico-coronal direction and later on using a soft toothbrush (Plakoff Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, ICPA Health Products Ltd., India).

The greater mean CAL gain in their study could be explained by the differences in initial DD. The clinical studies have demonstrated that the CAL gain following regenerative periodontal therapy is strongly dependent on the initial DD that is, greater the initial depth, higher is the CAL gain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the present study, significantly greater mean CAL gain of 2.20 mm observed in hyaloss + GTR treated group in comparison with GTR alone group, could be related to molecular characteristics of hyaloss, since hyaloss is known to stimulate cell migration, cell proliferation and also act as a carrier for other molecules, such as BMPs-2.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>From clinical standpoint, it was more significant to observe that 100% of treated sites with hyaloss in combination with GTR experienced the CAL gain of more than 3 mm, while only 8.3% of sites treated with GTR alone showed CAL gain of more than 3 mm.</p><p>Reduction of pocket depth to limit the risk of local reinfection is a primary goal of periodontal therapy. Shallow pockets have a strong, negative predictive value for future disease progression while deep pockets in treated areas are risk indicators for periodontal disease progression. In the present study, pocket depth reductions were significantly greater in both test and control groups. The mean PPD reduction obtained in sites treated with hyaloss combined with GTR was 4.52 mm and 2.97 mm in GTR treated sites. A statistically significant greater reduction of mean PPD (1.55 mm) was observed in hyaloss combined with GTR group compared to the GTR alone group. The mean PPD reduction observed in the present study by using hyaloss + GTR are comparable with other studies reported on the use of hyaloss in combination with bioresorbable membrane. Engstr&#x000f6;m <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported mean PPD reduction of 4.1 mm when hyaloss was used in combination with bioabsorbable PLA barrier. However, Vanden Bogaerde[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported mean PPD reduction of 5.8 mm (range: 0&#x02013;10 mm) at 12 months following an application of HA. Greater reduction of PPD reported by Vanden Bogaerde[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] could be related to the inclusion of the initial probing pocket of variable depth, which may possibly have influenced the treatment outcome.</p><p>In the present study, frequency analysis demonstrated that all 12 sites (100%) treated with hyaloss in combination with GTR showed the mean pocket depth reduction of &#x0003e;3 mm, whereas in control group 2 sites (16.7%) showed pocket depth reduction of &#x0003e;3 mm and 10 sites (83.3%) reduction of &#x02264;3 mm.</p><p>Periodontal surgeries are frequently associated with GR, an adverse effect that concerns both patients and clinicians. Regenerative approaches, however, potentially could help to limit this unwanted side effect. In the present study, increase in GR was observed to a limited extent in test group (0.04 mm), whereas slightly greater amount of recession was observed in control group (0.37 mm) at the end of 6 months, however, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The observed mean increase in GR in the present study was lesser to that of one reported in other hyaloss study. Vanden Bogaerde[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported mean GR of 2.00 mm in hyaloss treated interproximal defects.</p><p>During 6 months period, the infrabony lesions in this study, responded well to hyaloss combined with GTR treatment with regards to reduction in radiographic DD. It is the experience of the investigators that the most accurate means of determining osseous defect response (crestal changes as well as within the defect) is by direct visualization at re-entry surgery, but a major disadvantage of re-entry procedure is the need for a second surgical procedure to visualize the osseous defect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] To overcome this difficulty, radiographic monitoring of alveolar bone changes has been utilized with various degrees of success.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Radiographic bone measurement is a noninvasive, painless alternative to direct bone measurement. Therefore in the present study, radiographic monitoring of alveolar bone changes was carried out as end point variable.</p><p>In the present study, reduction in radiographic DD was obtained by subtracting postsurgical DD from initial DD. At 6 months, DD reduction was significant in both test and control group. The mean DD reduction at 6 months in test group was 3.92 mm with 94% defect fill and 2.08 mm in control group with 55.55% defect fill. The mean DD reduction was significantly greater by 1.84 mm in test group compared to control group. Findings in the present study are comparable with the previous report using different biomaterials for the treatment of infrabony defects. Nevins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] evaluated effectiveness of rhPDGF-BB (0.3 mg/ml) mixed with a synthetic beta tricalcium phosphate (&#x003b2;-TCP) for the treatment of infrabony defect and reported 2.6 mm linear bone gain and 57% of BF at 6 months. McGuire <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] treated four cases each with one infrabony defects using 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB + &#x003b2;-TCP and reported 88% BF at 18 months follow-up.</p><p>The most reliable outcome variable for assessing periodontal regeneration is human histology. Due to ethical considerations and patient management limitations, no histological evidence was obtained to establish the proof of periodontal regeneration. The importance of wound stability for bone and periodontal regeneration has been reported. Based on the histological evidence from human material, it may be assumed that the clinical improvements following esterified HA treatment may represent at least to some extent, a real periodontal regeneration characterized by the increase of osteoblastic activity by stimulating differentiation and migration of mesenchymal cells.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Moreover, the physiochemical properties of HA help keep the growth factors responsible for tissue repair <italic>in situ</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the analysis of the results and within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that regenerative approach using hyaloss in combination with GTR for the treatment of human infrabony defects resulted in a significant added benefit in terms of CAL gains, PPD reductions and radiographic defect fill, as well as LBG, compared to the GTR alone.</p><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><nlm-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nyman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindhe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Karring</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Rylander</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>New attachment following surgical treatment of human periodontal disease</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1982</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>290</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6964676</pub-id></nlm-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><nlm-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sigurdsson</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hardwick</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bogle</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikesj&#x000f6;</surname><given-names>UM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal repair in dogs: Space provision by reinforced ePTFE membranes enhances bone and cementum regeneration in large supraalveolar defects</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1994</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>350</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8195980</pub-id></nlm-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><nlm-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wikesj&#x000f6;</surname><given-names>UM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Wozney</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hardwick</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal repair in dogs: Evaluation of a bioabsorbable space-providing macroporous membrane with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2003</year><volume>74</volume><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>47</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12816296</pub-id></nlm-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><nlm-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wikesj&#x000f6;</surname><given-names>UM</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiropaidis</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvig</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hardwick</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal repair in dogs: rhBMP-2 significantly enhances bone formation under provisions for guided tissue regeneration</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2003</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>705</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12887339</pub-id></nlm-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><nlm-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cortellini</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pini Prato</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Tonetti</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal regeneration of human intrabony defects with titanium reinforced membranes.
