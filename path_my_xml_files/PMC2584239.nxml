Study participants provided signed informed consent before baseline procedures were performed. In brief, two identically designed, phase 3, prospective, comparative studies comprised the trial; both had randomised, double-masked, controlled, dose-ranging, multicentre, parallel-group designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJ1-92-12-1606-f01">fig 1</xref>). At baseline, patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups (0.3 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg of pegaptanib sodium in 0.09 ml of solution or sham injections) and received nine intravitreous or sham injections once every 6 weeks for 48 weeks with follow-up to week 54. At week 54, subjects in the active therapy arms were rerandomised (1:1) to either discontinue or continue treatment for a further 48 weeks (eight injections). Subjects receiving sham were rerandomised at week 54 (1:1:1:1:1) to discontinue sham treatment, to continue on the study receiving one of the three active treatments or to continue on sham therapy.</p><fig id="BJ1-92-12-1606-f01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Randomisation at years 1, 2 and 3.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="BJ1-92-12-1606-f01"/></fig><p>At 102 weeks, 422 remaining subjects with visual acuity in the study eye of 20/800 or better continued treatment for a further nine injections in the third year (week 102 to week 150 with follow-up to week 156). Those receiving the 0.3 mg or 1 mg dose in year 2 continued on the same treatment, while subjects receiving the 3 mg dose or sham were rerandomised to 0.3 mg or 1 mg (1:1).

Analyses of injection-related serious adverse events included all subjects who received pegaptanib sodium in year 3 regardless of previous randomised treatment (ie, sham or treatment discontinued). Assessments of IOP changes were performed in subjects who received 0.3 mg or 1 mg of pegaptanib sodium continuously from years 1 to 3.

On average, subjects experienced an increase in IOP at the 30 min postinjection assessment compared with preinjection at each treatment visit. At the 1-week postinjection assessment, the pressure had returned to levels similar to preinjection. Of subjects treated with 0.3 mg or 1 mg of pegaptanib sodium continuously for 3 years, the mean IOP remained stable throughout the 3 years, and more than 80% of subjects did not experience IOP values &#x02a7e;35 mm Hg at any time. Intervention for increased IOP on injection days also was relatively infrequent. Ten of 109 (9%) underwent paracenteses, and only 17 (16%) required treatment with concomitant medications for increased IOP on one or more injection days during the 3-year follow-up.</p><p>The Independent Reading Center graded all baseline and week 30, 54, 78, 102 and 156 fluorescein angiograms. These examinations revealed no retinal vascular abnormalities that are unexpected in the natural history of NV-AMD. Specifically, there were no notable delays in arteriovenous transit time, or abnormalities in choroidal perfusion or arteriolar occlusions.</p><p>As in years 1 and 2, no evidence of systemic safety signals related to the inhibition of VEGF arose with the third year of administration of pegaptanib sodium. In the 161 subjects receiving active therapy for 3 years, the most common nonocular adverse events in year 3 were infections and infestations (18%); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (15%); and gastrointestinal disorders (14%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BJ1-92-12-1606-t04">table 4</xref>). There were no thromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents; only two subjects had an event of myocardial infarction (2%), and one subject had an event of angina (1%). The incidence of these thromboembolic events was the same among the entire cohort of 422 subjects treated with pegaptanib sodium in year 3 and was similar to those observed in the pegaptanib and sham groups in years 1 and 2. There were no serious nonocular haemorrhagic events. Among the entire cohort of 422 subjects treated with pegaptanib sodium in year 3, the most frequently occurring serious adverse events were neoplasms and cardiac disorders, each experienced by 12 subjects (3%); gastrointestinal disorders (10 subjects, 2%); and vascular disorders (nine subjects, 2%). With the exception of one event of hypertension that the investigator assessed to be related to the injection procedure (the event occurred before an injection, and the investigator considered that the event was due to the subject&#x02019;s emotions in connection with the subsequent injection), none of these events was related to the injection procedure or the study drug. There were six deaths (1%) among the 422 subjects who received pegaptanib sodium in year 3; none of the deaths was considered to be related to study drug or injection procedure by the investigator.

No new safety signals emerged during the third year of therapy with pegaptanib sodium. Subjects&#x02019; compliance with intravitreal injections of pegaptanib sodium during the third year also was consistent with the previous 2 years of the study.</p><p>There was no change in the ocular safety profile of pegaptanib sodium in the third year. In year 3, as in the previous years, adverse events were mainly ocular in nature, mild, transient and related to the injection procedure. The incidence of the most commonly reported ophthalmic adverse events (eg, punctate keratitis, eye pain, vitreous floaters and cataract) decreased during the second<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and third years of the studies. While there was no sham group in the third year of the study, the most common ocular events in years 1 and 2 were reported in a higher proportion of study eyes of sham patients relative to the fellow eyes of each active treatment group, suggesting that many of these events may be related to the preparation procedure for the intravitreous injection rather than to the intravitreous injection itself. There was no case of severe anterior chamber inflammation, which suggests that no significant intraocular activation of the immunological response was triggered. This was consistent with previous studies that employed an aptamer for therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and with those demonstrating an absence of detectable serum antibodies against pegaptanib.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> Although extremely rare cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving pegaptanib (Macugen (package insert). New York: (OSI) Eyetech; 2006), it is not clear if the response is triggered by pegaptanib or some other component of the preparation or procedure. Additionally, there was no evidence of a difference in cataract progression between the third year and previous years. No unexpected changes in the choroidal and retinal vasculatures were seen even after 3 years of selective VEGF inhibition.</p><p>The low rate of serious ocular events continued during study year 3, with the incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment only 0.03% per injection (1/3227), and no iatrogenic traumatic cataracts were reported. The rate of endophthalmitis continued to decline over the course of the studies from 0.16% per injection (12 of 7545 injections) in the first year to 0.10% per injection (4/4091) in the second year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and to 0.06% per injection (2/3227) in the third year (p&#x0003c;0.0001, Cochran&#x02013;Armitage trend test). This decrease in the rate of endophthalmitis may result at least partially from a protocol amendment emphasising the importance of adherence to aseptic technique when performing intravitreal injections. The lower rate of endophthalmitis also may be attributed to the widespread adoption of and increasing familiarity with intravitreous injections by retina specialists over the 3 years of this study.</p><p>There was also no change in the systemic safety profile of pegaptanib sodium. The types and incidence of systemic serious adverse events observed are not unexpected in this elderly patient population, and none of these events was judged to be related to study drug. This favourable systemic safety profile is of particular importance for the NV-AMD population that is at higher risk for cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> In conclusion, 3 years of continuous selective VEGF inhibition with pegaptanib sodium in the treatment of patients with NV-AMD confirmed the favourable safety profile of pegaptanib sodium.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support, including contributing to the development of the manuscript and styling the paper for journal submission, was provided by J Murphy of Zola Associates.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was sponsored by (OSI) Eyetech Inc, New York and Pfizer Inc, New York.
