Similar results were found by Kamal <italic>et al</italic>. in their study.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] They compared oral dexmedetomidine 3 &#x000b5;g/kg with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in 60 children of age group 3&#x02013;10 years. They found the onset of sedation faster in midazolam group (28.4 &#x000b1; 13.7 min vs. 39.5 &#x000b1; 14.3 min) as compared to dexmedetomidine group. Almenrader <italic>et al</italic>. found that oral clonidine was required to be administered 45 min before induction to achieve optimum sedation, whereas satisfactory sedation with midazolam could be achieved in 30 min after ingestion.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Children given midazolam were more sedated and less anxious as compared to those given clonidine and dexmedetomidine at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after administering premedication. Although there was no significant difference between the groups in the number of children who were drowsy or asleep, most of the children (86%) given midazolam were asleep at 60 min after premedication.</p><p>A previous study has shown that oral clonidine requires 105&#x02013;120 min to reach peak sedative effect in children.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Oral dexmedetomidine in adults has been shown to take 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 h to reach peak plasma concentration with a lag time of 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.3 h.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] No such study on oral dexmedetomidine in children has been published. Payne <italic>et al</italic>. observed that the peak serum levels of midazolam were achieved at 60 min following oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg in children.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, patients were shifted to operation theater at 60 min after administering premedication and by this time, peak effect of clonidine and dexmedetomidine had not been reached and that of midazolam had been achieved. This may be the reason why midazolam was noted to be a better sedative.</p><p>In contrast to our study, Almenrader <italic>et al</italic>. found higher sedation scores in children receiving oral clonidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg as compared to those in oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg group. The children in their study were in younger age group of 1&#x02013;6 years as compared to those in our study who were 4&#x02013;12 years old. They also provided favorable quiet environment conducive to sleep to the children in their study.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The lack of a quiet and favorable environment for sleep, difference in age, and culture of the children could be few of the reasons why children in clonidine group in our study achieved lower sedation scores as compared to their study.</p><p>Acceptable parent separation scores of 1 and 2 were achieved in 100% of children in Group D, 90% of children in Group M, and 80% of children in Group C. A number of children with easy separation (score 1) were significantly more (83.3%) in midazolam group as compared to dexmedetomidine group (66.7%) and clonidine group (50%).</p><p>There was no significant difference between the three groups as regards satisfactory mask acceptance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). A number of children with excellent mask acceptance were significantly higher in oral midazolam (66.7%) group than in clonidine (43.3%) and dexmedetomidine (40%) groups. Better behavior of children at separation from parents and better mask acceptance in midazolam group could be because of its more pronounced sedative and anxiolytic effects due to action on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Oral clonidine and oral dexmedetomidine decrease sympathetic outflow and increase parasympathetic outflow from locus coeruleus in central nervous system where they induce electroencephalographic activity similar to natural sleep.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It is due to this that any external stimuli such as taking the patient inside the operation theater and mask application can lead to arousal from sleep in patients administered clonidine and dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Fazi <italic>et al</italic>. also found better anxiolysis on separation from parents and at mask induction in children (4&#x02013;12 years of age) given oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg than those given oral clonidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg, even though they separated children from parents at 75 &#x000b1; 25 min after premedication in clonidine group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Mountain <italic>et al</italic>. found no significant difference between children (age group 1&#x02013;6 years) administered oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg or oral dexmedetomidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg as regards acceptable behavior at separation from parents and satisfactory mask acceptance.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Akin <italic>et al</italic>. also found that a significantly greater proportion of children (82.2%) in nasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) group had satisfactory mask acceptance during induction as compared to those (60%) in nasal dexmedetomidine (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) group. Similar to our study, there was no difference between the groups in achieving acceptable separation from parents.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Yuen <italic>et al</italic>. found nasal dexmedetomidine 1 &#x000b5;g/kg similar to oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg for providing satisfactory separation from parents and satisfactory mask acceptance at induction. However, in their study, children in the dexmedetomidine group were more sedated.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This may be because they used intranasal route of administration of dexmedetomidine, which reaches peak effect faster and has higher bioavailability as compared to oral dexmedetomedine. In healthy adults, Iirola <italic>et al</italic>. showed that peak plasma concentrations of intranasal dexmedetomidine were reached in 38 (15&#x02013;60) min and its median (range) bioavailability was 65% (35&#x02013;93%).[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Yuen <italic>et al</italic>. in another study found median (range) time for the onset of sedation to be 25 (25&#x02013;45) min and duration of action to be 85 (55&#x02013;100) min in children (2&#x02013;9 years of age) given intranasal dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>A meta-analysis by Sun <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that dexmedetomidine premedication is superior to midazolam premedication for producing satisfactory sedation on parent separation and mask acceptance. However, they also suggested that their conclusions should be viewed in the light of heterogeneity caused by differences in various studies as regards the characteristics of the children, age, doses, and routes of the premedicant drugs used, time of separation from parents after premedication, types of surgeries, and scores for evaluation for each outcome.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine and dexmedetomidine caused a significantly greater fall than midazolam in MAP at 45 and 60 min after the administration of premedication. The HR began to fall from baseline at 30 min after premedication in all three groups and reached a lowest value at 60 min. The three groups were comparable as regards fall in HR. Kamal <italic>et al</italic>. found oral dexmedetomidine comparable to oral midazolam for fall in HR and BP. during preoperative period, but intraoperatively and postoperatively the fall was significantly more in dexmedetomidine group than in midazolam group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] No clinically adverse hemodynamic effects and need for any pharmacological intervention were noticed in all the three groups. Clonidine and dexmedetomidine cause a centrally mediated decrease in the sympathetic nervous system outflow and also an increase in vagal activity, which manifests as peripheral vasodilatation and decrease in SBP and HR.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>No significant side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, oxygen desaturation, and apnea were noticed during the study in all the three groups.</p><p>Limitations of our study include (1) intravenous formulations of the drugs were used as oral preparations of the drugs were not available. Mixing of the drug with apple juice could change pH of the drug and its absorption. (2) Children were separated from parents at 60 min after administering premedication by which time peak effect of clonidine may not have reached. However, in a busy operation theater with rapid turnover of patients, it was difficult to wait longer than this.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs may differ in younger and older children. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to find the optimum doses, time for peak effect, and the effects of these drugs in different age groups.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine at present is not approved for use in children in any country. There are number of small studies and case reports in literature showing its use in children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] However, additional large prospective studies in pediatric patients are warranted to further evaluate its safety and efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We conclude that oral dexmedetomidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg is comparable to oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and superior to oral clonidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg for providing acceptable, separation from parents in children. All the three drugs were comparable for providing satisfactory mask acceptance. Oral midazolam was superior to the other two drugs for providing easy separation from parents and excellent mask acceptance in children. Oral midazolam had faster onset of sedation and provided higher sedation scores and lower anxiety scores as compared to the other two groups. All three drugs are safe and effective for premedication in children when given orally.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"
