Priming principle refers to administration of a small dose of non-depolarising blocker which when followed by a large intubating dose after 2-4 min produces a relatively rapid and profound blockade to ensure a suitable condition for endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The theory behind this principle is that a small dose of non-depolarizing agent can block large number of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) before appreciable clinical reduction in neuromuscular transmission. The second larger dose blocks the remaining receptors and effects more rapid onset of intubating conditions. When using the priming principle to accelerate the onset of neuromuscular blockade, the initial dose should not exceed 10% of the drug's ED95.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The priming technique is considered clinically superior to the bolus method and is preferred in all elective cases and in those patients in whom succinylcholine is contraindicated.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The effects of pretreatment of three different non-depolarising muscle relaxants, rocuronium, vecuronium and atracurium on the facilitation of endotracheal intubation with rocuronium are compared as also the haemodynamic changes and adverse effects, if any.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A double-blinded, randomised controlled prospective study was conducted at a tertiary health care hospital between September 2010 and August 2012. After obtaining approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee, 105 patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I and II aged between 20 and 60 years, both sexes, undergoing surgeries under general anaesthesia, were selected. Patients with renal diseases, hepatic diseases, neurological disorders and neuropathies, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory problems with anticipated airway difficulties, any known allergy to study drugs were excluded from the study.</p><p>Based on previous studies,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] it was calculated that a sample size of 28 patients would be required per group to demonstrate a clinically significant difference among the groups for improving intubating conditions, at &#x003b1; = 0.05 with a power (1-&#x003b2;) of 80%. In order to improve the weight of the results, of the study, 35 patients were enrolled for each group. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups by computer generated randomisation chart to receive the drugs during the study as follows: Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 35) - rocuronium (0.06 mg/kg body weight), Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 35) - vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg body weight) and Group C (<italic>n</italic> = 35) - atracurium (0.05 mg/kg body weight).</p><p>On arrival at the operation theatre, the patients were connected to the monitors for measuring the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and the baseline values of these variables were recorded. For neuromuscular monitoring, a peripheral nerve stimulator (Train of Four watch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-Organon Infar, Netherland) was used.</p><p>Then, a priming dose of the test drug (10% of the ED95), which was prepared and loaded in a syringe by an assistant not involved in the assessment, was administered. This was followed by preoxygenation with 100% oxygen over 2 min and the anaesthesia was induced with injection thiopentone sodium until the loss of eye lash reflex. 90% (0.54 mg/kg body weight) of the calculated intubating dose (0.6 mg/kg body weight) of rocuronium was administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The ulnar nerve was stimulated percutaneously at the wrist joint immediately after administering the intubating bolus dose. The electromagnetic response of single twitch contractions (0.1 Hz) of adductor pollicis muscle obtained by stimulation of ulnar nerve with supra maximal stimulus of 0.2 ms duration was recorded.</p><p>Oxygenation was continued and endotracheal intubation was attempted at 60s from the end of rocuronium injection. The single twitch height was first recorded immediately after the administration of the intubating dose of rocuronium and at the end of 60s; another single twitch response was recorded. The intubating condition was assessed by the scale of Cooper <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] consisting of a total score of 9 in relation to jaw relaxation, condition of the vocal cords and response to intubation, which are graded as excellent (if score is 8-9), good (if score is 6-7), fair (if score is 3-5) and poor (if score is 0-2]). After successful intubation, a uniform anaesthetic technique was followed in all the patients. Vital haemodynamic parameters were recorded at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 min following intubation. &#x02018;0&#x02019; minute was defined as the point of time where the remaining 90% of the intubating dose of rocuronium was administered following the priming dose. Patients were extubated after the return of airway protective reflexes and monitored in post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) before transfer to the PACU.</p><p>The parameters and patient data were recorded and entered in Microsoft Excel sheet (Microsoft Office 2007 Professional) and compared among the three groups using ANOVA test for categorical variable, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables, and <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was deemed significant. Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 16.0 software, Chicago, SPSS Inc. was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The age, weight, and sex distribution of the three groups were uniform and comparable [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Several workers[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] used small doses of vecuronium (0.015 mg/kg) and proved that administration of vecuronium in divided doses gave satisfactory intubating conditions in majority of patients. Recently Rao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] proved that priming with rocuronium provides excellent intubating conditions in &#x0003c;60s with no adverse effects. The synergistic effect of rocuronium when combined with itself or with various other non-depolarizing muscle relaxants have been observed in priming studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a retrospective study by Patanwala <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] first attempt successful intubation with rocuronium (72.6%) and succinylcholine (72.9%) were similar. In this study, surprisingly, 100% first attempt successful intubations were seen 60s after administering the bolus dose. The least possible dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was used as bolus for intubation as against higher doses used by some studies and excellent intubating conditions were achieved. Kopman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] were of the opinion that, when using the priming principle to accelerate the onset of neuromuscular blockade, the initial dose shouldn&#x02019;t exceed 10% of the drug's ED95. Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Van Aken <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Taboada <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] respectively used 0.015 mg/kg vecuronium, 0.015 mg/kg vecuronium, (0.01 mg/kg) vecuronium and 0.05 mg/kg atracurium as priming doses. Accordingly, the priming dose used in this study was guided by the above mentioned studies. Though the onset time was not studied, the priming interval of 3 min was adopted as done by Yavascaoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and endotracheal intubation performed 60s after the bolus dose. This is a shorter priming interval when compared with that of Tripathi and Pandey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who advocated a priming interval of not &#x0003c;5 min. Takaya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used a 4-6 min. priming interval and Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] accomplished intubation 90 s after the intubating dose.</p><p>Several workers[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] explained the entropy suppression and haemodynamic stability respectively provided by rocuronium at optimum doses and was hailed as the drug of choice with optimum dose and a preferable drug for intubation for avoiding the side effects of succinylcholine. Wierda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed limited increase in HR without change in MAP and attributed this effect to the weak vagolytic activity of rocuronium. In the present study, there was statistically insignificant change in MAP in the three groups at all-time intervals. However, statistically significant but clinically insignificant increase in MAP at 0 and 1 min was observed. This increase in MAP at 0 min could be due to the haemodynamic responses induced by rocuronium injection pain,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the increase at 1 min could be due to the sympathetic stimulation produced due to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Simultaneously, there were no statistically significant differences in the HR, even though it increased from the baseline value in all the groups till the 3<sup>rd</sup> min. This rise in HR following intubation as found in all the groups may be the result of the usual responses to laryngoscopy and intubation. Even though the study of haemodynamic changes was not the primary aim, it was studied as a secondary outcome of the study, and we observed an increase in haemodynamic parameters at various time intervals in all the three study groups after the bolus dose of rocuronium. These findings are in concurrence with the study of Verma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>No significant differences were observed between the quantitative values of each component of intubating score in the present study. All the patients could be intubated at 1 min after the bolus dose of rocuronium was given. This is in agreement with the study by Cooper <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who explained the rapid onset of neuromuscular block to be due to the low potency of rocuronium, which results in a high molecular load being present at the NMJ, producing an initial high concentration gradient and transfer of molecules of the drug to the biophase. Similar findings were observed by different workers[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and this could be because of the fact that when rocuronium is combined in equipotent doses with other non-depolarizing agent, it acts synergistically in the early part of blockade.</p><p>Though statistically insignificant, establishment of excellent intubating conditions in 97.14% of patients in atracurium primed group as against 88.57% vecuronium and 85.71% rocuronium primed group may suggest a greater synergism between two drugs belonging to structurally different groups-atracurium being a non-steroidal benzylisoquinolone compound and rocuronium a mono quaternary steroid.</p><p>Though single twitch response was recorded just before intubation, it was not used as the guiding parameter. The baseline twitch height was 98.74% (recorded after administering bolus dose) and 34.80% just before intubation. Intergroup comparison showed significant difference only between the single twitch response recorded in vecuronium and atracurium groups just before intubation. However, when the intubating grades were compared, more number of patients in the atracurium primed group had excellent intubating conditions. Withdrawal response was seen in 3, 2 and 1 patient in rocuronium, vecuronium and atracurium groups respectively. This could be attributed to the pain on rocuronium injection. A study by Borgeat and Kwiatkowski[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] has shown that injection of rocuronium is associated with severe, burning pain of short duration responsible for spontaneous movements in the arm observed after induction of anaesthesia. However, intubating conditions were excellent in all these patients.</p><p>Priming technique alleviated the withdrawal responses associated with intravenous administration of rocuronium as only 6 patients (0.05%) showed withdrawal response to rocuronium injection. This is in agreement with the study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who found similar results. No symptoms of muscle weakness were observed which may be compared with the findings of Abdulatif <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There were a few limitations in this study which included the following: The priming effect of the various agents could have been assessed at a shorter point of time than the predetermined time of 60s. The pharmacokinetics of the agents along with the economical aspect of the study could have been assessed. The confounding effects of rocuronium injection and laryngoscopy and intubation on haemodynamic responses could have been further addressed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There is a strong possibility that endotracheal intubation could have been successfully performed earlier than 60s as it is possible to do so when the intubating conditions were only &#x02018;good&#x02019;, a presumptive event which might have happened before the establishment of excellent conditions in almost 90% of cases at 60s. However, we were guided by the recommendation that intubation should be performed at 60s with rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). Though the study did not prove a significant difference in intubating conditions among the three groups, it explains the efficacy of using priming principle for attaining excellent intubating conditions proved by numerous studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name><name><surname>Nath</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhattacharya</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of priming on intubating conditions produced by atracurium</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2003</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>458</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kopman</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuman</surname><given-names>GG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Precurarization and priming: A theoretical analysis of safety and timing</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2001</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>1253</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11682407</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bissinger</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Rex</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lenz</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intubation conditions following administration of atracurium and vecuronium.
