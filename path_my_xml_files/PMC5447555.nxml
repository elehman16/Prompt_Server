In both studies, natalizumab reduced the frequency of relapses, mitigated the development of new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and delayed the time to confirmed disability worsening relative to placebo. Recently, the results of a phase 2 study of natalizumab in Japanese patients with RRMS were reported, and treatment-related changes in relapses, brain lesions, and disability worsening were comparable to those from the phase 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">It has been demonstrated that the endpoint of &#x0201c;no evidence of disease activity&#x0201d; (NEDA) over 2&#x000a0;years, a composite measure of disease activity, including relapses, sustained Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score progression, and MRI activity, may predict long-term disability progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a phase 3 study of natalizumab in non-Asian patients with RRMS, 37% of natalizumab-treated patients showed freedom from disease activity (i.e., no radiological or clinical disease activity) compared with 7% of placebo-treated patients (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, since it was unknown whether similar effects would be seen in Japanese patients, we conducted this subanalysis of the phase 2 trial in Japanese patients with RRMS to evaluate the effects of natalizumab versus placebo on the proportion of patients achieving relapse-free, T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion-free, and new/newly enlarged T2 lesion-free status, defined as NEDA-like status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">Japanese patients (aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years) were eligible for the two-part phase 2 trial, if they had a diagnosis of RRMS (revised McDonald criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], &#x02265;1 exacerbation within the previous year, and, for inclusion in part B of the trial, an EDSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] score of 0.0&#x02013;5.5.

A post hoc analysis of data from AFFIRM (a 2-year, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of RRMS patients [<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;942]) was the first to include an assessment of individual outcomes as a composite measure: &#x0201c;freedom from disease activity&#x0201d;, defined as no relapses, no 12-week-confirmed disability worsening, no Gd+ lesions, and no new/newly enlarged T2-hyperintense lesions. In this trial, a larger proportion of natalizumab patients (37%) than placebo patients (7%) showed freedom from disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Similar composite endpoints have been evaluated in more recent MS clinical trials, though the terminology NEDA is becoming more frequently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Although the components and definitions of NEDA vary across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the proportion of natalizumab-treated patients who were free of relapses, T1 Gd+ lesions, and new/newly enlarged T2 lesions in the current analysis (77%) was comparable to that in previous reports of natalizumab treatment in Italian RRMS patients and in European, North American, Australian, and New Zealand patients with relapsing MS from the AFFIRM trial (37&#x02013;87%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The current study differs from the AFFIRM trial in that the proportion of patients free from new/newly enlarged T2 lesions in this study was not significantly larger with natalizumab than placebo. In addition, a similar result was observed in changes of mean EDSS score, referentially collected, in both groups (baseline score: placebo 2.05 vs. natalizumab 2.45; and score at 24 weeks: placebo 2.16 vs. natalizumab 2.25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These may be due, at least in part, to the shorter duration of this study (24&#x000a0;weeks) compared with AFFIRM (2&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Aside from studies of natalizumab, other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) studies from around the world have assessed the proportions of patients achieving freedom from disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The number of patients evaluated was relatively small, and the 24-week study period was relatively short. Evidence suggests that EDSS worsening confirmed at &#x02265;24&#x000a0;weeks is a meaningful intermediate clinical outcome measure that predicts clinically significant disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; however, confirmed EDSS worsening, which is often a component of NEDA, was not incorporated into the composite endpoint in this analysis due to the short study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">In conclusion, this subanalysis of data from the Japanese phase 2 study of natalizumab in RRMS patients demonstrates that a significantly larger percentage of natalizumab patients than placebo patients were free of relapses, T1 Gd+ lesions, and new/newly enlarged T2 lesions. These results are consistent with findings from non-Asian patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and support the efficacy of natalizumab in Japanese patients with RRMS.
