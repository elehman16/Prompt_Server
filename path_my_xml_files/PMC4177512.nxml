Patients in RCT1 received intravenous placebo, 30-mg tabalumab or 80-mg tabalumab every 3&#x000a0;weeks, and patients in RCT2 received subcutaneous placebo or 1-, 3-, 10-, 30-, 60- or 120-mg tabalumab every 4&#x000a0;weeks (Q4W). Regardless of prior treatment, all patients in this study received subcutaneous 60-mg tabalumab Q4W for the first 3&#x000a0;months, then a one-time increase to 120-mg tabalumab Q4W (60-mg/120-mg group) and a one-time decrease to 60-mg tabalumab Q4W per patient was allowed (60-mg/120-mg/60-mg group).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 182 patients enrolled: 60&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60), 60/120&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;121) and 60/120/60&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). Pretabalumab baseline disease activity was generally higher in the 60-mg/120-mg group. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events, as well as infections and injection-site reactions, in the 60-mg/120-mg group. One death unrelated to the study drug occurred (60-mg/120-mg group). In both groups, total B-cell counts decreased by approximately 40% from the baseline level in the RCT originating study.

Blood samples were collected for determination of serum tabalumab concentrations and measures of biologic activity. Serum samples were taken after dose adjustments (increase to 120&#x000a0;mg or decrease to 60&#x000a0;mg). Measures of biologic activity included changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), total B cells (CD20&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD3&#x02212;), B-cell subsets (immature (CD19&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD27&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;IgD&#x02212;), mature na&#x000ef;ve (CD19&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD27&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;IgD+), switched memory (CD19&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD27&#x02009;+&#x02009;IgD&#x02212;) and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA). Infection rates and any association between infections and changes in B cells or immunoglobulins were also assessed.</p><p>Long-term efficacy was assessed at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks according to the proportion of patients with an American College of Rheumatology criteria improvement &#x02265;20% (ACR20), &#x02265;50% (ACR50) or &#x02265;70% (ACR70), as well as on the basis of the ACR-N Index. Additional efficacy measures included the Health Assessment Questionnaire&#x02013;Disability Index (HAQ-DI), the European League against Rheumatism Responder Index in 28 joints (EULAR28) and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)&#x02013;CRP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Safety analyses included all patients who received study drug. All efficacy and biologic activity analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis and included patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline value. For ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 analyses, patients who discontinued the study drug prior to week 52 were imputed as nonresponders (NRI; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34); otherwise, the last observed components of the index were utilized for each patient&#x02019;s response (last observation carried forward (LOCF)). For HAQ-DI, EULAR28 and DAS28-CRP, the LOCF approach was used. Pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated, and a 90% prediction interval was created using the final model derived from RCT1 and RCT2 data. Graphical analysis was used for comparison of the model predictions with the observed OLE study data. Four patients in the 60-mg/120-mg group had no baseline B-cell data, and one patient in the 60-mg group had no postbaseline B-cell data. These patients were not included in B-cell analyses. One patient in the 60-mg/120-mg group was not included in absolute B-cell analyses because of an erroneous lab result that was not consistent with the patient&#x02019;s absolute lymphocyte or absolute CD19 B-cell count. Two patients were excluded from efficacy analyses: one patient (60&#x000a0;mg) had no postbaseline efficacy data and was lost to follow-up, and one patient (60&#x000a0;mg/120&#x000a0;mg) was removed because of good clinical practice violations.</p><p>The expected maximum sample size was 249 patients. This sample size was not based on statistical considerations; it was expected that between 5% and 25% of patients from the originating studies would not elect to participate in the OLE study. Assuming 200 participants, the probability of observing at least one adverse event (AE) of a specific type is 0.866 when the background AE rate for the event is 1% in a similar cohort of patients during the time frame of this study.</p><p>Baseline data for demographics, clinical characteristics, biologic activity and efficacy measures were summarized from data collected before patients received the active drug in RCT1, RCT2 or the OLE study (that is, pretabalumab baseline). For patients assigned to receive tabalumab in RCT1 or RCT2, pretabalumab baseline data were collected at week 0 of the originating study. For patients assigned to receive placebo in RCT1 or RCT2, pretabalumab baseline data were collected either before receiving an optional 80-mg tabalumab rescue dose at week 16 in RCT1 or at OLE study entry. Data were descriptively summarized by treatment for all safety assessments at the endpoint and for biologic activity measures and efficacy measures at each visit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>Of the 186 eligible patients who completed RCT1 or RCT2, 98% (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;182) were enrolled in the OLE study.

In the 60-mg/120-mg group, differences on the ACR-N from week 24 to week 52 that may be attributed to dose adjustment were noted, as the dose for the majority of these patients was increased from 60-mg to 120-mg tabalumab at week 12. In general, the dose given to patients with higher disease activity levels at pretabalumab baseline was escalated from 60 to 120&#x000a0;mg relative to patients whose dose was never escalated.</p><p>Interpretation of the efficacy and safety of tabalumab based on this study is limited by the absence of a control group, by small sample sizes (especially during B-cell follow-up) and by the heterogeneous population (TNF-IR and MTX-IR) who were on background methotrexate as well as other background medications in some instances. Additionally, the extent of tabalumab exposure varied, as patients were enrolled from two different RCTs involving a range of doses, dosing regimens and administration routes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite prior treatment differences, efficacy responses were observed in both groups with up to 52&#x000a0;weeks of open-label tabalumab treatment. Although a higher frequency of SAEs and severe TEAEs were observed in the 60-mg/120-mg group, no unexpected safety signals were observed and the frequencies of these events were within ranges reported for other biologics used to treat RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The reductions in total B cells were consistent with those observed in prior tabalumab studies. After this study was completed, phase III clinical trials were undertaken using tabalumab in RA patients. These trials were discontinued after interim analyses produced results that did not meet efficacy expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. No safety concerns were noted.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2014_415_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
