The mechanism leading to these complications is not clear. We investigated whether an opioid effect on the vestibular system resulting in corrupt head motion sensation is causative and, consequently, whether head-rest prevents nausea.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six healthy men (26.6&#x000b1;4.3 years) received an opioid remifentanil infusion (45 min, 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg/min). Outcome measures were the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain determined by video-head-impulse-testing, and nausea. The first experiment (n = 10) assessed outcome measures at rest and after a series of five 1-Hz forward and backward head-trunk movements during one-time remifentanil administration. The second experiment (n = 10) determined outcome measures on two days in a controlled crossover design: (1) without movement and (2) with a series of five 1-Hz forward and backward head-trunk bends 30 min after remifentanil start. Nausea was psychophysically quantified (scale from 0 to 10). The third controlled crossover experiment (n = 16) assessed nausea (1) without movement and (2) with head movement; isolated head movements consisting of the three axes of rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) were imposed 20 times at a frequency of 1 Hz in a random, unpredictable order of each of the three axes. All movements were applied manually, passively with amplitudes of about &#x000b1; 45 degrees.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>The VOR gain decreased during remifentanil administration (p&#x0003c;0.001), averaging 0.92&#x000b1;0.05 (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation) before, 0.60&#x000b1;0.12 with, and 0.91&#x000b1;0.05 after infusion. The average half-life of VOR recovery was 5.3&#x000b1;2.4 min. 32/36 subjects had no nausea at rest (nausea scale 0.00/0.00 median/interquartile range). Head-trunk and isolated head movement triggered nausea in 64% (p&#x0003c;0.01) with no difference between head-trunk and isolated head movements (nausea scale 4.00/7.25 and 1.00/4.5, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Remifentanil reversibly decreases VOR gain at a half-life reflecting the drug&#x02019;s pharmacokinetics. We suggest that the decrease in VOR gain leads to a perceptual mismatch of multisensory input with the applied head movement, which results in nausea, and that, consequently, vigorous head movements should be avoided to prevent opioid-induced nausea.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The German Federal Ministry of Education (Grant 01 EO 0901) and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Munich funded this study.

They are components of the number one oral prescription drugs in the US [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and are applied several million times a year during general anaesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Opioid use can be complicated by the common adverse reactions of nausea and vomiting [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], occurring in a third of all patients treated with morphine equivalents [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)&#x02013;with opioids as a key causative factor [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]&#x02013;is approximately 20&#x02013;30% in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reaches up to 80% in PONV high-risk patients [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting is a significant threat: Patients rank it the most distressing non-life-threatening side effect [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and consider vomiting the most undesirable complication after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They are willing to spend their own money [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and even accept pain [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in order to avoid it. Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting is a significant factor in complications such as pulmonary aspiration, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Its treatment costs several million dollar a year [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], frequently delaying discharge and leading to unexpected hospital admissions after ambulatory surgery [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>How opioids cause nausea and vomiting is still under debate [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been suggested that they have a direct effect on the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema or on the vomiting centre in the brainstem [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, opioid-induced nausea seems to be triggered by head motion and avoided by rest [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is why the vestibular system, which senses head motion, was thought to contribute [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Subjects gave their written informed consent and were free to withdraw from the experiment at any time. They were financially compensated for taking part in the study. Subjects had no history of balance disorders and were not taking any medication (explicitly no opioids). They experienced no nausea or vomiting when being bent forward and backward passively five times at a frequency of 1 Hz (about &#x000b1; 45 degrees, head-trunk movements) or after 20 head-bends for each of the three axes of rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) with a frequency of 1 Hz (about &#x000b1; 45 degrees, isolated head movement) at inclusion to the study (without any drug administration).</p><p>The simplified risk score for predicting PONV [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], chosen because of its ubiquitous use in anaesthesiology, was 28&#x000b1;9%, 35&#x000b1;8% and 38&#x000b1;8% (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation) in the subjects of experiments 1 (n = 10), 2 (n = 10) and 3 (n = 16), respectively. According to this score, 35% of all subjects (13/36), on average, were expected to experience PONV. Motion sickness susceptibility (assessed by the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire, MSSQ-Short [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) was 4.8&#x000b1;5.0, 7.9&#x000b1;6.1 and 4.2&#x000b1;5.3 respectively. The MSSQ was used in addition to the PONV score to make sure that groups had comparable motion sickness susceptibility in addition to having comparable PONV risk.

During head impulse testing, eye movements were measured by video-oculography, head movements by integrated 6-degree-of-freedom inertial sensors (EyeSeeCam [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Eye and head movement data were sampled at a rate of 220 Hz.

To verify that head motion alone, sensed by the vestibular system, leads to nausea during opioid-use, experiment 3 was designed as a cross-over design with the paradigm &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d; being compared to a paradigm &#x0201c;head move&#x0201d; consisting of head movement alone (trunk stationary).

The half-life time of VOR gain recovery after stopping remifentanil infusion (5.3&#x000b1;2.4 min, mean&#x000b1;standard deviation) reflects the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nausea during remifentanil administration was triggered by head movement in the majority of subjects. Four of the thirty-six subjects also experienced mild to moderate nausea at rest.</p><p>The remifentanil effect on the vestibular system agrees with previous observations that noted a decrease in caloric response with morphine [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a diminished active VOR with pethidine and fentanyl administration [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and of passive VOR and dynamic vision with remifentanil [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and vestibular dysfunction with heroin abuse [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Opioid effects on receptors in the VOR-three-neuron arc [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135263.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and in the cerebellum [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] could mediate the changes in vestibular-ocular motor function (VOR gain). The additional oculomotor findings, such as gaze-evoked nystagmus, saccadic smooth pursuit and, in particular, downbeat-nystagmus, point to an involvement of the cerebellum [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>When the VOR gain was decreased, head motion (either as part of head-trunk motion or isolated) triggered nausea and vomiting. The incidence of nausea at rest during remifentanil infusion (4/36 or 11%), however, was significantly lower than that expected from the Apfel score ([<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 35% or 13/36). This is in line with observations that motion worsens the incidence and severity of PONV [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and indicates that, in addition to possible direct opioid effects on the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema or the vomiting centre in the brainstem [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which lead to nausea at rest, there is a head-movement triggered pathomechanism. With a motion-induced nausea incidence of 23/36 or 64%, which is significantly higher than the incidence expected from the Apfel score ([<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 13/36 or 35%), the present study overestimates the motion-induced mechanism, possibly because the stimuli were more vigorous than the ones patients commonly experience perioperatively. Importantly, whereas all our subjects who experienced nausea with movement rated it the worst side effect, which corresponds to patients ranking nausea the most distressing non-life-threatening side effect [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and consider vomiting the most undesirable complication after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], this was not the case for nausea at rest.</p><p>The discordance between movement information from different sensors (e.g., visual, proprioceptive, vestibular) or between expected and real sensory information is thought to cause nausea and vomiting of motion sickness [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, movement-induced nausea during opioid administration could be due to a mismatch either within opioid-corrupted vestibular input or between vestibular input and that of other sensors (e.g. vision, proprioception). This would become apparent during movement generating vestibular input, i.e., head movement. As in motion sickness, nausea and vomiting would then result from mismatched input to the vomiting centre in the lateral reticular formation in the medulla oblongata and the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema. Perception has been shown to correlate with VOR function [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As this study demonstrates a corrupted VOR response with opioid administration, nausea could result from the corrupted perceptual response.</p><p>In our experiments, remifentanil itself was emetogenic only in some subjects at rest, while being so in a majority of subjects during movements. Further, the head motion itself induced nausea in none of our subjects before remifentanil decreased VOR gains, whereas it induced nausea in a majority of subjects after remifentanil decreased VOR gains. These findings clearly indicated that remifentanil induced vestibular dysfunction, evaluated as decreases in VOR gains, and that vigorous head motions manifested opioid-induced motion sickness though such vestibular dysfunction, thereby exacerbating remifentanil-induced nausea. Although we could not find any significant correlation between VOR gain drops and nausea scores, this may simply reflect the possibility that the mismatch that triggered nausea can be independent of the amount of gain change&#x02014;similarly to motion sickness where symptom strength poorly correlates with that of the provoking stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Due to practicability in the operation room, the head was moved differently in experiment 3 as opposed to the head-trunk movements in experiment 2. This could explain the (non-significant but due to the small numbers maybe critical) trend that a larger proportion of subjects did not suffer from nausea at all when the head only was moved. However, importantly, experiment 3 was designed to analyse whether head motion alone leads to nausea during opioid-use, which it does. So, even assuming that there was a difference in nausea ratings between experiments 2 and 3 and that this was owing to the fact that the head was moved differently, the conclusion that head movement alone can greatly exacerbate nausea during opioid use would still be valid.</p><p>The relative contribution of the movement-triggered pathomechanism and other direct opioid effects is unknown from our study. The motion sickness part of the pathomechanism is in line with several observations about PONV:</p><p>It is well known that once motion sickness is elicited, it outlasts the precipitating stimuli for hours or up to the entire day [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, the decomposition of opioids and VOR recovery do not necessarily terminate nausea in afflicted subjects. This could explain why ultra short-acting opioid remifentanil has been found to have a PONV incidence similar to that of longer acting fentanyl during the first postoperative 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Only a few risk factors are independent predictors for PONV: a history of motion sickness or PONV, female sex, non-smoking, and the use of postoperative opioids [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These risk factors are in line with our suggestion that head motion during transient impairment of vestibular function plays a role in opioid-induced nausea: if opioid-induced nausea and motion sickness have a common pathomechanism, it is evident why motion sickness susceptibility also predisposes to opioid-induced nausea and vomiting [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and why women, who are significantly more susceptible to motion sickness [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135263.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also have a higher PONV risk [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, both motion sickness and opioid-induced nausea also are more common in the 6&#x02013;10 year age group [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135263.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and decrease with age [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135263.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Tolerance to motion sickness is increased by short-term nicotine withdrawal [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]&#x02013;as is routinely practiced perioperatively. We suggest that as non-smokers cannot benefit from this effect they have a higher PONV risk [<xref rid="pone.0135263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Opioid effects such as cognitive slowing and sleepiness are not mediated by the vestibular system. They can, however, also lead to a feeling of light-headedness at rest, but not to nausea or vomiting. In our study, all subjects (experiment 2) who experienced relevant nausea rated it the most unpleasant remifentanil effect. When no relevant nausea was present, the most unpleasant side effects varied, even between the paradigms (&#x0201c;head-trunk/head move&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d;) in the same subject. This, again, underlines the unpleasantness of nausea and vomiting compared to other adverse effects such as cognitive slowing or light-headedness.</p><p>Head-rest as a preventive measure is feasible particularly in the perioperative setting with short opioid treatments during general anaesthesia where vigorous movements applied when patients are transferred out of the sterile area of the operation room, for example, can easily be avoided during the time opioids are effective. Further studies should address which sensory mismatch, e.g. visuo-vestibular or intra-vestibular, is relevant and, consequently whether in addition to head-rest, darkness could help prevent opioid-induced nausea.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that the &#x003bc;-agonist remifentanil affects the vestibular function in its pharmacokinetics-dependent manner and that vigorous head motion can extremely exacerbate nausea during opioid use. We suggest that the decrease in VOR gain causes an inter-sensory mismatch during head movements, which results in nausea and vomiting. This could be termed opioid-induced motion sickness. Consequently, vigorous head movements should be avoided to prevent opioid-induced nausea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Nicholas Sean Todd for help with the figures and Judy Benson for copy-editing the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135263.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
