the body&#x02019;s inflammatory response. Due to contemporary dietary habits and
increased energy expenditure, athletes are susceptible to depletion of magnesium ions.
The aim of our study was to investigate, through assessment of plasma ACTH, serum IL-6,
and salivary/serum cortisol levels, if chronic magnesium supplementation might reduce
damaging stress effects in amateur rugby players.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Rugby players (N=23) were randomly assigned to intervention and control group. Basal
samples were collected before intervention group started a 4-week-long supplementation
with magnesium (500 mg Mg/d). Blood and saliva sampling were done a day before the match
(Day-1), on the morning of competition (Game), and during a six-day-long recovery period
(Day1, Day3 and Day6). ACTH, serum/salivary cortisol, IL-6 and total/differential
leukocytes counts were determined at each time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a statistically significant increase in ACTH concentration in intervention
group compared to control group, while reductions in cortisol concentrations between the
two groups were the greatest at Day-1 (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and at the day of competition
(Game) (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Our results revealed that magnesium completely abolished the
increase in IL-6 level noted in control group on Day1 and Day3 vs. Day-1 (p &#x0003c;
0.01) and also diminished the rise in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in intervention group
vs. control group (p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest the possibly important influence magnesium supplementation might
have on the change of parameters of HPA axis activity and reduction of immune response
activation following strenuous physical exercise such as a rugby game.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="sr"><title>Kratak sadr&#x0017e;aj</title><sec><title>Uvod</title><p>Fizi&#x0010d;ko ve&#x0017e;banje aktivira hipotalamo-hipofizno-nad-bubre&#x0017e;nu (HPA)

balanced diet with proper dietary intake of micronutrients is of particular importance.
Magnesium (Mg) ions have numerous roles in energy metabolism, as a cofactor of more than 300
enzymes, and need to be available in adequate amounts in the body, in order to maintain the
proper performance level of athletes (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Magnesium is a physiological regulator of membrane stability and is involved
in neuromuscular transmission, immune, hormonal and cardiovascular function (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In case of insufficient dietary
intake, athletes are very sensitive to marginal magnesium deficiency during high intensity
exercises, because of the disbalance in magnesium homeostasis caused by increased magnesium
loss through urine and sweat (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A rugby match represents a very intensive form of exercise which, as a form of
physical stressor, can lead to activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
and the sympathetic nervous system, thus inducing changes in the concentration of different
hormones as well as interleukin 6 (IL-6). It is well documented that IL-6, whose synthesis
is a part of normal physiological response to exercise (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), modulates stress response and has the ability to
activate the HPA axis at its various levels: through stimulation of cortisol release from
the adrenal glands, and through its influence on the hypothalamus, stimulating the release
of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, prolonged intensive
exercise can induce the body&#x02019;s specific inflammatory response followed by transitory
leukocytosis and change in the leukocytes differential count (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). One of the earlier studies (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) showed that the
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, which has been presumed to be an excellent marker of the
systemic inflammatory response (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), increases after prolonged intensive exercise.</p><p>Several studies in magnesium depleted animals revealed that magnesium deficiency leads to
increased inflammation (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and
change in the activity of HPA axis. Laarakker et al. (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported significant correlation between several
anxiety-related behavioral parameters and plasma and brain magnesium levels.</p><p>Effects of magnesium supplementation in athletes were usually assessed with respect to
exercise-induced magnesium redistribution and its effect on physical strength performance
(<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A limited number of studies
investigated the influence of magnesium supplementation on hormonal response in trained
athletes, especially its influence on the HPA axis activity parameters (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) as well as on the white blood
cell (WBC) count and leukocytes percentage profile (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but to our knowledge, none of them were done
over a six-day-long period in amateur rugby players.</p><p>Having all the above-mentioned in mind, the aim of our study was to examine whether the
changes of HPA axis activity parameters before a rugby match and during 6 days of the
post-competition period were influenced by a 4-week-long Mg supplementation. Apart from
following the changes in the plasma ACTH levels and salivary/serum cortisol, we also
examined the changes in serum IL-6 level and WBC percentage profile.</p></sec><sec id="j_jomb-2016-0021_s_002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="j_jomb-2016-0021_s_002_s_001"><title>Subjects</title><p>Players of an amateur rugby team (N=23) gave their written consent for participation in

Blood samples were obtained by antecubital venepuncture into two EDTA vacutainer tubes and
one serum vacutainer tube with gel (Vacutainer; Becton, Dickinson and Company, NYSE, USA),
according to standardized protocol. Blood samples collected in one of the EDTA vacutainer
tubes were used for determination of hematological parameters. The other lavender top
(EDTA) tube was put immediately on ice and cooled centrifuge was used for the immediate
separation of plasma from cells. Serum tubes were centrifuged at room temperature (3000
rpm for 15 min). Both plasma and serum were aliquoted and stored in duplicates at
&#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C, for subsequent analyses. Two sponges (BD Visispear, Beaver-Visitec
International, USA) per subject were used for saliva collection. After 60&#x02013;90
seconds of saliva collection, sponges were placed in a conical tube with cap and
centrifuged to extract saliva. Within 2 hours after collection, saliva samples were frozen

analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, USA). According to manufacturer&#x02019;s
instructions, the lower limits of detection of the assays were 11 nmol/L and 0.5 pg/mL for
cortisol and IL-6, respectively. The total imprecision coefficient of variation for
cortisol assay was 6.0% at 664.9 nmol/L while IL-6 assay had total imprecision &#x0003c;
12.0% at concentrations greater than 2 pg/mL. Plasma levels of ACTH were determined with
the ECLIA method on an Elecsys analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with
intra- and inter-assay CV &#x0003c; 2.9% and &#x0003c; 5.4%, respectively, at 1.08 pmol/L.
Salivary cortisol was analyzed on the same instrument with an assay whose limit of
detection was 0.50 nmol/L and intra-assay imprecision for salivary concentrations of 4.68
nmol/L and 19.8 mol/L was 6.1% and 2.8%, respectively. Analyses of total white blood cells

players altered the pattern of change of ACTH and cortisol not only during the recovery
period after a rugby match, but also influencing the levels of these hormones before the
game. Furthermore, significant reduction of IL-6 levels in the supplemented rugby players
and absence of the sharp rise of NE/LY ratio after the rugby match were also noted.</p><p>Cortisol level, together with ACTH level, was reduced after a rugby match in the control
group. These results are in accordance with the studies conducted on rugby players (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and weight lifters (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), where immediately after
strenuous physical activity, levels of these hormones were augmented and within several
hours they were lower than their basal levels. According to the results obtained in our
study, Mg supplementation changed this pattern. The most significant difference was the
absence of anticipatory increase in cortisol level before the rugby match after Mg
supplementation, which was obvious in the control group. These findings point to the
possibility that supplemented players were less susceptible to anxiety-like behavior before
the match.</p><p>There are several lines of evidence that support the role of Mg in the stress response
system and anxiety-like behavior, but the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not
so clear yet. It was shown that Mg ion has N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- antagonistic and
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- agonistic properties (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and, thus, its elevation could contribute to
reducing the level of anxiety. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Mg deficiency
leads to anxiety-related behavior and HPA axis disbalance that could be surmounted by use of
anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Results obtained after Mg supplementation are in accordance with one of the
studies that analyzed the Mg supplementation influence on hormonal and immune response in
trained athletes (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this
study, effects of a 1- month-long exercise program and Mg supplementation (10 mg Mg/kg/day)
on ACTH and cortisol levels in young tae-kwon-do and sedentary subjects were explored and it
was demonstrated that the levels of ACTH and cortisol were significantly increased after
magnesium supplementation in all subjects, both at rest and at exhaustion. Although the
daily dose of the magnesium supplement used in our study was lower, similar to these
findings, our results for ACTH after Mg supplementation revealed the increase in ACTH
concentration compared to its level in the control group, especially during the
post-competition period: Day1 ( + 75%), Day3 (+82%) and Day6 (+46%).</p><p>Magnesium supplementation affected serum cortisol levels most significantly before the
game, thus pointing to magnesium&#x02019;s role in the reduction of stress-anticipating
anxiety. Nevertheless, the effect on the level of salivary cortisol, which could be
considered to represent the free hormone fraction (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), was the most evident at the end of the
post-competition period. It is well known that only 3&#x02013;10% of total circulating
cortisol is in the free unbound state, whereas the majority of the remaining cortisol binds
with high affinity to cortisol binding globulin (CBG), and some 10&#x02013;15% with low
affinity to albumin (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The
levels of CBG may be considerably altered during inflammatory response, since it is
considered to be a &#x02018;negative acute-phase protein&#x02019;. While the level of total
cortisol after the competition stays almost constant in time, the increase of free cortisol
at Day3 and Day6 could be explained through the possible decrease of CBG production, which
altogether could be the cause of high free/total cortisol ratio in the control group during
the post-competition period.</p><p>Response of IL-6 level after a rugby match was significantly affected by one-month-long Mg
supplementation: the rise in IL-6 level after a rugby match that was observed in the control
group was completely absent in the Mg supplemented group. Studies conducted on different
populations showed significant elevation of post-exercise IL-6 levels: both in athletes,
especially after 24 hours after the game played (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), as well in physically active volunteers who
were not accustomed to high-intensity exercise (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our results for rugby players before Mg
supplementation corroborate these findings. One of our previous trials on a male student
population showed that chronic magnesium supplementation caused decrease in serum cortisol
level that was also accompanied by reduction in IL-6 level (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). There is a substantial amount of data pointing
to the role of Mg in cytokine production as a part of HPA axis disturbance and/or immune
response. Mainly, those studies showed that Mg deficiency contributes to the C-reactive
protein rise (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), phagocyte
activation and consequently to higher cytokine production (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Sugimoto et al. (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) showed that MgSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation
increases I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; levels, leading to reduced NF-&#x003ba;B activation and decrease
in IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; cytokine production both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in
vivo</italic>.</p><p>The change in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, which might be a marker of subclinical
inflammation (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), is an
important finding of the present study. The greatest change was noticed 24 hours after the
competition (Day1) following Mg supplementation when the percentage of neutrophils
decreased, while the percentage of lymphocytes increased, compared to the values before Mg
supplementation, leading to a reduction of nearly 36% in the NE/LY ratio. It was suggested
that the rise in total leukocyte count, particularly of neutrophils, is a consequence of the
inflammatory reaction induced by exercise (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and is proportional to the intensity and
duration of physical activity (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Strenuous physical exercise may lead to oxidative stress, which brings damage
to lymphocyte DNA and subsequent reduction in their number and function (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The results of our study are in
compliance with previous findings that intensive physical training can lead to reduction in
basophil count, which can be the consequence of complete basophil degranulation (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Following 4-week-long Mg
administration, no significant change was observed in basophil count before and after the
competition. It is proved that Mg diminishes susceptibility to oxidative stress and is
important in DNA stabilization (<xref rid="j_jomb-2016-0021_ref_034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These results, together with the decrease of IL-6 and percentage of monocytes
and basophils, suggest that prolonged Mg supplementation may possibly act as an
antiinflammatory agent.</p><p>The major limitation of our study is the relatively small number of players who
participated in the investigation and the lack of strict control of dietary intake during
the pretrial period. Despite these limitations, this is the first prospective observational
study that examined the association between the activity of HPA axis parameters and
magnesium supplementation in amateur rugby players. Further larger and more controlled
studies are needed to closely identify the underlying molecular mechanism delineating the
association between magnesium and immune system response in physically active persons.</p></sec><sec id="j_jomb-2016-0021_s_005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The purpose of our study was to explore the impact of four-week-long Mg supplementation in
amateur rugby players on the IL-6 level and HPA axis activity parameters before a rugby
match and during the 6-day-long post-competition period. Our results showed an altered
pattern of change of ACTH and cortisol levels in Mg-supplemented rugby players compared to
the control group. The significant reduction of IL-6 level in supplemented rugby players and
the absence of sharp neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio rise after the rugby match were also
noted. These findings pointed to the significant role that magnesium could have in reducing
immune response activation just after a strenuous physical exercise such as a rugby
game.</p><p>Further investigations are needed to check if the downregulation of HPA axis activity by Mg
in rugby players could leave more space for the display of other hormones, possibly
adrenaline or testosterone, in defining pre- and post-match behavior, thus influencing the
optimal recovery between demanding competitions such as rugby matches.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="j_jomb-2016-0021_ack_001"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported entirely by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Science and
