Also, 4.4 million had impaired fasting glucose.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Inability to control blood sugar may induce serious complications such as heart and kidney diseases, stroke, nervous damages, blindness and poor quality of life.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>However, appropriate level of physical activity can manage Type II diabetes[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and resistance training has been recently documented to be a safe and officious therapeutic mean for the treatment of various chronic diseases for obese individuals during elderly.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Improved glycemic control can note the positive effect of physical activity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) can be applied to measure long-term (120 days) control. Sufficient glucose control is indicated as &#x0003c;7.0% HbA<sub>1c</sub> value.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although, previous studies that assessed resistance exercise with combined resistance and aerobic exercise sessions, showed significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In contrast, Geirsdottir <italic>et al</italic>. did not experience favorable changes in fasting glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> in patients with diabetes Type II.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, there is no consensus on the effect of circuit resistance training (CRT) in females with Type II diabetes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of CRT with moderate intensity and frequency on glycemic control of female with Type II diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted on obese and overweight females with diabetes Type II attended in Ansari Hospital, Roudsar. Informed consent was obtained, and 20 participants were randomly divided into CRT and control groups. First group underwent 1-month dietitian regimen and 2 months CRT for 3 months. Dietary intake was individually prescribed by 3-day recall technique. The Human Studies Review Committee at Islamic Azad University, Rasht (679, 30 April 2014) approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements body composition</title><p>The height, body weight, and waist circumference were measured at the enrollment and during the study. Standard calibrated scale and stadiometer were used to determine weight and height. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by the square of the height (m<sup>2</sup>). Caliper measured subcutaneous fat in three areas (arm, super iliac and thigh). Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint of the lowest rib and the iliac. Hip circumference was taken at the maximum circumference of the hip. Also, waist to hip ratio (WHR) was measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Laboratory tests</title><p>At the beginning and end of the study, the patients&#x02019; blood glycemic tests of the brachial vein were collected after 12 h fasting. Baseline blood glycemic tests including HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting blood glucose (FBS) (mg/dl) were measured. FBS and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were obtained by Pars Azmoon enzyme kits (Iran) and Biosystem auto-analyzer devices (Spanish), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Circuit resistance training protocol</title><p>As the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) adjusted the exercise intensity, an individualized CRT was designed for each participant. After 1-month regimen, the CRT protocol was initiated 3 days/week for 2 months [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The training consisted of 10 min warm up and 10 min cooling. During first 1&#x02013;3 weeks, participants involved in six stations with 40&#x02013;50% 1-RM intensity. Then, for remaining period (4&#x02013;8 weeks), eight stations with the 50&#x02013;65% 1-RM (16, 27) were indicated. 1&#x02013;2 sets and 2&#x02013;3 sets were noted for the first 3 weeks and remaining 5 weeks, respectively. This program included eight different exercises with 8&#x02013;12 repetition in each set and 3 min rest between sets. Exercises included bench press, seated row, lateral pull down, biceps forward, front thigh, back thigh, leg press and rowing [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-6-34-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The normality of the data was indicated by Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test.

In a systematic review by Miller <italic>et al</italic>. which examined the combined effects of diet versus diet and exercise, the majority of studies mentioned no significant difference in body composition when exercise was added to diet restriction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Furthermore, Misra <italic>et al</italic>. assessed effect of 12 weeks progressive resistance-exercise training on body composition in patients with Type II diabetes. Resistance training produced an increase in fat-free mass and diabetic patients needed more resistance training to improve muscle mass as they got older. It seems that resistance training reduces subcutaneous fat and probably it causes increased muscle fiber that might be due to some factors such as frequency, duration and intensity of exercise.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Church <italic>et al</italic>. Showed that the effect of resistance exercise on glycemic control in individuals associated with a 0.57% decline in absolute HbA<sub>1c</sub> as compared with control.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Also, another study assessed resistance training and aerobic training in females aged between 40 and 70 years in two groups. They indicated improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in both groups after 4 months.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Another study showed that 12 weeks progressive moderate-intensity resistance exercise resulted in significant improvements in glycaemia in Indians with Type II diabetes.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This showed that the effectiveness of resistance training on improving HbA<sub>1c</sub> in diabetes patients appeared to differ according to the intensity, frequency, and duration of training. As a result, CRT had a positive effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> in females with diabetics Type II. It seems that plasma membrane GLUT4 was increased in skeletal muscle from individual with Type II diabetes in response to an acute exercise. Also, lower resting plasma membrane GLUT4 content in insulin resistant subjects have been observed in some studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We appreciate patients participating in this study and the staff of Diabetes Unit in Ansari Hospital of Roudsar for their cooperation.
