From this, we can affirm that the patients who were treated with an intramedullary nail or a volar plate presented better quality of life and fewer pain symptoms than did those who were treated with an external fixator, up to the sixth week. However, after the sixth week, the clinical-functional parameters became statistically similar between the three groups.</p><p>The data obtained in this study were also compared with those from studies in the literature.

These authors concluded that these articles presented characteristics that would lead to positive results and that these results may have facilitated publication of these studies. They also suggested that a standardized clinical register covering the entire United States should be created for the results to be followed up and assessed. In our study, we attempted to use minimally invasive methods, cases in which the fractures had the same characteristics and recognized assessment and rehabilitation protocols in order to minimize these sources of bias.</p><p>Although using intramedullary nails to treat these fractures is not common in our setting, it could be seen in the present study that the results obtained were excellent and that the learning curve was short.</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The minimally invasive technique is effective and safe, with clinical and functional improvements at all observation times of the study. The three implants were stable, given that there were no alterations in the radiographic parameters. There were statistically significantly better clinical-functional results (degree of strength, range of motion, DASH and VAS) in group A (plate) and group B (nail), up to the sixth week. However, after the 12th month, there were no statistically significant differences in the clinical-functional parameters analyzed, between the three groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alffram</surname><given-names>P.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>G.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of fractures of the forearm.

My participation as a patient, and/or the person responsible, is voluntary and I am aware that I am receiving the best treatment options for the disease or condition that I have, in its current state. I am aware that this participation is for a period of five years. The treatment offered, i.e. surgical treatment with a volar plate for angular stability, a nonbridging external fixator or an intramedullary locking nail, has the aim of achieving adequate stabilization of the fracture of the distal extremity of the radius. It has been discussed and is appropriate and adequate, such that it provides improvement of the present conditions. These surgical procedures will be carried out in patients with a diagnosis of fracturing of the distal radius, comprising the abovementioned surgical treatment. I am aware that complications relating to the disease may occur, with procedures equivalent to the complexity of the general clinical picture, local state and hospital conditions. The surgery will be accompanied by anesthetic procedures and possible complications such as anaphylaxis, drug interactions, cardiorespiratory arrest and various allergies. There are risks of implant loosening and surgical site infection. Additional procedures with medical indications due to severe risks will be performed as described in the literature, if these are essential for my benefit, for treatment in view of emergency situations that might occur, and no non-routine procedures will be performed. If the use of intensive care units, semi-intensive care unit, blood transfusion or special examinations after the procedure(s) becomes necessary, these will be implemented and subsequently properly notified by the persons responsible for the sector. In the event of complications involving bleeding, blood transfusion may be effected, independent of religious convictions or beliefs. I am aware that routine sanitary measures in blood banks ensure the quality of the blood and blood derivatives from this source, but that there are diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis and Chagas disease, among others, that can be transmitted. The routine procedures comprise blood collection by means of peripheral vein puncture, other examinations (when necessary), dressings and the usual postoperative care. In cases of surgical implants, new surgical procedures such as reoperation or removal of implants unrelated to the procedure will be duly excluded and explained. If damage to health were to occur as a result of this investigation, a new surgical procedure with exchange of the implant(s) will be performed if necessary. Discomfort, pain, loss of strength, diminished range of joint motion, motor incapacity and other risks are inherent to the surgical procedure. Current diseases compatible with the degree of surgical complexity may progress to definitive motor incapacity and death. I will be benefited directly through the opportunity to receive adequate treatment for the disease, in its present state, at the institution that I have voluntarily chosen, from trained and qualified professionals. Regarding alternative procedures that could be advantageous, which I might have chosen, I am rejecting these and placing this treatment as the best option for the present moment of the disease. I have had the opportunity to ask all the questions that I deemed fundamental, important and necessary, and all of these were answered fully and satisfactorily. I am aware of the confidentiality, secrecy and privacy of the study. Nonetheless, at any stage of the treatment, clarifications for possible doubts are assured and I can ask such questions by appointment. I will have the right to be kept up to date with regard to the partial results from the treatment, complications and favorable or unfavorable evolution of the present disease, with support for intercurrences from the Hand Surgery Outpatient Clinic of the Padre Anchieta Teaching Hospital. I have the obligation to declare all previous diseases, diabetes, hypertension, contagious diseases, hematological diseases, allergies, drug use, smoking, medications in use, psychiatric treatment, etc.; and to rigorously follow all the guidance, make return visits to the outpatient clinic, take medications in accordance with prescriptions and follow the rules of the hospital and the ABC School of Medicine. There will not be any financial compensation in relation to my participation in the surgery and in the study. I will have the right to the surgical treatments proposed, anesthesia and medical follow-up, in conformity with the fees paid for these procedures, which are expressed in the contract with the Brazilian National Health System (SUS), to which I have a right. If a health problem is detected prior to the start of the study, I would expect to be referred to SUS for treatment. I believe that I have received sufficient explanations regarding the information that I have received and read, relating to the treatment, risks and benefits to which I have a right, and all the obligations. The purposes of the treatment and the study are clear to me; it is also clear that this form does not encompass all the complications. I am aware of making my choice and decision, and I voluntarily agree to submit myself to the treatment proposed. Likewise, I acknowledge that, regardless of the efforts of the doctor and the team, there is no guarantee or absolute assurance that the results will bring a cure for my disease. The guidance regarding anesthesia, the blood bank, the intensive care unit and other factors remains under the responsibility of each hospital sector, and the surgical team does not hold these responsibilities. I declare for legal purposes that I have obtained information relating to voluntary free and informed consent in a clear, assured and appropriate manner.
