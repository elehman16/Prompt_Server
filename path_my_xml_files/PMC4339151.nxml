muscle activities of the tibialis anterior (TA), the medial gastrocnemius (GCM), and the
peroneus longus (PL) are influenced by isotonic and isokinetic exercise of the ankle
joint. [Subjects] The subjects of this study were healthy adults (n=20), and they were
divided into two groups (isotonic=10, isokinetic=10). [Methods] Isotonic group performed 3
sets of 10 contractions at 50% of MVIC and Isokinetic group performed 3 sets of 60&#x000b0;/sec.
Muscle activity was measured by EMG and balance was measured by one-leg standing test.
[Results] For muscle activity, a main effect of group was found in the non-dominant TA,
and the dominant TA, GCM and PL. For balance, a main effect of time was found in both
groups for the sway area measured support was provided by the non-dominant side.
[Conclusion] In terms of muscle activity, the two groups showed a significant difference,
and the isokinetic group showed higher muscle activities. In terms of balance, there was a
significant difference between the pre-test and the post-test. The results of this study
may help in the selection of exercises for physical therapy, because they show that muscle
activity and balance vary according to the type of exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Isotonic</kwd><kwd>Isokinetic</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ankle joints play an important role in gait. The structure of foot is adapted for
locomotion and the alignment of the foot and ankle plays an important role in standing and
gait<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and supporting weight during
gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proper functioning of the
ankle joint is necessary for daily life, recreation and sports activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is important in ambulation and
functional gait in terms of its mechanical properties<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The strength of the muscles around the ankle is related injuries
from sports activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this strength
is essential for the prevention of falls<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The passive torque gained through the tension of muscular tissue and the stiffness of the
tissues adjacent to joints like ligaments or tendons is required for the development of an
appropriate strategy for the ankle joint. The central nervous system, which controls the
spontaneous physical response to the external events, and stretches and contracts the
muscles, generates the active torque. The active torque that is gained through the central
nervous system is also required for the development of an appropriate strategy for the ankle
joint<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control involves an
adequate stepping strategy and the appropriate use of the muscles attached to the hips and
ankles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The primary functions of the
ankle joints are the provision of balance adjustment in response to postural disturbance,
absorption of shock during gait, and movement of the lower extremity<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The maintenance of balance is a complex prcess, and it is influenced by a range of several
sensorimotor functions, including muscular strength, proprioception, and the visual and
vestibular sensory systems<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The central
nervous system uses ascending motor pathways that receive information from the feet to
control the position of the body and coordinate posture in relation to the surrounding
environment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle joint has the
function of balance control, responding to the ground reaction force, it contracts muscles
such as the gastrocnemius, the soleus and the tibialis anterior<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The plantar flexor and dorsiflexor play a central role in
maintaining balance during single-limb support and bilateral-limb support, and the
gastrocnemius and soleus play a significant role in postural correction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscular strength and muscle activation are required for
balance, to keep the center of gravity within the base of support<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In one study, subjects performed short-term isometric and isotonic exercise, and isometric
exercise increased muscular strength significantly at the low speed of 60&#x000b0;/sec, while
isotonic exercise did the same at the higher speeds of 120&#x000b0;/sec and 180&#x000b0;/sec<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study analyzed how the function
and muscular strength of the lower limbs are influenced by isotonic and isokinetic exercise
in a closed kinetic chain type exercise for 6 weeks, and reported that muscular strength,
muscle power and muscle endurance of the knee joint extensors and flexors did not show any
statistically significant differences<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Also, a study of a muscle strengthening program, including isometric and isotonic
contractions and stretching exercises, performed by elderly women for a period of 12 weeks,
reported that increased muscular strength improved their balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study analyzed the isokinetic torque and the
absolute peak torque of the invertor and evertor muscles of females with functional ankle
instability who performed eccentric contraction and concentric contraction at the respective
speeds of 60&#x000b0;/sec and 120&#x000b0;/sec. Deficits in eccentric invertor strength contributed to
symptoms of functional ankle instability, and it was noted that eccentric contraction
decrease of the invertor had a significant impact on the results<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study analyzed the equilibrium and EMG
(electromyography) activity of a sports player using a single-limb stance on four different
unstable surfaces and reported that the EMG activities of the peroneus longus, extensor
digitorum longus, and tibialis anterior muscle were greater on a small wood board than on to
hemi-cylindrical and large plastic wood boards<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The calf muscle-tendon unit of the ankle plays an important role in basic human movement
activities<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, such as balance control
while standing<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the enhancement of
the effectiveness of walking<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In spite
of the fact that the ankle joint is of such importance, most studies have performed
exercises on the knee joint muscle rather than on the ankle joint and analyzed the variables
of muscular function such as muscle strength and muscle power. Therefore, this study
examined the effects of isotonic and isokinetic exercise performed by the essential muscles
of the ankle joint, which play an important role in balance and gait. The purpose was to
investigate how the muscle activity and balance were affected by isotonic and isokinetic
exercise. In addition, the effects of isotonic and isokinetic exercise on the tibialis
anterior, which is responsible for dorsiflexion, and on the peroneus longus and
gastrocnemius, which are responsible for ankle plantarflexion were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty students (10 men, 10 women; 18 right dominant, 2 left dominant) attending Namseoul
University in Cheonan-si, Republic of Korea, volunteered for this study. They were clearly
informed of the purpose and experimental procedures before providing their written consent.
None of the subjects had impairments of the musculoskeletal or neurological systems, and
none had a history of athletics or had received any training for muscle strengthening within
the past 6 months<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two types of
exercises were performed and 10 subjects each were randomly assigned to the isotonic and
isokinetic exercise groups.</p><p>A body composition analyzer (Inbody720. Biospace O. Ltd, Seoul, Korea) was used to measure
subjects&#x02019; physical characteristics. A Functional Rehab System (PRIMUS RS, BTE Tech.,
Hanover, USA) was used to asses maximal voluntary isometric contraction and to perform
isotonic and isokinetic exercise. A Free EMG system (Free EMG, BTS Inc., Milan, Italy) was
used to measure muscle activity. A computerized balance platform (HUR BT4, BURLABS, Tampere,
Finland) was used to measure balance ability.</p><p>Prior to the commencement of this experiment, the subjects were informed of the contents of
the experiment and were allowed to participate in the experiment only after submitting their
written consent. The subjects were placed in either the isotonic exercise group or the
isokinetic exercise group with 10 individuals in each group. The subjects were ordered to
kick a ball on the ground, and the side they used to kick the ball was considered to be
their dominant side<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Surface electrodes
were then attached to the bilateral tibialis anterior, the peroneus longus and the medial
gastrocnemius of each participant. The subjects were seated on a dynamometer with their hip
joint and knee joints fixed in the mid-positon with a brace belt. The rotation axis of the
equipment was then adjusted to match the line that links the medial malleolus, and the foot
was fixed for the isokinetic exercise<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
No movement was possible, and the exercise was performed on the non-dominant side<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance was measured immediately after
completion of the exercise protocol<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
All exercises and measurements were performed with the subjects barefoot to prevent any
potential confusion being caused by different shoe types or heel heights<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For surface electromyography, electrodes were attached to the muscle at maximum static
contraction to prevent any technical difficulties from influencing the experiment<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The skin was abraded with sandpaper and
shaved, then cleaned with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab, to reduce the electrical impedance
of the skin to less than 5 k&#x003a9;. Active electrodes (Carbon electrode, 3M, USA) were placed
2&#x02005;cm apart, in parallel with the muscle fibers, on the tibialis anterior, the peroneus
longus and the medial gastrocnemius<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
During the electromyography measurements, the electromyography signals were recorded at a
sampling rate of 1 kHz, bandpass-filtered between 20 and 500&#x02005;Hz. The root mean square value
was calculated from the raw EMG data<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The EMG data of balance measures was processed after excluding the first and last 5 seconds.
The subjects performed a series of 5 submaximal contractions as a warm-up to familiarize
themselves with the dynamometer<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. They
rested for 5 minutes after warming up to prevent the fatigue effect<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The highest peak torque of 3 maximum voluntary isometric
contractions (MVICs) was used in this study<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the isotonic group, the level of resistance was set at 50% of MVIC<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise was performed at a self-paced speed for 1
set<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The istonic group performed
dorsiflexion and plantar flexion 10 times for 3 sets and had a 1-minute rest between sets to
prevent fatigue<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the isokinetic
group, the angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec that is generally used for muscle strengthening
exercises for healthy adults and athletes was chosen from among the angular velocities of
60&#x000b0;/sec, 180&#x000b0;/sec and 300&#x000b0;/sec, which are appropriate for isokinetics<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the isotonic group, the ankle was placed in the
neutral position<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, and subjects
performed dorsiflexion and plantarflexion in a non-painful range of motion 10 times for 3
sets, for a total of 30 times<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, and had
a 1-minute rest between sets to prevent fatigue<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Calibration was conducted before starting the measurements<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure balance, the one-leg standing
test with eyes open was performed on a computerized balance platform<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the trials, the subjects had to stand barefoot on
one leg for 30 seconds with their eyes open<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>, while the other leg was held off the surface with a knee flexion
of 30 degrees along the anterior-posterior axis of the foot plate<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, and with both arms in a relaxed state at the sides. For
visual information, the subjects were asked to stand in as stable a position as possible,
watching a point on a monitor that was 65&#x02005;cm in front of them during experimental
testing<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. For visual information
directions, a reverse countdown was started from 4 before beginning the measurements, and
&#x0201c;stop&#x0201d; was said after the measurements had been taken. Calm and stable surroundings were
provided for all procedures<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
measurements were taken twice, and the mean value of the two measurements was
calculated.</p><p>The physical characteristics are reported as mean&#x000b1;SD. The dependent variables were tested
for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and for homogeneity of variance using
Levene&#x02019;s test. MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) was used to examine the
significance of differences in balance and compare EMG and the balance of the tibialis
anterior, the peroneus longus and the medial gastrocnemius between the groups (isotonic and
isokinetic exercise) and time (pre-exercise and post-exercise). Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS for Windows v.18.0. The statistical significance level was chosen as
&#x003b1;=0.05. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Namseoul University
(Cheonan, Korea, NSU-140528-1).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty healthy adults took part in this study, and their physical characteristics are

exercise for the ankle joint, and how the respective exercises influenced muscle activity
and balance was investigated. When muscle activity was compared between pre-test and
post-test by group, both the dominant tibialis anterior and the non-dominant tibialis
anterior presented significant differences when support was provided by the non-dominant
side, and the dominant gastrocnemius muscle and the dominant peroneus longus presented
significant differences when support was provided by the dominant side.</p><p>Razaeimanech and Farsani<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
performance of isotonic exercise for the lower limb for 6 weeks increased EMG and improved
the muscle strength of volleyball players. Onambele et al.<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in both elderly and young adults, EMG of the tibialis
anterior was higher than that of the gastrocnemius when their eyes were closed. They also
reported that the tibialis anterior EMG of the elderly was higher than that of the
gastrocnemius, but the gastrocnemius EMG of the young adults was higher than the tibialis
anterior EMG their eyes were open. In this study, the dominant tibialis anterior showed a
significant increase when support was provided by the non-dominant side, and the dominant
gastrocnemius muscle and dominant peroneus longus showed a significant increase when support
was provided by the dominant side. Thus, our present study&#x02019;s results are similar to those of
previous studies. Kennedy et al.<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>
studied neuromuscular fatigue caused by isometric contraction of the plantar flexor and
dorsiflexor, and reported that central fatigue could be determined by comparing the level of
voluntary activation of the dorsiflexor and plantar flexor between pre-fatigue and
post-fatigue. However, the two muscle groups had different characteristics of fatigue
mechanism and recovery, and because the mechanisms of the two muscle groups were not
similar, they might not be influenced by the same method. They also reported that it took 7
minutes for the plantar flexor to recover from fatigue, while it took only 1 minute for the
dorsiflexor. In addition, the possibility of compensation between muscles was higher in the
plantar flexor than in the dorsiflexor, which is mainly composed of the tibialis anterior,
contrary to that of the plantar flexor, which is composed of synergistic muscle. So we
conjecture the reason why both sides (regardless of dominant or non-dominant side) of the
tibialis anterior had a better recovery speed than the plantar flexor (as indicated by the
significant difference in this study) is due to compensation among muscles. Berger et
al.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the EMG of the
exercised tibialis anterior decreased in their study of the bilateral effects of unilateral
lower limb muscle fatigue on EMG. They reported that the fatigued muscle activity was
related to passive tension increase, and to resist increasing the stretch of the fatigued
muscle, the decrease of the exercised tibialis anterior EMG might restrict tension and
increase the risk of injury to the fatigued triceps surae. Thus, the reason why the
non-dominant tibialis anterior showed a significant difference when support was provided by
the non-dominant side, in this study, can be attributed to the fact that the muscle tension
was influenced by the fatigue of the non-dominant tibialis anterior.</p><p>In this study, the dominant gastrocnemius muscle and the dominant peroneus longus showed
significant differences when support was provided by the dominant side. South and
George<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effect of fatigue
of the peroneus muscle on proprioception and reported that fatigue of the peroneus muscle
did not affect ankle position sense after inducing muscle fatigue using an isokinetic
dynamometer. McLoda et al.<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded
that muscles around the ankle other than the peroneal muscle are able to compensate for
fatigue of the peroneal muscle as they are less fatigued than the peroneal muscle and can
process the sensory information. They also reported that only 5 out of 12 muscles passing
through the ankle, are restricted by the ankle joint. Giulio et al.<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that the tibialis anterior is not always the
best muscle for preventing postural sway, and that the triceps surae is not always an
agonist of ankle muscles. They also suggested that these roles are dynamic and can change
according to the location of the center of gravity relative to the ankle joint. Paillard et
al.<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the impairment of
postural control in the contralateral (non-exercised) lower limb after stimulation and
voluntary contraction of the ipsilateral (exercised) lower limb. They observed a cross-over
fatigue effect after the sensory stimulus, and suggested that voluntary contraction might
impair postural control, since the sway area showed a significant difference after fatigue
of the lower limbs had been induced by voluntary contraction and electrical stimulus. It is
also known that the effect of one leg balance training can be transferred to the untrained
contralateral side by the cross-education effect<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, we consider the dominant gastrocnemius and peroneus
longus showed a significant difference in the current study due to the fact that fatigue
induced by exercise being transferred to the dominant tibialis anterior by the cross-over
fatigue effect, and the non-exercised muscle transmitting the sensory information, because
the location of the center of gravity changed during the one leg stance.</p><p>In this study, the sway area showed a significant difference between pre-test and post-test
by group when support was provided by the non-dominant side. Boyas et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> studied postural control impairment after
muscle fatigue induced by isokinetic exercise of the ankle joint in healthy adults. They
reported that the sway area during the one-leg stance with eyes open was greater when the
plantar flexor and ankle dorsiflexor were exercised simultaneously than when the two muscles
were exercised separately<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yaggie and
McGregor<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study in which
they examined the balance maintenance and postural limits after inducing muscle fatigue by
isokinetic exercise of the ankle joint at 60&#x000b0;/sec in healthy and young adults. They reported
that fatigue of the ankle plantar flexor and ankle dorsiflexor significantly affected the
sway and the range of posture control. Bisson et al.<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the acute effects of fatigue on the plantar flexor and
reported that postural sway increased as fatigue increased, especially during the one-leg
stance. Boyas et al.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> studied postural
changes related to postural control impairment due to fatigue of the plantar flexor during
the one-leg stance and reported that the sway area was greater during the post-fatigue
period than during the pre-fatigue period, showing that fatigue of the plantar flexor is
directly connected to changes in the postural sway. The results of our present study show
that fatigue of the lower limb, induced by isotonic or isokinetic exercise, significantly
affected the mechanism of postural control and the sway area. Hence, we consider the results
of our present study are similar to those of previous studies in that the sway area showed a
significant difference between pre- and post-fatigue.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was conducted to examine how the balance of the lower limbs and
the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior, the medial gastrocnemius and the peroneus
longus are influenced by isotonic and isokinetic exercise of the ankle joint. The subjects
of this study were healthy adults in their 20s, and the following results were obtained. (1)
The changes in muscle activities between pre- and post-test in both the isotonic and
isokinetic exercise groups did not show an the interaction effect between group and time,
and a main effect of time was not shown by either of the groups. A main effect was shown by
in the non-dominant tibialis anterior, the dominant tibialis anterior, the dominant
gastrocnemius muscle and the dominant peroneus longus. (2) The changes in balance between
pre-test and post-test in both exercise groups did not show an the interaction effect
between group and time, and a main effect was not shown by either of the groups. A main
effect of time was shown by both the isotonic and isokinetic exercise groups for the sway
area when support was provided by the non-dominant side. The two exercise groups showed
significant differences in muscle activities, and the group performing isokinetic exercise
showed higher muscle activities. In terms of balance, there was no difference between the
groups, but there was a significant difference between the pre-test and the post-test
results.</p><p>The results of this study may help in the selection of exercises for physical therapy,
because they demonstrate that muscle activity and balance vary according to the type of
exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this paper was provided by Namseoul University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A comparison of muscle activities in the lower extremity
