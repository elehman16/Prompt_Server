exercises applied to spastic shoulder joints on improving shoulder dysfunction in
hemiplegic patients. [Subjects and Methods] Hemiplegic patients were classified into three
groups: one group received 30&#x02005;min of traditional exercise therapy for the spastic shoulder
joint; one group received 30&#x02005;min stretching; and one group received 15&#x02005;min of stretching
and 15&#x02005;min of joint stabilization exercises. The exercises were performed once a day, five
times per week for eight weeks. Changes in the pathologic thickness of tendons and
recovery of shoulder function were compared among the three groups. Differences among the
three groups before the experiment, at four weeks, and at eight weeks were analyzed using
repeated measures ANOVA. [Results] The stretching and joint stabilization exercise therapy
group showed greater improvement in shoulder function than the traditional exercise
therapy group and the stretching only group. This group also showed greater decreases in
the pathologic thickness of tendons, than the other groups. [Conclusion] This study
demonstrated that an exercise therapy program that combined stretching and joint
stabilization exercise was more effective than other exercises for improvement of spastic
shoulder joint dysfunction in hemiplegic patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spasticity shoulder</kwd><kwd>Joint stabilization</kwd><kwd>Stretching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoulder pain in hemiplegic patients has high correlations with spasticity, sensory
changes, and severe subluxation of the shoulder<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spasticity is a general symptom in most poststroke hemiplegic patients. Increased muscle
tone causes shoulder pain caused by traction of the tendon, which is a muscle-adhered region
resulting from the shortening and spasticity of the periarticular soft tissues<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, investigations of the characteristics of the tendon with diagnostic
ultrasonography have generally evaluated subject age and disuse, motor, and mechanical
characteristics of tendons under maximum muscle contraction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies have also
found that the thickness, length, biomechanical characteristics, stiffness, and hysteresis
of the affected tendon were increased compared with those of the unaffected tendon in stroke
patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fixed positions caused by
immobilization of the soft tissues around the muscles and joints can lead to permanent
structural changes, such as decreased range of motion and stiffness<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The findings of previous studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that shoulder dysfunctions in
hemiplegic patients are caused by complex factors, including spasticity, capsulitis, and
tendinitis. These studies also showed that management of spasticity is critical for
improvement of function. Therefore, stretching and joint stabilization exercises are an
important therapeutic approach for improving shoulder function. This study was conducted
with the expectation that this approach would decrease the muscle tone as a result of the
change in length of the spastic muscle, improve the activity of the antagonistic muscle, and
improve the activity of the tendon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All participants provided informed consent prior to participation in this study. The
experimental protocol was approved based on the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects of this study were selected from patients who had been diagnosed with
poststroke hemiplegia and hospitalized in a hospital specializing in rehabilitation.
Forty-five patients who understood the details of this study consented to participate. The
inclusion criteria were as follows: Patients who were six months or more but less than two
years after the onset of stroke, patients in which spasticity of biceps brachii was in
stages 1&#x02013;3 on the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), and patients who had no shoulder pain six
months before onset. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients who had a severe
injury of the rotator cuff, patients who had undergone shoulder surgery after a shoulder
injury, and patients considered unable to participate in this study because of psychiatric
problems.</p><p>This study was conducted by applying eight weeks of exercise therapy to the participants,
who were selected based on the above criteria.</p><p>The medical records and physical function test sheets of all hospitalized patients were
examined to select subjects who satisfied the criteria for this study. The 45 patients that
consented to participate in this study were randomized into three groups. One discharged
patient left the normal development therapy group, two discharged patients left the
stretching exercise therapy group, and one discharged patient left the stretching and joint
stabilization exercise therapy group. Consequently, 41 patients participated throughout this
study, and the data analysis was performed using the data of these 41 patients.</p><p>Every subject received normal development therapy, for improvement of physical functions,
one hour and 30&#x02005;min of exercise therapy three times a week, and one hour of occupational
therapy five times a week, in addition to the 30-min exercise therapy programs used in this
study.</p><p>In the preliminary investigation of these exercise therapy groups, sonography was conducted
to measure the thickness of the biceps brachii tendons of both the affected and unaffected
sides and shoulder functions. The evaluations were performed for all subjects at four weeks
and then at eight weeks when the exercise therapy intervention was completed.</p><p>Normal development therapy, stretching exercise therapy, stretching and joint stabilization
exercise therapy, and evaluations were performed by physical therapists with at least three
years of clinical experience. The authors of this paper directed and supervised the
consistency of the therapy programs and their evaluations.</p><p>Concerning the neurophysiology approach, the normal development therapy program applied in
this study was neurodevelopment treatment according to motor development theory and motor
learning theory<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The stretching program applied here was a revised version of that used in a previous
study<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. First, maximum shoulder
external rotation at 45&#x000b0; abduction was performed in the supine position and gradually
extended as long as there was no pain. Then, stretching was performed at 90&#x000b0; of the shoulder
in a sitting position and gradually extended as long as there was no pain. Finally, the
subjects reached toward the ground with their palms with shoulder and elbow extension in a
sitting position and gradually extended their reach as long as there was no pain.</p><p>Joint stabilization exercise used in a previous study was revised<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> to affect the stability and mobility of the rotator cuff,
scapula, and glenohumeral joint, which are involved in stabilization of the shoulder joint.
Furthermore, an elastic band was used for resistance to prevent pain and fatigue, the
assistance of the therapist was minimized, and a 10-second hold time was used for each
position. For the joint stabilization exercise, the subjects started in a shoulder neutral
position, holding the band, with shoulder abduction of 0&#x02013;60&#x000b0; on the scapular plane and elbow
flexion of 90&#x000b0;. Next, they punched forward from the shoulder neutral position with shoulder
flexion of 0&#x02013;60&#x000b0; on the sagittal plane and elbow flexion of 90&#x000b0;. They then performed
adduction of the scapulas with elbow flexion of 90&#x000b0; and the shoulders in neutral rotation
with their arms by their sides. Finally, they performed shoulder external rotation with
upper limb abduction of 45&#x000b0;, elbow flexion of 90&#x000b0;, internal rotation of 30&#x000b0;, and external
rotation of 30&#x000b0;.</p><p>The thicknesses of the long head tendons of the biceps brachii on the affected and
unaffected sides were measured by one physiatrist using diagnostic ultrasonography equipment
(LOGIQ 400CL, GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA). For sonographic measurement, the
cross-sectional image of the biceps groove was obtained in pronation of the forearm at 0&#x000b0;
with elbow flexion of 90&#x000b0;, and the thicknesses were measured at the origins of the affected
tendons<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the normal tendons, thin
fiber aggregates were arranged in parallel, and cutting or deformation of their shape was
considered an abnormality<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
thickness of the long head tendons of the biceps brachii with scar tissue was 8&#x02005;mm or
greater, which is considered a symptom of tendinitis<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The measurement of functional movement of the shoulder joint used the motor assessment
scale for stroke, which was used in a previous study<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. For single-function measurement of the shoulder joint, measurement
item no. 6 was used. The scores ranged from 0 to 6; the closer to the score was to 6, the
closer the function was to a normal state.</p><p>PASW 18.0 for Windows was used for all statistical analyses performed in this study. The
demographic characteristics of the subjects were analyzed by the independent t-test and
chi-squared test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normality of the
variables. The changes over time were compared among the three groups before the experiment
and at four and eight weeks after the experiment. The differences in the changes among the
three groups before the experiment, at four weeks, and at eight weeks were analyzed through
repeated measures ANOVA. The Bonferroni method was used to determine differences between
prior to the experiment and at four weeks, between four and eight weeks, and between prior
to the experiment and at eight weeks. The differences in changes by period between the
exercise therapy groups were analyzed by ANCOVA, and the preliminary measurements were used
as covariate values. The level of statistical significance was set to p&#x0003c;0.05 for all
data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects and the results of homogeneity testing are

shoulder muscles, and tendon thickness. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that
stretching and joint stabilization exercise therapy could be an important therapeutic
approach for the improvement of shoulder function in hemiplegic patients.</p><p>It was previously reported that the degraded function of the upper limb in hemiplegic
patients had significant correlations with the decrease in proprioceptors, contracture of
muscles, subluxation of the shoulder, increase in shoulder pain, and peripheral tissues
(about 85%) of the shoulder joint that showed lesions under ultrasonography<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many previous studies have evaluated lesions of the shoulder joint in hemiplegic patients
by ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the shoulder joints in poststroke
hemiplegic patients revealed lesions in the peripheral tissues of shoulder joints in 48 of
64 patients (75%). Similar lesions were found in the long head tendon of the biceps brachii
(64.8%) and in the supraspinatus tendon<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. An ultrasonographic evaluation of lesions for 84 hemiplegic patients
showed that 62.2% of the patients had lesions in the affected tendon, and the most frequent
lesions were tendinitis of the long head tendon of the biceps brachii and tendinitis of the
supraspinatus<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, ultrasonographic evaluation of the shoulder joints in poststroke
hemiplegic patients also showed lesions in the long head tendon of the biceps brachii. The
thickness of the affected tendon was 36% greater than that on the unaffected side, which was
caused by the formation of scar tissue. This finding aligns with a previous study showing
that exercises and activities were important for reinforcement of the motility of shoulder
muscles and increase of muscle length<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In another study on spasticity accompanied by shoulder pain, however, application of
exercise consisting of passive joint stretching further increased the contracture of the
shoulder joint and shoulder pain because of the reflective position and protection against
muscle spasm. Accurate application and special care were required in the stretching
exercise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As shown by many previous studies, the spasticity of muscles after hemiplegia changes the
characteristics of muscle fibers, causes dysfunction of joint movement, and aggravates the
actions caused by neurologic injuries<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies on shoulder dysfunction in hemiplegic patients have emphasized the importance of an
exercise program for shoulder stability<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The increase in stability and the
decrease in spasticity of shoulder dysfunction are considered important because of their
effects on stabilization of the shoulder joint. Scapula stabilization of the shoulder joint
and muscle strengthening exercises for the scapulohumeral external rotation muscle over six
weeks in patients improved scapulohumeral rhythm<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study on stretching reported that 30&#x02005;min of static
stretching of immobilized and shortened muscles of mice improved the mobility of
sarcomeres<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Application of 30&#x02005;min of
static stretching per day for four weeks by hemiplegic patients significantly prevented
contracture of joints<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A similar study
claimed that at least 30&#x02005;min of stretching was required to prevent contracture of joints and
muscles in hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although previous studies found differences regarding stretching application time, they
commonly stressed the importance of stretching for the prevention of joint contracture and
the recovery of shoulder joint function in hemiplegic patients. In particular, periarticular
muscle strengthening exercise is needed to improve shoulder joint function in hemiplegic
patients because the humerus head and scapula movements cannot resist gravity, generate
incorrect mechanisms, and cause injuries of the periarticular soft tissue, neurologic pain,
and dysfunction<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study showed that the combined exercise therapy program of stretching
and joint stabilization exercises for spastic shoulder joint dysfunction in poststroke
hemiplegic patients reversed the pathological changes in tendons and improved shoulder
function.</p><p>There are many causes of shoulder dysfunction in poststroke hemiplegic patients and many
therapeutic approaches to them, but stretching and joint stabilization exercises are
indispensable to an exercise therapy program. The results of this study could provide
reference data about exercise therapy intervention. Extending previous studies of other
causes of shoulder dysfunction, future studies will develop the results of this study in a
clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Poulin de Courval</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Barsauskas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Berenbaum</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Painful shoulder in the hemiplegic and unilateral
