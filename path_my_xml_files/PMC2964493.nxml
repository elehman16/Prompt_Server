Five oral formulations (coded A, B, C, D and E), with a common base of <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> and <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> with a maximum of four plant extracts, were evaluated; with placebo and glucosamine as controls. 245 patients suffering from symptomatic OA knees were randomized into seven arms (35 patients per arm) of a double blind, parallel efficacy, multicentric trial of sixteen weeks duration. The groups matched well at baseline. There were no differences for patient withdrawals (17.5%) or adverse events (AE) of mild nature. Intention-to-treat efficacy analysis, demonstrated no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) for pain (weight bearing) and WOMAC questionnaire (knee function); placebo response was high. Based on better pain relief, significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) least analgesic consumption and improved knee status, &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation was selected for further development.

Introduction</title><p>Ayurveda, a holistic ethnic medicinal system [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>],is in practice in India and Sri Lanka since the prebiblical era [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and has contributed to discovery and development of natural product drug [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The traditional system advocates predominantly life style (includes diet) approach to good health and disease prevention. When treating a disease, herbal mineral formulations are added to the latter approach after assessing an individual's constitution traits (called <italic>prakriti </italic>in Ayurveda) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Undoubtedly, the traditional approach is predominantly individual and patient centric conforming to the basic principle of &#x0201c;no two individuals are alike.&#x0201d; Unlike a reductionist approach to strike the bull's eye (modern medicine), Ayurvedic treatment attempts to correct several factors implicated in causing the disease (called <italic>samprapti </italic>in Ayurveda). The system advocates a &#x0201c;soil more important than the seed&#x0201d; approach. Though therapeutic managements may differ, Ayurvedic physicians often use certain treatment modalities (e.g., the well-known detoxification technique called <italic>panchkarma</italic> in Ayurveda) and drugs in a uniform manner to treat different disorders. Chronic arthritis, irrespective of its etiology or clinical profile, is also one such disorder. Therefore, it may be reasonable to evaluate Ayurvedic drugs per se for a more general therapeutic use. But this would entail systematic validation using contemporary scientific methods and evidence [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ayurveda has an elaborate disease classification system. In the case of classification of rheumatic disorders [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we have reported some similarity between modern medicine and Ayurveda. Recently, a concept of &#x0201c;golden triangle&#x0201d; between modern science, modern medicine, and traditional medicine was proposed to promote integrated research and development [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Ayurvedic medicinal plants have demonstrated remarkable biological effects,especially those of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], that are relevant and potentially useful to treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. We have carried out several controlled drug trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety of standardized Ayurvedic drugs containing several plants mentioned in this paper, for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>An Ayurvedic segment of the &#x0201c;New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative&#x0201d; (NMITLI), a multidisciplinary national project, fully sponsored by the Government of India, was launched in 2002. The principal aim was to validate standardized Ayurvedic medicines for global use. Arthritis, diabetes, and hepatitis were selected as the target disorders. Experienced Ayurvedic physicians were involved at every step. The candidate drugs were assessed essentially using the &#x0201c;reverse pharmacology&#x0201d; approach. This approach gets credence from the historical and experiential long-term safe use of Ayurvedic medicines over several hundred years wherein validation of clinical use precedes or goes hand in hand with the pharmacological and other relevant mechanism of action studies. </p><p>We selected OA knees as the target disorder. The arthritis team involved a network of seventeen national research institutions, hospitals with modern medicine, and pharmaceutical industries with a delegation of specific responsibilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To begin with, Ayurveda and related discipline experts interacted in brain storming sessions to determine diagnostic and other critical protocol components (outcome measures and response criteria, in particular) and shortlisted medicinal plants with a potential to treat OA knees. During the selection process, due emphasis was given to the most popular traditional and proprietary formulations, in Ayurvedic clinical practice in India. Though authoritative literature reviews, scientific evidence and expert opinions were given due importance, the team adopted a consensual approach to finalize several key selections and procedures and settle contentious operative issues, if any. Though based on traditional principles of Ayurvedic pharmacology and pharmaceutics, formulations were developed and standardized using modern science methods. Safety data from animal studies was submitted to Institutional Ethics Committee to obtain clearance prior to the clinical drug trials. In a step-wise clinical approach (from exploratory to statistically designed large sample size controlled drug trials), the formulations were systematically evaluated (for efficacy and safety) with a view to identify and validate the best formulation. We present the results of the first of a series of planned drug trial evaluations completed under the auspices of the NMITLI project.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Patients and Methods</title><p>This trial was conducted at the Centre for Rheumatic Diseases (CRD, Pune), Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS, Hyderabad), KEM Hospital and GS Medical College (KEM, Mumbai), and Swami Prakashananda Ayurveda Research Centre (SPARC, Mumbai). The protocol was duly approved by the institutional ethics committees of the respective centers. Prior to signing the informed consent, patients were properly informed and counseled with a detailed multilingual brochure.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double blind, placebo and oral glucosamine controlled, parallel efficacy, multicentre drug trial study of 16 weeks duration using seven intervention treatment arms. The trial was essentially exploratory in nature and not statistically designed for sample size nor powered (for a low Type II error). Patients were examined by modern medicine physicians (in particular rheumatologists) and Ayurvedic physicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Ayurvedic Formulations (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">2</xref>)</title><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.1"><title>2.2.1. Selection</title><p>Classic Ayurvedic text and medicinal plant experimental data that is published was referred by the experts to select the most favored candidate plants and create a medicinal plant inventory. All the selected plants were well known and documented in classic literature [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and described to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulation properties and also to promote positive health. Herbal and mineral formulations possessing such a combination of preventive and therapeutic effects are described as <italic>Rasayana</italic> (immunomodulators and facilitating regeneration) in Ayurveda and have been widely used by Ayurvedic physicians since ancient times to promote health and treat immunoinflammatory and degenerative disorders. Using systems biology approach, the medicinal properties of selected plants were matched with the desired clinical efficacy targets (both from an Ayurvedic and modern medicine view point) in an activity matrix to select the formulations. The targets included analgesia, anti-inflammatory, chondroprotection, soft tissue healing, antiosteoporosis, immunomodulation, antilipogenesis, anabolic effect, and anti-oxidative stress, in order to promote digestion and normal gut function. One of the fundamental objectives of Ayurvedic antiarthritis drugs and regimen is to improve digestion and metabolism [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.2"><title>2.2.2. Test Materials</title><p>All the raw materials were procured from known authorized suppliers who provided passport data in the form of history data sheets. All the botanical drugs including Shunthi (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>), Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>), Amalaki (<italic>Emblica officinale</italic>), Ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>), and Gokshur (<italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic>) were identified and authenticated by Ayurvedic experts and medicine plant botanists. Routine pharmacognosy and chemo profiling with at least one phytochemical marker (on HPLC technique) was also completed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) by National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India. Voucher samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) of all botanical materials were deposited in the official herbarium of Agharkar Research Institute, Pune. Five Ayurvedic formulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), coded as A, B, C, D, and E, were used as investigational drugs. Batch samples of raw material were properly labeled, sealed and stored in SHS, Pune, for any future reference or investigation. After ensuring quality control standards, the raw material was processed for extraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.3"><title>2.2.3. Development, Standardization, and Manufacture</title><p>Based on traditional knowledge and popular use in clinical practice, Shunthi and Guduchi were first selected and optimized to create a platform of base formulation. Synergistic ingredients from the plant inventory were added to create variants (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">2</xref>). Aqueous extracts were prepared using traditional Ayurvedic procedures [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Organic solvents were not used. The precise quantity of each plant extract ingredient in the formulation was guided by the standard Ayurvedic teaching text [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and finally fixed by Ayurvedic experts. </p><p>Overall, the entire process comprised of several predefined milestone deliverables and suitable tests starting from creating passport data of raw material, identifying botanical material (pharmacognosy), to ensuring chemical quality (Spectroscopic and Chromatographic), molecular (DNA Fingerprinting) standardization, stability, and pharmacopoeia standards of finished product. Necessary documentation was maintained for review, records, and regulatory needs.</p><p>The drug trial test material (Ayurvedic formulations, placebo, and glucosamine) was manufactured as capsules with uniform weight (approx. 500&#x02009;mg), similar appearance, and smell. Only permitted pharmaceutical grade excipients were used. Pharmaceutical grade charcoal, and synthetic ginger essence were used to give uniform appearance and smell to placebo and glucosamine. The standards were consistent with the guidelines for botanical drugs on GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and CMC (Chemistry Manufacture and Control) provided by the US FDA to the industry [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].The excipients included pharmaceutical grade maize starch, talc, charcoal and synthetic ginger essence. The placebo capsules were filled with maize starch and were identical in size, shape, color, and odor to those of the formulations. Tests were also carried out for microbial load, heavy metals, pesticide residues, and aflatoxins as per standard norms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.4"><title>2.2.4. Safety and Activity</title><p>Animal toxicity studies were carried out at Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, as per OECD guidelines Serial Number 423 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The acute and subacute studies were completed prior to the initiation of clinical trials while the chronic toxicity studies were completed later. None of the animal studies demonstrated any obvious toxicity. </p><p>In-house data was generated, both in animal and lab experiments, to support some of the putative properties and actions of the selected plants. Moderate analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities were demonstrated in acute and chronic standard animal pharmacology models. As compared to single drugs, multiple plant formulations exhibited better efficacy to support the contention of a synergistic clinical activity expected from the trial formulations (data not shown). Human cartilage (procured during knee surgery) was cultured in an artificial medium to set up human OA explants cartilage model which demonstrated beneficial effects of the candidate plant extracts and formulations on some of the critical cellular processes (proteoglycan release, nitric oxide release, aggrecan release, and hyaluronidase inhibition ) to further support their clinical use [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The selection process of candidate medicinal plants in this project appeared to be vindicated by several experimental studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Patient Selection</title><p>Patients suffering from symptomatic OA knees were screened for eligibility as per the protocol in rheumatology outpatient clinics of participating medical institutions and free-of-cost knee arthritis camps carried out in community settings.

Wash-Out Period</title><p>The patients using NSAID prior to enrolment were entered into a supervised wash-out period. Standard recommendations (based on plasma half life) were followed if the NSAID was known and a maximum of five days wash-out was carried out if the name of analgesic/NSAID used by the patient was unknown. All other pain relieving medications were discontinued but oral paracetamol (500&#x02009;mg tablet taken 3 to 4 times in a day) was permitted as a rescue medication on need basis. However, if the pain became intolerable, the wash-out phase was terminated prematurely and the patient entered the trial intervention phase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

Western Ontario and McMaster University's OA Index Version LK3 (WOMAC) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</title><p>A validated and modified version of WOMAC questionnaire for Indian use [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was used to assess pain, stiffness, and functional ability in the knees. The version was further translated into several Indian regional languages by CRD, Pune, and appropriately retested for content and comprehension (using back translations and in small independent patient groups) prior to the actual trial. The pain and stiffness domains in the Indian version are unchanged from the original version. However, several questions from the physical function &#x0201c;difficulty&#x0201d; domain have been removed and replaced by those relevant to Indian customs and traditions (especially those who squat and sit cross legged). Each of the questions in the pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical function difficulty (17 questions) domain was scored by the patient in a face to face interview conducted by a trained trial paramedic into one of the categorical answers (none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3, extreme = 4). The score of all the answers was summed (24 questions with a maximum score of 96) up. </p><p>Secondary efficacy variables (clinical and laboratory) were also recorded and included in pain VAS on rest, and in walking time (time taken to walk a 50 feet ground level distance), physician and patient global assessment (graded from asymptomatic to a very severe category) of disease, in patient's graded assessment of drug tolerability, change in the knee status on completion of the study as assessed by the patient (worse = 1, no change = 2, mild improvement = 3, moderate improvement = 4, marked improvement = 5 ), and paracetamol consumption. A fixed amount of paracetamol tablets (500&#x02009;mg each tablet) were provided at each visit according to a predetermined scale contained in the protocol. During the predetermined follow up visit, the number of tablets that were not consumed were withdrawn and recorded. As per the scale, a reducing amount of paracetamol was issued at each predetermined follow-up visit. Laboratory variables included several serum cytokine and hyaluronic acid assays. </p><p>An Ayurvedic CRF was also completed by an Ayurvedic physician (data not presented).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Treatment</title><p>The prescribed dose was two capsules twice a day to be taken with plain water after meals (lunch and dinner). The daily dose of glucosamine sulfate was 1000&#x02009;mg (250&#x02009;mg/capsule). Concomitant medication, if ongoing and fixed over time, for concurrent illnesses was permitted. Patients could continue their regular exercise and/or physiotherapy program begun prior to the current trial but were discouraged from starting any new activity during the trial duration. Physical therapy and local applications of pain relieving ointments/gels for OA knees were not permitted. Patients were not allowed to seek therapy from any other alternative medicinal system (such as homeopathy, acupuncture, and acupressure).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Laboratory Investigations</title><p>The focus of investigations was on safety rather than any efficacy parameter. Routine laboratory workup was done at baseline and on completion of the study. Routine workup included hematology (total and differential white blood cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate by Westergren method), biochemistry (blood sugar&#x02014;Fasting), blood urea, serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum uric acid, serum bilirubin, total serum proteins/albumin/globulin, serum amino-transferases), rheumatoid factor assay, and urinalysis. Routine EKGs were taken for all patients at entry. X-rays of knees were taken to confirm diagnosis. However, as per the protocol, some special laboratory tests such as serum IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and Hyaluronic acid were carried out more from a research point of view.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.8"><title>2.8. Adverse Events</title><p>Patients were specifically questioned as per a predetermined list of common symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, skin rash, giddiness, oral mucous ulcers, dyspepsia, and abdominal discomfort and pain) based on our experiences in clinical practice. Patients were also encouraged to volunteer information that they considered to be adverse events (AE) or a side effect (SE). Severe and life-threatening AE were to be investigated, treated, and notified as per protocol and GCP guidelines. The investigator recorded opinions on the causality/relevance of AE/SE in each case.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.9"><title>2.9. Withdrawals</title><p>Patients could withdraw voluntarily or at the discretion of the Investigator.

Saluja) from CRD visited other trial sites at regular intervals to check trial progress and documents as per the GCP guidelines. An independent referee was also designated by the CSIR to visit all the trial sites and carry out a trial audit. After relevant checks, a copy of coded trial data was submitted to CSIR (Sponsor and Monitor) and SHS. The trial data was then decoded under supervision of S. Sarmukaddam (CRD) and B. Patwardhan (SHS) and kept locked (password protected). One copy of the locked database was also submitted to CSIR and SHS prior to carrying out statistical analysis.

Eighteen Percent Patients Withdrew from the Study but None Due to Serious Adverse Events</title><p>Forty three patients withdrew from the study (as per arm: 6 in A, 6 in B, 6 in C, 5 in D, 5 in E, 6 in placebo, and 9 in the glucosamine arm). There were no obvious differences between the reasons for withdrawal in any of the groups. However, the reasons were loss to follow-up (15 patients), noncompliance (4 patients), change in location (5 patients), poor efficacy (8 patients), and frequent abdominal upsets/diarrhea (5 patients); not more than 2 patients ever withdrew from any of the intervention groups for any of the cited reasons. None of the patients who withdrew, required hospitalization. Though we did not grade any AE severe, five patients (including 2 each from placebo and glucosamine arms) stopped medication due to frequent abdominal upsets and withdrew from the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Only Mild Adverse Events Were Reported with Least Incidence in the C Treatment Arm</title><p>None of the patients in the current study reported serious AE. All AE were mild and were treated symptomatically. None of the patients with AE required invasive intervention or an imaging study. The common AE/SE reported were epigastric discomfort, vague diffuse dull pain in abdomen, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and episodic skin rash (mostly nonitchy). Overall, a lesser frequency of AE seemed to be reported in the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm as compared to other Ayurvedic intervention arms, glucosamine, and placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Amongst All the Groups, &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; Formulation Showed the Best Response in Reducing Pain</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference (at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) in the mean change from baseline to completion in active-pain VAS and WOMAC index between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). However, the maximum reduction in pain was demonstrated by the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>) and this was further demonstrated at every follow-up evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The latter improvement was further supported by an unequivocal demonstration of lesser consumption (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) of a number of oral paracetamol tablets, both during the total study period and the final four weeks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). We also analyzed the proportion of patients showing &#x0003e;60% reduction in the active-pain VAS from baseline to completion and found that the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm (12 patients) was ahead of the placebo (8 patients) and glucosamine (4 patients) groups. Analysis of the data on knee status (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2">Section 2</xref>) on completion of the study demonstrated the best improvement in the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm; a RIDIT (relative to identified distribution) analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>) showed that the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation was definitely better than the placebo (<italic>P</italic> = .03) or glucosamine (<italic>P</italic> = .09). The latter was interpreted to mean that more than half of the time, a randomly selected subject from &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm was likely to have a better knee status as compared to a randomly selected individual from any of the reference groups (placebo and glucosamine). Though marginal and modest, the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm consistently showed a better numerical response for several other secondary efficacy measures ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2">Section 2</xref>)as compared to placebo,glucosamine and several other Ayurvedic drug intervention (data not shown).</p><p>The placebo response was found to be unexpectedly strong, especially with reference to the WOMAC result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.5"><title>3.5.

Discussion</title><p>In this controlled drug trialstudy comparing several Ayurvedic formulations (with a common Z. <italic>officinale-T. cordifolia </italic>base) with glucosamine and placebo in the treatment of symptomatic OA knee, we demonstrated a better clinical efficacy and safe use of &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; Ayurvedic formulation, albeit not statistically significant. This was an exploratory study intended to identify the best formulations based on positive clinical trends for further development. Importantly, the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation reduced pain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and requirement of rescue analgesic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>) and improved the patient centered knee status on completion of study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). The decrease in the mean pain VAS from 6.3&#x02009;cms at baseline to 4.4&#x02009;cms on completion in the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm was clinically meaningful. Though, the incidence of AE and rate of withdrawal from study did not discriminate between the intervention arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation recorded a comparatively lesser frequency of AE related to abdominal symptoms. </p><p>Our mandate in this initial phase of the NMITLI arthritis project was to identify the most promising formulation for development and validation (a subsequent phase of the project). Accordingly, despite several logistic challenges and an unprecedented trial, we designed a seven arm controlled study of sixteen weeks duration to evaluate five Ayurvedic formulations for their primary pain relief effect. We included both oral glucosamine and placebo as controls. A large number of patients were screened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), mostly in a community setting, to select patients of OA with moderately severe knee pain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). At least 30 patients in each intervention arm completed the study. This trial was not statistically designed nor adequately powered (in order to reduce the chances of a false negative trial result). The clinical trial phase (first patient screened to last patient completed) was completed in about 15 months. We were expected to carry out speedy and economical drug trial evaluations. Though not intended, we now find that the current trial satisfies several of the recently developed recommendations for reporting of trials of herbal interventions [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. </p><p>We have earlier reported a strong placebo response in Ayurvedic drug trials [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and speculated several causes related to challenging socioeconomics and cultural beliefs in our community. However, the phenomenon of &#x0201c;regression to mean&#x0201d; is well known to masquerade as placebo response. Indians have faith and high expectations from Ayurveda. Improvement in the WOMAC questionnaire (pain domain) is reported to be consistent with the pain relief recorded on VAS [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but this did not appear to be the case in the current study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). WOMAC assesses the functional ability of the knees. Perhaps the duration of the current drug trial study was too short to evaluate a meaningful change in WOMAC. Also, WOMAC response in the current study was recorded in one of the six regional languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, and Urdu) and probably there was a lack of sufficient standardization between various language versions and paramedic investigators. We carried out a separate analysis of data from each of the study centers but did not find any systematic bias (data not shown). </p><p>Though we chose Ayurvedic formulations which are popularly used in clinical practice, we are aware that the therapy in Ayurveda is holistic and much more complex. Validation of the latter traditional approach using a randomized controlled drug trial may not be the most appropriate method [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since our study aimed at developing standardized formulation for general global use, we adopted a diagnosis centric treatment approach similar to what is practiced in modern medicine. Standardization of Ayurvedic drugs is an extremely important and challenging step in the overall clinical validation process and should not deter investigators to carry out clinical validation studies such as the current report. The current Ayurvedic formulations contained relatively lesser ingredients. The current clinical trial was supported by several experts and accredited national institutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to carry out the arduous task of standardization and other paraclinical studies including those of animal toxicity which may not be feasible in a routine pharmaceutical setting. Some collateral work from our NMITLI project regarding the likely mechanism of action of the selected plant formulation ingredients has been recently published [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>We selected OA as the target disorder because it is a common cause of chronic pains, disability, and poor quality of life in the community [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Except for physiotherapy and exercises, the therapy options for OA in modern medicine are grossly limited to providing symptomatic relief using analgesic, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), or a joint replacement in the end stage situation. Patients often self-medicate and consume analgesics and NSAID for prolonged periods and run a risk of suffering from life-threatening drug toxicity (especially that of gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular system). Effective management of OA would need drugs to repair and strengthen cartilage and prevent future damage. We chose glucosamine in the current study because it is extensively used to treat OA worldwide and has been demonstrated to provide both symptomatic pain relief, improve quality of life, and reduce cartilage damage [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. But several other well-designed studies have challenged the therapeutic role of glucosamine [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The large scale NIH trial [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated limited use of oral glucosamine in the treatment of OA. The outcome with glucosamine in the current study (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) was rather disappointing but this might have been related to the use of a dose that is currently considered insufficient [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but was popularly prescribed in our scenario at the time of designing this study. </p><p> Although envisaged since long, there is a void in the development of chondroprotective drugs. An ideal drug would be one that provides pain relief and chondroprotection. We believe that Ayurvedic medicines, especially those with Rasayana properties as in the current study, may fulfill the requirement of cartilage repair and chondroprotection. This proposition and several other hypotheses are being carefully tested in the NMITLI project before Ayurveda can address some of the unmet needs in modern medicine [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have recently completed an appropriately powered and designed drug trial study of Ayurvedic &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; formulation in the long-term treatment of OA knees which also includes surrogate measures of cartilage damage and chondroprotection (not yet published).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated a better efficacy and safety profile of a standardized Ayurvedic formulation &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; in the symptomatic treatment of OA knees using a fast track multiple interventional arm exploratory drug trial controlled for placebo and glucosamine. The latter was a preliminary phase of a national project (NMITLI) and formulation &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; was chosen for further development and validation. Some of the logistic and socioeconomic issues connected with trials on traditional medicine, especially in the Indian scenario, are highlighted. The importance of using validated health assessment instruments appropriate for regional use such as Indian version of WOMAC is also emphasized. We also recommend a multidisciplinary integrated approach to validate traditional medicines.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title> Contributors to Paper</title><p>The clinical strategy and current protocol was designed by A.
