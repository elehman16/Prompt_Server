Retrospective data suggest that early application of IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may prevent or mitigate CIPNM. Therefore, the primary objective was to assess the effect of early IgM-enriched IVIG versus placebo to mitigate CIPNM in a prospective setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial, 38 critically ill patients with multiple organ failure (MOF), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis, and early clinical signs of CIPNM were included. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated either with IgM-enriched IVIG or placebo over a period of three days. CIPNM was measured by the CIPNM severity sum score based on electrophysiological stimulation of the median, ulnar, and tibial nerves on days 0, 4, 7, 14 and on the histological evaluation of muscle biopsies on days 0 and 14 and ranged from 0 (no CIPNM) to 8 (very severe CIPNM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 38 critically ill patients were included and randomized to receive either IgM-enriched IVIG (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19). Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. CIPNM could not be improved by IVIG treatment, represented by similar CIPNM severity sum scores on day 14 (IVIG vs. placebo: 4.8 &#x000b1; 2.0 vs. 4.5 &#x000b1; 1.8; <italic>P</italic> = 0.70). CIPNM severity sum score significantly increased from baseline to day 14 (3.5 &#x000b1; 1.6 vs. 4.6 &#x000b1; 1.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). After an interim analysis the study was terminated early due to futility in reaching the primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early treatment with IVIG did not mitigate CIPNM in critically ill patients with MOF and SIRS/sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01867645">NCT01867645</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness myopathy (CIM) are serious complications of severely ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>CIP is an acute and primarily distal axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy affecting mainly lower extremities and respiratory muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As in some patients when primarily the muscles are affected, the term critical illness myopathy (CIM) was established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the differentiation between CIP and CIM is difficult. Therefore, and due to the frequent association of both, the term critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy (CIPNM) was introduced in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, electrophysiological and histological findings of CIP and CIM disclose a significant overlap of these two entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In prospective studies, about 60 to 80% of patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) with or without sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) presented with CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In patients with septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or severe sepsis and coma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] the prevalence may reach up to 100%. In the majority of patients with sepsis a combination of both CIP and CIM was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Independent risk factors for CIPNM are, amongst others, severity of illness, duration of MOF with or without SIRS, duration of vasopressor and catecholamine support, hyperglycemia and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The clinical features of CIP and CIM are almost identical and include muscle weakness and atrophy primarily of the lower limbs and respiratory muscles, delayed weaning from the respirator not explained by pulmonary or cardiovascular findings, and prolongation of the mobilization phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, a number of complications, such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may be attributed - at least in part - to CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On neurological examination, decreased or absent tendon reflexes, especially with CIP, muscular atrophies and symmetrical flaccid tetraparesis are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The gold standards used to diagnose CIPNM are electrophysiological stimulation (EPS) and muscle biopsy. Characteristically, electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies demonstrate the preservation of the speed of impulse in the presence of decreased compound muscle (CMAP) and sensory nerve (SNAP) action potential amplitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These findings are highly consistent with a relatively pure axonal polyneuropathy. Furthermore, EMG discloses signs of denervation like fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in a widespread distribution. For the definite diagnosis of CIM and to differentiate between CIP and CIM the histological assessment of a muscle biopsy is the preferable method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>For CIPNM no specific pathogenic-based therapy is proven. For prevention, sepsis should be treated with maximum effort, including intensive insulin therapy (IIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Muscle relaxants and corticosteroids should be administered at the lowest doses needed, whereas the potentially detrimental effect of the latter has been controversially discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, there is weak evidence from a retrospective chart analysis of prospectively collected data, that early IgM-enriched IVIG application may prevent CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>IVIG contains natural polyreactive antibodies derived from human plasma of healthy donors directed against endogenous and exogenous antibodies, immunomodulating peptides and various cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The pathophysiologic rationale for using IVIG to treat CIPNM is based on the association of CIPNM with pro-inflammatory cytokines accompanied by increased E-selection expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This favors the accumulation of neurotoxic factors in the endoneurium and causes extravasation of activated leukocytes both resulting in neuron damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated cytokine levels directly induce muscle protein damage via activation of calpain and ubiquitine-proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of IVIG may attenuate the local immune activation on both the cellular and the humoral level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we aimed to investigate the use of IVIG in the early treatment of CIPNM in critically ill patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Trial design and setting</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in an eight-bed medical ICU at the University Hospital of Vienna, Austria.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Critically ill patients with MOF (failure of two or more organs), a SIRS/sepsis diagnosis, and first clinical evidence for CIPNM were randomized.

CIPNM severity sum score is a combined endpoint consisting of the CIP and the CIM scores determined on Day 0 (baseline) and after treatment (Day 14).</p><p>CIP was determined by EPS of the median, ulnar and tibial nerves on days 0, 4, 7 and 14 using a Nicolet Viking IV (Nicolet Biomedical, Fenton, MO, USA) apparatus. CIP was graded based on the CMAP amplitude size according to the following scheme. CMAP amplitude &#x02265;4,000 &#x003bc;V was considered as normal (score = 0), CMAP amplitude &#x02265;3,000 &#x003bc;V and &#x0003c;4,000 &#x003bc;V as mild CIP (score = 1), CMAP amplitude &#x02265;2,000 &#x003bc;V and &#x0003c;3,000 &#x003bc;V as moderate CIP (score = 2), CMAP amplitude &#x02265;1,000 &#x003bc;V and &#x0003c;2,000 &#x003bc;V as severe CIP (score = 3), and CMAP amplitude &#x0003c;1,000 &#x003bc;V as very severe CIP (score = 4). For each day the nerve with the highest CIP score value was used for further calculations.</p><p>CIM was semi-quantitatively scored by an independent blinded neuropathologist according to the histological and ultrastructural findings of the skeletal muscle biopsy specimens taken on days 0 and 14.</p><p>The percutaneous biopsies in all patients were taken from the <italic>Musculus vastus lateralis</italic> by the same clinician according to a standardized protocol. In case of a second biopsy (on Day 14), the biopsy was performed on the contralateral muscle. The biopsy site was on the straight line between the great trochanter and the lateral condyle of the femur exactly 20 cm proximal of the lateral condyle. First, a small sterile field was prepared and local anesthetic was applied into the (sub)cutaneous area up to the <italic>Fascia lata</italic>. After the incision of the cutis at a 90&#x000b0; angle the area up to the <italic>Fascia lata</italic> was dissected out under visual control. Second, the muscle was biopsied using a Bergstroem muscle biopsy needle (Stille, Stockholm, Sweden).</p><p>Muscle tissue was snap frozen and a small part fixed in glutaraledhyde and embedded in resin. The panel of stainings, including HE, ATPase (pH 4.3), Oil-Red O, PAS, Gomori Trichrome, NADH and combined COX-SDH, was performed on the cross-cut frozen sections. Furthermore, sections were stained with antibodies against myosin slow and fast (Novocastra, Milton Keynes, UK, 1:100), &#x003b3; sarcoglykan (Novocastra, 1:200), and N-terminal utrophin (Novocastra, 1:200). Thick sections of 4 &#x003bc;m were cut of the resin embedded tissue and stained with toluidine blue.</p><p>The quantification of myopathy was based on characteristic features of acute myopathy in intensive care, namely type II fibre atrophy (numerous scattered angular, atrophic fibers identified as type 2 fibers by ATPase and myosin stains), muscle necrosis, and selective loss of myosin filaments and scored as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]: no signs of myopathy (score = 0), signs of mild myopathy (score = 1), signs of moderate myopathy (score = 2), signs of severe myopathy (score = 3), and signs of very severe myopathy (score = 4).</p><p>Hence, the CIPNM severity sum score consisting of the CIP and CIM scores determined on days 0 and 14 ranged from 0 (no CIM, no CIP) to 8 (very severe CIP, very severe CIM).</p><p>Secondary outcomes were to assess the effect of early IVIG versus placebo on mortality from any cause within a 28-day period and length of the ICU stay. Furthermore, we investigated the course of CIPNM from baseline to Day 14 in all patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The software PASS 11 (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) was used for sample size calculation.

To date, no specific treatment has been proven in randomized controlled trials to prevent or mitigate CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As there is evidence for a role of immune mechanisms in CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Wijdicks <italic>et al.</italic> administered IVIG in three patients, without beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, in a retrospective analysis of 33 patients early administration of IgM-enriched IVIG was suggested to prevent CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The present study is the first prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial assessing the impact of IgM-enriched IVIG on CIPNM. To achieve a potentially optimal effect of IVIG, we included only severely ill patients with MOF, a SIRS/sepsis diagnosis and clinical signs of CIPNM.</p><p>However, IVIG did not mitigate CIPNM in the critically ill patients in the present trial. Neither CIP as determined by EPS of three nerves on days 0, 4, 7 and 14 nor CIM as assessed by the histological examination of muscle biopsies on days 0 and 14 were different in the IVIG group compared to the controls at any time point. Moreover, length of ICU stay and mortality were similar in both groups.</p><p>More than two-thirds of the patients presented with both increased CIM and CIP scores while 16% had either elevated CIP or CIM scores. Thus, 97% of the patients (31/32) presented with CIPNM at baseline based on EPS and muscle histology findings. This is comparable to patients with severe sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As CIP and CIM are overlapping diseases, the CIP (CIM) score does not necessarily reflect severity of CIP (CIM) only, but should be seen as a marker of the severity of CIPNM.</p><p>Mohr <italic>et al.</italic> found some evidence in a retrospective chart analysis of IVIG being able to prevent CIPNM in critically ill patients using EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on the retrospective character of their analysis, the evidence has been regarded as weak and is in contrast with findings of our prospective, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. However, Mohr <italic>et al.</italic> started their IVIG treatment within 24 hours after onset of sepsis/multi organ failure and did not wait for the first clinical signs of CIPNM. As we administered IVIG only after the first clinical evidence of CIPNM at median five (three to seven) days after the start of the respective SIRS/sepsis episode, these two studies are not entirely comparable.</p><sec><title>Rationale for the treatment strategy</title><p>The pathophysiologic rationale for using IVIG to treat CIPNM in the present study is based on the association of CIPNM with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1, and IL-12 accompanied by increased E-selection expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This is suggested to promote the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial-cells and extravasation of activated leukocytes within the endoneurial space. The increased cytokine production leads to enhanced vascular permeability favoring the passage of neurotoxic factors into the endoneurium causing neuron damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated cytokine levels directly induce muscle protein damage via activation of calpain and ubiquitine-proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of IVIG are mediated by regulating the production, release and function of pro-inflammatory cytokines and have been successfully used in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The use of IgM-enriched IVIG was based on the potential superiority over standard IVIG as seen in sepsis treatment and on the analysis of Mohr <italic>et al.,</italic> who suggested a beneficial effect of IgM-enriched IVIG in the prevention of CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Standard IVIG has been safely administered intravenously at daily doses of 0.40 g/kg body weight over five days in patients with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mohr <italic>et al.</italic> administered IgM-enriched IVIG at doses of 0.3 g/kg body weight daily over three days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the manufacturer recommends that IgM-enriched IVIG be administered at a maximum dose of 0.25 g/kg body weight daily for three consecutive days, which is also the common dosage for the treatment of severe sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we decided to administer IgM-enriched IVIG at a dose of 0.25 g/kg body weight daily for three consecutive days. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a potential benefit with higher doses of IgM-enriched IVIG regarding the treatment of CIPNM.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>It is desirable to have a clinical endpoint like the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength to assess the course of CIPNM. However, the MRC scale assessment depends on patient's cooperation and cannot be performed in patients who are not fully awake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Patients in our study were severely ill, represented by MOF, SIRS/sepsis and high SOFA/APACHE III scores. The vast majority was fully or partly sedated (87% at baseline; 50% on Day 14) and/or intubated/tracheotomized (95% at baseline; 84% on Day 14). Therefore, clinical assessment of the muscle weakness using the MRC scale was not feasible in the majority of our patients. At baseline only 5 of 38 patients (3 in the placebo, 2 in the IVIG group) were cooperative enough to allow the clinical assessment of muscle strengths using the MRC scale.</p><p>This is similar to Routsi <italic>et al.,</italic> who only could determine the MRC score in one-third of their patients although their patients were less ill than those in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, as a clinical endpoint was not feasible, we regarded the CIPNM severity sum score, based on serial EPS and two muscle biopsies, as the most appropriate method of assessing the course of CIPNM in critically ill patients who are not fully awake. A total of 106 patients fulfilling the screening criteria (SIRS/Sepsis and MOF) were evaluated by a neurologist in order to only randomize patients with clinical signs of CIPNM. This evaluation was challenging as the majority of the patients was not fully awake. However, unlike the MRC scale assessment, its aim was not to measure CIPNM using a metric scale but to select patients with an advanced stage of CIPNM. One-third (38 of 106) of patients met these criteria. CIPNM was confirmed in 97% (37 of 38) of patients at baseline based on EPS and muscle histology findings with relatively high CIPNM sum scores. Therefore, we regard the initial clinical evaluation as a valid tool to specifically select patients with an advanced stage of CIPNM, whereas the sensitivity of this evaluation may have been rather low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The differentiation between CIP and CIM is often not possible in critically ill patients by EPS alone. This shortcoming also could be compensated for by using the CIPNM severity sum score. Routsi <italic>et al.,</italic> who suggested that electrical muscle stimulation may prevent CIPNM, used only a clinical score for muscle strength to assess CIPNM and, therefore, could not differentiate between CIP and CIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another method to make a distinction between CIP and CIM is direct muscle stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, as muscle biopsy is regarded as the gold standard, we did not use direct muscle stimulation in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Van den Berghe <italic>et al.</italic> found a reduced incidence of CIPNM in a pre-planned subgroup analysis of critically ill patients treated with IIT compared to conventional insulin therapy. Similarly, no differentiation between CIP and CIM was feasible in their study, as no histological assessment was done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>It has been controversially discussed if discrimination between CIP and CIM is reasonable. However, exact differential diagnosis between these two entities leads to better prognostic information regarding long term disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. CIM in combination with CIP is associated with a more severe weakness and longer ICU length of stay than CIM alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, CIM has a better long-term prognosis than CIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The main limitation of the present trial is the relatively small number of critically ill patients included in our trial prone to type II errors. Although we did not see any differences in the outcomes between the groups, this cannot entirely rule out a (small) effect of IVIG on CIPNM.</p><p>Furthermore, not all EPS or muscle biopsy evaluations could be performed as scheduled. The recruitment period of 4.5 years is rather long for a single-center trial and this potentially influenced the results. The slow recruiting is attributed to the very specific inclusion criteria, based on which only patients with a two-or-more organ failure, SIRS/sepsis, and clinical evidence for CIPNM could be included. To minimize the potential bias of the relatively long recruitment period we ensured that all procedures were carried out by the same team throughout the study period.</p><p>Although EPS and muscle biopsy are the methods of choice of assessing nerve and muscle damage in CIPNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a combination of both (CIPNM sum score) as used in the present study has never been validated to be superior. Therefore, we also provide separate results of EPS and muscle biopsy assessment which do not differ from the CIPNM sum score (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The CIPNM sum score should be further validated in future trials for determining the specificity and sensitivity of CIPNM in critically ill patients.</p><p>Another limitation may have been the use of the &#x0201c;CIM score&#x0201d; based on the histological assessment of muscle biopsies. Although histological assessment is the diagnostic method of choice to evaluate myopathy in critically ill patients the grading of the &#x0201c;CIM score&#x0201d; is only semi-quantitative and has not been validated before. Muscle biopsy is regarded as safe and well tolerated in critically ill patients but it is still an invasive procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that muscle biopsies should primarily be used in clinical trials. Unclear muscle weakness and inconclusive electrophysiological findings may justify muscle biopsy in the clinical routine.</p><p>Ultrasound has been successfully used to reliably measure muscle mass in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, at the start of enrollment (December 2004), this information was not yet available. Furthermore, the patients included in our trial were more severely ill than in the trial of Gruther <italic>et al.</italic> As tissue edema is common in severely ill patients, the assessment of the muscle mass using ultrasound may be challenging. Nevertheless, ultrasound examination should be considered as additional outcome in future trials.</p><p>Patients with clinical unapparent polyneuropathy or mild polyneuropathy were eligible for enrollment, as we did not expect an effect on the primary outcome.</p><p>We hypothesize that the following circumstances may be responsible for the lack of effect of IVIG. First, we decided to include patients that were already presenting with clinical signs of CIPNM at an early stage to achieve a maximal effect of IVIG. However, the application of IVIG at an even earlier time point - when the first signs of CIPNM can be verified only using electrophysiology measures may result in improved effects of IVIG. This was similarly observed in patients with severe sepsis, who had a significantly improved survival rate when IVIGs were administered early compared to at a more advanced phase of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Thus, earlier or even prophylactic application of IVIG may show better effects of IVIG regarding the prevention or mitigation of CIPNM, since a short, albeit crucial, time period may pass between first nerve and/or muscle fiber damage and first demonstrable electrophysiological changes, not to mention the first clinical signs, chosen as inclusion criterion in our study. However, a prophylactic treatment had required the inclusion of a lot more patients.</p><p>Potentially, a beneficial effect of IVIG on CIPNM may only be seen months after ICU discharge and was still concealed on Day 14 when we assessed the primary outcome. Due to patients lost to follow-up, this requires the inclusion of a higher number of patients.</p><p>Furthermore, the pathophysiology of CIPNM is complex and a multimodal cause is postulated. This includes alterations of the local immunity, decreased microcirculation of peripheral nerves, increased generation and deficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species, enhanced permeability for neurotoxic factors into the endoneurium, direct muscular protein breakdown and acquired channelopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, IVIG has only a relatively limited point of action by modulating the local immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, a multimodal therapy approach may be necessary to improve CIPNM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial showed that early treatment with IVIG does neither significantly improve CIPNM nor influence length of ICU stay or mortality in critically ill patients.
