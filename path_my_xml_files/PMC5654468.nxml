The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of delivering the combined interventions by physiotherapists and to establish preliminary clinical efficacy for improving walking outcomes; secondary outcomes will be provided in a parallel publication. We delivered the same exercise programme to both groups and controlled for contact by comparing a structured SCT education programme with an attention control education programme and investigated whether adding the SCT education component would yield greater improvements in walking mobility and whether the improvements were maintained at follow-up. It was hypothesised that that the participants in the exercise and SCT-based intervention would achieve significantly more improvement in walking outcomes than the control group postintervention and that this improvement would be maintained at follow-up. The results of this trial will inform the design, particularly power analysis, of a definitive trial that provides Class 1 evidence (AAN).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicentre, two-arm, parallel (1:1), double-blind, randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The participants were recruited through the MS Society of Ireland and via neurology clinics in three urban locations in Ireland.

After each of the group exercise classes, the control group received an education session about topics unrelated to PA behaviour, for&#x000a0;example, diet, vitamin D, sleep, temperature and hydration and immunisations and vaccinations. The exercise plus SCT-based intervention group received the same exercise intervention as the control group (as described in the previous section).

In order to have 80% power (at the 5% significance level) to detect such a difference in mean improvement in 6MWT over the study period between groups, a sample of size 62 randomised equally to two arms (ie, 31 per arm) was used to inform the target sample size for this pilot study. The intention was to recruit 72 participants to account for dropout and to run the group interventions once sufficient people in that region were eligible. Recruitment in regions was not uniform and participants became ineligible while waiting for others to be recruited. Recruitment was better than intended and continued to 92 eligible participants resulting in 65 participants starting the intervention.</p><p>Suitable numerical statistics and graphical summaries were used to describe characteristics of the sample at baseline and to assess the validity of any distributional assumptions needed for the formal analysis. All tests of significance were two-sided and conducted at an alpha=0.05&#x02009;level of statistical significance. An exploratory paired t-test between baseline and each of the week 12, 24 and 36 follow-ups was conducted, providing a summary of the effects of the estimated treatment and control from the raw data. These &#x02018;unadjusted&#x02019; results do not account for the patient covariates and repeated measurements. We also quantified and compared the magnitude of change in walking measures using Hedges&#x02019; G effect sizes and associated 95% CIs using Cohen&#x02019;s conventions for effect sizes (0.2 small, 0.5 moderate, 0.8 large). For each outcome measure, the mean baseline to postintervention and 3-month and 6-month change for the control condition was subtracted from the mean baseline to postintervention and 3 and 6&#x02009;month change for the intervention condition and divided by the pooled baseline SD.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Effect sizes were calculated such that greater improvements in outcomes in the intervention group compared with the control group resulted in positive effect sizes.</p><p>The statistical modelling compared differences in the response variables (6MWT, TUG and MSWS scores) between the two intervention arms at each of the three postintervention follow-ups while correcting for the baseline measurements for each participant. A linear mixed model for a continuous response over time due to the two interventions, while adjusting for participant-specific covariates and factors, namely 6MWT at baseline, age, gender, time since diagnosis and MS type (ie, benign, primary progressive and relapsing-remitting). Treatment and time (and their interaction) were specified as fixed effects, centre (three levels) and subject (nested in centre) as random effects in order to account for homogeneity within centre and within subject correlation over time. Initially a model containing the main effects of the treatment, time and a treatment-by-time interaction was specified in order to test whether there is evidence that the treatment effects varies over time. If the interaction was deemed unnecessary (using a likelihood ratio test), the model was refitted excluding the interaction term, so the treatment effect was then constant over time. Two separate analyses were carried out. First, following an intention-to-treat principle in which all 65 patients who remained eligible to participate were considered. In the secondary analysis, a smaller cohort of 52 patients are analysed, who were identified to have closely adhered to the programme by having attended at least two of the three follow-ups. All models were fitted in R 3.2.0 using the lme4 and lmerTest packages.

Between time of randomisation and initiation of the intervention, 27 eligible participants either became ineligible or were unable to participate. One participant was not treated as randomised (two acquaintances had been randomised to the other group and they wanted to exercise with them). Sixty-five participants commenced the intervention (SCT group, n=33; CON group, n=32). In the SCT group, four participants discontinued the intervention and 12 were lost to follow-up at 36&#x02009;weeks. In the CON group, three participants discontinued the intervention and 10 were lost-to-follow up at 36&#x02009;weeks. Following the 10-week intervention, overall attrition was 17% and at the 36-week follow-up assessment attrition was 34%.

Using this secondary analysis, there was no evidence of a treatment effect in favour of the SCT group as compared with the CON group regarding the TUG or MSWS-12 scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This pilot RCT investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Step it Up programme, a 10-week aerobic and strengthening programme that aimed to enable physically inactive PwMS to exercise according to the recent MS exercise guidelines.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We investigated whether embedding an evidence-based exercise programme within a structured SCT-based education programme resulted in improved and more sustained walking outcomes compared with an exercise plus attention control education intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of enabling inactive people to meet the minimum recommended dose of the MS exercise guidelines and examine the effects on walking mobility as a primary end-point.</p><p>The intervention protocol was feasible and results demonstrated significant improvements in walking mobility following the intervention in both groups. There was a moderate effect (Hedges&#x02019; G 0.50) at 36-week follow-up in favour of the SCT group for 6MWT. The effect for the SCT group was also greater at 12-week and 36-week follow-up for the primary outcome, 6MWT, using the secondary analysis which included only patients who adhered to the programme (as defined by having attended at least two of the three follow-ups). Recruitment was successful and over 9&#x02009;months at three centres, we recruited more than our target of 62 participants (92 eligible participants). The largest point of attrition was while participants waited for enough people to run the group in that region. In the future, recruiting from the largest city in Ireland for a definitive RCT will enable greater numbers to be recruited more quickly and should minimise this attrition at this point in the trial. Retention across the intervention period was good and the attrition rate (17%) was similar to other exercise interventions in people with depression<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and slightly higher than the average of 15% in a review of exercise trials in MS.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While the level of participant attrition in the current programme is greatly improved from our previous community based exercise RCT,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> measures such as recruiting a dedicated study coordinator to provide more frequent interactions with participants in the definitive trial will be explored to further enhance retention at follow-up. The addition of booster intervention sessions after the completion of the 10-week intervention will also be explored in the future definitive trial.</p><p>The intervention was delivered by physiotherapists who attended a 1-day training session and treatment fidelity findings suggest that this approach was successful as the interventions were delivered as intended; further training and support may increase the success of the intervention in future. Participants completed on average 73%&#x02013;75% of possible sessions suggesting that the protocol is feasible for participants with minimal impairment due to MS. We collected data from exercise logs for demonstrating adherence with the exercise programme. The exercise logs were returned by 82% of participants and used to ascertain whether participants were meeting the MS exercise guideline at the end of the intervention period. It is interesting to note that a greater proportion of participants in the SCT group (68% vs 50%) progressed to meeting the guidelines. Measures to further enhance completion and return of logs (such as offering them in alternative electronic formats) in the future definitive trial are needed.</p><p>We further confirmed adherence to this aerobic and strengthening intervention by investigating its effects on strength, fitness and PA. Both 5xSTS and Godin Health index increased significantly and the Aerobic Fitness Scale (AFS) showed a tendency to improve providing evidence that the exercise intervention met its intended outcomes. Collectively, we believe that the exercise log data combined with fitness and PA outcomes support the successful manipulation of exercise behaviour with in both trial arms. Based on the data on recruitment, retention, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this group exercise and SCT education intervention, we propose to progress to a definitive intervention. To do this, a sample of 49 (for a difference between groups of 39&#x02009;m, assuming a SD of the change score at 36&#x02009;weeks of 67.85, 80% power, 0.05 significance level) in each group would be needed and we therefore plan to recruit across these three centres again and to add a fourth centre in the largest city in Ireland to minimise attrition.</p><p>Importantly, both groups improved significantly in the primary outcome, 6MWT, following the intervention. This improvement in 6MWT is consistent with a recent systematic review of exercise studies that found a significant improvement in walking endurance.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We note that the mean improvement in the SCT group of 80&#x02009;m and of 60&#x02009;m in the control group far exceeded the value for the clinically important change of 26.1&#x02009;m proposed by Baert <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Both groups improved more than that reported by Carter <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> in their exercise plus education group, and the magnitude of improvement is more consistent with the improvements noted in a recent community-based intervention among people with moderate-severity MS.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We further note that the current physically inactive sample of PwMS with an average age of 42 had 6MWT of 445&#x02009;m at baseline that was less than that of a reference sample aged 70&#x02013;80&#x02009;years who walked an average of 514&#x02009;m<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. This confirms the significant walking impairments for inactive people with mild disability with MS and importantly demonstrates positive improvements due to the Step it Up exercise intervention. Interestingly, the SCT group but not the CON group improved in their self-reported walking impairment (MSWS-12) and the magnitude of the change in 6MWT distance may have influenced that finding. Both groups however improved in walking speed and maintained that improvement at 36-week follow-up with a small-moderate effect size in favour of the SCT group demonstrated for TUG.</p><p>Of note, through the secondary analysis including participants who participated in at least two follow-up assessments, we demonstrated that adding a structured SCT education programme enhanced the effect on 6MWT distance following the 10-week intervention. This is important as it provides information on the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention and confirms the need to augment the retention strategies in the definitive trial. We propose greater training for the interventionists and greater use of telephone coaching in weeks without classes and between intervention and follow-up sessions. Importantly, both the improvement from baseline and the difference in between-group effects were maintained at 36-week follow-up providing new information on the ability to sustain effects after the intervention ceased. Interestingly, the effect was reduced at 24&#x02009;weeks and participants reported that realising they had deteriorated at that assessment served as a prompt to resume their exercise after that assessment. The SCT education programme had six education sessions that targeted outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, goal setting and perceived barriers and benefits of exercise. The components are further consistent with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of modifiable psychosocial constructs associated with PA in MS that confirmed self-efficacy, goal setting and outcome expectancies as significantly correlated with PA in MS.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> One novel feature of the current trial is that the SCT education modules were delivered by physiotherapists with minimal training in delivery of behavioural interventions. These findings also support that delivering this SCT education intervention by physiotherapists in a group setting is both feasible and preliminary findings suggest that it may have superior outcomes to an attention control education intervention.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>One of the strengths of this pilot RCT relates to the production of new knowledge around the sustainability of exercise interventions for PwMS. Building on the existing evidence base, we designed and delivered a SCT-based pragmatic physiotherapist-led community exercise. Results demonstrated the feasibility of the protocol among physically&#x000a0;inactive people with mild MS and trends towards clinical efficacy for walking outcomes. The model of care outlined in this pilot study presents as a highly&#x000a0;scalable intervention package for physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals working in primary care services or with third sector organisations (charities). Further study in the form of a definitive trial, including cost and clinical outcomes has the potential to have real policy implications for the provision of rehabilitation to PwMS. Further strengths relate to the use of measures of treatment fidelity, target variables of the intervention (strength, fitness and PA) and both self-report (MSWS) and objective (TUG and 6MWT) measures of walking. Additionally, in the context of an evidence base where PA interventions are often not theoretically&#x000a0;based, a key strength of this RCT is the use of the SCT framework to design a behaviour-change intervention; building on the extensive work of the US partner in this trial.</p><p>One limitation is the attrition of participants between point of eligibility and allocation to the intervention. The large waiting times resulted in the loss of 29% of eligible participants at this point in the trial. Recruitment from larger urban areas with greater numbers of both MS clinics and PwMS is planned for the future definitive trial so that the numbers required to run group classes are met more quickly. A further positive is that we used pedometers and exercise logs to record the intensity and duration of the intervention; however, another limitation is that detailed exercise diaries were not returned for all participants. However, a return rate of 82% is acceptable and measures to improve this in the definitive trial will be considered.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot RCT aimed to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of enabling physically inactive PwMS to meet the MS exercise guidelines<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> through a group exercise and education, physiotherapist-led intervention. We further sought to investigate whether the theory-based SCT component was superior to an attention control education intervention. We found that recruitment was successful, though measures to improve retention in a future definitive trial are needed. Attrition over the intervention and follow-up periods were improved compared with our previous exercise trial.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The programme resulted in significant improvements in walking endurance and speed for both groups. There was a moderate effect (Hedges&#x02019; G 0.50) for 6MWT at 36&#x02009;weeks which is supported by a secondary analysis of those with data for three of four assessment points which demonstrated there was a significant effect in favour of the exercise plus SCT groups compared with the exercise plus control education group at weeks 12 and 36. This supports the preliminary sustained efficacy of the intervention and we propose progressing to a definitive intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e250" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016336.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e251" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016336.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank MS Ireland for their assistance with recruitment and running this trial.
