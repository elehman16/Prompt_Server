The number-needed-to-treat was 2 to achieve any improvement in incontinence symptoms, and 5 to attain significant improvement. Compared to controls, participants in the combined intervention reported an adjusted mean 2.05 point (95% CI 0.87 to 3.24) greater improvement on the ICIQ from baseline to 3-month follow-up.

Media campaigns, brochures and public awareness lectures attempt to destigmatise incontinence and increase help-seeking, but the effectiveness of these initiatives for reaching their target population remains unknown.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Transmission of public health education via community organisations is an unexplored strategy for improving urinary symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Data from randomised trials are needed to determine whether the delivery of an evidence-based continence intervention via community organisations is an effective method for treating incontinence.</p><p>The primary objective of this cluster randomised controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of the three experimental continence promotion interventions against a control intervention on urinary symptom improvement in older women with untreated incontinence recruited from community organisations. A second objective was to determine whether changes in incontinence-related knowledge, attitudes and new uptake of risk-modifying behaviours explain improvements in incontinence. We hypothesised that continence education combined with evidence-based self-management would yield the greatest improvement in incontinence symptoms, measured at the level of the individual, 3&#x02005;months postintervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and oversight</title><p>A four arm, parallel-group, controlled, cluster randomised trial was conducted. The study design, recruitment methods and interventions have been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Clustering was at the level of the community organisation, from whence participants were recruited. The choice of a cluster design served to prevent contamination between participants in the same community organisation. The trial was designed by two of the authors and was overseen by the full investigator team, which had full access to the data. The data were collected at community organisations across the UK. All participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population and recruitment</title><p>Inclusion criteria for community organisations included any organisation throughout the UK that consented to participate in the trial between November 2010 and September 2012. A community organisation was loosely defined as any not-for-profit group of individuals with a shared interest. These included interest and charity groups, seniors&#x02019; housing groups, women's lobby groups and Asian caregiver associations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Organisations were contacted strategically by convenience sampling, word of mouth and referral. A research coordinator approached community organisations to join the trial by telephone, email and newspaper advertising.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for participants were women aged 60&#x02005;years and older who reported urinary incontinence at least once weekly on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), and who were not under active treatment for incontinence. For privacy reasons, many community organisations were uncomfortable screening their members for incontinence in advance, so eligibility to participate in the trial could only be ascertained by the research coordinator on the day of delivery of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Eligibility to participate in the trial was established by asking all attendees at the workshop to complete a baseline screening questionnaire on arrival. At this time, a study information sheet and a consent form were distributed to all participants. All women, regardless of eligibility or desire to enrol in the trial, were permitted to stay for the workshop. Only those women who wished to enrol in the trial submitted the signed consent form to the workshop facilitator following the delivery of the intervention, however all attendees were encouraged to submit the baseline screening questionnaire even if they were continent or did not wish to participate in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The interventions were applied at the level of each cluster. The three experimental interventions to be tested were continence education, self-management including the distribution of an evidence-based risk factor reduction tool for incontinence, and a combined intervention that included both components. The sham control intervention was a lecture on health promotion for older women that addressed topics other than incontinence. All interventions were delivered once in group format to 8&#x02013;16 women by the same facilitator at a venue of the organisation's choosing, and lasted 60&#x02013;90&#x02005;min. A slide presentation with a pre-established script prepared for the facilitator was delivered at each workshop.</p><p>The continence promotion intervention incorporated elements of constructivist learning that challenged older adults&#x02019; erroneous beliefs about accepting incontinence as a normal part of ageing, and aimed to change attitudes and create new knowledge about the different types, aetiology, risk factors and treatment options for urine loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The self-management workshop reviewed the self-management theory in an interactive format, and provided a customised evidence-based self-management programme for risk factor modification for incontinence to each participant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The programme targeted pelvic floor muscle weakness, obesity, consumption of caffeinated beverages, smoking, vision loss and constipation, with instructions on how to keep a bladder diary to help monitor symptoms. The content of the combined intervention condensed elements from the continence promotion workshop along with the self-management theory, and provided the customised self-management tool to participants. The control intervention addressed other non-bladder-related aspects of older women's health such as memory problems, polypharmacy, osteoporosis, nutrition, physical fitness and vision impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the participant's global impression of improvement in incontinence symptoms, measured at 3&#x02005;months postintervention by telephone interview using the patient's global impression of improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire. The PGI-I is a validated, single-item global rating of change scale that asks the patient to describe how their incontinence condition is now compared to how it was prior to the intervention (very much better, much better, a little bit better, no change, a little bit worse, much worse and very much worse).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> The primary outcome, any improvement, was defined as a rating of a little bit better, much better or very much better. A secondary outcome, significant improvement, was defined as much better or very much better. The ICIQ, which measures the frequency, severity and bother from incontinence was used at baseline to screen participants for inclusion to the trial, and was repeated at follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> The ICIQ diagnostic item was used by participants to describe the type of incontinence at baseline. A pre-8-item and post-8-item questionnaire on knowledge and attitudes towards incontinence was administered at baseline and at 3-month follow-up, as were risk factors and behaviours related to incontinence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Risk factors and behaviours included performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises three times weekly (yes, no), daily consumption of one cup or more of tea or coffee (yes, no), fluid intake &#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;L/day (yes, no), weight and height (self-report) and smoking status (yes, no). At 3-month follow-up participants were asked whether they had sought treatment for urine leakage during the past 3&#x02005;months. All follow-up interviews were performed by the research coordinator, who was blinded to participant identification.</p><p>The original study protocol sought to examine reductions in urinary frequency as measured on a bladder diary and reductions in the cost of pad use as primary and secondary outcomes respectively. However, as soon as recruitment for the trial started it became apparent that the distribution of bladder diaries and the objective measurement of pad use preintervention would not be possible. This occurred as a result of privacy concerns expressed by participating community organisations for revealing and sharing their members&#x02019; names and contact information with the research team prior to the delivery of the workshops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> The PGI-I was therefore used as the revised primary measure of effectiveness from the onset of the trial. Data on self-efficacy for managing incontinence were also collected, but are not reported in this article due to problems with comprehension of the visual analogue response scale during the 3-month telephone follow-up that occurred non-differentially among participants in all arms of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Group allocation occurred by non-stratified randomisation in blocked groups of four of consenting organisations that agreed to host a workshop. An independent statistician at a distant study site was responsible for randomisation using computer-generated random digits. Community organisations were informed that one of four workshops would be delivered on health topics of interest to older women, but not which one. In this way, group allocation was concealed from both the clusters and the individual participants, who were invited by the host organisation to attend a &#x02018;Women's Health Workshop&#x02019;. The research coordinator remained unaware of group allocation at the time each community organisation was recruited to the trial because she was only informed which workshop to prepare for each organisation several days before each workshop. The trial is considered open-label because both the research facilitator who delivered the intervention and the participants who received it were aware of which intervention was being delivered.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>The trial was designed to detect a minimal 35% difference in the number of participants reporting any improvement (very much better, much better and a little bit better on the PGI-I) between the experimental and control conditions, assuming a rate of improvement in the control condition as high as 20%, with 80% power and &#x003b1; 0.05 two sided (n=34). Using an inflation factor of 1.65 to account for an anticipated maximum intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.05 and unequal cluster size yielded a recruitment target of 56 participants per group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Differences in baseline characteristics between the four groups were determined. To assess the primary outcome we estimated the unadjusted risk difference (prevalence of the outcome) and 95% CI via generalised estimating equations (GEEs) for participants who reported any improvement on the PGI-I. We repeated the same analysis for those who reported significant improvement. GEEs with an identity link and an exchangeable correlation structure were used to account for possible correlation between women in the same organisation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> To adjust for the imbalance in potential confounders in the groups at baseline, additional analyses were conducted using multivariable logistic regression estimated via GEE with an exchangeable correlation structure. Potential confounders included age and baseline incontinence severity (ICIQ score) as continuous predictors, and living alone, depression, heart disease, falls, arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, educational status and general health perception as dichotomous predictors. Both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. For the ITT analysis, participants with missing data were assumed to have no change in incontinence status at 3-month follow-up. The number needed to treat was calculated as the inverse of the difference in absolute event rates between the experimental and control groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> We report intracluster (intracommunity organisation) correlation coefficients (ICC) from the marginal model using GEE with assumed exchangeable correlation structure and robust SEs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> In cases where an ICC&#x0003c;0 was detected, we assumed a correlation structure of independence, but still used the robust variance estimator. The robust variance estimator is robust to misspecification of the correlation structure, so SEs, CIs and p values are still correct. To estimate adjusted mean group differences in ICIQ scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up, we used GEE with a Gaussian regression model for continuous outcomes and followed the same procedure outlined above.</p><p>Improvements in incontinence-related knowledge by intervention type for proportions of individuals responding correctly to each knowledge questionnaire item at baseline compared to 3-month follow-up were estimated using McNemar's test for matched pair analysis. Rates of improvement in self-reported risk modifying behaviours for incontinence were calculated, along with 95% CIs. Differences in improvement rates between the intervention and the control groups were compared using Fisher's exact test using a PP analysis. A difference in response for each health behaviour item that indicated adoption of a new risk modifying behaviour was defined as a positive change at a 3-month follow-up compared to baseline. Reduced coffee and tea intake refer to individuals who reduced their consumption to a single cup per day or less. Weight loss was determined by a positive response to the question, &#x0201c;Has your weight changed (yes, no) and if so, how much do you now weigh?&#x0201d; and evidence of self-reported current weight lower than self-reported weight at baseline. All statistical analyses were run using RStudio V.0.97.310.0, an integrated development environment for R.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study participants and follow-up</title><p>Four hundred and twenty different community organisations were approached over an 18-month period to participate in the trial. Of these, 17% consented and succeeded in hosting an intervention, yielding 71 clusters that were randomised. Approximately one-quarter of the groups contacted refused; 2% expressed interest but were unable to organise a workshop; and a little over half failed to give any response although most of them had been followed up and had received extra information on the project.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

We believe the results have wide external validity as the community groups included women with varied educational levels and wide socioeconomic status.</p><p>The results of this study confirm findings from previous randomised trials suggesting a positive effect of continence education and self-monitoring strategies on urinary symptom improvement in untreated incontinent individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29 R30 R31 R32 R33">28&#x02013;33</xref> However all previous trials invited participants for clinical assessments prior to the delivery of the intervention, or involved individualised education sessions. The current trial delivered group continence interventions without medical or nursing evaluations, in a true public health approach, to both continent and incontinent women as part of the regular activities offered by each community organisation. Rates of improvement reported in this trial on the PGI-I were similar to or exceeded those reported in other studies using self-help booklets, in the range of 50%. Owing to the nature of recruitment and delivery of the intervention via community organisations, bladder diaries and pad tests could not be collected preintervention. The results of our trial can therefore not be directly compared to other trials that used more objective measures of symptom improvement.</p><p>Other limitations also apply. Owing to the nature of recruiting potential participants, individuals could not be screened and enrolled in the trial prior to randomisation of the clusters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> The result was an imbalance between groups, accounted for by analyses that took into account group differences in age, health status and baseline incontinence severity. The trial was not designed to measure the dose-response of knowledge acquisition and behaviour change on urinary symptom improvement. Thus only crude, dichotomous self-reported measures of behaviour change were collected and should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Relevance to the discipline</title><p>The value of continence promotion interventions likely reflects the delivery method as well as the quality of the content. Group interventions that deliver continence education, self-management information or a combination of the two will improve incontinence symptoms in 59%, 41% and 66% of recipients, respectively. It is surprising that the self-management intervention alone was not associated with a significant improvement compared to sham control in this trial. This can potentially be explained by the fact that continence education was completely omitted from the self-management workshop, whereas some information on bladder functioning was provided to participants during the initial work that tested the self-management tool.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Implementation of community-based programmes that promote behavioural techniques as first-line management for incontinence support evidence for the superior efficacy and tolerability of conservative management approaches over a pharmacological treatment for incontinence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> As &#x02018;silent sufferers&#x02019; become better informed that effective strategies exist for improving urinary symptoms, patient demand for care will likely increase. Almost 20% of women made an appointment to discuss urine leakage with a health professional in the 3&#x02005;months following receipt of the continence education intervention. Evidence-based guidelines exist for physicians to evaluate and manage urinary incontinence when first-line behavioural strategies fail, and will need to be more frequently applied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>In conclusion, continence education combined with self-management delivered via community organisations to untreated older women with incontinence leads to symptom improvement in one of every two recipients. At the current time, the majority of older women with incontinence do not seek care, and either self-manage their symptoms inappropriately or use protection to palliate urine leakage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4">1&#x02013;4</xref> As incontinence is associated with multimorbidity and other deleterious health effects, results from this trial provide strong justification for public health outreach via community organisations to reduce urine leakage among untreated individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e201" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004135.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e202" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004135.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of Mira Jabbour and Francine Giroux for their expert help with database management and the data analyses.
