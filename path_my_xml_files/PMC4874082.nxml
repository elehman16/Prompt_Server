Numerous drugs such as tramadol, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists, opiates, ketanserin, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, steroids, 6HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists have been proposed for the treatment of postoperative shivering.

On arrival in the operating room, baseline heart rate (HR), BP, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and body temperature (axillary, tympanic membrane temperature) were recorded. A large bore intravenous cannula was inserted. Operating room temperature was maintained at 22&#x000b0;C.</p><p>All patients were administered injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg and fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over a period of 5 min before induction of anesthesia. Propofol 1% was titrated to loss of verbal response. Tracheal intubation was facilitated using inj. succinylcholine chloride 2m/kg as a bolus dose. A loading dose of inj. atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was given after confirming the correct position of the tracheal tube using EtCO<sub>2</sub> and presence of bilateral equal air entry on auscultation. Anesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub> O:O<sub>2</sub> 6:3, intravenous infusion of propofol at 50-150 &#x003bc;g/kg/min and repeated doses of atracurium 0.1 mg/kg given every 15-20 min. Injection fentanyl 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg was repeated after 1 h intra-operatively. All patients were covered by surgical drapes throughout the surgery and no active warming was done. Vitals were recorded after every 5 min for the 1<sup>st</sup> h followed by every 10 min for next 2 h. Core temperature was recorded by infrared tympanic membrane thermometer before induction, immediately after induction of anesthesia, thereafter every 30 min until the completion of surgery.</p><p>At the beginning of wound closure, the test drug (prepared by a person not involved in the study), was administered intravenously over a period of 5minutes using a syringe pump. All observations were recorded by a blinded observer.</p><p>At the end of anesthesia, the neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with injection neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg intravenously. Trachea was extubated when respiration was adequate and patient was able to obey verbal commands.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patients received O<sub>2</sub> via venturi mask and were covered with a single cotton blanket. HR, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and tympanic membrane temperature were measured and recorded on admission to recovery room (T<sub>0</sub>), 10 min (T<sub>10</sub>), 20 min (T<sub>20</sub>) and 30 min (T<sub>30</sub>) and then half hourly intervals for 4 h.

Mohta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared the efficacy of tramadol in different doses of 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg with pethidine (0.5 mg/kg) and observed a reduction in the incidence of shivering (9%, 6%, 3%, and 12%, respectively), compared to that in the control group (42%).</p><p>Bhukal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] concluded that prophylactic pre-induction use of low dose pethidine does not have major role in preventing postoperative shivering. Furthermore Zahedi[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] observed superiority of tramadol to pethidine in preventing shivering, due to its earlier onset of action, less untoward consequences and its higher safety when used as an analgesic in the hands of nonanesthetics. Bhatnagar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that shivering was significantly more likely to have ceased in the tramadol group (12 of 15 vs. 4 of 15 cases, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at 10 min after drug administration and this control was better sustained. No patients receiving tramadol had a recurrence of shivering.</p><p>Tramadol, a nonopioid analgesic, inhibits postanesthetic shivering, lowers the thermoregulatory set point, doubles the inter threshold range and reduces the vasoconstriction and shivering threshold at doses of 1 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Clonidine reduces the threshold for shivering and vasoconstriction, and when given at induction reduces postanaesthetic shivering without influencing the core and peripheral body temperature distribution. Dexmedetomidine also reduces the incidence of shivering by the same mechanism,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] though it is 8-10 times more specific for &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors than clonidine.</p><p>We found that all the three study drugs provide prophylaxis against shivering compared to placebo. However tramadol offered maximum efficacy in the prevention of shivering. Though tramadol was associated with higher incidence of nausea compared to clonidine, dexmedetomidine, and placebo, it was mild requiring no treatment in the majority of the patients. Clonidine caused significant postoperative sedation while patients who received tramadol and dexmedetomidine were not sedated compared to clonidine. All the three drugs provided postoperative analgesia with tramadol exhibiting maximum analgesic efficacy. There was no difference in analgesic efficacies of clonidine and dexmedetomidine. Thus, tramadol was found to be the most suitable agent in preventing postanesthesia shivering with the additional benefit of longer analgesic effect and least side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>De Witte</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sessler</surname><given-names>DI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Perioperative shivering: Physiology and pharmacology</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2002</year><volume>96</volume><fpage>467</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11818783</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vanderstappen</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Vandermeersch</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanacker</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Mattheussen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Herijgers</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Aken</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of prophylactic clonidine on postoperative shivering.
