Social media platforms (i.e. Facebook) and text messaging represent potential mediums to promote physical activity. This paper reports the results of a randomized pilot trial evaluating a theory-based (Social Cognitive Theory) multi-component intervention using Facebook and text-messages to promote physical activity among African American women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) were randomly assigned to receive one of two multi-component physical activity interventions over 8&#x000a0;weeks: a culturally-relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based, intervention delivered by Facebook and text message (FI) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14), or a non-culturally tailored print-based intervention (PI) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) consisting of promotion brochures mailed to their home.

Only 36% meet the national recommendation of 150&#x000a0;minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Low physical activity levels are especially worrisome because African American women are disproportionally burdened with medical conditions associated with inactivity, including colon and breast cancers, overweight/obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such disparities require innovative approaches to promote physical activity in this high-risk, underserved population.</p><p>Technology-based platforms (i.e. Internet, mobile phone, social media, text message, etc.) are promising eHealth and mHealth options to help decrease physical activity-related health disparities among African American women. Nationally representative data show that African American adults access the Internet at rates similar to Non-Hispanic Whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. African American adults are more likely to own a mobile phone (87% of African American versus 80% of Whites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and have the highest prevalence of smartphone ownership when compared to other race/ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, African Americans are more likely to use their mobile phones to access social media websites (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and send and receive text messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the high prevalence of Internet, social media, and text message use among African American women, few interventions have used such technologies to deliver culturally relevant physical activity interventions to African American women. Our review of the literature found no studies using social media to promote physical activity exclusively among African American women and only six studies using either a website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or text message-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to promote physical activity in African American women. The lack of culturally-relevant technology-based approaches to promote physical activity among African American women represents a missed opportunity given the high levels of technology use in this population and substantial evidence suggesting that technology-based physical activity promotion efforts are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Existing and commonly used social media and text messaging infrastructures may be especially advantageous for delivering physical activity promotion interventions to African American women. Combined social media and text messaging interventions have been used to successfully promote various health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, dietary behaviors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in previous research and have several advantages compared to traditional face-to-face or mailed print-based physical activity interventions. Advantages include lower participant burden associated with not having to attend in-person intervention sessions and 24-hour access to intervention materials. Moreover, from a public health standpoint, technology-based platforms can provide researchers the ability to reach a large number of people at a relatively low cost; which can ultimately lead to a greater public health impact of physical activity promotion efforts.</p><p>The purpose of the current randomized pilot trial was to evaluate a multi-component, culturally-relevant intervention delivered using Facebook and text-messaging designed to promote physical activity among African American women. The Facebook and text message intervention was based on tenets of Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a behavioral health theory that explains human behavior in a triadic and reciprocal model where one&#x02019;s personal, environmental, and behavioral factors all interact to influence behavior. The Social Cognitive Theory is one of the most frequently used behavioral theories in physical activity research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and was selected as the theoretical background in the current study due to its particular focus on the interaction between one&#x02019;s personal characteristics and his/her social environment: as these are two key factors associated with physical activity behavior in African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, Facebook, the largest and population social media site in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and text messaging were selected as the primary delivery channels for the intervention materials due their popularity and high use among African American women. Given the paucity of published reports using a theory-based technology intervention to promote physical activity among African American women, this study provides important insight regarding the acceptability and feasibility of using social media and text message technologies to promote physical activity in African American women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>An 8-week, 2-arm randomized pilot trial was implemented. Sample size was determined by financial feasibility. Twenty-nine African American women were assigned by the first author using a random number allocation sequence (SPSS, version 21) to receive either a Social Cognitive Theory-based, culturally-relevant physical activity intervention delivered via Facebook and text messaging (hereafter referred to as FI) or to a standard print-based intervention (PI), consisting of non-culturally tailored physical activity promotion brochures developed by the American Heart Association, mailed to their home address. Participants also wore an Omron HJ-720IT pedometer and kept a calendar to track and self-monitor their daily step counts. The Omron HJ-720IT pedometer is a validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] dual-axis acceleration sensor that can be worn (vertically or horizontally) anywhere on the body (i.e., hip, pocket, purse, etc.). The pedometer provides an estimate of: a) total of steps per day, and b) minutes per day of walking at a cadence associated with moderate-intensity physical activity (i.e., &#x0003e;100 steps per minute). This pedometer was selected because it allowed participants to evaluate both their daily step counts and minutes per day of moderate-intensity physical activity so they could compare their activity to the national physical activity guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited in February 2014 from the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. Recruitment strategies included email distribution lists (ex., African American sororities, churches), fliers posted at local businesses, advertisements placed in a local African American newspaper, and postings on a local social event website for African Americans. Facebook advertisements were not used to recruit participants due to both financial restraints and the limited number of participants that could be enrolled in the study (i.e., Facebook advertisements are fee-based and have high reach potential that may have resulted in many more women wishing to participate in the study than financial feasible). Women were eligible for the study if they: a) self-identified as African American and female, b) were insufficiently active (&#x0003c;150&#x000a0;min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity as assessed by the Short Version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire), c) were aged 24&#x02013;49 years, d) had an active Facebook account at the time of eligibility screening, and e) could to read and write in English. Only adult women aged 24&#x02013;49 were recruited because the intervention was tailored to adult-aged African American women of childbearing age and because national data show that social media and text message use declines after the age of 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exclusion criteria included: a) concurrent participation in another physical activity promotion program (research or commercial), b) pregnancy or planned to become pregnant in the next 6&#x000a0;months, and c) a contraindication to exercise as indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) unless written permission was provided for the participant&#x02019;s primary care physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study was approved by the Arizona State University Institutional Review Board. After reading or hearing about the study from recruitment materials, African American women interested in participation contacted study staff via email or telephone. Potential participants were screened for eligibility by telephone using an eligibility screener developed for the current study and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire. Eligible participants were scheduled for their baseline study visit.</p><p>At the baseline study assessment, participants provided informed consent, completed demographic, psychosocial and behavioral questionnaires, and had their height and weight assessed by trained study staff. Participants were then provided an accelerometer and instructed to wear it during all waking hours for the next 7&#x000a0;days. At the end of the 7-day wear period, participants returned their accelerometer to study staff and received $10 for participation. Approximately one week following the accelerometer return, participants were notified via telephone of their group assignment and scheduled for a study orientation visit that would take place the subsequent week. Separate group orientations were held for each study arm as participants were blinded to the differences in physical activity promotion materials between arms (i.e., culturally relevant vs. non-culturally relevant). Participants who were unable to attend their group orientation visit were provided a one-on-one orientation by a trained staff member. The purpose of the orientation session was to give participants a brief overview of the study group they were assigned, provide instructions on how to properly wear the pedometer, and to verify they that the research team had correct contact information on file. The orientation session was also when participants randomized to the FI were added to the study Facebook group.</p><p>Follow-up data collection procedures were similar to baseline procedures, with anthropometric, psychosocial, treatment acceptance, and physical activity data collected approximately one week after the end of the intervention period. Upon return of the accelerometer after the 7-day wear period, participants were provided an additional $15 for study participation. The last participant completed the intervention in June 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Physical activity interventions</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Facebook and text message intervention (FI)</title><p>The FI was comprised four primary intervention components designed to increase moderate-intensity physical activity among participants to the nationally recommended levels of 150&#x000a0;minutes per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These four components targeted one or more of the constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory and included: 1) Weekly physical activity promotion materials posted on the group Facebook wall, 2) Discussion topics and participant engagement on the group Facebook wall, 3) Motivational text messages promoting physical activity, and 4) Adaptive pedometer-based self-monitoring and goal-setting program. Email was also used as a communication channel between study staff and participants (see <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Adaptive pedometer-based self-monitoring and goal setting program</xref> below).</p><sec id="d30e387"><title>Weekly Facebook materials</title><p>Participants randomized to the FI received a Social Cognitive Theory-based, culturally-relevant physical activity promotion intervention delivered through text messages and the social media website Facebook. These culturally relevant-intervention materials were developed specifically for the current study and were informed by the first author&#x02019;s previous research with African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], prominent determinants of physical activity among African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and published literature focused on culturally-tailoring lifestyle interventions to minority populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Specifically, intervention materials: (a) highlighted the low physical activity levels of African American women and associated disease burden (e.g., obesity prevalence and increased risk for chronic disease conditions, including colon cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], (b) addressed prevalent sociocultural norms and barriers to physical activity commonly reported among African American women (e.g., familial and caretaking roles of African American women, lack of social support, hair concerns, and body shape preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), and (c) included images of African American women with varying body sizes and skin tones engaging in physical activity.</p><p>The Facebook group was &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d;, allowing only participants enrolled in the study to view the information posted on the Facebook group wall and view the profiles of other participants who are members of the group. The theory-based, physical activity promotion materials were delivered weekly (every Monday) on the study&#x02019;s Facebook group wall. These materials were electronic print/image-based materials written at the 10th grade reading level or lower and followed a sequential pattern of physical activity-related topics with the overarching goal of increasing physical activity. Specific behavioral components of the Social Cognitive Theory that underpinned the intervention are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Weeks 1&#x02013;6 focused on physical activity adoption by presenting new information and Social Cognitive Theory concepts to study participants each week. Weeks 7&#x02013;8 reviewed and reinforced information presented in the first 6&#x000a0;weeks and focused on maintenance of increased physical activity after the conclusion of the intervention period.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Discussion prompts were posted every Wednesday to the Facebook wall to allow participants time to read and reflect on the week&#x02019;s preceding physical activity promotion posts. The purpose of the weekly discussion topics was for participants to share their personal experiences with physical activity and to give/receive social support for physical activity. Study staff did not engage in dialogue with participants on the group wall beyond posting the weekly discussion topics, as this component of the program was designed to be participant driven. The only exception was one occasion when study staff intervened to correct inaccurate physical activity information posted by a participant.</p></sec><sec id="d30e586"><title>Motivational text messages</title><p>FI participants received three text messages to motivate and promote physical activity each week. These text messages acted as another mechanism of social support and provided: (a) tips on strategies to increase physical activity throughout the day (e.g., &#x0201c;Set aside time today for several 10&#x02013;15 minute walks. Walking 30&#x000a0;minutes at a moderate-intensity on 5&#x000a0;days each week&#x02009;=&#x02009;150 minutes!&#x0201d;), (b) information on how to overcome barriers to physical activity (e.g., &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t let the lack of child care interfere with your physical activity routine. Take a walk with your whole family this weekend&#x0201d;.), (c) reminders of the health benefits of physical activity (e.g., &#x0201c;Physical activity promotes bone health and reduces the risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis&#x0201d;.), and (d) motivational/inspirational tips and quotes to participants (e.g., &#x0201c; &#x02018;Each person must live their life as a model to others&#x02019;. - Rosa Parks&#x0201d;). The text message library consisted of 24 total messages (i.e., 3 text messages per week for 8 weeks) and all participants received the exact same text messages over the duration of the study. Additionally, the first text message delivered each week also informed participants that a new physical activity promotion topic of the week was posted on the group Facebook page. The content of the text messages and frequency of delivery (i.e., 3 messages per week) were derived from our previous work that showed African American women preferred to receive a variety of physical activity-related text messages and that receiving 3 text messages per week was ideal while enrolled in a physical activity promotion program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="d30e594"><title>Adaptive pedometer-based self-monitoring and goal-setting program</title><p>FI participants received weekly individualized step goals and social reinforcement from study staff via email. This component of the study was designed to target the Social Cognitive Theory constructs of self-regulation, reinforcement, and self-efficacy. Individualized step goals were based on an adaptive goal-setting and feedback approach adapted from previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As opposed to a static step goal approach (i.e., goal of 10,000 steps per day), the adaptive approach assumed within-person variability and used this variance to adjust step goals each week to ultimately increase daily physical activity over time. Specifically, the adaptive goal-setting and feedback algorithm was based on a rank-order percentile algorithm. This percentile algorithm required: 1) continuous and repeated measurements of physical activity (i.e., steps per day), 2) ranking steps per day from lowest to highest, and 3) calculation of a new weekly step goal based on a 60th percentile criterion. For example, if a participant reported the following daily steps during a week of the study (ranked from highest to lowest): 2500, 3500, 4200, 4500, 5100, 5500, 6000, her step goal for the next week (i.e., next 7 days) of the study would be 5100 (based on the 60th percentile of the previous week&#x02019;s steps). We selected to use an adaptive approach with the FI group because it allowed for study staff to individually tailor step count goals to participants. Rather than asking all participants to immediately increase their step counts to a static goal of 8,000-10,000 steps per day during the first week of the study (as is frequently done in physical activity promotion research), the adaptive approach provided participants with more realistic step goals to achieve because they were based on their performance. This allowed study staff to slowly increase step counts each week (given participants were able to achieve their step goals) with the ultimate goal of increasing daily steps the general public health goal of 8,000-10,000 steps per day.</p><p>Participants emailed or texted study staff their daily step counts from the previous week on Sunday of each week. While the method of reporting weekly step counts to study staff was based on participant preference, almost all of the participants reported by email (only one participant regularly reported her weekly step counts to study staff via text message). Study staff then calculated each participant&#x02019;s new step goal for the upcoming week and provided them brief standardized feedback and reinforcement via email on their progress (e.g., &#x0201c;Last week you achieved your step goal on 4 days &#x02014;let&#x02019;s see if you can meet your step goal on all 7 days this week. Your new minimum step count goal for the week is 8000 steps per day&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Last week you achieved your step goal on all 7 days. Congratulations! Keep up the hard work and see if you can continue to meet your goal again on all 7 days this week. Your new minimum step count goal for the week is 9,000 steps per day).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Print-based Intervention (PI)</title><sec id="d30e607"><title>Mailed print-based component</title><p>Participants randomized to the PI served as the comparison group of the study and were mailed four non-culturally tailored, self-help booklets promoting physical activity and health produced by the American Heart Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

The GT3X+ assesses time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity physical activity, as well as provides an estimate of daily step counts. Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on their right hip during waking hours for a consecutive 7-day period at both baseline and 8-weeks. Accelerometer data were downloaded and processed with ActiLife Software (version 6.10.0) using a 60-second epoch without the low frequency extension. To be considered as a valid assessment (and subsequently included in data analysis), participants were required to wear the accelerometer for at least 10 hours per day on at least four days during the seven day wear period. Non-wear time was defined as 60 minutes of consecutive zero counts with allowance of a 2 minute spike tolerance of less than 100 counts per minute. Cut-points developed from controlled laboratory experiments were used to estimate minutes of activity performed at various intensity levels: sedentary (0&#x02013;99 counts/minute) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], light (100&#x02013;759 counts/minute), moderate-lifestyle (760&#x02013;1951 counts/minute) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], moderate (1952&#x02013;5725 counts/minute), and vigorous (&#x0003e;5725 counts/minute) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Additionally, accelerometer data were analyzed to provide an estimate of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity performed in bouts of ten minutes or greater (which coincides with the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/">http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/</ext-link>). These ten-minute activity bouts were defined as achieving the aforementioned cut-point for moderate-intensity activities or greater (i.e., &#x0003e;1951 counts/minutes) for at least ten consecutive minutes, with allowance of one to two minutes below these thresholds during the ten minute period.</p><p>As a secondary physical activity measure, participants completed the 2-item Exercise Vital Sign questionnaire developed by Kaiser Permanente at Southern California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This questionnaire asks participants to report their frequency (days per week) and duration (minutes per day) of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (e.g., like a brisk walk) during the past week. The questionnaire is scored by multiplying the days x minutes of physical activity performed to create an estimate of minutes per week of at least moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The Exercise Vital Sign has been previously validated for accuracy against national population-based physical activity surveillance surveys (i.e., NHANES and the California BRFSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Social Cognitive Theory variables</title><p>Self-efficacy for physical activity was assessed by the Exercise Confidence Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Results showed several promising outcomes, including decreased sedentary behavior, increased light and moderate-lifestyle intensity physical activity, and enhanced self-regulation and social support from family for physical activity. Moreover, favorable findings regarding acceptability and feasibility lend further support for the approach to promote physical activity among African American women. Results provide important preliminary insight regarding the use of existing social media infrastructures and mobile phone technology to deliver culturally-relevant physical activity interventions to African American women.</p><p>While participants in both intervention groups failed to demonstrate significant increases in accelerometer measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, FI participants decreased their sedentary time and increased time spent in light- and moderate-lifestyle physical activity over the 8-week study when compared to PI participants. Moreover, the between group effect sizes for these physical activity outcomes were especially promising for the FI (i.e. <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.251 for sedentary behavior, <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.263 for light physical activity, and <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.419 for moderate-lifestyle physical activity) as they were substantially larger than the mean effect size (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.19) reported in a recent meta-analysis of physical activity interventions for healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The reduction in sedentary behavior and increases in lower-intensity physical activity are particularly relevant considering FI participants self-reported increases in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (as measured by the Exercise Vital Sign Questionnaire). These findings suggest that FI participants actually increased their overall physical activity; however, contrary to their perceptions, the intensity of the physical activity performed was lower than the threshold of moderate-intensity according to accelerometers. This outcome suggests the need for inclusion of an objective measure of physical activity and an intervention component to show participants how it &#x0201c;feels&#x0201d; to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity. Example strategies may include having participants walk at a moderate-intensity with study staff during their baseline assessment or engage in a brief moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity session.</p><p>The seasonal time period in which the study was conducted may have also played a role in the null accelerometer measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity outcomes, as well as the slight decline in daily pedometer-measured steps performed during the last two weeks of the 8-week study. The study was conducted in Phoenix, Arizona during March &#x02013; June (i.e., late spring/early summer months), a period when daily high temperatures increased dramatically. The average daily high temperature during the two-week period in which participants wore accelerometers at baseline was 82 degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the average daily high temperature during the follow-up data collection period was 103 digress Fahrenheit. This approximate 21 degree rise in temperature may have influenced physical activity levels among participants as temperature during the follow-up assessment period may have been too hot for most women to perform outside activities or to walk places. Temperature and heat-related concerns may have been further accentuated in our sample as many African American women identify sweating and sun exposure as prominent barriers to physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>Both intervention groups reported significant increases in self-regulation for physical activity over the 8-week study; however, the FI group reported significantly greater enhancements in self-regulation than the PI group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). We attribute the enhancements in self-regulation in both study groups to the pedometer and self-monitoring components of the intervention. Further, the finding that FI participants reported significantly greater increases in self-regulation than the PI group suggest that the FI intervention components were more effective in promoting self-regulation for physical activity; however, due to design limitations, we are unable to determine the specific influence each of the FI intervention components (i.e., the culturally-relevant physical activity promotion materials or adaptive pedometer-based self-monitoring approach) had on this Social Cognitive Theory construct.</p><p>We also observed a significant increase in social support from family over the 8-week study among FI participants. This finding was encouraging and suggests that participants may have used some of the social support strategies presented FI materials foster support for physical activity among family members (i.e., Week 4 included a specific topic on how to facilitate social support for physical activity from family members). Conversely, the lack of pre-post intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy for both intervention groups was unexpected. However, comparable null outcomes have been reported in previous website-based interventions promoting physical activity among African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Potential explanations for the lack of change in this variable may be associated with the relatively high scores reported by participants at baseline, which limited room for improvement, or that as participants began to increase their physical activity levels they realized that physical activity was more difficult than they anticipated. Another unanticipated outcome was that participants in the PI reported greater enhancements in outcome expectations for physical activity than participants in the FI. This perhaps speaks to the high quality of the content in the print-materials the PI received and indicates the need for the FI materials to be refined to further address this Social Cognitive Theory construct.</p><p>Findings regarding the acceptability and feasibility of the Facebook and text-message approach to promote physical activity were generally positive. Self-reported satisfaction and treatment acceptance of the FI was high, with all reporting that they gained physical activity-related knowledge from the weekly Facebook posts and all indicating they would recommend the study to a friend. Moreover, an overwhelmingly majority of FI participants (i.e. 93%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) reported they were &#x0201c;motivated&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very motivated&#x0201d; to continue to be physically active after the end of the study. We suggest that the favorable acceptance among FI participants was associated with the culturally-relevant approach used to promote physical activity, as previous research suggest culturally-relevant behavior change interventions are advantageous in increasing the receptivity and perceived salience of the targeted behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Further, the use of pre-existing communication channels (i.e. Facebook and text messages) to deliver the physical activity intervention likely contributed to the high participant acceptance, as it minimized participant burden associated with accessing/obtaining the intervention materials. An interesting outcome was that despite only 53% of PI participants indicating they gained knowledge from the print-based program and less than half (47%) reported being &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; with the program, the majority (87%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) indicated they would recommend the intervention to a friend. We hypothesize that this discrepancy may have been influenced by social desirability as PI participants likely wanted to provide favorable information regarding the intervention to study staff.</p><p>Treatment receipt also supported the feasibility of using Facebook and text messages to deliver a culturally-relevant physical activity program to African American women. However, despite high fidelity of intervention delivery, a disappointing outcome was the decline in participant receipt of intervention materials during the second half of the study (i.e., 100% for the first 4 weeks of the study vs. 64-86% during week 5&#x02013;8). Participant interaction on the group Facebook wall was also lower than expected with the average number of 5.5 participant comments on the weekly discussion topic post. We speculate that modest participant engagement on the Facebook wall may have contributed the non-significant change in social support for physical activity from friends, as we anticipated this component would penetrate and enhance this Social Cognitive Theory construct. However, since the social support survey did not differentiate between study &#x0201c;Facebook friends&#x0201d; and friends outside of the study, the exact role of participant engagement on the Facebook wall cannot be ascertained. These results indicate the need for additional strategies to promote and maintain participant engagement with study activities as we anticipated participants would be more interactive on the group Facebook page. Examples strategies for future research may include adding an in-person component at the beginning of the study for participants to interact and get to know each other prior to expecting them to interact on the Facebook page or modifying the physical activity promotion material to be more visually appealing and/or more interactive by incorporating short video and/or audio clips to complement the print-based materials.</p><p>Several study limitations must be noted. Due to the small sample size, we were likely underpowered to detect significant pre-post intervention changes in various physical activity, anthropometric, and psychosocial outcomes. However, the primary focus of the study was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of using Facebook and text-messages to deliver a culturally-relevant physical activity program&#x02014;for which the sample size is appropriate. Additionally, the sample was comprised of a convenience sample of highly educated African American women (i.e., all had a high school degree and most had a college degree) living in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to African American women of different socioeconomic backgrounds or those residing in other geographical regions. Similarly, Facebook and text message materials were written at a 10th grade reading level or lower. In future research, we plan to reduce the reading level of study materials (i.e., to a 5th grade reading level) to enhance readability and improve the potential for broader dissemination of the program. We also did not assess frequency of Facebook use or level of Facebook knowledge/skill during recruitment efforts. Including such measures will be considered in future research as more frequent Facebook use and higher knowledge on how to navigate the Facebook website may have influenced study outcomes.</p><p>Another limitation was that text messages were not individually tailored according to participant-specific characteristics. All participants received the exact same text messages over the 8-week study. Given the content of the some of the text messages may not have been relevant to all women enrolled in the study (e.g., one text message focused on overcoming childcare barriers to physical activity and only half of FI participants had children), individually tailoring messages to address participant-specific characteristics and barriers to physical activity will be included in future studies. The study also included an active control group that received a non-tailored physical activity intervention. Inclusion of a passive control group would have been beneficial to compare changes in physical activity levels among women not receiving physical activity promotion materials over the 8-week intervention period. However, inclusion of a 3rd group was not possible due to funding limitations. We also note that two different pedometer-based self-monitoring approaches were used in the intervention groups; limiting our ability to determine the exact influence each of these strategies had on study outcomes. The multi-component nature of the Facebook and text message study arm also limits our ability to determine which aspects of the study were beneficial to behavior change (e.g., delivery channel, cultural adaption, combination of both). Future research and larger studies are needed to explore the influence that each of these components had on the physical activity and associated psychosocial outcomes of the study. Lastly, the study focused on relatively short-term physical activity and psychosocial outcomes following the 8-week intervention period. Future studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term behavioral and psychological outcomes (i.e., 6 and 12 months post-intervention) following the intervention period as long-term adoption of healthy behaviors are imperative to chronic disease prevention.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the current study has several strengths. A limited number of studies have used a social media-based approach to deliver a physical activity promotion intervention to African American women. Given the favorable findings, future research is warranted to further examine the use of these technology-based platforms to promote physical activity in African American women. Second, we used a culturally-relevant approach when developing the physical activity promotion materials that addressed prevalent sociocultural norms, traditions, and barriers associated with physical activity among African American women. Culturally-tailoring intervention activities have the potential to increase the acceptability and uptake of a behavioral interventions, which can ultimately lead to positive changes in the targeted and behavioral outcome of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Moreover, we grounded study activities in behavioral health theory (i.e., Social Cognitive Theory), which can also increase the potential efficacy of the physical activity program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Use of accelerometers to measure physical activity was a strength. Accelerometers are advantageous because they are not subject common issues associated with questionnaire or survey assessment such as recall bias, same source bias, or the necessity for high literacy and/or numeracy levels to comprehend questions and estimate time spend in physical activity. The high adherence of accelerometer wear among study participants (i.e. 97%) also strengthened the credibility of the physical activity outcomes. A final strength was the 100% retention of randomized participants, especially given the moderate-to-high attrition commonly reported by physical activity studies with African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and studies using technology-based mediums to promote physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study provides important insight regarding the acceptability and feasibility of using social media and text messages to promote physical activity in African American women. Overall, study findings suggest that that culturally-relevant, Facebook and text message delivered physical activity program was associated with a reduced sedentary behavior, increased light and moderate-lifestyle physical activity, and was well-received among study participants. The lack of significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity calls for future research to further explore the use of these technologies to successfully promote physical activity. Similarly, due to the limited amount of research on this topic, there is the potential for additional qualitative research to explore the role technology-based platforms can play in promoting physical activity among African American women. As time and technology continue to progress at a rapid pace, researchers developing and implementing physical activity programs for African American women should stay abreast of emerging technology trends in order to adapt the delivery methods of their culturally-relevant behavior change programs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FI</term><def><p>Facebook and text message intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>Print-based intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RPJ conceived the study, participated in the design and coordination, performed data collection and analysis, and helped to draft the manuscript.
