The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and tolerability profiles of DA-2802 were compared to those of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Viread<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in healthy subjects. A randomized, open-label, single-dose study was conducted in 36 healthy subjects using a two-treatment, two-period, and two-sequence crossover design. Subjects received a single oral dose of 319 mg DA-2802 or 300 mg TDF, during each period, with a 7-day washout. Serial blood samples were collected pre-dosing and up to 72 hours post-dosing in each period, for determination of serum tenofovir concentration, which was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A non-compartmental method was used to obtain PK parameters of tenofovir. For comparison between the two tenofovir disoproxil salts, the 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) of geometric mean ratios of DA-2802 to TDF for the maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) were determined. The tolerability profiles of tenofovir were assessed by evaluation of adverse events and vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. The serum tenofovir concentration&#x02013;time profiles of DA-2802 or TDF were comparable in 32 subjects who completed the study. In both profiles, a two-compartmental elimination with first-order elimination kinetics in the terminal phase was reported in a few subjects, showing a secondary peak in the initial phase of elimination. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of DA-2802 to TDF was 0.898 (0.815&#x02013;0.990) for C<sub>max</sub> and 0.904 (0.836&#x02013;0.978) for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>. There were no clinically significant findings in the tolerability assessments. DA-2802 showed comparable PK characteristics and tolerability profiles to TDF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>phase I clinical trial</kwd><kwd>chronic hepatitis B virus infection</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tenofovir is a nucleotide analog that exhibits an antiviral effect via inhibition of various viral DNA polymerases, resulting in termination of viral replication.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Tenofovir exists in a very polar dianion state at physiological pH,<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> leading to poor bioavailability.

Subjects who had a history of allergic reactions to tenofovir or had previously participated in other clinical studies within 3 months prior to the day of study drug administration were excluded from the study. Eligible 36 healthy male subjects aged between 20 and 50 (both inclusive) years were randomized to receive one tablet of 319 mg tenofovir disoproxil orotate (DA-2802; Dong-A ST Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) or one tablet of 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Viread<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Gilead Sciences, Inc., CA, USA) in Period 1 with 200 mL of water and vice versa in Period 2 after a week of washout. All subjects were hospitalized on the day before study drug administration and were required to fast up to 10 hours before dosing. Subjects were restricted from taking any concomitant medication or beverages containing xanthine or alcohol.</p><p>Serial blood samples (7 mL) were obtained for determination of serum tenofovir concentration at pre-dosing and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Tolerability assessments were based on vital signs, physical examinations, and adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of serum tenofovir concentration</title><p>Serum concentrations of tenofovir were determined using a validated method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. The lower and upper limits of quantification were 5 and 2,000 ng/mL, respectively, and the calibration curve of the method was linear over this range. Where necessary, samples were diluted with normal human serum to bring the concentration within the calibration range. Calibration standards were prepared by spiking blank plasma samples with known amounts of tenofovir ranging from 5 to 2,000 ng/mL. The within-run accuracy (expressed as the percentage difference from the theoretical concentration) of the quality control samples used during the sample analysis ranged from &#x02212;10.7% to &#x02212;2.0%, with a within-run precision (expressed as the coefficient of variation) of &#x02264;4.0%. The between-run accuracy ranged from &#x02212;8.0% to 0.4%, with a between-run precision of &#x02264;7.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic evaluation and statistical analyses</title><p>For determination of the tenofovir PK parameters between the two salt forms, a non-compartmental analysis was conducted. By implementation of Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (version 6.3; Certara USA Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA), the following PK parameters were derived: maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) (ie, T<sub>max</sub>); area under the concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, where t is the last time point with a quantifiable concentration) and from 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>); the terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>); and the apparent clearance (CL/F). The observed concentrations and times were used to determine the C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of tenofovir. The AUCs were calculated using the linear trapezoidal method, and t<sub>1/2</sub> was calculated as the natural logarithm of 2 divided by the elimination rate constant, which was calculated as the slope of the terminal data from the semilogarithmic plot by linear regression.</p><p>The PK parameters of log-transformed C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> of tenofovir were compared between the two salt forms based on the two one-sided tests procedure by mixed-model analyses of variance for the crossover design &#x02013; considering sequence, treatment, and period as fixed effects and the subjects nested within the sequence as a random effect. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of geometric mean ratios (GMR) of the orotic acid to fumaric acid salt forms for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> were calculated for statistical comparison between the two salts.

The age range of the study participants was 21&#x02013;42 years, and the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) of weight, height, and BMI was 70.4&#x000b1;7.4 kg, 175.4&#x000b1;5.5 cm, and 22.9&#x000b1;2.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>PK characteristics</title><p>Tenofovir was absorbed rapidly after a single oral administration of orotic acid and fumaric acid salt form of tenofovir disoproxil to 32 healthy male subjects with the T<sub>max</sub> of the tenofovir ranging between 0.5 and 2.0. The mean serum tenofovir concentrations versus time profiles almost over-lapped between the two salt forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-11-3171">Figure 1</xref>). After reaching T<sub>max</sub>, tenofovir showed a two-compartmental elimination with first-order elimination kinetics in the terminal phase. During the initial phase of elimination, a few subjects showed a secondary peak in both orotic acid and fumaric acid salt forms of tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-11-3171">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As a result, the 90% CIs of GMR for C<sub>max</sub> and the AUCs between the two salt forms were entirely within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-11-3171">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-11-3171">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>Of the 34 subjects who had received tenofovir disoproxil orotate, 2 (5.9%) reported five AEs during the study. After administration of TDF, 3 (9.4%) of the 32 subjects reported five AEs, which were considered by the investigator to be study drug-related AE. The most frequently reported study drug-related AEs after administration of TDF were fatigue, occurring in two subjects. However, the two subjects who had experienced five AEs after administration of a single oral tenofovir disoproxil orotate were considered to not be related to the study drug.</p><p>After administration of tenofovir disoproxil orotate and TDF, all reported AEs were mild in severity, and there were no deaths or serious AEs that caused withdrawals from the study. There were no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, and ECG tolerability parameters throughout the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we first evaluated the PK of the novel salt form of tenofovir disoproxil after a single oral administration in healthy male subjects. In comparison with those of the currently available fumaric acid salt form (TDF 300 mg), there were no significant differences in the T<sub>max</sub> as well as the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-11-3171">Table 1</xref>), which were within the bioequivalence criteria stated by the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the US Food and Drug Safety.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is significant because such data support the purpose of incrementally modified drug development, which ultimately improves the patient&#x02019;s quality of life by 1) lowering the cost involved in manufacturing process for salt conjugation, which would ultimately be advantageous for the consumers, and 2) improving stability over that of the currently marketed fumarate form by prolonging its shelf life.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It is thus expected that the new orotic acid salt form of tenofovir disoproxil may be used as an alternative therapy to the fumaric acid salt form.</p><p>In line with the previously described tenofovir PK,<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> some individuals showed secondary peaks of various sizes at 6&#x02013;10 hours in both or only in one of the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-11-3171">Figure 2</xref>). The secondary peaks in both the treatment groups were larger than those in one of the treatment groups, suggesting that such phenomenon is caused by the characteristics of the compound rather than the differences in the salt forms. Such compound characteristics may have possibly occurred due to the involvement of enterohepatic circulation. As previously shown, up to 80% of tenofovir is excreted unchanged in urine within 72 hours after dosing.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, the remaining 20% of tenofovir may be subjected to reabsorption via enterohepatic circulation, leading to the secondary peak in some individuals. In addition, due to interindividual variabilities and the relatively small portion of drug eliminated via the enterohepatic route, only a few subjects may have shown this kind of profile.</p><p>When comparing the tenofovir C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> of the two treatment groups, there were approximately three- to fivefold differences between the subjects who showed the highest and the lowest values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-11-3171">Figure 3B</xref>). Such variations in the tenofovir C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> were observed for each individual, regardless of treatment-group differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-dddt-11-3171">Figures S1</xref>), and individual factors may be the cause of the observed variations. Because there were no particularities in either the renal functions or the demographic characteristics among all subjects, and presuming for possibilities in other interindividual variabilities, differences in transporter abundance between the subjects may be suspected. The multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), present on the apical side of the membrane with the role of non-bile salt organic anion excretion, contributes toward hepatobiliary elimination of tenofovir<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> without affecting the intestinal absorption of the total tenofovir equivalents.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Such variations in MRP2 expression might have, therefore, resulted in the interindividual variabilities in exposure. For this speculation to be confirmed, MRP2 genotype information of individual subjects would be supportive, which was not determined in the present study.</p><p>Other limitations are that the study was carried out only in healthy subjects. The PK characteristics of tenofovir disoproxil orotate are still unknown in the patient population with chronic hepatitis B; however, there have been reports that similar PK was observed in the HIV-1-infected patient population when compared to that in healthy subjects.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-3171" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, the new orotic acid salt form of tenofovir disoproxil is expected to have similar PK in the patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The novel orotic acid salt form of tenofovir disoproxil oral formulation (DA-2802 319 mg) showed similar PK characteristics with comparable tolerability profiles as that of the fumaric acid salt form (TDF 300 mg). These similarities of the new salt formulation provide evidence for it being a suitable candidate as an alternative to the existing tenofovir disoproxil for patients with chronic hepatitis B.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-dddt-11-3171"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Spaghetti plots of individual (left) C<sub>max</sub> and (right) AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> for comparison between tenofovir disoproxil orotate (DA-2802 319 mg) and fumarate (TDF 300 mg).</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> C<sub>max</sub>, maximum concentration; AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, area under the concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable concentration.</p></caption><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="dddt-11-3171s1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e408" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The first author (Yu Kyong Kim) received a scholarship from the BK21-plus education program provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea.
