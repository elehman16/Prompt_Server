Secondary outcomes included safety and teamwork climates, and incident reporting. Mixed-effects models adjusted for time effects, age, comorbidity, palliation status and ward admissions.

PCTS increased eLOS in the adjusted intention-to-treat model (OR 1.32, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.10 to 1.58, p=0.003). Conversely, high-fidelity PCTS reduced eLOS (OR 0.79, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.67 to 0.94, p=0.006). High-fidelity PCTS also increased total, high-yield and non-nurse incident reports (incidence rate ratios 1.28&#x02013;1.79, all p&#x0003c;0.002). Sustained PCTS significantly improved safety and teamwork climates over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlighted the potential benefits and pitfalls of ward-level interdisciplinary interventions.

Favourable staff perceptions of care correlate with improved clinical outcomes, including patient survival.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Yet frontline concerns do not feature in national safety initiatives, nor are they a priority at a local level.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Senior leaders remain reluctant to pursue unvetted reports of frontline problems.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Better methods are needed to capitalise on frontline experiences and translate them into organisational action.</p><p>Prospective clinical surveillance systems can promote the systematic identification of safety concerns from a frontline perspective. Embedded observers, or visiting facilitators, work with frontline staff to form a structured record of their experience of care delivery&#x02014;and its consequences. Observational studies suggest this is a more engaging route to improvement than traditional incident reporting.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> The appeal of these systems is clear. They may act at multiple organisational levels: (1) motivating and empowering staff to resolve unit-level issues within their control; (2) recording frontline successes and challenges to build a rich understanding of safety and resilience across the organisation; and (3) engaging leadership in attending to frontline concerns. Nonetheless, prospective clinical surveillance has not yet been tested as an intervention. Its impact on patient and team outcomes is unknown.</p><p>Here, we sought to evaluate prospective clinical <italic>team</italic> surveillance (PCTS), a novel extension of prospective clinical surveillance, on UK medical wards. PCTS combines structured, frontline interdisciplinary briefings with facilitated organisational escalation of the issues they identified, and feedback. PCTS was tested in a pragmatic, cluster controlled trial, assessing its effects on patient outcomes, and staff safety attitudes and behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>We conducted a prospective, interventional, non-randomised stepped wedge trial on seven medical wards at two NHS (National Health Service) hospitals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).

All the approached teams agreed to participate. The order in which wards adopted the intervention was pragmatically guided by local constraints. It would have been counterproductive to insist on a fully randomised implementation schedule. Instead, we sought input from senior ward staff and nursing leadership, trying to identify when they felt they could support the intervention&#x02019;s introduction. In practice, personnel and organisational changes meant that the anticipated leadership support could not be guaranteed. Similar pragmatic approaches have been used in other stepped wedge evaluations.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A schematic of the ward-level implementation schedule is provided in the online&#x000a0;supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 1)</xref>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014333.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 1</title></caption><p>

Exclusion criteria were: (1) less than 50% of the hospital admission spent on the specified ward; (2) discharge to a new skilled care facility (not the patient&#x02019;s previous address) or other hospital; (3) multiple ward transfers; (4) admission to the high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU); (5) elective admission, or direct admission from another hospital; and (6) surgeon-directed care for more than 24&#x02009;hours of the admission. Other studies have used similar criteria to identify the patients whose outcomes might be most affected by service-level interventions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The included patient group made up around 90% of all inpatients on these wards during the study period. Participating teams were teaching teams with attendings (consultants), residents (specialty trainees) and interns (foundation doctors). Interdisciplinary staff also included ward clerks and nurses, who were typically based on a single ward. Doctors were based largely on one ward, but with some patient commitments elsewhere in the hospital. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists worked on multiple wards. Neither managers nor clinical staff had protected time for quality improvement initiatives.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention programme</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Structured team briefing</title><p>The PCTS programme was based on observational studies showing that medical teams can engage in the rapid identification and review of potential adverse events.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 15&#x02013;18</xref> We designed a daily interdisciplinary briefing for structured team self-report on medical wards: the HEADS-UP (Hospital Event Analysis Describing Significant Unanticipated Problems) briefing. HEADS-UP briefings identified clinical and administrative challenges of the preceding 24&#x02009;hours. They centred on the problems identified most commonly in the medical ward setting, as described in a recent, large, observational European study.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Structured team self-report captures the majority of errors documented by a trained observer.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>HEADS-UP briefings were co-developed with frontline clinical staff between October and November 2013. At the request of clinicians, a pro forma was developed with a visual format similar to the WHO&#x02019;s surgical safety checklist<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">(see online supplementary figure 2)</xref>. Best practice recommendations for improvement interventions advise a degree of local flexibility<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>: other teams were able to make minor changes to their unit&#x02019;s pro forma, while retaining the overall format. This flexibility maintains the &#x02018;hard core&#x02019; of the intervention, and permits a &#x02018;softer periphery&#x02019; to maximise its uptake. Briefings ended with a team agreement on how to resolve, or escalate, the concerns that had been discussed. After a short period of supervision by the programme lead (a resident with a 0.75 full time equivalent commitment, working as an &#x02018;embedded researcher&#x02019;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>(SP)), the briefing was devolved to the ward team. Teams introduced daily HEADS-UP briefings between Monday and Friday, at the most appropriate time in their usual workflow. There was no protected time for team training. Briefings could be led by any member of the ward team, from ward clerk to therapist to attending physician.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Facilitation</title><p>The second component of the intervention was facilitation, advancing the issues raised in the HEADS-UP briefings to bring about tangible unit-level and organisational changes. Facilitation helps to make sense of quality improvement interventions, aligning them with their participants and the surrounding context.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It is necessarily opportunistic and malleable, taking advantage of existing organisational levers. Here, it involved (for example) working with frontline teams to identify and document their areas of concern more effectively; championing those concerns in regular meetings with service leaders and safety committees; and following up on subsequent agreed actions when other priorities threatened their resolution. Other studies that have used a facilitator in a similar way have described the role as an &#x02018;<italic>animateur</italic>,&#x02019; bringing on board people over whom he has no direct managerial authority.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Feedback</title><p>The third component of the intervention was feedback to participating teams, managers, governance committees and senior executives. Feedback summarised and disseminated the information collected in the daily briefings, highlighting HEADS-UP performance in each area, common concerns and challenges, and recurrent or unresolved problems that might require additional support. HEADS-UP data were provided on request to service leads, to support their business planning. System changes arising from HEADS-UP were publicised, for example, in existing departmental meetings, and via email and posters. As much as possible, feedback delivery was timely, focused on solution finding, signposted to relevant resources and adopted a non-judgemental approach.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Facilitation and feedback were provided by the programme lead.</p><p>Although described separately here, we hypothesised that the intervention components would be interlinked, in that changes arising from the programme&#x02019;s facilitation and feedback would motivate increasing engagement with HEADS-UP briefings, in turn increasing their ability to bring about change. We anticipated that improvements in interdisciplinary team care effectiveness would be brought about both&#x000a0;by improvements in ward teams&#x02019; function, and&#x000a0;by incremental support service improvements in response to their concerns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Setting</title><p>Characteristics of the two participating institutions are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Most study wards were in a community general hospital in London. Both institutions faced significant challenges during the study period, with significant turnover in senior staff, mounting service pressures and financial restrictions. One hospital was in the process of a merger, and underwent a major inspection by the healthcare regulator (the Care Quality Commission). The other hospital was introducing an electronic health record.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was excess length of stay (eLOS). eLOS was a binary variable, representing an admission more than 24&#x02009;hours above the patient&#x02019;s expected length of stay. Benchmarks for expected length of stay were generated using patient-level Healthcare Resource Groups<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> data from a network of four local hospitals. These hospitals were subject to the same community service restrictions and healthcare economy demands as the study sites. The study design therefore evaluated the extent to which intervention and control wards met this local standard.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included patient-level measures of (1) readmission within 30 days and (2) in-hospital death or death/readmission within 30 days. Ward-aggregate measures included (3) escalation events (referrals to the ICU outreach service, emergency calls and ICU transfers); (4) complications of care (pressure ulcers, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections, and methicillin-resistant&#x000a0;<italic>S.aureus&#x000a0;</italic>[MRSA], methicillin-sensitive&#x000a0;<italic>S.aureus</italic>&#x000a0;[MSSA] and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteraemias); and (5) incident reporting characteristics. Safety and teamwork climates were assessed at baseline and 6&#x02009;months into the intervention period, using the relevant subscales from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Secondary outcomes (and the per protocol analysis described below) were prespecified.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data collection</title><p>Anonymised patient-level and ward-level outcomes were extracted from routinely collected data sets. Potential participants in the HEADS-UP briefings were invited to complete anonymous surveys at baseline and 6&#x02009;months later, either by submitting responses electronically (via Survey Monkey) or via a paper questionnaire. Overall response rates were calculated using contemporaneous staffing rosters.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>Power calculations were conducted for the primary outcome (eLOS) using a recommended methodology for stepped wedge trials.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> As described in detail in the published protocol,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we adopted an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.06, based on the ICCs for length of stay and appropriateness of stay in trials of acute care pathways.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We iterated calculations based on the wards with the highest and lowest baseline eLOS rates.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> With a two-sided p&#x0003c;0.05, a sample size of 7840 patients was needed to detect a 2%&#x02013;14%&#x02009;absolute risk reduction, with a power between 75% and 100%.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This approach to sample size calculations and study power has been used for other stepped wedge trials.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Allocation and blinding</title><p>Individual patients were not recruited separately to the study, so we did not anticipate significant bias due to lack of allocation concealment.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Staff could not be blinded to their ward&#x02019;s assignment, due to the nature of the intervention. Clinical outcome data and escalation of care data were extracted by local administrative staff blinded to the study, as part of their ordinary duties. Hospital peer group data were generated by the data extraction services <italic>CHKS</italic> (Alcester, UK) and <italic>Dr Foster</italic> (London, UK), also blinded to intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Multilevel mixed-effects models (Stata V.14.2) were used to evaluate the intervention&#x02019;s effect on each patient-level and ward-level outcome. This statistical approach accounts for clustering of outcomes within wards, and repeated measurements over time, representing ward-level variance in patient outcomes as a random effect. For the binary patient-level outcomes, binary logistic models were used; for counts data (complications of care and processes of care), we used Poisson loglinear models. Analyses involving eLOS were restricted to those patients who survived to discharge; no patients were excluded because of &#x02018;outlier&#x02019; length of stay. General linear regression models were used to analyse survey data using a difference-in-differences approach<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> with an interaction code for time*intervention at each site (SPSS, V.22). This method evaluated whether changes in survey responses over time differed between PCTS participants and non-participants.</p><p>In addition to the intention-to-treat analysis, we conducted a per protocol analysis, evaluating the effect of briefing implementation fidelity. Based on observations during the pilot period, we described implementation fidelity each month as the product of briefing frequency and engagement. High fidelity required both high briefing frequency and correspondingly intensive documentation by the ward. High frequency was coded if briefings took place on &#x02265;75% working days that month. Monthly engagement was defined as high if teams documented more than the median number of issues. An interaction term &#x02018;frequency*engagement&#x02019; was incorporated into each model, with a code for high fidelity where both engagement and frequency were high. Note that this per protocol analysis, which calculated different implementation fidelity codes for each ward month, allowed for varying fidelity by a single ward team over the course of the study.</p><p>Patient-level outcomes were adjusted for time effects, age, Charlson comorbidity index,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and palliation status, as well as ward admissions. Time effects were specified as a continuous variable coded for each study month.

Among the secondary outcomes, safety and teamwork climates improved with sustained PCTS implementation. High-fidelity PCTS increased both incident reporting by non-nursing staff, and the number of non-falls reports.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the tension between the two analyses. First, faithful attention to quality improvement efforts may indeed result in worse outcomes, perhaps by distracting attention from existing good practice.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This is unlikely to have been the mechanism here: the wards that dedicated most time and effort to the intervention saw improved outcomes. Second, there may have been unmeasured confounders distinguishing between high-fidelity and low-fidelity PCTS teams. Teams that participate more wholeheartedly in trials may be more innovative, with stronger leadership, a readiness for change and better managerial relations.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> It is difficult, therefore, to entirely separate the intervention&#x02019;s effects from the characteristics of the teams that implemented it best. However, the study design mitigated for this, allowing for varying implementation fidelity by a single team across the study period. As the design elicited high-fidelity ward <italic>months</italic> rather than high-fidelity teams per se, unmeasured team characteristics should hold less influence over the results. It is unlikely that our findings were a simple reflection of teams&#x02019; pre-existing practice or fluctuations in their workload.</p><p>The most likely explanation is that the intervention was used differently by high-fidelity and low-fidelity wards. In the linked qualitative analysis, high-fidelity PCTS improved team autonomy in resolving problems, and facilitated managerial resolution where necessary.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> By contrast, low-fidelity teams may have used PCTS simply to record issues with a degree of frustration, without any positive change in their attitudes or behaviours.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Rather than enacting change for themselves, low-fidelity teams perhaps deferred to facilitation and managerial input, believing that&#x000a0;they would be sufficient to address unit-level problems. Previous quality improvement programmes have also inadvertently blurred lines of responsibility.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> While imperfect PCTS implementation might be deleterious, our results suggest that interdisciplinary quality and safety interventions&#x02014;when implemented well&#x02014;remain a viable route to improvement.</p><p>Earlier studies of prospective clinical surveillance did not evaluate an effect on patient outcomes, and so we can only position our work within a broader literature on ward-level interdisciplinary interventions. The variable implementation of these interventions likely contributes to their disputed impact on length of stay.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> Overall, the experience of PCTS implementation mirrored that of other structured team initiatives. Only 62% of mandated interdisciplinary surgical checklists are completed in their entirety.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Similarly, structured bedside rounds may be implemented for only 54% of patients, despite co-creation with frontline staff.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The benefits of these interventions are only identified at high fidelity,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and so optimising their implementation should remain a focus for further research.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s strengths include its pragmatism: the trial had broad eligibility criteria; a typical clinical setting; little additional investment for study recruitment or follow-up; and flexibility with regard to intervention delivery and adherence.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Limitations include the difficult balancing act between trial rigour and implementation effectiveness. Attempts to preserve distinct intervention and control groups may have constrained implementation fidelity, limiting a more natural, collaborative spread of practice. Conversely, contamination between the groups may have reduced the intervention&#x02019;s measurable effect: PCTS-generated organisational support (over which we had no control) was not necessarily directed to areas that first raised concerns. Last, there may have been inadequate adjustment even for known confounders like workload. Ward admissions are an imperfect proxy for workload: demands on staff increase as the numbers of admissions, transfers and discharges all increase.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Ward-level staffing data are rarely available in this detail in the UK.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, PCTS increased eLOS for general medical patients - a worsening of the primary outcome. In contrast, high-fidelity PCTS reduced eLOS, improved safety and teamwork attitudes, and increased high-yield incident reporting. Our results suggest that interdisciplinary interventions can improve care delivery in complex, fluid environments like medical wards. The manner in which these interventions are implemented&#x02014; honouring the spirit of the interventions and replicating their proposed mechanism of actions&#x02014;is vitally important. Suboptimal implementation may have an unexpectedly negative impact on team performance.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014333.supp2</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 2</title></caption><p>
