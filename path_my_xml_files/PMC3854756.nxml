Various therapies for tendonitis have been described; however, none of these therapies results in complete tissue regeneration, and the injury recurrence rate is high even after long recovery periods involving rest and physiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A lesion was induced with collagenase gel in the superficial digital flexor tendon in the center portion of the metacarpal region of eight equines of mixed breed. After two weeks, the lesions of the animals in the treated and control groups were treated through the intralesional administration of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (adMSCs) suspended in platelet concentrate (PC) and with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), respectively. Serial ultrasound analyses were performed every two weeks. After 16&#x000a0;weeks of therapy, a biopsy was performed for histopathological, immunohistochemical and gene expression (type I collagen (<italic>COL1A1</italic>), type III collagen (<italic>COL3A1</italic>), tenascin-C (<italic>TNC</italic>), tenomodulin (<italic>TNMD</italic>), and scleraxis (<italic>SCX</italic>)) analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Differences in the ultrasound and histopathological analyses were observed between the groups. Improved results were reported in the group treated with adMSCs suspended in PC. There was no difference in the gene expression levels observed after the different treatments. The main results observed from the histopathological evaluation of the treated group were as follows: a prevention of the progression of the lesion, a greater organization of collagen fibers, and a decreased inflammatory infiltrate. A lack of progression of the lesion area and its percentage was observed in the ultrasound image, and increased blood flow was measured by Power Doppler.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of adMSCs combined with PC for the therapy of experimentally induced tendonitis prevented the progression of the tendon lesion, as observed in the ultrasound examination, and resulted in a greater organization and decreased inflammation, as observed in the histopathological evaluation. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this therapy for the treatment of equine tendonitis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tendon lesion</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Stem cell</kwd><kwd>Horse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendon lesions are a major cause of lameness and reduced performance in athletic horses and may result in the early termination of the animals&#x02019; careers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Tendinous structures are poorly vascularized, are relatively acellular, and have limited potential for regeneration because the tendon repair is prolonged and results in the formation of scar tissue, which is biomechanically inferior and prone to lesion recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A tendon injury usually requires a considerable rest period (from six months to over a year) to allow adequate tissue repair. Conventional treatments for tendonitis are basically clinical and surgical approaches. However, the recovered animals are rarely sufficiently healed to allow their return to competitions with a performance similar to that observed when they were healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Regenerative medicine has significantly evolved. In addition, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the implantation of platelet concentrate (PC) in the therapy of equine tendonitis have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies have shown a significant decrease in the recurrence rate of tendonitis for a period of at least two years in animals treated with cell therapy (27%) compared with those that were treated with conventional therapies (56%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>There are several sources of MSCs available, including the bone marrow, the adipose tissue, the peripheral blood, the blood and matrix from the umbilical cord, and the tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Of these sources, the bone marrow has been considered the most important source of MSCs. However, other sources, such as the adipose tissue, exhibit interesting characteristics, such as a greater number of viable MSCs with a high rate of migration and cell differentiation; thus, these characteristics make this source a convenient source of progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>PC is an autologous biological product that is used in equine sports medicine with evident clinical efficacy. The benefits of this therapy include minimally invasive collection and fast, easy, and low-cost processing. The therapeutic efficacy of PC is due to the release of several growth factors that are injected directly into the injured area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The studies that demonstrate the potential of PC in the therapy of equine tendonitis, such as those that analyzed the improvement of the score obtained through the ultrasound evaluation of clinical cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], showed increased local vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and metabolic activity, which resulted in the maturation of tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The suspension of MSCs in PC has been used with promising results in bone repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Only one clinical study in equines investigated equine tendonitis therapy using mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (adMSCs) suspended in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and 14 out of the 16 animals that underwent superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) therapy returned to athletic activity.</p><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of autologous adMSCs suspended in autologous PC in the therapy of animals with experimentally induced tendonitis through ultrasound, histopathological, immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Eight young horses (seven females and one male) of mixed breed and aged between three and four and a half years were used. The animals were clinically and ultrasonographically examined before the start of the experiment to ensure that there was no tendon injury. A complete blood count was also performed to confirm the health status of the animals. All of the animals were placed in individual stalls and adapted to daily management for 21&#x000a0;days before the start of the experiment. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee for animal experimentation of the university (number: 213/2008). In addition to the eight tendons of the horses used in the experiment, four tendons were used that were obtained from equines (two males and two females, mixed breed, aged between three and eight years) that were euthanized due to complications during surgical procedures that did not compromise the SDFT. The samples from euthanized horses were used to standardize the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The animals&#x02019; previous histories of tendonitis were also researched to ensure that the collected fragments were obtained from healthy tendons.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study consisted of two randomly chosen groups: the treated group (TG; tendon treated with adMSCs, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and the control group (CG; tendon treated with PBS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4). The collection of adipose tissue was performed three weeks before the administration of the therapy in order to obtain an adequate number of MSCs in culture (Week &#x02212;3). The tendon lesion was then induced two weeks before the beginning of the therapy. This time is enough to consider a consistent lesion at an early stage (Week &#x02212;2). Ultrasound examinations were performed every two weeks until the end of the experiment. After 16&#x000a0;weeks of therapy, a biopsy of the SDFT was performed for histopathological, immunohistochemical and gene expression evaluations (Week 16). All of the exams were performed by experimenters blinded to the study conditions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Timeline.</bold> US, ultrasound.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="scrt236-1"/></fig><p>Samples from the SDFT of four euthanized horses with no history of tendonitis (HG, healthy group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) were used to assess the gene expression differences between the TG and the CG.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and cultivation of stem cells</title><p>For the collection of adipose tissue, the animals were sedated with xylazine (0.7&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.v.). This treatment was followed by trichotomy, antisepsis and the subcutaneous injection of 20&#x000a0;mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride using an inverted-L anesthetic block. An approximately 8 cm long incision was made. This incision was approximately 15&#x000a0;cm abaxial to the spine to allow the visualization of a layer of fat between the skin and the musculature. Approximately 2&#x000a0;g of fat was collected per animal. The fat was immediately packed in a tube containing 50&#x000a0;mL of Knockout DMEM (Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium).</p><p>The adipose tissue was rinsed with PBS to remove any contamination with whole blood. This step was followed by a gentle mechanical separation using a scalpel and anatomical forceps. Then, 3&#x000a0;mL of type I collagenase diluted in 2&#x000a0;mg/mL Knockout DMEM was added to the mixture. The mixture was then incubated for 12&#x000a0;hours in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for the enzymatic digestion of the adipose tissue. An equal volume of Knockout DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was then added to the mixture to neutralize the enzyme action; the mixture was then rinsed with PBS. The cell pellet obtained from each animal was diluted in Knockout DMEM containing 10% FBS and transferred to 75-cm<sup>2</sup> culture plates, which were placed in an incubator. The culture medium was changed every 48&#x000a0;hours until the culture plate reached 70% confluence. The trypsinization of the cells was then performed, and the cells were subjected to the Trypan blue exclusion test of cell viability. The culture was maintained until the administration of the cell therapy. Prior to the cellular implantation, an aliquot of cells (P1) was collected to perform the immunophenotypic characterization of the cultured cells. As in a previous study, the following markers were used in this characterization: CD44, CD90, CD105 and MHC Class II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiations were also performed to demonstrate the multipotent potential of the cells used (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of the tendon lesion</title><p>The tendon lesion was induced in the middle region of the metacarpus (in the central portion of the SDFT) in one of the forelimbs of the equine, which was randomly selected, using sterile-filtered collagenase type I (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, 1,000 U of gel collagenase was injected into an approximately two-inch-long column defect in the center of the stress region of the SDFT, 10 to 12&#x000a0;cm distal to the accessory carpal bone (ACB). For the correct induction of the lesion, the implantation was guided by an ultrasound device (My Vet Lab 70, Esaote, Genova, Italy) using a sterile 16-gauge (G) catheter needle that was manually curved to a 45&#x000b0; angle (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. After the induction of the lesion, the bandage was tied down to the selected member and maintained for one week.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Lesion induction image.</bold> Lesion induction was guided by an ultrasound device.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="scrt236-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Cell therapy</title><p>Two weeks after the induction of the lesion (T&#x02009;=&#x02009;week 0), the tendon lesions were treated according to the treatment protocol of the respective groups using intralesional injections that were guided by ultrasound. The treated group received 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> adMSCs, which were suspended in 1&#x000a0;mL of autologous PC. The collection and processing of the whole blood were performed minutes before the cell implantation using a previously established protocol (the platelet activation with calcium hydrochloride was not performed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The numbers of platelets in the whole blood and PC were counted. Aliquots containing 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS for implantation in the control group were also prepared.</p><p>For the administration of the therapy, a local trichotomy was required. This step was followed by anesthetic block with 2&#x000a0;mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride at the point of the needle insertion and antisepsis. The animals were also sedated with detomidine (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg, i.v.) and maintained in the catch pen throughout the procedure. A 21-G needle was used for the administration of the therapy. The needle was inserted into the center of the SDFT lesion with the aid of ultrasound. The animals remained individually confined throughout the experiment, and the selected members remained bandaged for one week after the therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluation and physical activity</title><p>The vital signs of all of the animals were measured for the evaluation of specific clinical signs, such as local sensitivity, increased temperature and circumference of the central region of the metacarpus.

The real-time B-mode examination was performed using ultrasound (My Lab 70, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) equipped with a 3- to-11 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer. The lesion regions that received therapy were also evaluated using Power Doppler to evaluate the micro-vascularization of the tendon with Doppler frequency of 6.7 MHz, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 370 Hz, and wall filter of 3.</p><p>The tendon region to be treated for each animal was determined immediately before the administration of the therapy, that is, two weeks after the induction of the lesion. The larger cross-sectional lesion area over the approximately 2 cm lesion was used as the criterion.</p><p>The B-mode ultrasound was used to collect longitudinal images to evaluate the parallelism of the fibers and to collect cross-sectional images to measure both the cross-sectional tendon area and the cross-sectional lesion area. The percentage of the cross-sectional lesion area (lesion area/tendon area&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100) was also calculated.</p><p>The score used to evaluate the bone vascularity was adapted for Power Doppler evaluation (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This score classification was used to score the three images obtained in the Power Doppler evaluation videos to evidence the greatest possible blood flow.

The animals were subjected to inhalational anesthesia and received 10% xylazine (1.1&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.v.) as premedication. Diazepam (0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.v.) and ketamine (2.2&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.v.; Dopalen, Vetbrands, Paul&#x000ed;nia, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) were used for the induction, and isoflurane (Crist&#x000e1;lia Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Itapira, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) vaporized in 100% oxygen was used for anesthesia maintenance.</p><p>The surgical procedures were performed with the animals in right lateral decubitus. An approximately 2 cm long incision was made at the exact point of injury (11 to 12&#x000a0;cm ACB) in the skin and subcutaneous tissue until the SDFT injury was identified. The biopsy was performed in the central portion of the SDFT; the biopsy covered the total area of the tendon lesion. After the correct identification of the injured area, an approximately 0.5-cm<sup>3</sup> sample of the SDFT was collected and properly stored for subsequent histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemical analysis (in 10% buffered formalin solution), and RT-PCR (frozen in liquid nitrogen) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). A simple continuous suture of the paratendon was performed using Vicryl 2&#x02013;0 (Ethicon Inc., Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Medical Limited, Kirkton Campus, Livingston, West Lothian, UK), followed by skin suture with simple points separated with nylon. After the surgical procedure, a compressive bandage was applied to the metacarpal region. The bandage was changed every 24&#x000a0;hours to dress the wound and was maintained until the removal of the stitches two weeks after the surgery. In the immediate postoperative period, all of the animals were treated with phenylbutazone (4.4&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.v.), which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on the first day and for the next four days (2.2&#x000a0;mg/kg, PO q24 h).</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathological evaluation</title><p>Histological sections were prepared in a longitudinal paraffin block that was processed using the conventional paraffinization method. The histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Masson&#x02019;s trichrome and examined under a light microscope. The assessor was blinded to the experimental group. Two histological sections were used in each analysis. The histopathological analysis was based on scores. All of the tendon parameters were scored between 1 (normal) and 4 (severe changes): shape of tenocytes, density of tenocytes, hemorrhage, neovascularization, inflammatory cell infiltrate, linearity of collagen fibers, uniformity of collagen fibers and thickness of the epitendon. These assessments were based on those used in previous studies on tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical evaluation</title><p>The 5-&#x003bc;m-thick cuts obtained from the paraffin blocks were extended on immunoslides (EasyPath, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). Prior to incubation with the primary antibodies for collagen type III and factor VIII, the material was deparaffinized with successive xylene baths and rinsed three times in absolute alcohol followed by washes in solutions with decreasing alcohol concentration (95% and 85%). The antigen retrieval was performed through enzymatic digestion with 2% pepsin (pH 1.8) for 10 minutes in a 60&#x000b0;C incubator and then for 50 minutes in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator. The blocking of the endogenous peroxidase was performed using hydrogen peroxide (3%) in methanol for 20 minutes, followed by 10 washes with distilled water. The peroxidase blocking was followed by the blocking of nonspecific binding with 3% milk powder for 1 h in a 27&#x000b0;C incubator. The slides were subsequently rinsed with TRIS solution. The primary antibodies were incubated for 18 h (overnight) at 6&#x000b0;C using polyclonal anti-bovine antibodies for collagen type III (Novotec, Saint Martin la Garenne, France) and sheep anti-factor VIII (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, Oxford, UK).

These techniques are basically divided into physical and enzymatic methods, such as the use of collagenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], collagenase gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and surgical induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although several studies have been conducted on the subject, there is still no consensus on which is the best induction technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The tendon lesion resulting from the use of collagenase for the induction of tendonitis is not identical to the lesion resulting from the etiopathogenesis of a naturally occurring injury. However, the collagenase method exhibits several advantages over the other methods, such as the development of hypercellularity, the loss of organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), the increased vascularization, and the absence of inflammation mediated by inflammatory cells in the injured tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The results obtained from the induction of the tendon lesion using collagenase gel are consistent with those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]: it was possible to create consistent lesions, and there was minor extravasation of the enzyme to the epitendon.</p><p>The collection of adipose tissue, although considered an invasive procedure, proved to be a relatively simple technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and no postoperative complications were observed in the animals. The isolation of the stromal vascular fraction and the subsequent culture of adMSCs until a sufficient amount was obtained (approximately 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> MSCs) for the implementation of the stem cell therapy were successfully achieved during the three week period used in this experiment. Although the quantification of the cell duplication of adMSCs was not performed in the present study, the data obtained are consistent with the results previously described in studies that reported the rapid growth of these cells in culture, which enables the generation of a higher concentration of progenitor cells in a shorter period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Some studies that use MSCs derived from bone marrow for the therapy of equine tendonitis use a marrow puncture to isolate the bone marrow supernatant to suspend the stem cells at the time of the therapy. There are reports of beneficial effects from this type of therapeutic combination due to the improvement in the therapeutic effect of the progenitor cells that is induced by the stimulant effects of the bone marrow supernatant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition to the bone marrow supernatant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], progenitor cells have been previously suspended in PBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], cell culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], autologous serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and platelet-rich plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study, we chose to prepare the stem cell suspension in PC to combine the therapeutic effects of MSCs derived from the adipose tissue with the growth factors that are released by platelets after their activation. Our use of double centrifugation for the collection of the PC proved effective and enabled the collection of a PC with an average platelet number that was greater than that reported by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Although the PC was not activated in this study, there is clinical evidence that demonstrates an improvement in tendon repair after therapy using a non-activated PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The positive results obtained with the use of non-activated PC can be explained by the <italic>in situ</italic> activation of platelets and the subsequent release of growth factors due to its stimulation by the components present in the local environment (for example, collagen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The activation of platelets can be induced by several methods. A recent study in horses showed that CaCl<sub>2</sub> induced the highest concentration of growth factors compared with the other various types of platelet activators tested.

The lack of significant differences between the cross-sectional lesion area and its percentage at different time points after the therapy can be justified by the correction of the <italic>P</italic>-values resulting from Tukey&#x02019;s test and by the accidental reduction of the size of the CG.</p><p>The interpretation of the evolution of the cross-sectional lesion area and its percentage in the TG and the CG between the time of therapy (Week 0) and the subsequent assessment times shows significant differences between the groups at Weeks 4 and 6. This result demonstrated that the therapy used in this study exhibited a preventive action on the progression of the lesion because the TG showed no increase in the cross-sectional lesion area or its percentage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>This absence of lesion progression can be largely explained by the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action of the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We hypothesize that the moment of therapy administration may have contributed to these data because the preventive action of the therapy on the progression of the tendon lesion in the TG can be more clearly demonstrated in the ultrasound evaluation (the tendon lesion is not yet fully developed at this point). If the therapy had been performed four weeks after the induction of the lesion, we would certainly not find this preventive action because the lesion would have already reached its maximum size. This statement is based on a recent study that used a technique similar to the induction of tendon injury with the collagenase gel that was used in the present study. The study demonstrated that the maximal cross-sectional area of the lesion and the maximal relative cross-sectional area of the lesion of the SDTF are found four weeks after lesion induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The use of Color Doppler ultrasound for the assessment of the vascularization in equine tendonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and after therapy for equine tendonitis with PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] has been described. Although Power Doppler does not provide information on the blood flow speed or direction, as can be obtained with the Color Doppler ultrasound, Power Doppler has a greater sensitivity to the presence of blood and to the blood volume, which enables the visualization of smaller vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The results of the assessment of the vascularization obtained in this study indicate that there was increased blood flow in the treated group six weeks after the start of the therapy compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). This result suggests that a biopsy at Week 6 would more likely find a larger number of vessels in the treated group than in the control group; this would be true in both the histopathological analysis and the immunohistochemical evaluation using factor VIII. The vessels are poorly visualized with the Color Doppler evaluation of a healthy digital flexor tendon. Hypervascularity is expected during the tissue repair process, but there is decreased vascularity with the progress of tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The semi-quantitative morphological evaluation demonstrated the histopathological improvement of the treated group compared to the control group; this improvement is based on the cumulative sum of histological scores (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049). This evaluation also demonstrated a reduction in the inflammatory infiltrate and an improved organization of the ECM. These data are in agreement with previously reported results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. An improved linearity and uniformity of the collagen fibers was also observed in the treated group compared with the control group.</p><p>The action of the anti-inflammatory therapy is evident after combining the analysis of the histopathological data with the ultrasound evaluation (Weeks 2, 4 and 6). The cross-sectional area and its percentage did not worsen with therapy in the TG (Weeks 2, 4 and 6), whereas there was an increase in the lesion in the same period in the CG. This result suggests a possible anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of the lesion that prevents it from increasing in size by either minimizing or stabilizing the degeneration of the tendon fibers. The decreased inflammation after the implantation of adMSCs is likely due to the immunosuppressive effect of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. There are several mechanisms that compose the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs that benefit tendon repair; these include an increase in chemokines, the suppression of cytokine secretion from dendritic cells, and a reduction in the effects of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. These data highlight the potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of these cells. Given these potent immunomodulatory effects of MSCs, it is not surprising that these cells are being used in clinical studies of graft-versus-host disease, which is usually a fatal condition after organ transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The immunohistochemical evaluation found no difference in the expression of collagen type III and factor VIII between the different groups. Previous studies have described the use of mononuclear cells derived from adipose tissue and adMSCs for the therapy of equine tendonitis. These studies have demonstrated a decreased expression of type III collagen in the treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, another study described the quantification of the blood vessels present in the SDFT treated with PC using factor VIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]: a greater amount of vessels was found in the group that received therapy with a platelet concentrate. Factor VIII is a clotting pro-cofactor that is found only on intact and functional endothelial cells of blood vessels; thus, this factor is an important tool for the evaluation of tissue vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The increased expression of the <italic>COL1A1, COL3A1, TNC, TNMD</italic> and <italic>SCX</italic> genes in the tendons of the TG and the CG compared with the HG are consistent with the results obtained in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Soon after tendon injury occurs, the expression levels of <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The expression level of <italic>TNC</italic>, which is an ECM protein that is synthesized during inflammation and tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and modulates the binding of cells to ECM components, also increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. <italic>TNMD</italic> regulates the proliferation of tenocytes and the maturation of collagen fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The increased expression of <italic>SCX</italic> in the injured tendons was consistent with the attempt to repair the tissue because this gene regulates the tendon progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and is a marker of tendon and ligament development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Although an increases expression of the tested genes was observed in the injured tendons (TG and CG) compared with the healthy tendons (HG), no difference was observed between the expression in the different injured groups (TG and CG). This result is consistent with the results obtained in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, a trend for increases in the expression of <italic>COL3A1</italic> was observed in the control group (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08). Soon after tendon injury, the gene expression levels of collagen type I and III increase. The decrease in the concentration of collagen type I compared with that of collagen type III is more closely related to the formation of scar tissue than to tendon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, the lower expression of the <italic>COL3A1</italic> gene in the treated group suggests that the tendons in the TG are better repaired than those in the CG. However, this result should be examined with caution because the difference in the expression levels of <italic>COL3A1</italic> between the groups was not significant and because no increase in the collagen type III protein expression was observed in the immunohistochemical evaluation.</p><p>Only one study has reported differences in gene expression after the use of cell therapy for equine tendonitis. This study reported an increase in the expression of the gene cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (<italic>COMP</italic>) after tendonitis therapy with mononuclear cells derived from adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A likely explanation for the lack of gene expression differences between the tendons of the TG, which exhibited improved histological and ultrasound characteristics, and the tendons of the CG is that the tested genes, although associated with tendon repair, are not specific. Thus, further research is necessary to select genes that are better markers of tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of the present study was the fact that the investigation did not determine the exact mechanism of action of the therapy that was used. This lack could have been due to trophic action (local modulation of cytokines), the replacement of cells from the injured tissue, local immunomodulation, or other mechanisms that favor the improvement of tissue repair evidenced by histopathological and ultrasound analyses.</p><p>There is great difficulty in the development of a well-designed large-scale study involving equines. The lack of basic knowledge of the behavior of adult stem cells and PC after their administration is also undeniable. Progenitor cells are believed to differentiate in the specific tissue site into which they were deployed (for example, tenocyte differentiation) and thus promote the production of the appropriate ECM. These cells can also synthesize bioactive proteins (for example, growth factors and cytokines) that promote the recruitment of endogenous stem cells and the anabolic stimulation of newly recruited cells and the mature cells of the tissue itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Similar to other experiments that used cell therapy with or without PC for the treatment of equine tendonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the present study demonstrated a satisfactory result. However, it has limitations regarding the effects of the therapy used. The results demonstrate that there is no definition for the effectiveness of a therapy for the treatment of equine tendonitis. Based on the preventive result obtained with the adMSCs suspended in PC on the progression of the lesion in the ultrasound evaluation (cross-sectional lesion area and its percentage), further studies should be conducted to confirm this preventive action and the mechanism of action of the therapeutic association, as well as the action of progenitor cells and platelets alone as the lesion progresses. This conclusion is consistent with that described in a recent study on tendonitis, which states that prevention can have a significantly greater clinical impact than therapy due to the impossibility of tendon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Future studies should be conducted to further elucidate the ideal time of administration of the equine tendonitis therapy, which is currently standardized between 7 and 45&#x000a0;days after the onset of the lesion. Additionally, further studies would contribute to the understanding of when the best therapeutic results are obtained and whether it really is possible to prevent further injury when the therapy is administered to a still-developing injury.</p><p>Basic studies that elucidate the real mechanism of action of the therapy used in tissue repair should also be conducted to confirm the differentiation of the stem cells used, analyze the release of trophic factors (for example, cytokines and growth factors), and verify the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action of the therapy. Better knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of tendonitis associated with the knowledge of the mechanism of action of adult stem cells and activated platelets will enable improved clinical outcomes and result in the verification of the therapeutic efficacy of this new biotechnology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated that the use of adMSCs combined with PC had a favorable action in the therapy of tendonitis. This result was verified mainly by the prevention of the progression of the lesion, which was observed in the ultrasound evaluation, and by the significant improvement observed in the histopathological analysis scores. Future studies should be conducted to elucidate the immunomodulatory action of adMSCs combined with PC and the best time for its administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACB: Accessory carpal bone; adMSCs: Mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue; CG: Control group; COL1A1: Type I collagen; COL3A1: Type III collagen; COMP: Gene cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; CT: Threshold cycle; DMEM: Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium; ECM: Extracellular matrix; FBS: Fetal bovine serum; H&#x00026;E: Hematoxylin and eosin; HG: Healthy group; MSCs: Mesenchymal stem cells; P1: First pass; PBS: Phosphate buffered saline; PC: Platelet concentrate; PRF: Pulse repetition frequency; RT-PCR: Real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription; SCX: Scleraxis; SDFT: Superficial digital flexor tendon; TG: Treated group; TNC: Tenascin-C; TNMD: Tenomodulin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AMC, ALGA, ASB, CAH and ED contributed to the conception and design of the study.
