The pain during the first 30 days of onset is known as Acute Herpetic Neuralgia. Multiple treatments using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and tricyclic anti-depressants are available, but their side effects limit their use in geriatric patients.

Exclusion criteria included the following: patients with acute herpes zoster presenting after 72 hours of onset; pain of herpes zoster rating less than 60 at baseline; prior treatment with gabapentin; history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients; significant hematological disease; immuno-compromised state; and significant systemic disease or hepatic and renal disease.</p><p>Eligible subjects who gave informed written consent underwent physical examination.

They were assigned into four groups to receive gabapentin 300 mg/day (G 300), 600 mg/day (G 600), 900 mg/day (G 900) in divided doses and placebo. At each visit (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), subjects were assessed for pain (on 100 mm Linear VAS with &#x0201c;0 mm&#x0201d; as no pain to &#x0201c;100 mm&#x0201d; as worst possible pain) by an independent assessor. Adverse events were recorded on visual rating scale from 0 to 3 as nil (-), mild (+), moderate (++), and severe (+++), respectively.

Measures of frequency, nature, and severity of adverse events were derived from a total of 42 subjects receiving gabapentin.

These studies showed significant role of gabapentin in the chronic pain of PHN. In our study, gabapentin was started as early as possible after the diagnosis of zoster.</p><p>The pathophysiology of pain in acute herpetic neuralgia differs from that of PHN. In acute zoster, the skin is inflamed, already partially denervated and the dorsal-root ganglion shows inflammation, hemorrhagic necrosis, and neuronal loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] On the other hand, PHN is due to the continuing inflammation in peripheral nerves for weeks to months leading to demyelination, wallerian degeneration, and sclerosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] After the injury, peripheral neurons discharge spontaneously, have lower activation thresholds, display exaggerated responses to stimuli, and there is an altered central nervous system signal processing.&#x0200a;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Gabapentin has been reported to relieve pain in patients with intractable neuropathic pain and reflex sympathetic dystrophy allowing the reduction or termination of other analgesic medications and relieving symptoms associated with painful disease manifestations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] It also reduces spontaneous pain and tactile allodynia in patients with peripheral or central pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] We utilized the property of gabapentin to act both centrally and peripherally by starting gabapentin within 72 hours of onset of zoster.</p><p>This study shows that gabapentin in all doses was significantly more efficacious than placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Comparison between different doses showed significantly less efficacy of 300 mg/day as compared to 600 and 900 mg per day (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and dosage of 600 mg/day was equally efficacious to 900 mg/day (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). This effect can be explained on the basis of nonlinear-bioavailability relationship of gabapentin, i.e., at higher doses smaller percentage of drug is bioavailable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>While reviewing the literature, we could find only two studies published in western text assessing the role of gabapentin in acute herpetic neuralgia. Berry and Peterson observed 66% reduction of pain as compared to placebo by using single dose 900 mg of gabapentin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our study also showed around 26-38% of reduction of pain in different groups as measured by VAS at the end of 4<sup>th</sup> week. It should be noted that in the former study, the effect was studied for six hours period only, while in our study, the effect was observed for four weeks period showing the long term efficacy of the drug. Another study by Dworkin <italic>et al</italic>., on gabapentin and CR-oxycodone (controlled release) showed significant reduction in pain with oxycodone in the first two weeks, but for gabapentin, the pain relief was observed only in the first week but not later.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In our study, the pain reduction started by the end of first week of therapy was highest at the end of second week and then plateau was observed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> week. The continuous reduction of pain by gabapentin in our study may be explained on the basis of starting of gabapentin within 72 hours which may have had a role in reducing the pain provocation potential at receptor level and its anti-nociceptive properties.</p><p>The safety profile showed significantly more somnolence, dizziness, and gastro-intestinal side effects in dose of 900 mg/day as compared with 300 and 600 mg/day [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. This highlights that the dose of 600 mg/day is therapeutically more effective and a safe dose. The most common side effect was somnolence, but it was not a source of stress in our patients, rather nocturnal somnolence was perceived as mark of pain relief.</p><p>Geriatric patients usually are on multiple drugs for different medical and surgical conditions. A drug which has less drug interaction potential is therefore needed. Gabapentin, in all doses undergoes minimal metabolism, has minimal protein binding and is excreted unchanged by kidneys which accounts for its less drug interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] As geriatric patients are at a higher risk to develop post herpetic neuralgia, gabapentin can be continued as single or combined therapy in cases of PHN.</p><p>The results of this study show that early initiation of gabapentin can be safe and effective alternative to analgesics and tricyclics in geriatric patients to reduce and prevent the pain in herpes zoster. Further trials can be done in future enrolling more number of patients with different combinations and different age groups to quantify the effect.</p><p><graphic xlink:href="IJD-57-362-g007.jpg" position="float"/></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>RS</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Tindall</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Geriatric herpes zoster</article-title><source>J Am Geriatr Soc</source><year>1971</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>495</fpage><lpage>504</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5094651</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Understanding zoster-associated pain</article-title><source>How can the burden of zoster-associated pain be reduced?
