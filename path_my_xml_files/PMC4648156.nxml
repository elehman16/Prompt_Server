However, little is understood either about the mechanisms underlying motivation for intense sensory experiences or their neuropharmacological modulation in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we first evaluate a novel paradigm to investigate sensation-seeking in humans. This test probes the extent to which participants choose either to avoid or self-administer an intense tactile stimulus (mild electric stimulation) orthogonal to performance on a simple economic decision-making task. Next we investigate in a different set of participants whether this behavior is sensitive to manipulation of dopamine D2 receptors using a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both samples, individuals with higher self-reported sensation-seeking chose a greater proportion of mild electric stimulation-associated stimuli, even when this involved sacrifice of monetary gain. Computational modelling analysis determined that people who assigned an additional positive economic value to mild electric stimulation-associated stimuli exhibited speeding of responses when choosing these stimuli. In contrast, those who assigned a negative value exhibited slowed responses. These findings are consistent with involvement of low-level, approach-avoidance processes. Furthermore, the D2 antagonist haloperidol selectively decreased the additional economic value assigned to mild electric stimulation-associated stimuli in individuals who showed approach reactions to these stimuli under normal conditions (behavioral high-sensation seekers).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide the first direct evidence of sensation-seeking behavior being driven by an approach-avoidance&#x02013;like mechanism, modulated by dopamine, in humans. They provide a framework for investigation of psychopathologies for which extreme sensation-seeking constitutes a vulnerability factor.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>sensation-seeking</kwd><kwd>impulsivity</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>D2 antagonist</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensation-seeking is a personality trait concerned with motivation for &#x0201c;intense, unusual and unpredictable&#x0201d; sensory experiences (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>) that constitutes an important and well-conceptualised individual difference (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Roberti, 2004</xref>). Engagement in various sensation-seeking&#x02013;type activities (eg, recreational drug consumption, risky driving and sexual behaviors) covaries across both adults and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Carmody et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, questionnaire-based measures of sensation-seeking personality have high heritability estimates (40&#x02013;60%; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Koopmans et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Stoel et al., 2006</xref>) with rank order differences in scores remaining highly stable over time (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Terracciano et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Extreme sensation-seeking has been implicated in a variety of psychopathologies with high social cost, including substance and gambling addictions (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Roberti, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). Among individuals with substance use disorders, higher sensation-seeking score is associated with earlier age of onset, increased polysubstance use, more severe functional impairment, and poorer overall treatment outcome (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ball et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Staiger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Lackner et al., 2013</xref>). Identification of mechanisms underlying human sensation-seeking is therefore likely to have high clinical relevance.</p><p content-type="indent">Investigations of animal models of sensation-seeking have implicated variation in striatal dopamine function, particularly at D2 types (D2/D3/D4) dopamine receptors, in mediating individual preferences for novel or sensory stimulation-inducing choice options (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bardo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). As the efficacy of striatal dopaminergic transmission is considered to be involved in the vigor of approach behaviors in response to salient stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Robbins and Everitt, 2007</xref>), one theoretical account proposes that the core basis for individual differences in sensation-seeking is in the differential activation of dopaminergic approach-withdrawal mechanisms in response to novel and intense stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zuckerman, 1990</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Consistent with this view, genetic and PET evidence has implicated differences in function at D2-type receptors in individual differences in human sensation-seeking (eg, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hamidovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Gjedde et al., 2010</xref>). Crucially, however, lack of behavioral paradigms analogous to those in the preclinical literature has meant that it has not been possible to test the approach-avoidance hypothesis directly in humans. Such an approach has previously proved highly fruitful with respect to other facets of impulsivity (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Winstanley, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Jupp and Dalley, 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Here, we first tested a novel instrumental task of human sensation-seeking&#x02013;like behavior that involved the opportunity to self-administer mild (but nonpainful) electric stimulation (MES) during performance of an economic decision-making task. This task was designed to be analogous to a recent operant sensation-seeking paradigm developed for rodents (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Olsen and Winder, 2009</xref>). We next used a within-subjects design to investigate the effects of the D2 dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol on task performance in a different sample of healthy volunteers. We predicted that: (1) individuals high in trait sensation-seeking would assign a positive economic value to the opportunity to experience such an &#x0201c;intense and unusual&#x0201d; sensory stimulus; (2) this preference would be reflected in an approach-like speeded relative response time for these stimuli; and (3) such &#x0201c;behavioral sensation-seeking&#x0201d; would be disrupted by antagonism at D2 receptors, depending on baseline sensation-seeking performance (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Norbury et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Study 1</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-five healthy participants (28 female), mean age 24.3 (SD 3.55), were recruited via internet advertisements (for further demographic information, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

In the first part of the task (acquisition phase), they simply learned the point values associated with various different abstract visual stimuli (conditioned stimuli [CSs]). Eight different fractals were used as CSs, with 2 of them assigned to each of 4 possible point values (25, 50, 75, or 100 points). In every trial, fractals were presented as pairs, restricted to consist of either adjacent or equal point value stimuli, yielding 10 different trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sensation-seeking task. In the first part of the task (acquisition phase), participants were presented with a series of forced choice decisions between pairs of abstract fractal images. There were 8 different fractal stimuli (conditioned stimuli [CSs]) with 2 different CSs assigned to each of 4 possible point values (25, 50, 75, or 100 points; with which choice option a particular fractal represented randomised for every participant). Choice pairs were restricted to consist of either adjacent or equal points value stimuli, yielding 10 trial types. The acquisition phase of the task continued for a minimum of 80 trials until participants reached a criterion level of performance, &#x02265;80% higher points value choices over the last 10 trials where a higher points value choice was possible. After this learning stage was completed, participants progressed to the second part of the task (test phase). For the test phase, participants were instructed that all stimuli were associated with the same points value as before but that some of the stimuli were now associated with the chance of receiving a mild electric stimulus (MES) to their nondominant hand (the magnitude of the MES was individually calibrated to be &#x0201c;stimulating but not painful&#x0201d; prior to starting the task). Specifically, one-half of the stimuli became designated as CS+s (chance of MES) and the other half CS-s (no chance of MES) in such a way that trials fell into 1 of 3 types: those where the CS+ was the lower points option, those where the CS+ was the higher points option, and, crucially, those where the CS+ and CS- stimuli were of equal points value. To increase the salience of the tactile stimulus, receipt of the electrical stimulation was probabilistic in both occurrence and timing. The probability of receiving the MES given selection of a CS+ stimulus was 0.75, with the onset of the MES occurring randomly during a 2500-ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI), throughout which participants were presented with a blank screen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijnppy_pyv041_f0001"/></fig><p content-type="indent">The acquisition phase continued for a minimum of 80 trials until participants reached a criterion level of performance (choosing the fractal associated with the higher points value on 80% or greater of trials where this was possible, over the last ten trials). After this learning stage was completed, participants progressed to the second part of the task (test phase).</p><p content-type="indent">In the test phase, one-half of the choice stimuli became additionally associated with the chance of receiving a nonpainful MES to the hand. These fractals will henceforth be referred to as CS+s (for full details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The other fractals were not associated with electrical stimulation and so are referred to as CS-. For each points value, one of the associated fractals became CS+ (chance of MES), while the other was CS- (no chance of MES). This yielded 3 trial types: those where CS+ was the lower points option, those where CS+ was the higher points option, and, crucially, those where the CS+ and CS- stimuli were of equal points value.</p><p content-type="indent">Participants thus continued to make choices between fractal pairs, with the only difference being that now one-half of the choice options were associated with the chance of receiving the MES, including, importantly, on trials where both fractals were of the same points value. The key experimental question was whether some participants&#x02019; choices would be biased towards selecting the CS+ stimuli when it was of equal points value to, or even less than, the CS-. The degree of bias in participants&#x02019; choice towards or away from CS+ stimuli, with respect to the relative points value of the CS+ option, thus allowed precise calculation of the economic value (positive or negative) each participant assigned to the opportunity to receive the additional intense sensory stimulus (see Computational modelling analysis).</p><p content-type="indent">Participants completed 100 test phase trials (10 per trial type) and were told they would be paid a cash bonus at the end that depended on the total number of points accrued. To increase the salience of the tactile stimulus, receipt of MES was probabilistic in both occurrence and timing. The probability of receiving the MES given selection of a CS+ stimulus was 0.75, with the onset of MES occurring randomly during a 2500-ms inter-stimulus interval.</p><p content-type="indent">Before initiating the task, participants rated their preference for each of the fractals to be used in the paradigm on a computerized visual analogue scale (VAS) (ranging from &#x0201c;like to &#x0201c;dislike&#x0201d;). This measure was repeated for a second time following completion of the acquisition phase (ie, after learning the points value associated with each CS), and for a third time at the end of the experiment (ie, following introduction of the MESs). For details of apparatus and stimulation parameters used to deliver the MES, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ijnp/pyv041/-/DC1">Supplementary Information</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Design</title><p>Following consent and task instructions, the amplitude of the electrical stimulation was calibrated individually for each participant via a standardized work-up procedure. Specifically, participants received a series of single stimulation pulses, starting at a very low amplitude (0.5 mA; generally reported by participants as being only just detectable) and gradually increasing in current strength until the stimulation was rated as 6 out of 10 on a VAS ranging from 0 (just detectable) to 10 (painful or unpleasant), a level at which participants endorsed a description of the sensation as being &#x0201c;stimulating but not painful.&#x0201d; This procedure was repeated twice for each participant to ensure consistency.</p><p content-type="indent">Participants also completed several self-report measures: a revised measure of the Sensation-Seeking Scale version V (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Gray and Wilson, 2007</xref>); a measure of hedonic tone, the Snaith-Hamilton Anhedonia Scale (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Snaith et al., 1995</xref>); and the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Spielberger et al., 1970</xref>). The latter 2 measures were included to test the possibility that individual differences in MES preference may be related to trait anxiety or current state (an)hedonia rather than being driven by sensation-seeking personality per se.

This was due to a selective decrease in the economic value assigned to receipt of the intense sensory stimulus in participants who exhibited decreased relative RTs towards (or displayed approach reactions to) the MES under placebo conditions (behavioral high-sensation seekers).</p><p content-type="indent">The results presented here are in line with a broader background of evidence from both humans and animals that relates trait sensation-seeking to variation in dopaminergic neurotransmission, particularly in striatal regions (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hamidovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Olsen and Winder, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Gjedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Norbury et al., 2013</xref>). A combination of evidence from genetic and PET radioligand displacement studies suggests that individuals higher in sensation-seeking personality may have both higher endogenous dopamine levels and greater dopaminergic responses to cues of upcoming reward in the striatum (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Riccardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Gjedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>). According to one influential model of the role of dopamine in striatal function (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Frank, 2005</xref>), in the normal state this may contribute to increased inhibition of &#x0201c;NoGo&#x0201d; (action inhibition) pathway neurons via increased stimulation of inhibitory postsynaptic D2 receptors. This in turn would result in greater overall thalamic disinhibition or &#x0201c;Go&#x0201d; bias (favoring action expression) in high-sensation seekers, particularly in the presence of reward cues.</p><p content-type="indent">Haloperidol is a silent D2 receptor antagonist (blocks endogenous dopamine signalling via D2 receptors; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cosi et al., 2006</xref>), and D2 antagonists have previously been shown to preferentially affect striatal function (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kuroki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Honey et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that under haloperidol, the responses of higher sensation seekers may be normalized (increase in resemblance to lower sensation seekers) by allowing increased NoGo pathway output. This would explain our finding of a selective decrease in appetitive reactions to the intense sensory stimulation in the higher sensation-seeking (approach group) individuals.</p><p content-type="indent">Our finding of a significant effect of haloperidol on choice, in the absence of any influence on learning, is consistent with recent work suggesting that D2 antagonists may have strong effects on choice of rewarding-predicting stimuli while leaving learning intact (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Eisenegger et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is important to note that the putative mechanism suggested above assumes a predominantly postsynaptic effect of haloperidol (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Frank and O&#x02019;Reilly, 2006</xref>). Despite our attempt to ensure significant postsynaptic receptor binding by use of a greater dose than the previously cited study (where mixed pre- and postsynaptic D2-ergic effects were thought to be observed), we can provide no direct evidence of this. Further, inferences regarding the brain regions involved in our findings are speculative and would need to be tested in further work, for example involving functional imaging.</p><p content-type="indent">The studies presented here have some limitations. First, as sensation-seeking behaviors in the real world can take many different forms, it might appear surprising that use of a single, tactile sensory stimulus (MES) is able to sufficiently capture sensation-seeking behavior in all individuals. However, our findings are consistent with a previous study reporting distinct physiological response profiles to electric shock in low and high self-reported sensation-seekers (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Pascalis et al., 2007</xref>). We would not seek to claim that performance on our task captures all of sensation-seeking personality, as this is a complex multidimensional trait, but it may tap operational sensation-seeking&#x02013;like behavior in at least a subset of high-sensation&#x02013;seeking individuals, thereby allowing us to probe underlying neural mechanisms in the laboratory (eg, with pharmacological manipulations). In analogous fashion, there is some evidence that apparently dissimilar animal operationalizations of sensation-seeking behavior may tap at least partially overlapping neural circuitry (eg, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Parkitna et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Crucially, in both our studies, choice of MES-associated stimuli was found to correlate selectively with total self-reported sensation-seeking scores, which probe multiple classes of sensation-seeking&#x02013;type behaviors. Although these relationships were of only moderate strength, it should be noted that these findings are at the higher end of the range of those generally found between behavioral and questionnaire measures of impulsive behavior (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Helmers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 1999</xref>). We also found some evidence of greater recreational substance consumption amongst individuals who assigned a positive value towards opportunity to experience the MES, indicating that task performance may relate to real-life engagement in sensation-seeking behaviors.</p><p content-type="indent">Second, as our drug finding is based on a significant decrease in value in one (previously higher mean value) subgroup, an alternative explanation of our findings from Study 2 is that this simply represents a regression to the mean effect. However, against this interpretation, we found evidence of fair-to-good reliability of &#x003b8; values generated from the same participants across multiple sessions of our novel paradigm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ijnp/pyv041/-/DC1">Supplementary Information</ext-link>).</p><p content-type="indent">Furthermore, the subgrouping for Study 2 is based on individual difference in relative choice RTs rather than &#x003b8; values per se (although the 2 are significantly correlated). We also used our estimate of RT effect from the second or third testing session (placebo session) to group participants, a strategy that has previously been argued to help guard against regression to the mean effects (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, we would contend that these factors argue against a purely trivial effect of haloperidol on MES value in the approach or high-sensation&#x02013;seeking individuals.</p><p content-type="indent">Third, although haloperidol is considered to be a selective D2 receptor antagonist (it binds &#x0003e;15 times more strongly to D2 than D1 receptors in rat and human cloned cells; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Arnt and Skarsfeldt, 1998</xref>), it has also been shown to have modest affinity for the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1 adrenoreceptor and the serotonin 2A receptor in postmortem human brains (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Richelson and Souder, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we cannot be completely certain about the mechanism underlying our drug effects. As haloperidol has previously been reported to induce high levels of brain D2 receptor occupancy at relatively low oral doses (60&#x02013;70% at 3mg and 53&#x02013;74% at 2mg; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nordstr&#x000f6;m et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kapur et al., 1997</xref>), we are confident that the dose used in our study (2.5mg) was sufficient to antagonize central D2 receptors in our participants. Another potential limitation is the possibility that the behavioral effects we observed are due to some general effect of haloperidol treatment, for example, increased negative affect in some participants. However, the effect of drug on MES value was unrelated to differences in mood, affect, sedation or dysphoria ratings, or our measure of general psychomotor function between drug and placebo sessions.</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, the novel paradigm introduced here appears to tap a dimension of willingness to self-administer intense and unusual sensory stimulation, together with associated behavioral invigoration. For participants who choose to approach rather than avoid this kind of stimulation, we propose that it is intrinsically rewarding and that, similar to analogous findings from the animal literature, this appetitive response involves the D2 receptor dopamine system. These findings may aid investigation of various psychopathologies for which more extreme sensation-seeking scores constitute a vulnerability factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Interest Statement</title><p>J.P.R. is a consultant for Cambridge Cognition and has participated as a paid speaker in a media advisory board for Lundbeck.
