We conduct this parallel design, randomized-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of adjunct sodium tanshinone IIA sulfate (STS) therapy on circulating inflammation markers in CAD patients. Unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients with increased hs-CRP level were randomly assigned to atorvastatin-based standard medical therapy or standard therapy plus STS injection (80&#x02009;mg, once daily for 14 consecutive days). The primary outcome was hs-CRP level. After the 14-day treatment, the experimental group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35) exhibited significantly lower levels of hs-CRP than the control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35) (1.72 vs 3.20&#x02009;mg/L, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0191). Lower levels of interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and soluble CD40 ligand were also observed in the experimental group. Angina symptoms were also better controlled in the experimental group. At 30 days after treatment completion, MCP-1 levels remained lower in the experimental group than in the control group (313.88 vs 337.91&#x02009;pg/mL, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0078). No serious adverse events occurred. Our study demonstrates that on the basis of standard medical therapy, STS further reduce elevated hs-CRP and other circulating inflammation markers in CAD patients.

Inflammation plays an important role both in the development of atherosclerosis and in triggering cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As a robust marker of systematic inflammation, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been closely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and a meta-analysis showed that hs-CRP &#x0003e;3&#x02009;mg/L is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, reducing the concentration of hs-CRP may further benefits patients with CAD. In fact, the mortality reduction and cardiovascular benefits of statins, a cornerstone of evidence-based standard medical therapy for CAD, may partly attribute to its anti-inflammation effect.</p><p id="Par3">Indeed, the JUPITER trial found that, among non-hyperlipidemic patients with elevated hs-CRP, statin therapy reduced hs-CRP levels by 37%, and led to a significantly lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events after 1.9 years compared to placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, despite intensive statin therapy, 22.4% of patients with acute coronary syndrome suffer a serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event within two years of initiating treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, thus revealing the extent of residual cardiovascular risk, as well as the potential benefit of further dampening the inflammatory reaction of atherosclerosis.</p><p id="Par4">Tanshinone IIA, one of the most pharmacologically active components extracted from <italic>Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae</italic>, has been identified as a promising natural cardioprotective agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Most noteworthy is the ability of tanshinone IIA to decrease the levels of multiple inflammatory factors associated with the progression of atherosclerosis, such as CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x1d6fc;), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), CD40, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Because of the low oral bioavailability of tanshinone IIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, intravenous sodium tanshinone IIA sulfate (STS) has been developed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and is the most widely used clinical formulation of tanshinone IIA in China for patients with CAD.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The chemical structure of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_16980_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e345"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par5">In this trial, we hypothesized that the addition of STS to standard statin-containing medical therapy for patients with CAD will: 1) further reduce the levels of serum hs-CRP and other circulating inflammatory markers after 14 days of treatment; 2) show a sustained effect on inflammatory marker levels at 30 days after treatment completion; 3) improve angina symptoms; and 4) be a safe treatment, compared to standard medical therapy alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p id="Par6">Study participants were recruited from August 2012 to January 2014, and final follow-up was completed by February 2014. A flow diagram illustrating the study design is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. A total of 280 inpatients were assessed for eligibility, and finally, 72 eligible participants were enrolled. Among which, 36 participants were randomly assigned to receive standard statin-containing medical therapy with uniformly-dosed atorvastatin 20&#x02009;mg daily (control statin group) and 36 to standard medical therapy plus 80&#x02009;mg intravenous STS daily (experimental statin+STS group). Two patients were subsequently excluded because of mis-inclusion: 1 patient in the statin group withdrew to receive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during hospitalization, and 1 patient in the statin+STS group developed pneumonia. Ultimately, 70 participants (35 in each group) completed the 14-day treatment. During the 30-day follow-up period, 3 participants, 2 in the statin+STS group and 1 in the statin group, were lost to follow up. Among them, one declined to participate in the follow-up since she has left Beijing, two were unreachable for data collection. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed, involving all 70 patients who were successfully randomized, and the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation method was used to account for missing data.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow Diagram of Study Design. <sup>a</sup>Two patients were excluded because of mis-inclusion: 1 patient in the control statin group elected to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention during hospitalization, and 1 patient in the experimental statin +STS group developed pneumonia. <sup>b</sup>Two patients were lost to follow up in the experimental statin +STS group, due to inability to contact the patients for data collection. <sup>c</sup>One patient was lost to follow up in the control statin group after the patient elected to withdraw from the study.

Among the various systemic inflammatory markers, hs-CRP has the greatest predictive value for atherosclerotic plaque stability and acute cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the JUPITER trial, <italic>de novo</italic> initiation of rosuvastatin 20&#x02009;mg daily reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated hs-CRP level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, thus suggesting the potential of hs-CRP to be a therapeutic target. A meta-analysis including 22 trials indicated that hs-CRP &#x0003e;3&#x02009;mg/L was independently associated with risk of incident CAD events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, while hs-CRP &#x0003e;15&#x02009;mg/L may be more suggestive of infection. Therefore, hs-CRP was adopted as the primary outcome measure in this trial, but only patients with confirmed CAD and with elevated hs-CRP level between 3&#x02009;mg/L and 15&#x02009;mg/L were enrolled. Our results showed that 14 days of adjunctive STS therapy was more effective in reducing elevated hs-CRP level than standard medical therapy alone.</p><p id="Par19">In addition to affecting hs-CRP, adjunctive STS therapy also reduced the levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and sCD40L further than did standard medical therapy alone. IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that coordinates the release of CRP during the acute-phase response, and may have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanisms that all contribute to CAD pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, MCP-1 plays an important role in atherosclerosis as a key chemokine regulating the migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and CD40-mediated signaling has been implicated in the process of plaque destabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The upregulation of IL-6, MCP-1, and CD40L in the setting of CAD has each been associated with worse clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and as such, these important inflammatory factors represent additional targets for future anti-inflammatory CAD therapy. However, our study did not show a significant effect of adjunctive STS on levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-9, and sVCAM-1, which differs from the results of previous experimental studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, STS represents a promising adjunctive therapy for mitigating residual cardiovascular risk secondary to inflammation in CAD patients. Indeed, Robertson <italic>et al</italic>. recently conducted a large-scale screening of anti-inflammatory compounds using zebrafish as an animal model, and identified tanshinone IIA as one of the most potent anti-inflammatory agents among thousands of compounds screened<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Since STS is an intravenous preparation not suitable for long-term application, we investigated whether adjunctive STS therapy might yield sustained anti-inflammatory effects after discontinuation of treatment. Our results showed that the significant reduction in MCP-1 level following administration of integrative statin-STS therapy compared to standard medical therapy alone persisted to 30 days after the treatment was completed. Although there was no statistically significant difference in hs-CRP reduction between the groups at 30 days after the completion of treatment, we nevertheless observed a clear trend toward lower hs-CRP levels in the statin-STS group as compared to the control group. This negative result might be due to the small sample size of this preliminary trial. Larger clinical trials with longer duration of follow-up are necessary to clarify whether there is a sustained, long-term effect of adjunctive STS on hs-CRP, and whether this promising anti-inflammatory effect might be translatable into clinical benefits.</p><p id="Par21">In addition to anti-inflammatory effects, STS also possesses both anti-platelet and anticoagulant properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Considering the potential for drug interactions between STS and the various anti-thrombotic agents commonly used in conventional CAD treatment, increased hemorrhagic events associated with adjunctive STS therapy may be an issue of concern in clinical practice. In this short-term, small-sized clinical trial, we did not observe any bleeding events or any other serious adverse events associated with adjunctive STS therapy. Our results suggest that the addition of STS to standard medical therapy for CAD might not increase the risk of bleeding events or hepatorenal side effects, although the full safety profile of this integrative therapy should be further assessed in future larger scale clinical trials.</p><p id="Par22">Some limitations of this trial should be noted. First, the sample size was small, and thus the study may not have sufficient power to detect statistical differences between the 2 groups for each serum inflammatory marker. Second, the open-label design of our study introduces the potential for patients, physicians, or researchers to be influenced by their knowledge of a patient&#x02019;s treatment allocation. Nevertheless, blinded end-point assessment by outcome adjudicators, laboratory blood technicians, and data analysts minimized the potential biases. Third, the short 30-day follow-up period after the completion of treatment limits our ability to resolve the long-term effects of STS on serum inflammatory markers, and also hinders our ability to determine the potential benefit of STS in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, we demonstrate in this trial that an 80&#x02009;mg intravenous dose of STS administered daily for 14 days, as an adjunct to standard medical therapy with uniformly-dosed atorvastatin, further reduced the levels of circulating inflammatory markers including hs-CRP, IL-6, MCP-1, and sCD40L in CAD patients compared to standard medical therapy alone. The apparent additive effect of STS in reducing the level of MCP-1 even persisted to 30 days after the completion of treatment. Our study also demonstrated a considerable improvement in angina symptoms, including the frequency and severity of angina pectoris, as compared with standard medical therapy alone. Given that no previous high-quality study has examined the effect of STS on hs-CRP and other inflammatory markers in CAD patients, our findings shed light on the benefit and safety of an integrative statin&#x02009;+&#x02009;STS regimen for CAD patients with enhanced inflammatory reaction, thereby offering potential implications for clinical practice. Whether the additional reduction of inflammatory factors in CAD patients will ultimately reduce future cardiovascular events and yield long-term prognostic benefit will be the focus of future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par24">The study protocol (2012XL022-2) was approved by the ethics review board of Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS), and is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

After 14 days, patients in both groups continued to receive guideline-based standard medical therapy for CAD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par31">Serum hs-CRP level was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included 1) the levels of other inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, TNF-&#x1d6fc;, VCAM-1, sCD40L, MCP-1, and MMP-9, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 2) the extent of improvement in angina symptoms; and 3) treatment safety.</p><p id="Par32">The extent of improvement in angina symptoms was evaluated by a scoring system (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) based on the frequency, duration, and intensity of angina episodes, as well as the dose of nitroglycerin utilized, according to &#x0201c;Cardiovascular Drug Clinical Research Guiding Principles&#x0201d; by the Ministry of Health, People&#x02019;s Republic of China, 1998. The total angina score ranges from a minimum 0 points (no angina) to a maximum 24 points, and higher score indicates more severe angina symptoms.</p><p id="Par33">To assess treatment safety, patients were asked to report any side effects or changes in feelings that they had noticed. In addition, the results of routine blood, urine, and stool tests, liver and kidney function tests, coagulation tests, and electrocardiogram tests were also considered in the evaluation of safety. Finally, adverse events including death, adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.) were closely monitored and recorded by the clinical researchers during the whole study period.</p><p id="Par34">All outcomes were measured at baseline, immediately after completion of the 14-day treatment, and at 30 days after completion of treatment. No changes to the designated trial outcomes were made after the study commenced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p id="Par35">Because the data needed to perform an <italic>a priori</italic> sample size calculation for this pilot study was not available, we adopted the sample size of a comparable trial which involved 60 subjects randomized into two groups of 30 each<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For our study, planned to recruit 72 patients, assuming conservatively that 20% of the participants would be lost to follow-up. No interim analyses were undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par36">A member of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology (ICP) of Xiyuan Hospital who was independent of the study used SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to perform a permuted-block randomization, generating a sequence of 72 random numbers. To maintain concealment, the group assignments were relayed by another member of the ICP using a central randomization strategy. Once a patient met all the criteria for enrollment in the trial, the group assignment was delivered by telephone to the clinical researchers. Given that the color of the STS solution is unique and challenging to emulate, unblinding was permitted at the physician and patient levels only after baseline data was collected. In order to minimize biases as much as possible, all other potential sources of information that may reveal treatment allocation to the patients were judiciously guarded. Additionally, the details of treatment allocation were not disclosed to any patient until the study had concluded, and all study participants were discouraged from discussing with one another their involvement in the trial. Finally, the clinical researchers strictly abided by the study&#x02019;s random design and interacted with the patients in each group with as few differences as possible. Blinding was maintained at the level of outcome assessment. The individuals performing laboratory blood analyses, data management, and statistical analysis were independent of the clinical component of the study, and were not provided with any information that may reveal treatment allocation details.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par37">Statistical analyses were performed with SAS9.3 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical data were reported as counts with the percentage of the total and continuous data as a mean with standard deviation, or as a median with 95% confidence interval (CI) or interquartile range (IQR). The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used for comparisons of categorical data. Because serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF&#x1d6fc;, VCAM-1, sCD40L, MCP-1, and MMP-9 were measurement data, an independent Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the analysis of intergroup differences when the date meet the normal distribution; Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used when the distribution of levels of the data was non-normality. In addition, comparison of inflammatory markers levels within the group be conducted by paired t-test or paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to the analysis of intergroup differences of total angina scores because the distribution of levels of the data was non-normality. All tests were two tailed and a statistical probability of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
