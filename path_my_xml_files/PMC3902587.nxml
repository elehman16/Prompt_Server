It is characterized by symptoms like- <italic>Aswedanam</italic>, <italic>Mahavastum</italic>, <italic>Matsyashakalopamam</italic>, etc., these characteristic features has a striking similarity with Psoriasis. It is a papulosqaumous disorder of the skin, characterized by sharply defined erythmatosqaumous lesion. Due to its chronic and recurrent nature, it has a great impact on the quality of life of the patients. The present study was aimed to compare the effect of <italic>Navayasa Rasayana Leha</italic> and <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> tablet along with <italic>Dhatryadhyo Lepa</italic> in patients of <italic>Ekkakushta</italic> (psoriasis).

Most prominent precipitating factors reported by the patients of this series were climate (87.38%) and emotional stress (84.68%). The role of climate as a trigger is also supported by many studies.
