imposes a heavy burden on the health-care system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>The COMPAS randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority trial examined the safety of
long-term remote monitoring of pacemakers. Between December 2005 and January 2008, 538
patients were randomly assigned to remote monitoring follow-up (active group) vs.
standard care (control group). The primary objective was to confirm that the proportion
of patients who experienced at least one major adverse event (MAE), including all-cause
death and hospitalizations for device-related or cardiovascular adverse events, was not
&#x0003e;7% higher in the active than in the control group. MAE-free survivals and
quality of life were compared in both groups. The characteristics of the study groups
were similar. Over a follow-up of 18.3 months, 17.3% of patients in the active
and 19.1% in the control group experienced at least one MAE (<italic>P</italic>
&#x0003c; 0.01 for non-inferiority). Hospitalizations for atrial arrhythmias (6 vs. 18)
and strokes (2 vs. 8) were fewer (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and the number of
interim ambulatory visits was 56% lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in
the active than the control group. Changes in pacemaker programming or drug regimens
were made in 62% of visits in the active vs. 29% in the control group
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Quality of life remained unchanged in both
groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Remote monitoring was a safe alternative to conventional care and significantly lowered

function and patient clinical status, and may prompt the reprogramming of the device or
changes in medication regimens. The efficiency of this strategy is, however, questionable
since, in the majority of scheduled visits, the device programming or drug regimen is left
unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C3">3</xref></sup> To optimize the
follow-up of device recipients, systems have been developed, which allow the automatic
teletransmission of data stored in the devices' memories, including battery voltage,
lead characteristics, and arrhythmias. The data sent by a home transmitter allow the remote
surveillance of patients and eliminate unnecessary ambulatory visits. Clinical studies of
these new systems have been conducted mostly in recipients of cardioverter defibrillators,
and only a few studies of permanently paced patients have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C10">10</xref></sup></p><p>The French randomized, multicentre &#x02018;COMPArative follow-up Schedule with home

follow-up of patients with regard to the adverse events related or unrelated to the
implanted devices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Primary study objective</title><p>The primary objective of this non-inferiority trial was to confirm that the proportion of

centres participated, including 30 public and 13 private institutions (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehr419/-/DC1">Supplementary material online, appendices</ext-link>). The trial protocol, which
complied with the declaration of Helsinki, was reviewed and approved by the pertinent
National Ethics Committees, and all patients granted their written, informed consent to
participate. COMPAS was sponsored by Biotronik SE and Co. KG that participated to the
study design and data monitoring. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and pacing
indications were randomly assigned to an active vs. a control group at least 1 month after
the pacemaker implantation.</p><p>The patients assigned to the active group were monitored daily by telecardiology. No
interim visit was scheduled in the active group, but in case of device dysfunction
(technical issue) or health event (medical issue), the cardiologist investigator was
notified by e-mail, prompting the rescheduling of the next follow-up visit, if necessary.
It is noteworthy, however, that remote monitoring was not a substitute for emergency
medical services. The management of remote FU was organized in each centre either by
direct access of the physician to the transmitted data or by delegation to an allied
professional specifically educated to perform this task during office hours. No reaction
time was imposed by the protocol, the patients were duly informed that the physician could
only evaluate remote data during office hours and days. The events were assigned a level
of warning. Level I prompted a mandatory interim follow-up to be scheduled as soon as
possible. Level II prompted an optional interim follow-up left to the physician's
decision (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHR419TB1">1</xref></italic>).
Patients assigned to the control group were managed according to the usual practices of
each participating medical centre, and the follow-up schedule was left to the
physicians' discretion. So the dates of FU were not imposed by the protocol but
physicians were encouraged to comply with guidelines. Both patient groups were followed
for 18 months. At each follow-up visit, and at the end of the trial, 18 months after
random assignment of the patient, the investigators interrogated the pacing system and
recorded the possible occurrence of clinical events. We examined the contributions and
reliability of remote monitoring in the early detection of MAE, and measured the number of
contributory follow-ups, defined as a visit prompting a change in patient management or
reprogramming of the pacemaker. Quality of life was assessed at the time of enrolment and
at the end of the study by means of the SF-36 questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C11">11</xref></sup></p><p>The patients assigned to the control group were also remotely monitored, though the data
were not used for patient surveillance and were not made available online to the physician
investigators. This allowed a retrospective comparison between the two groups of the delay
between the remote monitoring warning message and subsequent medical interventions, such
as (i) contributory interim follow-ups, as defined earlier, or (ii) hospitalizations.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data collection, management, monitoring, and analyses</title><p>The data were collected at each medical centre on case report forms completed by the
investigators and dedicated staff, under the supervision of study coordinators and with
the assistance of study monitors assigned by the sponsor. Specific responsibilities of the
study coordinators included (a) the verification, along with the study monitors, of the
completeness and accuracy of the case report forms, (b) analysis of the data in
collaboration with the investigators, (c) support of the publication and presentation of
the study results, and (d) preparation of the adverse event report forms and supporting
information for evaluation by a member of the Safety Monitoring Committee, composed of
three expert cardiologists who did not participate in the trial and were unaware of the
random patient assignment to the active vs. the control group. The adverse event report
forms and supporting documentation were reviewed by a member of the Safety Monitoring
Committee for confirmation of the investigator's classification of seriousness and
outcome. Discordant classifications were reviewed by all members of the committee and
final classifications were reached by consensus. The statistical analyses were performed
by a biostatistician employed by the sponsor.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The size of the randomized population was calculated to reach a &#x0003e;80% power
to confirm the non-inferiority of remote monitoring compared with standard follow-ups,
assuming a 7% incidence of primary study endpoint in both groups and with a
non-inferiority margin of 7%, a 5% significance level, and assuming a
10% rate of non-compliance. The patients were randomly assigned to an active vs. a
control group, in even blocks among study centres. The baseline characteristics of the two
study groups were compared by two-sided &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for nominal, qualitative
variables, and by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for normally distributed,
quantitative, continuous and discrete variables. The normal distribution of variables was
verified, using the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov and Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk tests. Survival free
from MAE were estimated by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and compared, using the log-rank
test. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the likelihood of
survival, after verifying the proportional hazard assumption. Cox model was also used to
verify the non-inferiority of remote monitoring vs. primary care in various patient
subgroups. The event rates of each component of the composite primary study objective were
also measured separately. Odds (OR) and hazard (HR) ratios were calculated and the
confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated with Miettinen's method. Friedman's
non-parametric, repeated-measures analysis was used to compare the SF-36-scale and summary
scores. We estimated the number of follow-ups per patient-year, with 95% CI, in
each study group, assuming a Poisson distribution. A <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;
0.05 was considered significant. The SPSS statistical software, version 18.0 (SPSS
Institute, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient population</title><p>Between December 2005 and January 2008, 538 patients (mean age = 76 &#x000b1; 9

conventional, scheduled follow-ups, (ii) enabled the early detection of a variety of adverse
events, and (iii) decreased significantly the number of ambulatory follow-up visits.</p><p>The increasing rate of cardiac device implantations is increasing the burden of specialized
medical centres to a point of becoming unmanageable. Remote monitoring offers an alternate
management strategy, which decreases the need for follow-up visits. The safety and clinical
benefits conferred by a systematic application of this technology needs to be thoroughly
validated. While the TRUST trial confirmed that remote monitoring of ICD recipients was as
safe and effective as standard care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C12">12</xref></sup> no clinical trial had examined its performance in permanently paced
patients. By its non-inferiority design, the COMPAS trial confirmed the safety of remote
monitoring in this specific population. In addition, although the study was not powered to
make these comparisons, significant differences were observed between the two study groups
in the rates of hospitalizations for the management of atrial arrhythmias and strokes.
Several follow-ups prompted by remote monitoring, which enabled the early detection and
management of atrial arrhythmias in the active group, may have prevented the development of
more serious adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The <italic>a posteriori</italic> analysis of all daily transmissions by remote monitoring,
including those recorded in the control group, revealed a considerably longer delay in
medical interventions in the control than in the active group, representing a temporal gain
of nearly 120 days. It is noted that in the active group, this delay was left free to each
physician according to the emergency of the warning message and his knowledge of the patient
profile, so the delay could be more or less prompt. The retrospective analysis of AWARE,
including over 11 000 patients from 23 countries, found similarly that, compared with
conventional biannual scheduled visits, remote monitoring advanced the detection of adverse
events by a mean of 154 days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C14">14</xref></sup> a
time interval similar to the 144 days observed in COMPAS.</p><p>While one might argue with the selection of devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C15">15</xref></sup> all patients enrolled in the COMPAS trial were
recipients of dual chamber pacemakers. The atrial lead, by enabling the detection of atrial
arrhythmias (a function unavailable in single chamber pacemakers), may have played a role in
the added value of remote monitoring. Moreover, for safety reason, the study included only
non-pacemaker-dependent patients, but now it would be interesting to evaluate remote
monitoring for patients with spontaneous ventricular rates &#x0003c;30 b.p.m.</p><p>The majority of adverse events in COMPAS was clinical, and few technical events, such as
lead dysfunction, were observed, probably because the follow-up was limited to 18 months. A
longer period of observation would have allowed the detection of a higher number of
technical adverse events and would have included the management of the end of pacemaker
battery life. The difference of complications related to the pacing system observed in
COMPAS is difficult to interpret due to the few number of events. Furthermore, by study
design, the total number of follow-ups over 18 months was 36% lower in the active
than in the control group. Before the final 18-month follow-up imposed by the protocol, the
decrease reached nearly 60%. Finally, over 70% of the routine ambulatory
visits in the control group were non-contributory, whereas the much less frequent and
unscheduled follow-ups prompted by remote monitoring in the active group were usually
medically appropriate.</p><p>The results of this trial confirmed that remote monitoring is not a substitute for an
emergency system, as it prompted only a few hospitalizations. However, it safely eliminated
unnecessary follow-up visits and allowed the early detection of events, prompting more
appropriate follow-up visits. It is noteworthy that over 40% of the overall
population transmitted no warning message. A similar 47% of patients regularly
monitored remotely transmitted no warning messages in the AWARE and 40% in the OEDIPE
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHR419C14">14</xref></sup> Moreover, over 50% of patients in the active
group needed no interim follow-ups. The observations made in this trial might soon set a new
standard of care for the follow-up of pacemaker recipients.</p><p>The important reduction in FU suggests evaluating economic implications. The results of
this costs analysis will be shown in a forthcoming publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the COMPAS trial, long-term remote monitoring of pacemaker recipients was a safe
