Patients will be aged 45&#x02013;80, undergoing unilateral primary hip arthroplasty, with no plan for contralateral procedure within the study timeframe, and able to comply with the protocol. Participants will be randomised to receive either a short (125&#x000a0;mm) or a standard (150&#x000a0;mm) Exeter V40 stem. The Contemporary acetabular component will be used in all cases. All implants will be cemented.</p><p id="Par3">Patient pain, function and satisfaction will be assessed using change from baseline measurement in Oxford Hip Score, Forgotten Joint Score, EQ-5D, pain numerical rating scores, and patient satisfaction questionnaire at baseline and at 1 and 2&#x000a0;years following surgery. Radiographic assessment will evaluate stem position and will be appraised by independent reviewers. Patients will be blind to implant allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Stem length may be associated with outcome; however, we can find no randomised trial in which researchers investigated the effect of stem length on patient outcome following cemented total hip arthroplasty.

Over 100,000 procedures were carried out in the UK in 2016, with established implants demonstrating 10-year survival rates of more than 95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Various companies produce implants for hip arthroplasty and most have good long-term track records of success. The orthopaedic manufacturing industry supports the continual development of implant technology with a view to enhancing patient outcomes and prolonging implant longevity.</p><p id="Par10">Recent developments in hip arthroplasty have focused on achieving the best fit in all patients through the use of shorter femoral stems. Short stems are suggested to eliminate problems with proximal-distal mismatch, excessive femoral bowing and diaphyseal deformity, which can make the surgical intervention more challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The implantation of smaller components hypothetically also results in less damage to bone and soft tissue, and offers preservation of bone stock, which is advantageous in the event that future revision surgery is required. Despite widespread use in clinical practice, there is a lack of randomised trial evidence to support the potential benefits of using the short stems in total hip arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The original Exeter total hip arthroplasty femoral stem was designed in 1970 at a length of 150&#x000a0;mm and has been employed successfully since. The Universal stem was introduced in 1988, with an identical implanted portion of the stem to the current design, but a different trunnion taper. The current &#x02018;V40&#x02019; Exeter stem design with the V40 taper was introduced in 2001, with excellent reported long-term survivorship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, however, it has become apparent that the design may not be optimal for all patients. The &#x02018;original&#x02019; 150&#x000a0;mm stem may be difficult to insert in certain groups, such as Dorr A femurs and those with excessive bow or femoral deformity, e.g. from a previous fracture. This observation has led to the design of a shortened Exeter V40 stem (125&#x000a0;mm) for use in revision surgery with the exact same design characteristics aside from the shorter length. This shorter stem has been successfully employed for revision cases and is being increasingly used &#x02018;off label&#x02019; in primary surgery, where the new geometry allows for a better anatomical fit in some cases. The worry is that this stem is too small and thus has too thin a cross section, with the potential of stem fracture occurring when using the revision stem in primary total hip replacement. As a result, the manufacturer has designed a range of 125&#x000a0;mm stem sizes that parallel the original 150&#x000a0;mm length stems for use in primary surgery. The new, shorter 125&#x000a0;mm stem range is sized at No. 1, thus providing better stem strength whilst being shorter to fit in Dorr A femurs. These &#x02018;short&#x02019; stems have been CE marked and are in routine use. However, there are theoretical concerns that the shortened 125&#x000a0;mm stem length could result in an increased incidence of varus malalignment at the time of cementation, which in turn may be associated with worse patient clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par12">Choy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] recently used data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry to suggest that, at 7&#x000a0;years post-surgery, there is no significant difference in the cumulative percent revision rate in the Exeter short stem (3.4%, 95% CI 2.4&#x02013;4.8%) compared with the standard length Exeter stem (3.5%, 95% CI 3.3&#x02013;3.8%); however, this data does not include patient quality of life and functional outcomes. Consequently, as part of the responsible introduction of implantable technology, a randomised trial comparing the new 125&#x000a0;mm stem design against standard 150&#x000a0;mm length stems should be conducted to ensure equivalence of outcomes compared to the original stem design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par13">The primary objective of the &#x02018;Can Arthroplasty Stem INfluence Outcome?&#x02019; (CASINO) study is to assess whether using the 125&#x000a0;mm Exeter V40 stem in total hip arthroplasty achieves an equivalent change in patient-reported pain and function as the 150&#x000a0;mm Exeter V40 stem at 1&#x000a0;year.

It uses a 5-point Likert response format, consists of 12 questions, and the raw score is transformed to a range from 0 to 100 points. High scores indicate good outcome, i.e. a high degree of being able to forget about the affected joint in daily life. The FJS has a low ceiling effect and especially discriminates between good, very good and excellent outcome after total hip or total knee arthroplasty. In its validation study, it showed high internal consistency and discriminated well between patient groups known to show different outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The EQ-5D is a standardised instrument with five items for use as a measure of self-reported general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. It is one of the most frequently used measures to gain quality of life scores for analysis in health economy as utility weights for calculating the quality-adjusted life years can be obtained.</p><p id="Par29">Global hip pain severity will be assessed using an 11 point (0&#x02013;10) numerical rating scale, where 0 represents no pain and 10 the worst possible pain.

The cement mantle will be evaluated as described by Barrack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Length at the hip will be assessed by evaluating a line drawn across the inferior aspect of the obturator foramen (&#x02018;tear drops&#x02019;). Trial participant radiographs will be reviewed and graded by two independent experts (surgeons) from NHS Lothian. It is not possible to blind the reviewers to allocation (this will be apparent on the radiograph). The surgeons will review and report the films separately.

The Exeter V40 is the dominant brand of cemented femoral stem used in the UK with greater than 60% of market share [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The stem range has been expanded to include short stem options. Whilst national joint registries collect data regarding the implantable devices, the granularity of implant data is variable and few routinely collate patient outcome scores. To our knowledge, there is no randomized trial evidence to evaluate whether the outcome of 125&#x000a0;mm short stem procedures are equivalent to those following procedures carried with the original 150&#x000a0;mm stem length.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par45">CASINO benefits from the use of a variety of outcome metrics. We are collecting the OHS and EQ-5D as these are the mainstay of outcome analysis following total hip arthroplasty in the UK and this facilitates wider comparative interpretation. These questionnaires are augmented by the use of more sensitive and discriminative metrics. The FJS-12 has proven to be a more responsive tool, with greater measurement range, improved discriminative ability and effect size compared to the OHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Pain intensity is evaluated with direct evaluation of that construct using multiple rating scales. Radiographic review will directly evaluate any difference in position of the stem.</p><p id="Par46">Patient outcome metrics can be influenced by dysfunction in the contralateral limb, and as such&#x000a0;&#x000a0;we aim to ensure that the patients taking part in CASINO are not suffering symptomatic bilateral joint disease that would likely result in&#x000a0;both hips being replaced within the study timeframe. This inclusion criteria enhances the validity of the study outcomes; however, it may compromise the generalisability of the findings. CASINO has been designed to investigate short-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes, however,&#x000a0;the longer term metric of the success of an implant is longevity and surgical revision rate. 95% implant survival at 10&#x000a0;years is expected of all modern prostheses and such evaluation is outside the scope of this study. However, to facilitate future longer term evaluation,&#x000a0;of this study cohort we have caped the age of participants to CASINO at 80&#x000a0;years. This inclusion criterion many also somewhat limit generalisability.</p><p id="Par47">The results of this trial will be presented at scientific meetings and submitted for publication in relevant peer-reviewed journals.
