The difference between before and after treatment FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio was calculated and compared between groups by ANOVA and it no significant difference was observed between treatment groups and placebo.(<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.51, respectively) After adjusting the effect of baseline FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio by ANCOVA the result didn&#x02019;t changed too (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54, respectively). The magnitude of increase in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio was corresponding in the three groups. However, clinically improved lung function(Reduction in MMRC) was observed in all cases and was significant in the majority of patients. The MMRC in Calcitroil group showed a significant decrease from 3.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.49 at baseline to 1.98&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.65after treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).

The difference between before and after treatment MMRC was calculated and compared between groups by ANOVA and Tukey test and significant difference was observed between calcitriol group vs. placebo (1.46 vs. 0.71 <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

In Calcitriol group, however, the variation from 54.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;34.9 to 57.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;44.4&#x000a0;nmol/l was not significant. The same result was seen in placebo group. The plasma level of 1,25OH-D was not affected significantly by any of treatments [Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">This study revealed that short term treatment with neither calcitriol nor vitamin D has any effect on pulmonary function of COPD patients during exacerbation, nevertheless the MMRC in Calcitroil group showed a significant decrease. The level of calcitriol did not change during this study, but the increase in 25(OH) vitamin D in group B indicated the compliance of the patient in ingesting the drug.</p><p id="Par47">A number of studies have stated 25-OHD serum levels in COPD patients. One recently published study showed that aspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake in patients receiving vitamin D improved significantly compared with placebo group, but two groups were not statistically different in terms of improved quadriceps strength or six minutes walking distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Also, high doses of vitamin D(100 000&#x000a0;IU every 4&#x000a0;weeks for 1&#x000a0;year) in vitamin D sufficient patients did not have a significant effect on mean time before the appearance of the first exacerbation, exacerbation rates, FEV1, hospitalization, life quality, and death. In participants who had acute vitamin D deficiency at baseline, the use of supplementation could reduce exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The studies of Forli and colleagues showed that more than 50&#x000a0;% of patients enlisted for lung transplantation had vitamin D deficiency (&#x0003c;20&#x000a0;ng/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Likewise, a study on community-dwelling patients in Denmark who suffered from COPD revealed 68&#x000a0;% of the participants had untreated osteoporosis or osteopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is worth noting that insufficient or low levels of vitamin D are not particular to COPD. Patients with COPD are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency for several reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in most population yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The current supplementation with a daily dose of 800 to 1,000&#x000a0;IU of vitamin D makes up for low levels of serum 25-OHD in the majority of adults in concentrations greater than 20&#x000a0;ng/ml, but higher doses may be needed to increase 25-OHD levels proportional to the needs of high-risk patients who don&#x02019;t have hypocalcaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One recent study suggest that &#x0201c;the current vitamin D recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (600&#x000a0;IU/day) is insufficient to cover the skeletal health needs of at least 50&#x000a0;% of black and white children&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In this study most patients were vitamin D sufficient maybe due to extra use of vitamin D supplementation in old population in our country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It was shown that &#x0201c; Vitamin D intake decreased COPD exacerbation and improved FEV1 in the patients with severe and very severe COPD&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Unfortunately in this study which was carried out in our country the baseline level of vitamin D was not determined. It was shown that &#x0201c;vitamin D3 was protective against moderate or severe exacerbation in participants with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 50&#x000a0;nmol/L&#x0201d; too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Our study showed no significant relationship between vitamin D level and FEV1 and or FEV1/FVC, it may be due to sufficient leveled vitamin D in the population of our study. Unfortunately there were not enough vitamin D deficient patients to do any statistical analysis in this subgroup. The present study showed that any relationship between vitamin D level and FEV1 or airway responsiveness may be due to high levels of vitamin D in the patients. The more important cause can be explained by the difference between the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive lung diseases a non-reversible airway disease. The level of CRP didn`t significant difference between three groups it may emphasis that this dose and duration of vitamin D and calcitriol can`t be effective on reducing the inflammation. Due to the great possibility of genetic involvement in Vitamin D's effect on respiratory disease and the high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in Iran, it is suggested to conduct clinical trials among the Iranian people and evaluate the efficacy of Vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Our study had some limitations. First most of our patients were Vitamin D sufficient so we couldn&#x02019;t determine the effect of short term treatment in patient Vitamin D deficiency (which may be more effective). Longer duration with larger sample size study in vitamin D deficient patients with COPD suggests. Second our study was too short to follow the patient for readmission so we recommend study the effect of calcitriol on the frequency of hospitalization. Third as this study were done in normocalcemic patient we had chosen the lowest dosage of calcitriol, higher doses of calcitriol can be used in future studies.</p><p id="Par54">Given the inefficacy of current treatments in COPD, there is still a need for further randomized control trials with vitamin D supplementation. In such randomized controlled trials in which vitamin D treatment is only based on bone maintenance, defining the optimal serum levels for 25-OHD in this disease as reference for other calcemic endpoints is a challenging task. Future clinical trials are suggested to evaluate the impact of higher levels of vitamin D and especially calcitriol on lung function during exacerbation. We suggest investigating this correlation in vitamin D deficient patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par55">Short term treatment with either calcitriol or 25(OH) <sub>2</sub>Vit D didn`t changed FEV1 or FVC in vitamin D sufficient patients with COPD exacerbation; nevertheless it can provide clinical benefit.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>Alb</term><def><p id="Par8">Albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ca</term><def><p id="Par9">Calcium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>25OH-D</term><def><p id="Par10">Vitamin D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>1,25OH-D</term><def><p id="Par11">1,25Vitamin D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par12">C reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Calcitriol</term><def><p id="Par13">Calcitriol</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was a part of a joint project supported by the vise chancellor and physiology research center Kerman University of medical sciences and Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
