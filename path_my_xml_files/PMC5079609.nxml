Since hyperglycemia is the defining characteristic of diabetes, near normalization of blood glucose levels by intensive glycemic control has been proposed as one of the interventions that can be used for this purpose. A meta-analysis of four large randomized clinical trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes has indeed shown that this intervention can lower the risk of myocardial infarction by 15% and that of major cardiovascular events by 9% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, in one of these studies, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, intensive glycemic control was associated with a paradoxical increase in mortality, mainly due to increased cardiovascular deaths (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This prompted early termination of the trial&#x02019;s intensive arm 3.7 years postrandomization. Results of an intention-to-treat analysis at 5 years from randomization showed an 18% significant risk reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarctions, which, however, was offset by a 29% significant increase in cardiovascular mortality (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). While the reasons for this paradoxical rise in mortality are being debated (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we sought to identify genetic predictors of this adverse effect of intensive glycemic control that could be used to select individuals with type 2 diabetes who could be safely treated with this intervention. To this end, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cardiovascular mortality in the ACCORD intensive arm and analyzed the modulating influence of significant loci on the effects of intensive and standard treatments on fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes. These loci were further investigated in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes from the Joslin Clinic as well as in the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Cohorts</title><sec id="s4"><title>ACCORD Study</title><p>ACCORD was designed to test the effect of intensive glycemic control (targeting glycated hemoglobin [HbA<sub>1c</sub>] levels to &#x0003c;6.0% [42 mmol/mol]) on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes, as compared with a standard therapy aimed at HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 7&#x02013;7.9% (53&#x02013;63 mmol/mol) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

To avoid possible confounding and/or heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium patterns due to racial differences, the analysis was restricted to self-reported non-Hispanic white subjects in this arm (<italic>n</italic> = 2,667).</p><p>Due to the differences in genotyping platforms, independent genome-wide analyses were performed in the two genotyping sets (including 2,145 and 522 individuals in the ANYSET and ACCSET, respectively) and results meta-analyzed. For each variant, the expected minor allele dosage, ranging from 0 to 2, was computed from the imputed posterior genotype probabilities. Subsequent statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The association between minor allele dosage and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated for each variant by means of Cox proportional hazards regression assuming an additive genetic model. As in the original ACCORD analysis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the regression models included indicators for the seven clinical center networks, blood pressure or lipid subtrials assignment, and treatment assignments within these subtrials as covariates, along with adjustments for the first three principal components, PC1&#x02013;PC3, which explain a large part of the population admixture of the ACCORD cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0285/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>). All cardiovascular deaths observed in the intensive arm until the end of the study in self-reported non-Hispanic whites (<italic>n</italic> = 84) were included in the analysis. After filtering the results by MAF &#x02265;0.05 and applying a genomic control correction (&#x003bb; = 1.02 and 0.92 for ANYSET and ACCSET, respectively), results from the two genotyping sets were summarized by means of a fixed-effects meta-analysis using an inverse-variance approach in METAL (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Meta-analysis results were considered significant if the <italic>P</italic> value for the variant was less than the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and notable (suggestive) if &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>. Further analyses of variants showing significant or notable associations were conducted among self-reported whites to estimate their effects in the standard therapy group, test for their interaction with treatment assignment, and investigate the effect of a genetic risk score (GRS) calculated by adding the minor allele dosage at the two genome-wide significant loci. The effect of significant variants on nonfatal myocardial infarction was explored in a similar fashion. Kaplan-Meier plots were generated to illustrate the effect of significant variants and to estimate the number of cardiovascular events caused or prevented by treating 1,000 subjects with intensive as opposed to standard therapy for 5 years (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The top two variants were further examined in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) for their correlation with tissue-specific gene expression levels. Genes within 1Mb from either SNP were selected and only tissues that had at least 70 donor samples in the database with matched gene expression and genotype data were included in the analysis. For each tissue and gene, the effect of the SNP minor allele on gene expression was analyzed by linear regression. Beta estimates were then meta-analyzed across all tissues by generic inverse-variance methods.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>JKS</title><p>The average degree of glycemic control while attending the Joslin Clinic was estimated at baseline and at the end of each year of follow-up as the time-weighted average of all HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements available at the Joslin from 1990 (inception of electronic Joslin laboratory records) up to that point in time. These yearly HbA<sub>1c</sub> averages were used to build a cumulative, time-dependent index of glycemic control. For measurements taken before 1994, HbA<sub>1c</sub> values were derived from HbA<sub>1c</sub> values as previously described (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The interaction between good glycemic control (defined as a time-dependent mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the lowest quartile [&#x0003c;7.5% (58 mmol/mol)]) and GRS (constructed from the two lead SNPs of the ACCORD GWAS) on cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by means of Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for age and sex. The JKS first quartile (7.5%) corresponds to the 87th and 43rd percentiles of mean follow-up HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the ACCORD intensive and standard arms, respectively. Thus, this cutoff was a good index within the JKS to reproduce the contrast between intensive and standard control while providing adequate power. The time variable was defined as the time between study entry and the date of death, or, for subjects who did not die, the date of censoring (31 December 2011).</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>ORIGIN Study</title><p>The association between GRS (constructed from the two lead SNPs of ACCORD) and cardiovascular mortality was analyzed in ORIGIN by means of Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for age, sex, and treatment assignment.

Long-term glycemic exposure was estimated from the HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements available for this cohort in the Joslin electronic medical records (median <italic>n</italic> = 23, IQR 12&#x02013;37) over a median time period of 10 years (IQR 6&#x02013;16). In this cohort, good glycemic control (defined as an average HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the lower quartile of the distribution [&#x0003c;7.5% (58 mmol/mol)] and considered as a time-dependent variable) was overall associated with a protective effect on cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.46 [95% 0.28&#x02013;0.76], <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). However, when stratified by GRS, good glycemic control was associated with lower mortality among subjects with GRS = 0 or 1 (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.06&#x02013;1.07] and HR 0.29 [95% CI 0.13&#x02013;0.65], respectively) but not among patients with GRS &#x02265;2 (HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.52&#x02013;2.39]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).

No significant evidence of interaction between GRS and HbA<sub>1c</sub> was observed in this study; although this analysis was limited by the fact that a vast majority of participants had postrandomization HbA<sub>1c</sub> values &#x0003c;7.5% (58 mmol/mol).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intensive glycemic control, that is, aiming for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.0% (42 mmol/mol) rather than between 7.0 and 7.9% (53&#x02013;63 mmol/mol), significantly decreased the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events among high-risk subjects with type 2 diabetes in the ACCORD trial (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This beneficial effect, however, was offset by a paradoxical increase in mortality, mostly due to cardiovascular deaths. Through a GWAS approach, we have identified two genetic markers that were specifically associated with cardiovascular mortality in the intensive arm of ACCORD and, when considered together as a score, could predict whether a participant in this trial was more likely to derive benefit rather than harm from the application of intensive glycemic control. Participants with the lowest score (&#x0223c;20% of the ACCORD population) derived on average the most benefit, experiencing a large reduction in both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Those with an intermediate score (&#x0223c;50% of participants) derived on average some benefit, experiencing a reduction in nonfatal events but not in cardiovascular mortality. Those with the highest scores (&#x0223c;30% of participants) derived on average harm, experiencing a large increase in cardiovascular deaths without any reduction in nonfatal events. The modulatory effect of these genetic markers was independent of previously identified predictors of excess mortality in the ACCORD intensive arm, such as presence of neuropathy, aspirin use, and a high HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>In support of these findings, we observed a similar inverse relationship between GRS and long-term cardiovascular benefits of good glycemic control in the clinical care setting of the Joslin Clinic. The Joslin cohort, with its rich HbA<sub>1c</sub> data, provided a glimpse into whether the GRS interacts with intensive glycemic control in the &#x0201c;real world,&#x0201d; adding to the generalizability of our findings. Among these patients, a high GRS was associated with a neutral effect of good glycemic control rather than a detrimental one, due perhaps to the fact that this cohort was not exposed to a glucose-lowering intervention as intense as in ACCORD. It is remarkable, however, that despite the differences in design and setting, similar patterns of interaction with GRS were observed in the two studies.</p><p>Although there are no other randomized controlled trials having the same exact design as ACCORD, we were able to corroborate our findings in another, albeit different, randomized controlled trial, the ORIGIN study. ORIGIN investigated whether good glycemic control obtained by means of insulin therapy was more beneficial on cardiovascular outcomes than glycemic control obtained by other means (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We found that the GRS was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events also in this study, regardless of the type of treatment. Since both arms were on average in excellent glycemic control at baseline (median HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.4% [46 mmol/mol] in both arms) as well as during the intervention (median HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.0&#x02013;6.5% [42&#x02013;48 mmol/mol]) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), these results are consistent with findings in ACCORD and the JKS, where associations between GRS and cardiovascular mortality were only found in the presence of good glycemic control and/or intensive treatment.</p><p>These findings have potential implications for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. After the report of increased mortality in response to intensive glycemic control in ACCORD, this intervention was dismissed as a viable strategy to decrease cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. The results of our study suggest that it may be possible to revive this therapeutic approach by developing a precision medicine strategy (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), through which intensive treatment is prescribed for those patients who will benefit from it and who are at lower risk of being harmed. The fact that testing for two genetic markers is inexpensive and can be conducted at any point in time makes this possibility especially attractive, although the cost-effectiveness of this approach will have to be evaluated. However, before this possibility can be entertained, these findings must be replicated by other studies. Also, one must consider that ACCORD was specifically directed to subjects with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the genome-wide study was limited to those participants who consented to genetic studies (80% of the total) and self-identified as whites. Whether the described genetic effects also concern subjects with diabetes with different characteristics remains to be determined.</p><p>In addition to their potential as predictive tools, the two variants that we have identified could provide new insights into the mechanisms through which intensive glycemic control affects cardiovascular outcomes, although these can only be speculative at this time. The variant on chromosome 10 (rs9299870) is placed in intron 1 of the <italic>MGMT</italic> gene and associated with tissue expression of this gene as per our analysis of GTEx data. In addition to being involved in DNA repair, MGMT functions as a negative regulator of ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which has been linked, although not unequivocally, to atherosclerosis and thrombosis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A search of the RegulomeDB database (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) shows robust evidence for a regulatory function of rs9299870 based on its occurrence on a DNAse I hypersensitivity cluster where it affects the binding of the transcriptional coactivator CREBBP. As this protein has also been implicated in the increased atherogenesis of diabetes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), our findings may point to an as yet undescribed CREBBP-MGMT-ESR1 pathway linking glucose metabolism to cardiovascular outcomes. The other variant (rs57922) is placed in an intergenic region and associated with <italic>NSA2</italic> expression. Interestingly, <italic>NSA2</italic> is a hyperglycemia-induced gene associated with diabetic nephropathy and involved in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 pathway (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Also, close to rs57922 is a cluster of three LINC RNAs. LINCs are thought to have important regulatory functions, affecting gene expression and cellular processes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, including vascular complications of diabetes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Our genome-wide screen also identified 22 other loci that did not reach genome-wide significance but had <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> for association with cardiovascular mortality in the ACCORD intensive arm. Of these, the MASP2 protein interacts with another CAD-related gene (<italic>MLB2</italic>) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), whereas the platelet phospho-fructokinase (<italic>PFKP</italic>) gene is linked to BMI and interacts with obesity gene <italic>FTO</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of our study include the randomized design, rigorous clinical trial protocol for the ACCORD cohort, and the availability of rich phenotype data with frequent follow-up and high rates of adherence (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Another important strength is the genome-wide approach, allowing the systematic search for genetic effects without preconceived a priori hypotheses. This was further enhanced by the use of an enriched variant set with wide coverage and excellent imputation quality, and by the application of stringent criteria to evaluate significance. Overall, since this analysis tested the effect of genes on clinical cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort enrolled and monitored under rigorous clinical trial conditions, one could anticipate a strong possibility of uncovering novel associations that would be missed or diluted in typical heterogeneous cross-sectional GWAS, even large ones.</p><p>Nonetheless, some limitations should be acknowledged. In addition to the need for replication and the uncertain generalizability mentioned above, one should consider that, due to the relatively small number of events and the stringent significance threshold, the study was powered to detect only large genetic effects. We cannot exclude the existence of other variants exerting a smaller but still relevant influence on the cardiovascular effects of intensive glycemic control. Similarly, one cannot exclude additional genetic influences by low-frequency variants, which were not included in the present analysis. Finally, although our GWAS identified two loci with robust statistical associations with cardiovascular mortality in the intensive glycemic arm of ACCORD, the tests for interaction between treatment and these two loci (singly or combined in a GRS) likely provided downwardly biased <italic>P</italic> values, due to a form of &#x0201c;winner&#x02019;s curse.&#x0201d; The test of gene-treatment interaction in the Joslin cohort is not biased, however, and the results from this study suggest that the observed interaction is not solely due to statistical artifact.</p><p>In summary, we have identified two genome-wide significant loci associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death in the intensive glycemic treatment arm of ACCORD. Our additional analyses suggest that these loci could be potentially used as screening tools to identify subjects with type 2 diabetes who may highly benefit from intensive glycemic control rather than derive harm from it, although further validation is needed. These two loci also point to novel candidate pathways linking glycemic control to cardiovascular outcomes, the study of which may lead to the development of new interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0285/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0285/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article is featured in a podcast available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes-core-update-podcasts">http://www.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes-core-update-podcasts</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn3"><p>See accompanying articles, pp. <related-article id="d36e1796" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-1833" vol="39" page="1854">1854</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1799" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-0738" vol="39" page="1858">1858</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1802" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-1763" vol="39" page="1870">1870</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1805" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-1762" vol="39" page="1874">1874</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1808" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-0645" vol="39" page="1879">1879</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1812" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-0769" vol="39" page="1889">1889</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1815" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-0706" vol="39" page="1896">1896</related-article>, <related-article id="d36e1818" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc15-2464" vol="39" page="1902">1902</related-article>, and <related-article id="d36e1821" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dc16-1111" vol="39" page="1909">1909</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Acknowledgments.</bold> The authors thank the investigators, staff, and participants of the ACCORD study for their support and contributions and for giving us access to this rich dataset.</p><p><bold>Funding.</bold> The ACCORD genome-wide association analysis was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants HL110400 (to A.D.) and HL110380 (to J.B.B.).
