During recent years there have been an increasing growth of e-mental health technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the amount of electronic platforms for self-monitoring in mental health, including bipolar disorder, is increasing rapidly. Recently, electronic self-monitoring of depressive and manic symptoms using regular cell phones to prompt patients with bipolar disorder to respond to weekly text messages has been suggested as an easy and inexpensive way to continuously monitor and identify prodromal depressive and manic symptoms and in this way allowing for health care providers to intervene shortly after symptoms first appear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Other articles reporting on electronic self-monitoring have used personal digital assistants (PDAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], computers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as the electronic self-monitoring tools, but none of the studies have however included data on objective measures of illness activity and the effect of electronic self-monitoring has only been investigated sparingly in randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is likely that the ability of these electronically self-monitored subjective measures may not be sufficient to detect prodromal depressive and manic symptoms compared to automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity (objective measures) such as phone usage, social activity, physical activity, and mobility. Social activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], i.e., engaging in relations to others, as well as physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] represent central and sensitive aspects of illness activity in bipolar disorder, but none of the articles used patients monitored during non-experimental daily life, in naturalistic settings and with collection of real-time data.</p><p>Our group developed and tested the MONitoring, treAtment and pRediCtion of bipolAr disorder episodes system (the MONARCA system), an Android smartphone-based electronic self-monitoring system, in a number of studies during recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The MONARCA system allowed for electronic subjective self-monitoring of mood, sleep, activity level, irritability, stress, medicine intake, alcohol consumption and other subjective personal measures and included a bi-directional feedback loop between patients and health care providers. The system also collected automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity, such as accelerometer data, the number of incoming and outgoing phone calls/ day, and the number of incoming and outgoing text messages/ day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The initial MONARCA pilot studies showed a high acceptance of the system and a higher compliance to self-monitoring than when monitoring on a paper-based version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Further studies showed that electronic self-monitoring of depressive and manic symptoms using the MONARCA system correlated with observer-based clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 item (HDRS-17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], respectively. Furthermore, HDRS-17 and YMRS correlated with a number of automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity collected by the smartphone (e.g. the number and duration of incoming and outgoing calls/day and the number of outgoing text-messages/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The MONARCA I RCT investigated the effect of daily electronic self-monitoring of subjective measures using the MONARCA system including a bi-directional feedback loop between the patient and clinicians compared with using a smartphone for normal communicative purposes in patients with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Overall no differences between the intervention group and the control group was found, but findings from sub-analyses suggested that patients using the MONARCA system had more sustained depressive symptoms than the control group and fewer manic symptoms in periods with presence of manic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>It has never been tested in a RCT whether electronic self-monitoring of subjective measures including a feedback loop integrating subjective as well as automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity in patients with bipolar disorder improves illness outcome.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Using a smartphone-based monitoring system for daily electronic self-monitoring including an integrated feedback loop on both subjective and automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity (phone usage, social activity, physical activity, and mobility) (the Monsenso system) reduces the severity of depressive and manic symptoms and rate of depressive and manic episodes in adult patients with bipolar disorder more than standard treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>To investigate in a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial whether the use of a smartphone-based monitoring system including an integrated feedback loop on both subjective and automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity (phone usage, social activity, physical activity, and mobility), the Monsenso system, reduces depressive and manic symptoms, the rate of depressive and manic episodes, the total number of days hospitalized, and improves psychosocial function, perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms, recovery, empowerment, and medicine adherence more than standard treatment in adult patients with bipolar disorder.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial protocol is reported according to the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The trial protocol describes a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial investigating the effect of using the Monsenso system on a daily basis, this including an integrated feedback loop, compared with using a smartphone for normal communicative purposes in adult patients with bipolar disorder.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design and study organization</title><p>The MONARCA II trial is a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial with an unbalanced allocation ratio (2:1) of adult patients with bipolar disorder.

This corresponds to approximately 400 potential participants. The Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder is a specialized outpatient clinic that covers a recruitment area of the Capital Region, Denmark, corresponding to 1.4 million people. The staff consists of full-time specialists in psychiatry with a specific clinical experience and knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder as well as certified psychologist, nurses and a social worker with experience in bipolar disorder. Patients with bipolar disorder were referred to the Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder from secondary healthcare when a diagnosis of a single mania or bipolar disorder was made for the first time or in the case of occurrence of treatment resistance (persistent depressive or manic symptoms or recurrence despite treatment in standard care). The physicians at the clinic followed the patients with evidence-based psychopharmacological treatment and regular appointments. Treatment at the Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder comprised combined psychopharmacological treatment as according to the guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and supporting therapy for a 2-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Inclusion criteria: All patients between the age of 18 to 75 years with a bipolar disorder diagnosis according to ICD-10 using Schedules for Clinical assessments in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] who have been treated and discharged from The Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder, Denmark from the period 2004 to January 2016 are invited to participate in the MONARCA II trial.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Patients who have received the MONARCA system as part of previous studies are excluded.

If the patients wish to change their subjective evaluation they can enter a second evaluation in addition to the initial one, and both of the subjective evaluations are then visible for the patient and the health care provider when logging on to in the Monsenso system. If the patients forget to evaluate the subjective measures it is possible to enter and evaluate retrospectively for up to two days. It is then noted in the Monsenso system that the subjective measures are collected retrospectively.

Furthermore, speech activity is collected by extraction of different voice features during phone calls. Voice feature extraction will take place directly on the smartphones and no recording of the actual speech/conversation will take place.</p><p>Thus, we will be able to investigate correlations between automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity and the severity of depressive and manic symptoms of all participants in the trial, using smartphones capable of collecting automatically generated data on measures of illness activity, including the ones allocated by randomization to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians in the intervention group</title><p>A study nurse with experience with bipolar disorder is assigned to the patients allocated to the intervention group of the MONARCA II trial. The MONARCA II study nurse is responsible for the integrated feedback loop. Patients allocated to the intervention group of the MONARCA II trial have the Monsenso application installed on a smartphone, and this automatically transfers the self-monitored subjective measures and for some smartphones also the automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity (Flow diagram in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to servers at the hospital through secure connections (I-suite number RHP-2011-03). By giving informed consent to participate in the MONARCA II trial, the patients allow for the MONARCA II study nurse and their health care provider to access the monitored data through a secure web interface. The MONARCA II study nurse goes through the collected data two to three times a week, or more often on patients where it is deemed necessary. A personal homepage is set up on a server allowing for the patients to access all their own data through a similar secure web interface.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The feedback loop on subjective measures: Regardless the choice of smartphone a feedback loop on the subjective measures is established. A standard of scoring thresholds for when the MONARCA II study nurse initially should react was made.

A design with an unbalanced allocation ration was chosen since the integrated feedback loop using smartphones capable of collecting automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity or not is not based on the same amount of collected data, and thus comprising two versions of the integrated feedback loop. The choice of smartphone used is chosen by the patients themselves at inclusion <italic>before</italic> the randomization, and is estimated to by approximately 50% on each of these types of smartphones (smartphones capable of collecting automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity (e.g. different versions of Android smartphones) or not (e.g. iPhones)).

Allocation is concealed in numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes and stored in a securely locked cabinet of unknown location to others than the research secretary (HGN). Allocation is identified by the letter A or B written on the paper (different colour of paper for the two different randomization groups) inside the envelopes and this indicate the allocation to intervention (intervention group or control group). The translation of the letters A and B was made and known to only KM, LVK and the MONARCA II study nurse. A paper with this translation is kept in a securely locked cabinet of unknown location to others than KM and LVK. The secretary (HGN) gives the allocation envelopes to the MONARCA II study nurse after enrolment and baseline assessments of the patients. Corresponding allocation envelopes are opened only after all baseline assessments are performed and the patients&#x02019; names and social security numbers are written on both the envelopes and the randomization papers. The MONARCA II study nurse assigns patients to their allocation of intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the type of intervention in the MONARCA II trial, the patient, the patients&#x02019; health care provider and the MONARCA II study nurse are aware of the allocated randomization group.

The trial is therefore single-blinded. The MONARCA II study nurse does not collect any outcome measures. All patients are thoroughly and at each visit with the researcher instructed not to mention anything about randomization allocation. The risk of unblinding due to simply seeing the patients&#x02019; smartphone is minimized since all patients use a smartphone during the trial period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data from all randomized patients are collected until dropout or the end of the trial period.

The MONARCA system included a feedback loop on subjective self-monitored measures between patients and clinicians and was tested by the authors in multiple studies, this including a RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The integrated feedback loop and prediction models in the Monsenso system are therefore not based on the same amount of data in the two smartphone groups.

The MONARCA II trial is designed to include a control group of patients using a smartphone for normal communicative purposes, a placebo smartphone. Automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity is collected on all patients using a smartphones capable of collecting these data during the trial period, including the patients in the control group, this allowing for correlation analyses between depressive and manic symptoms and the automatically generated behavioural data on measures of illness activity in a larger sample of patients with bipolar disorder.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Generalizability</title><p>A RCT represents a study design with possible high interval validity, but this with a possible cost of lower external validity and thereby lower generalizability of the study results. The MONARCA II trial recruits patients who have received treatment at and been discharged from a tertiary specialized mood disorder clinic, however including patients with recent onset of bipolar disorder, whom in most countries are treated elsewhere. Further, the trial has a pragmatic design with few exclusion criteria. In addition, as the Monsenso system is user-friendly for both the patients and the health care providers, and previous MONARCA studies showed a high acceptance and compliance of the previous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the findings of the MONARCA II trial are believed to be generalizable to patients with bipolar disorder in general.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Electronic monitoring using smartphones represents a flexible and adjustable system that could be of great support for both patients and health care providers, and possibly increase the patients&#x02019; illness insight, empowerment and awareness of early warning signs of upcoming depressive or manic episodes.</p><p>If the Monsenso system is proved effective in reducing the level of depressive and/or manic symptoms (and other symptoms of bipolar disorder) and the rate of depressive and manic episodes in the present trial, there will be basis for extending the use of the system to the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder in general and in a larger scale. Potentially electronic monitoring using smartphones may be applied in relation to patients suffering from other mental disorders. In this way, it is possible that outpatient treatment in general can be optimized, and that the frequency of necessary health care provider/physician/clinician and other clinical staff visits can be reduced and be more flexible according to the needs of the patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>MFJ has been a consultant for Eli Lilly.
