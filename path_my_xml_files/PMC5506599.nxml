Ceftiofur is the only third-generation cephalosporin labeled for veterinary use in the USA, and it is the drug of choice in the majority of dairy farms for the treatment of mastitis. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to describe longitudinal changes that occur in the milk microbiome before, during, and after infection and treatment with ceftiofur. Twelve animals were intramammary challenged with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in one quarter and randomly allocated to receive intramammary treatment with ceftiofur (5d) or untreated controls. Serial samples were collected from &#x02212;72 to 216&#x000a0;h relative to challenge from the challenged quarter, an ipsilateral quarter assigned to the same treatment group, and from a third quarter that did not undergo intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> dramatically impacted microbial diversity. Ceftiofur significantly decreased LogCFUs but had no significant effect on the milk microbiome, rate of pathogen clearance, or somatic cell count. At the end of the study, the microbial profile of infected quarters was indistinguishable from pre-challenge samples in both treated and untreated animals. Intramammary infusion with ceftiofur did not alter the healthy milk (i.e., milk devoid of clots or serous appearance and collected from a mammary gland that shows no clinical signs of mastitis) microbiome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our results indicate that the mammary gland harbors a resilient microbiome, capable of reestablishing itself after experimental infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> independent of antimicrobial treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0291-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Milk microbiome</kwd><kwd>Mastitis</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Ceftiofur</kwd><kwd>Dairy cattle</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial treatment</kwd><kwd>Milk</kwd><kwd>Third-generation cephalosporin</kwd><kwd>Cephalosporins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-67015-21233</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Mastitis is a prevalent, costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] disease in dairy cows that is defined by an increase in milk somatic cell count (<bold>SCC</bold>) as a result of inflammation in the mammary gland, leading to abnormal milk and varying degrees of clinical severity. This condition affects almost 25% of the 9.3 million dairy cows present in the USA every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and negatively impacts animal welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent studies have reported that approximately 80% of all antimicrobials used on American dairy farms are for the treatment or prevention of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Prevention measures, improved management, and sanitation have reduced the number of contagious mastitis cases and have led to a change in the etiology of the disease in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], making opportunistic environmental pathogens, including coliforms,&#x000a0;major contributors to clinical mastitis.</p><p id="Par5">Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern and has led to increasing attention regarding the judicious use of antibiotics. Although conflicting evidence is available on whether human, companion, and/or livestock medicine is responsible for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the livestock industry has been recognized as one of the main causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], perhaps due to the amount of antimicrobials used in this sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], affecting humans either through direct contact or through the food chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The increasing demand for animal protein is believed to be accompanied by a significant growth in need for antimicrobial use in food animal production, which is predicted to rise by approximately 67% between 2010 and 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Responsible use of antimicrobials in food animals is paramount for maintenance of both animal and human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has been one of the policies proposed by the One Health Initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ceftiofur is the only third-generation cephalosporin labeled for veterinary use in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is considered a critically important antimicrobial for human medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and is the drug of choice in the majority of dairy operations for intramammary treatment of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To this date, the effectiveness of the treatment of coliform mastitis has been discussed in an ambiguous manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, all information regarding the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy reported so far is based on clinical cure and the ability to isolate and culture a specific pathogen from a mastitic milk sample in a laboratory setting. Culture-independent studies resulted in significant proof for the existence of a resident microbiota in milk in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], bovines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In light of constantly advancing molecular techniques, the use of next-generation sequencing led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the dynamics of health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and offers an opportunity to provide evidence that will substantiate antibiotic stewardship, helping the optimization of preventative, diagnostic, and treatment protocols for bovine mastitis. Therefore, detailed information on the effect of treatment of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> mastitis with third-generation cephalosporins is indispensable.</p><p id="Par6">Our group has recently described the dynamics of milk microbiome upon antimicrobial treatment with ceftiofur in animals naturally infected with mastitis pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In that study, cows from a commercial dairy farm were enrolled upon diagnosis of clinical mastitis and randomly allocated to receive extended intramammary therapy with ceftiofur, or to receive no treatment. We observed that in cows with mastitis caused by <italic>E. coli</italic>, treatment with ceftiofur did not offer an advantage when compared to no treatment in terms of clinical cure, pathogen clearance rate, or bacterial load. Moreover, the milk microbiome from the affected quarters was indistinguishable from the adjacent healthy quarters within 14&#x000a0;days following the onset of the disease regardless of intramammary antimicrobial administration.</p><p id="Par7">Herein, we describe a challenge model using a known strain of mastitis-causing <italic>E. coli</italic> to characterize the microbiome before, during, and after intramammary infection in a controlled setting. We aim to investigate the changes that occur upon introduction of a major pathogen and the ability of the healthy mammary microbiota to restore equilibrium with or without external aid of antimicrobials. Moreover, the role of antimicrobials in the normal milk microbiota has not yet been investigated in controlled longitudinal studies. We hypothesize that intramammary administration of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial might favor the overgrowth of specific organisms and incite a shift in the microbial profile of milk from normal quarters.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, the objectives of this study were to generate knowledge on the complex microbial ecology and treatment of mastitis, more specifically (a) describe the milk microbiome before, during, and after the infection of bovine mammary glands with a strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> previously isolated from a mastitis case; (b) compare microbial populations between infected and non-infected quarters; and (c) evaluate the impact of a third-generation cephalosporin on both healthy and mastitic milk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Challenge strain</title><p id="Par9">The strain used in this study (<italic>E. coli</italic> ECC-Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Cornell University), hereafter referred as C1, was isolated from a clinical case of bovine mastitis, and was proven effective in previous experimental challenges to result in mild to moderate cases of clinical mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Despite the significant drop in LogCFUs observed in treated challenged quarters, we could not identify a treatment effect in the relative abundance of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae.</italic> Taking in consideration the significant reduction in live bacteria detected in the present study, it is possible that the relative abundance of bacteria remains unchanged but treatment with ceftiofur has an effect in impairing the viability of bacteria exposed to the antimicrobials.</p><p id="Par44">Herein, we were unable to recognize a treatment effect neither on the rate of change of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> nor in the overall microbial profile of challenged quarters. These findings are in agreement with our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], in which no significant differences were observed in the rate of decrease of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in animals naturally infected with <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, we failed to identify a significant effect of treatment on the total milk microbiome as measured by ANOSIM, which is in line with the results from our earlier investigation. Several studies have investigated the effect of ceftiofur in food animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]; however, these studies evaluated parenteral or oral administration of ceftiofur in different microbiome niches, such as the gut. To the best of our knowledge, our group is the first to evaluate the effect of intramammary ceftiofur in bovine milk. The effect of chemotherapy in human milk microbiome and metabolome has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In bovine milk, modifications in the metabolome have also been described after the use of parenteral enrofloxacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The evidence of ceftiofur-induced modifications in the microbiome of food animals and the indication of possible drug-induced changes in milk prompt further investigation to simultaneously characterize the effects of cephalosporins in the mammary gland microbiome, metabolome, and resistome. It is possible that the observed lack of change in the relative abundance could be accompanied by differences in the metabolic profile of bacteria exposed to antimicrobials. Using technologies such as shotgun metagenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], we could detect differences not evident by 16S rRNA sequencing, and conclusions about the effects of cephalosporins in the diseased mammary gland may change.</p><p id="Par45">In our study we observed a dramatic change on the milk microbial profile upon infection with <italic>E. coli</italic>. Nevertheless, the most remarkable result of this investigation was the lack of discrimination between the microbiome of pre-challenge samples and the microbiome of milk samples from the same quarters collected after disappearance of clinical signs. Multivariate analysis of milk microbiome identified a significant difference when pre-challenged samples were compared to the ones collected in the first 2&#x000a0;days after challenge (&#x02212;72 to 0&#x000a0;h versus 6 to 48&#x000a0;h). However, we failed to identify any differences between the microbiome of treated and untreated quarters during treatment administration (time points 54 to 150). Interestingly, no difference could be observed in the overall microbiome assessed through ANOSIM between groups after treatment cessation, indicating that the milk microbiome is capable of returning to the original microbial status. The restoration of the microbiota to a healthy milk profile is in line with the findings of our investigation in naturally infected animals, in which no differences on the microbiome of healthy quarters and cured quarters could be observed 14&#x000a0;days after diagnosis of mastitis. Conversely, work by Falentin et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] identified long-lasting effects in quarters with normal milk that had a history of mastitis and suggested that such effects could be due to clinical mastitis and the antimicrobials used for the treatment thereof. Nevertheless, work performed by that group consisted of a cross-sectional study, and several components related to study design, sample collection, and the pathogens associated with mastitis in those animals could contribute for differences in the findings between the two studies. Those authors identified high abundance of members of the family <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic>, with some samples having as much as 30% of staphylococci reads assigned to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is known to have adapted to persist in the mammary environment, and attach to the cell lining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Regardless of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> both being considered major mastitis pathogens, the mammary environment is known to be a reservoir of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> while <italic>E. coli</italic> is mainly considered an environmental mastitis-causing bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Antimicrobial infusion in healthy mammary glands did not have a significant effect in the microbial profile. This was an interesting finding, given that alterations in the flora of healthy individuals exposed to antimicrobials favoring the blooming of pathogenic bacteria have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Previous reports of mastitis outbreaks following &#x0201c;blitz&#x0201d; therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], which consists in intramammary treatment of all lactating animals in the herd for elimination of a contagious pathogen, led us to hypothesize that shifts in the microbiome of healthy milk would occur in consequence to antimicrobial exposure, as it has been observed in other niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Nevertheless, intriguing work by Zaura and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] have reported a surprising resilience of the salivary microbiome upon exposure to different antimicrobials. While authors of the latter study observed significant and long-lasting changes in the fecal microbiome, the microbiome of the saliva presented only short-term ecological consequences, representing two radically different responses in two niches of the same individuals. It is possible that the microbiome of the mammary gland present itself as stable and resilient, comparable to what was observed in the salivary microbiome. This hypothesis is corroborated by the highly diverse microbiome of healthy milk described in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. One could also speculate that the healthy milk microbiome does not contain strains of bacteria that are resistant to ceftiofur and capable of taking advantage due to the lack of competition imposed by antimicrobial exposure. On the contrary of what is observed in the gut, the very low bacterial load in healthy milk reported in our former study might indicate that the milk microbial environment is not as competitive and is less favorable to the overgrowth of bacteria and subsequent change in the microbial profile.</p><p id="Par47">In this study, three out of the 12 challenged cows did not develop an infection following the challenge with <italic>E. coli</italic>. Several factors could account for this occurrence, most importantly the fact that these animals had significantly higher SCC in the time points prior to experimental infection. This finding is in agreement with Schukken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and Burvenich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] which have reported that the success of any intramammary infection is dependent upon the stage of lactation and the initial amount of milk leukocytes. In addition, our data follows the reasoning of Burvenich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], which stated that the severity and outcome of <italic>E. coli</italic> mastitis are cow-dependent, rather than entirely pathogen-dependent; however, it is important to highlight that in our study, we have evaluated infection with a single-characterized strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The dynamics of <italic>E. coli</italic>-associated mastitis and its resolution are multifactorial, involving aspects of the animal&#x02019;s immune system and features of the pathogen involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Due to the anatomic structure of the udder, it is generally assumed that infection in one quarter should not affect the immune status of neighboring quarters. Recent studies have contested this hypothesis, providing evidence of interdependence between infected and healthy quarters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Jensen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] have evaluated the transcriptional response of uninfected quarters in animals challenged with two major mastitis pathogens and described that the response in non-affected quarters was greater in animals with <italic>E. coli</italic>-associated mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Although other immune parameters were not evaluated in the current study, the numerical increase in somatic cell count in unchallenged quarters after intramammary infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> observed here is in agreement with Jensen et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and Blagitz et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], indicating that the immune response in the mammary gland is to some extent influenced by the status of adjacent quarters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">We have demonstrated here that the bovine mammary gland harbors a resilient microbiome, capable of reestablishing itself after dramatic changes due to an infectious event with an environmental pathogen. While all cows were inoculated with the same bacterial load, unique responses were observed in different animals. No differences were observed in the microbial profile of unchallenged mammary glands that were exposed to extended intramammary antimicrobial therapy. The milk microbiome was shown to be diverse and stable, indicating that bacteria within the mammary gland are tightly regulated. Our results corroborate for judicious use of antimicrobials in the dairy industry, demonstrating that due to the resilience of the mammary gland microbiome, certain cases of mastitis are capable of resolving independently the use of intramammary antimicrobials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
