mobilization of the upper spine using a Kaltenborn wedge on the pain and cervical
dysfunction of patients with neck pain. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-seven patients with
neck pain were divided into two groups; the self-mobilization group (SMG, n=13) and the
self-stretching group (SSG, n=14). The SMG performed upper thoracic self-mobilization and
the SSG performed self-stretching exercises as a short-term intervention for a week. To
assess the degree of neck pain, the visual analog scale (VAS) was utilized, and to measure
the joint range of motion at the flexion-extension, it was compared and analyzed by using
the goniometer. [Results] Both SMG and SSG show a significant decrease in the visual
analog scale and a significant increase in joint range of motion within the group. In the
comparison of groups, there was no significant difference, but it indicated effects on
improving the range of motion of extension in SMG. [Conclusion] Self-mobilization of the
upper spine, using a Kaltenborn wedge, was useful in alleviating pain in and dysfunction
of the cervical spine, and in particular, in improving cervical spine extension in this
study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Self mobilization</kwd><kwd>Kaltenborn wedge</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic pain in the cervical spine region is commonly due to overuse or recurrent trauma,
and may be due to instability of the spinal segments<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This causes restriction to the movement of the adjacent joints,
leading to impaired functional movement of the cervical spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A relationship between the cervical and thoracic spine has been described as close and
ergonomically related<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the
functional viewpoint of the entire spine, since the movement of the cervical vertebrae
includes the movement of the upper thoracic (&#x02018;1th thoracic spine; T1&#x02019; to &#x02018;4th thoracic
spine; T4&#x02019;)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, hypomobility of the upper
thoracic can cause pain in the cervical spine because of compensation, whereas hypermobility
of the upper thoracic can induce incompetence of the upper thoracic<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lau et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reports that patients with dysfunctional cervical spine have
excessive kyphosis compared to healthy normal persons, and kyphosis is closely related to
pain around the neck.</p><p>Joint mobilization is often used in manual therapy. This method applies distraction and
sliding techniques passively to the joint surfaces in order to maintain or recover joint
mobility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sandow demonstrates the need
for joint mobilization in the thoracic due to the risk of cervical mobilization, which
involves cervical rotation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The application of joint mobilization to the upper thoracic spine has been reported to have
an positive effect, sometimes immediately, on cervical spine dysfunction, in conjunction
with the provision of pain relief<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, previous treatments, including
joint mobilization, have been ineffective in a busy clinical setting because they involve
the direct and passive intervention of therapists<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it was determined that a therapeutic joint mobilization
intervention method that patients could easily administer themselves should be applied.</p><p>Thus, the study objective was to investigate the effect of short-term self-joint
mobilization of the upper spine using a Kaltenborn wedge on the pain and cervical
dysfunction of patients with neck pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on patients who presented at a hospital located in Andong,
Gyeongbuk, South Korea, for neck pain treatment. Twenty-seven patients with cervical spine
dysfunction and pain agreed to participate in the study. Written informed consent according
to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki was provided by all subjects prior
to participation, and all agreed to participate in this study. The patients were randomly
divided into two groups; the self-mobilization group (SMG, n=13) and the self-stretching
group (SSG, n=14), all of whom received conventional physical therapy (a hot pack and
interferential current therapy). Thereafter, the two groups performed self-mobilization or
self-stretching exercises for 20 minutes, three times a week, for one week only, to
determine the effect of the short-term intervention.</p><p>The SMG performed self-mobilization exercises using the Kaltenborn wedge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Kaltenborn wedge.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-30-486-g001"/></fig>). The size of the wedge used in the Kaltenborn concept is 20.3&#x02005;cm long, 10.8&#x02005;cm wide,
and 6.4&#x02005;cm high. Upper thoracic self-mobilization is a technique that is applied to the
upper thoracic spine (the spine between C7 and T3), originally termed the Kaltenborn-Evjenth
concept<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The groove of the Kaltenborn
wedge is placed under the spinous process of the upper spine in a lying position with the
knee bent. Rocking forward and backward mobilization of the upper spine joint is possible
owing to gravity and body weight. The subjects in this position raised the hips upward into
a bridging position until they felt pain, thereby increasing pressure on joint mobilization.
The therapist guided the subjects from time to time to ensure that they recognized and
transferred their position from the C7 to T3. The joint Range of Motion (ROM) is maintained
by increasing pressure for 30 sec with 10 sec of rest while repeating the motion. Each set
consists of three sets of 10 repetitions of motion. One&#x02005;min of rest was given between each
set.</p><p>The SSG performed self-stretching exercises, applied to the levator scapulae muscle and the
trapezius muscle using the contract-relax technique<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each muscle was stretched for 30 sec followed by 10 sec of rest.
The motion was applied 10 times on both sides.</p><p>Neck pain was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Dysfunction of the cervical
spine was measured with a joint ROM device, i.e., Myrin<sup>&#x02122;</sup> OB Goniometer (Kineman
Enterprises, Norway), to establish ROM in the cervical spine in terms of flexion and
extension within the sagittal plane. The subjects took a neutral position in the static
chair while crossing their hands and fixing them on the shoulders. The measurements were
taken while fixing the movement of the thoracic as much as possible. The angles of the
motions started at 0 degrees and each of the movements was repeated three times in order to
record a mean value. Both the SMG and the SSG had the same treatment time (25&#x02005;min) for each
session and were measured twice; once prior to the intervention and once following the third
treatment session (also the last).</p><p>This study used SPSS 18.0 for Windows to conduct the data analysis. A paired t-test was
used to test the within-group level of pain and joint ROM before and after the experiment.
An independent t-test was conducted to explain the between-group difference. The
significance level &#x00251; was set at 0.05 for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the general

Kaltenborn wedge for a short duration on the pain and cervical dysfunction of patients with
neck pain.</p><p>Although the current study finding of a significant decrease in pain in the cervical spine,
observed in both the SMG and the SSG, is consistent with that of previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
in which it was indicated that both joint mobilization and stretching exercises were
effective in reducing pain, we found it difficult to identify distinct differences in
reducing pain between the groups owing to the short study duration (one week).</p><p>In the comparison of cervical functional movement on the sagittal plane, there were
significant intragroup increases in the flexion and extension in both the SMG group and the
SSG group after the experiment, and there were significant intergroup increases in extension
angles. This finding is consistent with those of previous papers<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>: self
mobilization is effective for the functional improvement of the cervical spine. A study by
Kim et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrates that joint
mobilization in the upper thoracic shows significant improvement in terms of pain and joint
ROM. Kim et al. also state that joint mobilization is more effective although statistically
significant results were not revealed than the control group, which is a self-stretching
group in contrast with the result of the present study. This implies that mobility of the
thoracic plays an important role in disability around the neck. The improvement of
functioning around the neck, which is due to therapy on the upper thoracic, supports the
concept of regional interdependence<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This study applies joint mobilization to the upper thoracic without giving direct
therapeutic intervention to patients with neck pain, which is also considered to be applying
indirect therapeutic intervention. Hwangbo<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study on thoracic mobilization and self-stretching
exercises in chronic neck pain patients. Joint mobilization was reported to have had a
greater positive impact on extension than on flexion of the thoracic spine. This finding is
consistent with that of the current study. In addition, it is likely that the structural
shape of the wedge facilitated the extension gliding movements more so than it did flexion
during the self-mobilization exercises in the current study.</p><p>There were limitations to this study. Firstly, the effect of the movements was only
measured in the sagittal plane when the angles of the cervical spine were being determined.
Secondly, the intervention was performed over a very short period.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that self-mobilization of the
upper spine, using a Kaltenborn wedge, was useful in alleviating pain in and dysfunction of
the cervical spine, and in particular, in improving cervical spine extension in this
study.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cleland</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Childs</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>McRae</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Immediate effects of thoracic manipulation in patients
