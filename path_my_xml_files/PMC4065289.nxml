There were no meaningful differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes from baseline from 24 to 48&#x000a0;weeks, indicating that glycemic efficacy was maintained. Improvements in fasting plasma glucose and post-challenge plasma glucose were also observed with dapagliflozin over 48&#x000a0;weeks. Dapagliflozin 2.5/5/10&#x000a0;mg produced sustained reductions in weight (&#x02212;1.36/&#x02212;1.54/&#x02212;2.41&#x000a0;kg) versus placebo (&#x02212;0.77&#x000a0;kg).

Loss of efficacy with glucose-lowering agents over time, particularly with sulfonylureas, is a consequence of progressive worsening of diabetes, characterized by loss of &#x003b2;-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dapagliflozin, a competitive, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of sodium&#x02013;glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), increases urinary glucose excretion and reduces hyperglycemia independently of insulin secretion or action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, its efficacy is expected to be complementary to that of agents with insulin-dependent mechanisms of action. We previously published results from the first 24&#x000a0;weeks of a double-blind study in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea monotherapy, which showed that dapagliflozin added to glimepiride significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-challenge plasma glucose, and weight compared with placebo added to glimepiride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When considering newer, insulin-independent treatments such as the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, maintenance of efficacy achieved in the short-term over a longer period of time is important to establish, particularly for chronic, progressive conditions such as T2DM where some conventional, insulin-dependent therapies are associated with loss of efficacy over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the present analysis were to evaluate whether efficacy of dapagliflozin at 24&#x000a0;weeks was maintained after 48&#x000a0;weeks of treatment and to provide further safety and tolerability data with dapagliflozin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with inadequately controlled T2DM (defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0% and &#x02264;10.0%), and who were receiving a stable dose of sulfonylurea monotherapy at a level of at least half the maximum recommended dose for at least 8&#x000a0;weeks prior to enrollment, were eligible for inclusion. In view of the observation that the glucose-lowering effects of sulfonylureas start to reach a plateau at half-maximal doses, and higher doses are not recommended because of excessive risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the patients included in this study were highly likely to have been exposed to a maximally effective dose of glimepiride.

The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (July 1996). It was approved by institutional review boards and independent ethics committees for participating centers and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00680745). All participants provided informed consent.

Those patients still meeting the study eligibility criteria were randomized to receive double-blind dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, or 10&#x000a0;mg, or placebo, taken orally once daily before the first meal of the day, while continuing open-label glimepiride 4&#x000a0;mg/day. Open-label glimepiride could be downtitrated to 2&#x000a0;mg or discontinued to mitigate recurrent hypoglycemic events at the discretion of the investigator. However, no uptitration was allowed.</p><p>Patients with inadequate glycemic control during the treatment period remained in the trial but received open-label rescue therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone (if pioglitazone was unavailable).

A prespecified list of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 13.0 preferred terms identified signs, symptoms, and other reports suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI) and genital infection in the database. This list included terms for nonspecific signs and symptoms suggestive of genital infection (e.g., genital pruritus, vulvovaginal pruritus) as well as terms for clinical infection (e.g., vaginal infection), but did not include terms for sexually transmitted diseases. Patients reported these events both spontaneously and in response to proactive questioning by the investigators during study visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The continuous efficacy analyses over 48&#x000a0;weeks were based on longitudinal repeated measures analyses using &#x0201c;direct likelihood&#x0201d; without imputation of missing data. The SAS procedure PROC MIXED (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) was used, and model terms included the fixed categorical effects of treatment, week and treatment-by-week interaction, and the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement and baseline measurement-by-week interaction. No statistical hypothesis testing was performed for the combined short-term plus extension periods from baseline to week 48, but point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided. Categorical efficacy variables were analyzed using logistic regression methodology from Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] with adjustment for baseline value. Patients with missing data were included in these analyses and considered non-responders. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to analyze time to onset of rescue therapy for failing to achieve prespecified glycemic targets or patient discontinuation due to poor glycemic control.

In addition to these changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, dapagliflozin treatment was associated with sustained improvements in FPG over 48&#x000a0;weeks and reductions in postprandial plasma glucose rise in response to an OGTT at 24&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and 48&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The proportion of patients requiring rescue medication or discontinuing due to lack of glycemic control was lower in the dapagliflozin groups compared with placebo, with markedly greater differences seen between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups at the end of the extension period than were noted at the end of the short-term period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A sharp increase in the probability of rescue or discontinuation due to lack of glycemic control was evident after week 32 in all treatment groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which can be explained by the change in criteria for rescue therapy from an FPG &#x0003e;11.0&#x000a0;mmol/L during the short-term treatment period to an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8.0% during the extension period.</p><p>Regarding additional clinical benefits with dapagliflozin treatment, sustained reductions in body weight and SBP were noted over 48&#x000a0;weeks, consistent with findings observed in other clinical studies of dapagliflozin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Owing to the insulin-dependent mechanism of action of sulfonylureas, these agents are often associated with weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The addition of dapagliflozin to sulfonylurea therapy has the potential, therefore, to not only improve glycemic efficacy, but also to mitigate sulfonylurea-associated weight gain. Reductions in SBP have been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the majority of whom also have hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Whether the modest reductions in SBP observed with dapagliflozin therapy translate into longer-term reductions in cardiovascular risk await results from the prospective DECLARE study (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01730534) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Overall, dapagliflozin was well tolerated. Although hypoglycemic events were more frequently reported in patients treated with dapagliflozin than with placebo, most first events occurred within the first 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. An increase in such events is commonly observed when glucose-lowering therapies with a low intrinsic potential to cause hypoglycemia are added to sulfonylurea therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>A higher proportion of patients treated with dapagliflozin (mostly female) reported events suggestive of vulvovaginitis, balanitis, and related genital infection compared with placebo. Although patients with diabetes are at increased risk of common infections, including genital infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], an increase in rates of events suggestive of genital infection has been consistently reported in clinical studies of dapagliflozin and canagliflozin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Most of these events occurred during the first 24&#x000a0;weeks, were of mild or moderate intensity, responded to routine management, and rarely led to study discontinuation. Events suggestive of UTI occurred in similar proportions of patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, in line with similar findings of other SGLT2 inhibitor therapies in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Findings reported in the present study were also similar to pooled analyses of 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy, which assessed the occurrence of genital infections and UTIs over 24&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These pooled analyses also demonstrated that when actual clinical diagnoses of genital infections and UTIs (as opposed to events suggestive of) were considered, the proportions of patients with an event decreased across groups.</p><p>No deterioration of renal function was noted in the dapagliflozin groups. Although dapagliflozin was associated with modest rises in hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen, there were no changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or serum cystatin-C (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, there was no increase in the proportions of patients experiencing AEs of renal impairment/failure, or AEs of hypotension/dehydration/hypovolemia (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>The decrease from baseline in fasting C-peptide to near normal levels observed with dapagliflozin in this study is interesting, given suggestions that high levels may be a marker for hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Theoretically, as the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion, the reduction in fasting C-peptide observed with treatment may be a result of reduced stress on &#x003b2;-cells, which may ultimately improve &#x003b2;-cell function over the long term. Indeed, a recent, small-scale study of 11 patients with T2DM demonstrated that lowering plasma glucose concentration with dapagliflozin improved insulin resistance and &#x003b2;-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further in-depth investigation, outside the scope of the present study, is required to comprehensively examine SGLT2-facilitated relief of glucotoxicity in a clinical setting.</p><p>In our study, the proportion of patients with neoplasms (benign, malignant, and unspecified) was fractionally higher in the dapagliflozin groups compared with placebo, but no apparent anatomical pattern was noted. An analysis of &#x0003e;4,500 patients included in the dapagliflozin phase IIb/III database has indicated that overall incidence rates for malignant and unspecified tumors (per 100 patient-years) were similar for dapagliflozin (1.34) versus control treatments (1.39) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, trends in specific malignancies will continue to be evaluated in further observational and randomized clinical studies.</p><p>Limitations of the study design have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although excluding data after rescue therapy allows changes attributable to the investigational treatment to be evaluated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), the progressive loss of patient numbers from the analysis limits the confidence of these findings. Display of all patient data, including after rescue therapy (Supplementary Figure S2), shows that a high number of patients completed the study. Although including all treated patients comes closer to actual clinical practice, interpretation of the results is confounded by changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and other variables consequent to the addition of rescue medication. We have reported both analyses to evaluate the robustness of dapagliflozin treatment effects and found that the adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were similar between the two analytic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Loss of efficacy over time is observed with some treatments for T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the longest study to date of an SGLT2 inhibitor added to sulfonylurea monotherapy. In this study, short-term efficacy observed at 24&#x000a0;weeks was maintained over the longer term. Overall, treatment with dapagliflozin improved glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure over a total of 48&#x000a0;weeks in patients whose T2DM was inadequately controlled on glimepiride. Although hypoglycemic events and events suggestive of genital infections were reported more often in patients receiving dapagliflozin, therapy was well-tolerated in general over 48&#x000a0;weeks. Given the common use of sulfonylureas in the management of T2DM in a number of countries, sustained efficacy and long-term tolerability with add-on therapies of complementary mechanisms of action such as dapagliflozin are important to establish.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13300_2014_72_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 761&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="13300_2014_72_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (PDF 210&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00680745.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This study and article processing charges were funded by AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
