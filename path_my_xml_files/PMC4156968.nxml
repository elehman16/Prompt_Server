Patients recruited were randomized into two groups. The first group received oral Prednisolone in addition to low dose aspirin and heparin, while the other group received a placebo in addition to low dose aspirin and heparin.

Genetic abnormalities with chromosomal, single gene, or genomic imprinting defects account for 3.5&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% of the causes of RM. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Other foetal defects include foetal infections and developmental abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Maternal causes of RM include immunological causes accounting for 30&#x000a0;% of the cases, with anti phospholipid antibody syndrome being the most common autoimmune cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Endocrine dysfunction accounts for 48.71&#x000a0;% of the causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], while other maternal factors including anatomical detects and sub-clinical endometrial infection account for a minimal number of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, approximately 50&#x000a0;% of the RM cases are unexplained with no definitive aetiology. Several authors are proposing the cause to be alloimmune rejection of the foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that are part of the innate immune system and are found in both peripheral blood and uterine mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been found that in women with a history of RM, 37.3&#x000a0;% had a mild to moderate increase (12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;%) and 14.7&#x000a0;% a marked increase (&#x0003e;18&#x000a0;%) in peripheral blood CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells. An NK cell percentage of &#x0003c;12&#x000a0;% is strongly associated with a subsequent successful pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, these findings have not been confirmed by other studies that concluded that peripheral NK cell numbers do not necessarily correlate with NK cell cytotoxicity, which can be represented by markers such as KIRs (killer inhibitory receptors) or CD16 receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Up until now, therapy has been empirical and not evidence based, resulting in a poor understanding of the precise aetiology of unexplained RM. Treatments have included aspirin, heparin, progesterone, steroids, leukocyte immunization and IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Heparin and aspirin have been recommended as a standard empiric treatment for cases of RM by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Prednisolone has been reported to improve in vitro fertilization treatment outcome and to reduce the rate of miscarriage due to various reproductive immunological problems by increasing the T-regulatory cells, which in turn regulate the peripheral NK cells and their homing into the decidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of adding oral prednisolone to heparin and low dose aspirin in the management of patients with unexplained RM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>This randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital and involved 180 patients who experienced unexplained recurrent miscarriage between August 2010 and May 2012.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using Epi Info Q version 6.0.

Although both peripheral NK cells (pNK) and uterine NK cells (uNK) express the surface antigen CD56, they are phenotypically and functionally different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies have shown that 90&#x000a0;% of pNK cells express a CD56<sup>dim</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup> phenotype, while 80&#x000a0;% of the uNK cells express a CD56<sup>bright</sup> CD16<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype, with the CD56 cells known to have a regulatory function, while the CD16 cells have a cytotoxic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In humans, it has been proved that the elevated levels of circulating cytotoxic NK cells&#x02014;and not the absolute count of NK cells&#x02014;increase the risk of miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we tried to determine the efficacy of steroid therapy in patients with unexplained RM and the effect of steroid therapy on both the count of pNk cells and their cytotoxic function.</p><p>We found that oral prednisolone was associated with an eightfold increase in successful on-going pregnancies beyond 20&#x000a0;weeks gestation [(RR 7.63, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (3.71&#x02013;15.7)].</p><p>Oral Prednisolone was also associated with a 61.1&#x000a0;% reduction in the risk of miscarriage before 20&#x000a0;weeks gestation (NNT&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.63). Although a different design was used, in their study, Lash and his colleagues found that administration of Prednisolone pre-pregnancy helped one-third of their participants to achieve a live birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. But a recent study published by Tang et al., on the use of prednisolone in patients with high levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, stated that live birth rate among the prednisolone group was 60&#x000a0;% and among the placebo group it was 40&#x000a0;% with a risk ratio of 1.5, and hence was not significant. The discrepancy between our results and theirs may be due to the insufficient sample size and the inconsistency in the start date of treatment, as they stated in their conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>One of the beneficial effects of prednisolone might be its suppressive effect on NK cells. In our study, we found that prednisolone effectively suppressed peripheral CD16 levels in women with a successful pregnancy until 20&#x000a0;weeks gestation; however, this suppressive effect was not found in the levels of CD56 cells. These findings agree with the speculations mentioned above that suppression of the cytotoxic function of NK cells by suppressing the CD16 expressing cells may have a beneficial effect on patients with RM. Again, this was consistent with the findings of Lash et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which found that prednisolone reduced uNK cells in the majority of their cases.</p><p>In our study, we failed to find an association between pNK cell (CD56 CD16) levels before the start of any treatment and the miscarriage rate, which indicates that such cells can&#x02019;t be used as predictors of a successful pregnancy outcome. Although different study designs have been used among study groups, the results of two studies concur with our speculations and the finding that pNK cell levels cannot predict the risk of spontaneous abortion in women with unexplained RM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>It is worthy of mention that in our study we found that in the non-prednisolone group (the group receiving only low dose aspirin and unfractionated heparin), the ongoing pregnancy rate was only 9.2&#x000a0;%, which contradicts the findings of Badawy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Fawzy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], whose studies were also conducted in Egypt. There may be two reasons for this difference. First, the authors of these studies used low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin 20&#x000a0;mg/day subcutaneously, whereas we used unfractionated heparin in our study for financial reasons. Second, in our study, the timing of the start of therapy differed from theirs. In their study, they began therapy as soon as foetal life was documented, which was not the case in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Our study has limitations in that we did not follow the pregnancies up to delivery, and heterogeneity existed in the start time of therapy, which might have affected the outcome in some cases.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial showed that prednisolone therapy has a beneficial effect when combined with heparin and low dose aspirin in the management of patients with unexplained RM, which might be due to the suppressive effect of steroids on the cytotoxic CD16 cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine</collab></person-group><article-title>Definitions of infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss</article-title><source>Fertil Steril</source><year>2008</year><volume>89</volume><fpage>1603</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.03.002</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18485348</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Egozcue</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Balanco</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vendrell</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human male infertility: chromosomal abnormalities, meiotic disorders, abnormal spermatozoa and recurrent abortion</article-title><source>Hum Reprod</source><year>2000</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>105</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Regan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Jivraj</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>MacLean</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Regan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Infection and pregnancy loss</article-title><source>Infection and pregnancy</source><year>2001</year><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>RCOG Press</publisher-name><fpage>291</fpage><lpage>304</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilcox</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Connor</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence of early loss of pregnancy</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1988</year><volume>319</volume><fpage>189</fpage><lpage>194</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJM198807283190401</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3393170</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bricker</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Farquharson</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Types of pregnancy loss in recurrent miscarriage: implications for research and clinical practice</article-title><source>Hum Reprod</source><year>2002</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>1345</fpage><lpage>1350</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/humrep/17.5.1345</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11980763</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Regan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Recurent miscarriage</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2006</year><volume>368</volume><fpage>601</fpage><lpage>611</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69204-0</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16905025</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR7"><label>7.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hill JA (1999) Recurrent pregnancy loss.
