This is the first reported use in humans of an investigational vaccine, AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel, with the novel adjuvant CPG 7909.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A phase 1 trial was conducted at the University of Rochester with 75 malaria-naive volunteers to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 malaria vaccine.

Anti-AMA1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the immune sera of volunteers that received 20 &#x000b5;g or 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 had up to 14 fold significant increases in anti-AMA1 antibody concentration compared to 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel alone. The addition of CPG 7909 to the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel vaccine in humans also elicited AMA1 specific immune IgG that significantly and dramatically increased the in vitro growth inhibition of homologous parasites to levels as high as 96&#x00025; inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The safety profile of the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 malaria vaccine is acceptable, given the significant increase in immunogenicity observed.

Most of this mortality occurs among children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 4 species of malaria that infect humans, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is responsible for the majority of these deaths. Mounting drug resistance of the malaria parasite, as well as widespread resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides, make these control strategies increasingly problematic. A vaccine that would reduce both mortality and morbidity secondary to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection would be a valuable resource in the fight against this disease.</p><p>The asexual blood-stage merozoite surface antigen Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) has been shown in several preclinical studies to be a promising malaria vaccine candidate <xref rid="pone.0002940-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002940-Stowers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Alignments of published <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA1 gene sequences from different isolates reveal that the AMA1 gene occurs as distinct allelic variants that differ by a number of point mutations, resulting in at least 64 known polymorphisms in the amino acid sequence <xref rid="pone.0002940-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002940-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Immunization with only one form of AMA1 may not protect against parasites expressing different AMA1 alleles. The combination of two or more divergent AMA1 alleles within a single vaccine formulation may provide broader protection against parasites with varying AMA1 sequences in the field, if some degree of cross-strain protection is induced <xref rid="pone.0002940-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Remarque2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For this reason, the AMA1-C1 vaccine contains equal mixtures of the recombinant AMA1 proteins derived from the FVO and 3D7 strains of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p>Four previous studies in the US and Mali have evaluated AMA1-C1 formulated on Alhydrogel&#x000ae; without CPG 7909 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002940-ClinicalTrials.gov1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Some volunteers in the US Phase 1 clinical trial achieved AMA1 antibody levels that partially blocked <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of erythrocytes; however, the majority of volunteers displayed low antibody levels with little or no <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of parasite invasion <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Antibody responses in semi-immune Malian adults were superior to those seen in the US, and responses were seen after the first dose <xref rid="pone.0002940-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We believed that higher antibody responses would be more likely to lead to protection. AMA1 has also been tested in humans in combination with other adjuvants such as AS02A, AS01B and Montanide ISA 720 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Girard1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The novel adjuvant CPG 7909 (VaxImmune&#x02122;), a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), has been administered to humans in combination with hepatitis B vaccine, inactivated influenza vaccine, and anthrax vaccine <xref rid="pone.0002940-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002940-Klinman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

The study was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review as part of Investigational New Drug application BB-IND#12029. The study was monitored for regulatory compliance and data quality by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of NIAID. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers prior to screening for eligibility for participation</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years old recruited in the Rochester, New York area. Exclusion criteria included prior malaria infection, recent or planned travel to a malaria endemic country, and recent use of malaria prophylaxis. Because of the theoretical risk of inducing autoimmunity with CpG ODNs, potential subjects were screened for positive anti-double stranded DNA (ds-DNA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and proteinuria. Volunteers also had normal results for screening laboratories (complete blood count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine), no serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C infection, or antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Urine pregnancy testing was performed at screening as well as prior to each vaccination for females.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>AMA-1 antigens were expressed in the yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>, and 20 &#x000b5;g and 80 &#x000b5;g doses of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x000ae; were manufactured under cGMP conditions as previously described <xref rid="pone.0002940-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. cGMP CPG 7909 was supplied by Coley Pharmaceutical Group (Wellesley, MA) under a clinical trials agreement. CPG 7909 is a short synthetic ODN with a sequence of <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT-3&#x02032;</named-content> with all nucleotides linked with phosphorothioate bonds. CPG 7909 was supplied in sterile vials containing 1 mL at 10 mg/mL in hypertonic phosphate buffer at a pH 7.4. AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 was prepared as a point of injection formulation. Characterization and quality control were performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0002940-Mullen2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Aebig1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Shortly before vaccination, 0.08 mL of CPG 7909 was drawn into a 0.30 mL (insulin) syringe and added to a single dose (0.7 mL) vial of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel and gently mixed. The vaccine was administered no more than 6 hours after mixing and was kept at 4&#x000b0;C if not immediately administered. When ready to administer, 0.55 mL was withdrawn into a syringe, and the vaccine injected. Vaccine was given by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle on Days 0, 28, and 56, with successive vaccinations given in alternating arms. A 0.55 mL dose of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 corresponds to either 20 &#x000b5;g or 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1 and 564 &#x000b5;g of CPG 7909.</p><p>Participants were sequentially enrolled and randomized within three dose escalating cohorts.

Randomization was performed using the enrolment module of the Internet Data Entry System (IDES), with the code list stored in a secured location at the study site. Participants remained blinded to their treatment assignment for the duration of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>(i) Safety</title><p>Volunteers were observed for 30 minutes after each vaccination to evaluate for immediate adverse events, and were given diary cards to record events occurring during the first week after vaccination. Volunteers were seen in the study clinic at 3, 7, and 14 days after each vaccination, and at 28, 84, and 180 days after the third vaccine dose. Solicited adverse events included injection site pain, erythema, and induration, fever, headache, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Pain and solicited adverse events other than fever and urticaria were graded as follows: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;absent/none, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;easily tolerated, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;interferes with daily activity, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;prevents daily activity. Unless otherwise specified, non-solicited adverse events were graded as 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;none, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no effect on activities of daily living, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;partial limitation in activities of daily living, or treatment given, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;activities of daily living limited to &#x0003c;50&#x00025; of baseline, or medical evaluation required. Hematological (Hb, WBC, and platelets) and biochemical (AST and creatinine) laboratory parameters were measured at screening and on days of immunization, and at 3 and 14 days after each vaccination; hematological parameters were also checked on Days 7. Anti-dsDNA, ANA, and RF were checked at screening, each day of vaccination, and at 7 days after each dose and 28 days after the third dose, and at the end of the study. All adverse events were graded for severity and relationship to study product. Adverse events which were unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related to vaccination were considered to be associated with vaccination; adverse events definitely unrelated to vaccination were not associated. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any adverse event resulting in death, life threatening, requiring hospitalization, resulting in disability or incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any other event which required intervention to prevent such outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>(ii) Immunological Assays</title><p>Antibody responses to the AMA1 antigens were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 140 and 236. The standardized ELISA technique was performed as described previously <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A new human anti-AMA1 standard serum was made using a pool of plasma from 3 individuals receiving AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 vaccine in this study. The standard pool was assigned 460.9 Malaria Vaccine Development Branch (MVDB) ELISA units on AMA1-FVO and 578.0 units on AMA1-3D7. The AMA1 specific antibody concentration in the standard pool gave 0.0584 (SE&#x000b1;0.0012) &#x000b5;g/mL of AMA1-FVO-specific IgG for 1 ELISA unit, and 0.0473 (SE&#x000b1;0.0016) &#x000b5;g/mL of AMA1-3D7-specific IgG for 1 ELISA unit. The methods used to determine the concentration will be reported elsewhere (Miura et al, manuscript in preparation). Using these factors, all MVDB ELISA units were converted to &#x000b5;g/mL. Minimal detection level of this ELISA was 1.66 &#x000b5;g/mL and all values less than that were assigned as 0.83 &#x000b5;g/mL for statistical analysis.</p><p>In vitro parasite growth inhibition of homologous FVO and 3D7 <italic>P.falciparium</italic> strains was performed on sera from all volunteers on Days 0 and 70 using a standardized growth inhibition assay (GIA) as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002940-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. GIA was performed using total IgG purified from individual sera and concentrated to 40 mg/mL. The final concentration of total IgG in the GIA wells was 10 mg/mL. The anti-AMA1 antibody concentrations (&#x000b5;g/mL) shown are the concentration of specific antibody in test wells. Heterologous in vitro parasite growth inhibition of L32 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and M24 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> strains of parasites were performed. Due to the limitation of volume of purified IgGs, only ten total IgG samples with high growth-inhibitory activity to homologous parasites (&#x02265;68&#x00025; inhibition to 3D7 parasites) were tested.</p><p>Samples were excluded from the ELISA and GIA statistical analysis for the time points after the first missed vaccination of volunteers who withdrew or were withdrawn from the study or if samples were unavailable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>(i) Adverse Events</title><p>The frequency of adverse events stratified by dose cohort was summarized. Logistic regressions were used to investigate the effect of dose group on either local, systemic or laboratory adverse events. In each logistic regression, the response used for each subject was the most severe response observed, and all subjects were included regardless of withdrawal status. For the local or systemic reactions separate regressions were done for the odds of experiencing any reaction (mild, moderate, or severe vs. none) or higher severity reactions (moderate or severe vs. none or mild). When a dose group effect was found to be significant, pairwise tests using the same model were used to further investigate specific comparisons. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

This procedure is known to bound the family-wise type I error at 0.05 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We repeated the procedure for Day 70 ELISA and Day 70 GIA. To test for an accelerated CPG effect we compared the 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 group to the 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG group by Mann-Whitney U test. For comparison of Day 42 and Day 70 AMA-FVO and AMA1-3D7 titers within the groups, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used with Hodges-Lehmann confidence intervals. To determine significant differences between growth inhibition on the 4 parasite strains (3D7, FVO, L32, and M24), we used an all-subset procedure with Friedman's test, with the family-wise p-value defined as the lowest family-wise significance level that declares all pairs significantly different <xref rid="pone.0002940-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

The larger groups (80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 with and without CPG) were sized for a comparison of immunogenicity. Based on an analysis of the human antibody responses to a number of malaria antigens that had been previously tested in clinical trials, the observed coefficient of variation in the range of antibody concentrations was approximately 1.2&#x02013;1.4. Assuming the larger coefficient of variation and assuming that one group had mean antibody concentrations that were at least 2.2 times the mean antibody concentrations of the other group, then the two-sided Mann-Whitney test assuming a significance of 0.05 performed on a sample size of 30 per group would have a power of greater than 0.80.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant flow</title><p>The study was conducted at the University of Rochester School of Medicine from April 2005 to March 2007. 184 volunteers were screened to sequentially enroll 75 participants in three cohorts as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>.

When testing for an overall dose group effect on solicited systemic events, there was no significant difference when measuring any events (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.546), but there was a significant difference for higher severity events (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.024). Volunteers in the 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG group were significantly more likely to experience a higher severity event compared to the 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 group (OR 4.57, 95&#x00025; CI 1.45&#x02013;14.39, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0094). Combining the CPG groups also showed a higher probability of a more severe systemic event in comparison to the non-CPG group (OR 9.14, 95&#x00025; CI 1.01, 83.04, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0493).</p><p>Three volunteers were withdrawn due to rash related to vaccination. One volunteer receiving 20 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG developed a grade 1 papular non-pruritic rash on his chest, back, and upper arms 7 days after receiving his second vaccination. A dermatologic consultation was obtained and folliculitis/acne possibly related to vaccination was diagnosed. The rash lasted 45 days and he was not revaccinated. One volunteer receiving 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG developed a grade 1 erythematous, papular, non-pruritic rash on her chest and back 5 days after first vaccination. The rash had substantially subsided by day 28 and the volunteer received a second vaccination on Day 28. On Day 31 there were increased macules in the same distribution and a decision was made not to administer the third vaccination. The rash was completely resolved by Day 58. The third volunteer developed a grade 2 rash 17 days after receiving his first vaccination with 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1; this was a fine papular rash on the trunk, arms, and legs associated with itchy eyes and rhinitis. Tests for mononucleosis and streptococcal infection done by the primary physician were negative and the rash resolved after 4 days. Another volunteer was withdrawn due to Grade 3 epigastric pain after second vaccination with 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG. Other Grade 3 AEs judged to be possibly related to vaccination included vomiting, loss of appetite, body aches, and fatigue. All Grade 3 systemic AEs resolved within 3 days.</p><p>Three volunteers were withdrawn due to a positive ANA. One volunteer who received 20 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG was positive (1&#x02236;80) on Day 0 and continued to have low level fluctuations until the end of the study; RF and anti-dsDNA remained normal and this was considered not associated with vaccination. ANA elevations in the other two volunteers were considered associated with vaccination. One volunteer received 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 without CPG; this volunteer had a mild elevation (1&#x02236;80) on the day of second vaccination which returned to normal 6 weeks later; RF and anti-dsDNA remained normal throughout. One volunteer who also received 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 without CPG had a normal ANA at baseline, with a mild elevation (1&#x02236;80) 7 days after vaccination and 1&#x02236;1280 at second vaccination; this volunteer also had intermittently positive RF. After consultation with the safety monitoring committee, the protocol was amended to allow continued participation if ANA was positive at vaccination, as long as anti-dsDNA and proteinuria were both negative. Subsequently, four volunteers had ANAs of 1&#x02236;80 either at day of first vaccination, day of second vaccination, or early in their participation; all received three doses of vaccine as per protocol and all returned to normal, with some low level fluctuations. Three of these four volunteers received vaccine with CPG. One volunteer was withdrawn due to positive anti-dsDNA (82 IU, normal 0&#x02013;70) 7 days after first vaccination with 20 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG; ANA and RF remained negative throughout and anti-dsDNA was negative when rechecked 21 days later. No volunteers had clinical evidence of autoimmune disease. The other two withdrawals associated with vaccination were due to low hemoglobin in a volunteer who received two doses of 20 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG, and one volunteer who received one dose of 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 who experienced a worsening of pre-existing chest pain related to anxiety.</p><p>Laboratory adverse events are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002940-t002">Table 2</xref>. There are no significant differences between study groups for any parameter. Transient decreases in white blood cells and platelets are an expected observation with administration of CPG 7909 <xref rid="pone.0002940-Krieg1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study there were no adverse events as a result of decreases in platelets.

This has been seen in some previous studies using a combination of CPG 7909 with licensed vaccines <xref rid="pone.0002940-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002940-Cooper3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and was not unexpected. As with any vaccine, risk must be weighed against benefit. For a vaccine intended to prevent severe malaria, the risk of greater reactogenicity may be outweighed by enhanced immunogenicity. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate, severe reactions were of short duration, and no serious adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to vaccination occurred. This safety profile was judged to be acceptable given the greatly enhanced immunogenicity of the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 vaccine, and further development of this blood-stage vaccine in malaria endemic areas.</p><p>There is a theoretical risk of inducing autoimmune disease with CpG ODN, and markers for this were monitored frequently in this study. One volunteer who received CPG was withdrawn from further vaccinations after developing a transiently low positive anti-dsDNA which subsequently returned to normal. Other studies of CPG 7909 have also rarely seen transiently elevated anti-dsDNA after vaccination <xref rid="pone.0002940-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; no clinical events related to this have been reported in studies using CPG 7909 in a vaccine to date.

In this study this is illustrated by the high number of positive results before vaccination, and frequent fluctuations from baseline in both the CPG and non-CPG groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002940-t002">Table 2</xref>). Three volunteers with baseline or early elevations of ANA received three doses of vaccine containing CPG without an increase in ANA titer; the volunteer who had a higher titer ANA (1&#x02236;1280) did not receive CPG. Less frequent monitoring using the more specific of these markers, i.e., monitoring anti-dsDNA alone, and checking ANA and RF if anti-dsDNA is positive or if clinical symptoms are present, is likely to be sufficient for future studies.</p><p>While assessment of the safety of the vaccine formulation was the primary goal of this study, an important secondary objective was to determine the ability of the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 vaccine to elicit humoral immune responses in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve individuals after primary vaccination and the ability to boost memory responses with revaccination. While there was virtually no detectable antibody response to either AMA1-FVO or AMA1-3D7 after the first dose of 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1 on Day 28 in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve volunteers, an antibody response was detected in volunteers who received either 20 or 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1&#x0002b;CPG. This dramatic increase in anti-AMA1 antibody concentrations continued to be significant post second and third immunizations on Days 42 and 70 and to the end of the study on Day 236. The difference in antibody concentration after the second and third immunizations for the 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1&#x0002b;CPG group was small (1.12 fold) and non-significant, indicating that two immunizations were sufficient to elicit a near-maximal antibody response at this dose level. Two weeks after the three immunizations there was also no significant difference in AMA1 antibody concentration between 20 &#x000b5;g and 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1&#x0002b;CPG.

At least 64 amino acid residues have been shown to have one or more substitutions, but the impact of this polymorphism with respect to protective responses is unknown <xref rid="pone.0002940-Healer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To address this issue, the AMA1-C1 vaccine was designed to include AMA1 proteins based on the sequences of two relatively diverse <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains: FVO and 3D7. The AMA1 sequences from these two parasite strains differ by 25 amino acids. By incorporating both the FVO and 3D7 alleles into the AMA1-C1 vaccine, the goal was to induce a broader immune response than could be achieved by vaccination with either individual component alone. The anti-AMA1 antibodies induced by the AMA1-C1 vaccine recognize the native parasite protein and inhibit growth of the FVO and 3D7 strains of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in vitro. The addition of CPG 7909 to the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel vaccine in humans elicited AMA1 specific immune IgG that dramatically increased the growth inhibition to levels as high as 96&#x00025;. This growth-inhibitory activity was significantly better than that from AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel in this paper as well as what has been previously reported <xref rid="pone.0002940-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, all GIA data points could be plotted on the same curve regardless of formulation, suggesting that the intrinsic functional activity of the antibodies was not different with and without the addition of CPG 7909.</p><p>Having converted the ELISA units to &#x000b5;g/mL and using a widely accepted standardized GIA, it is now possible to develop a standardized inhibitory constant such as the concentration of AMA1 antibody required to give 50&#x00025; inhibition of homologous parasite growth (i.e. Ab<sub>50</sub>). The Ab<sub>50</sub> could be used to compare GIA results between blood-stage vaccine trials. However, it should be noted that the correlation of growth-inhibitory activity with in vivo reduction in parasite growth or protection in field trials against clinical malaria remains to be established.</p><p>The growth inhibition of these same total IgGs on the heterologous parasite strains L32 and M24 was not as high and gave rise to levels approximately half or less of those observed for the homologous FVO and 3D7 parasite strains. While heterologous inhibition was significantly decreased compared to homologous inhibition, some cross-strain inhibition was demonstrated. To potentially further broaden protection, MVDB is developing a second generation vaccine which will combine a third, more divergent AMA1 allele with AMA1-C1 and which will be evaluated in humans in the near future. Other approaches include developing an AMA1 vaccine that incorporates a combination of synthetic Diversity-Covering PfAMA1 sequences to provide a broader functional immune response<xref rid="pone.0002940-Remarque2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, in this Phase 1 trial the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 vaccine demonstrated an adequate safety profile and was highly immunogenic in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. Additionally, the functional properties of these antibodies were demonstrated by their ability to inhibit parasite growth in vitro. AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel&#x0002b;CPG 7909 is currently under evaluation in a Phase 1 endemic adult trial and if found to be safe a Phase 1 pediatric trial is planned. This would be the first use of CPG 7909 in a pediatric population for any indication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002940.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort Checklist.</p><p>(0.11 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002940.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002940.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.63 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002940.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Peter Mariuz, Betty Diamond, and Wendy Keitel, who served on the Safety Monitoring Committee for this study, Abdi Naficy, Lee Hall and DMID, EMMES, Regina White, Coley Pharmaceutical Group.
