Both the groups consumed two tablets of either <italic>Dashanga Kwatha Ghana Vati</italic> or placebo, twice daily after food for a period of eight weeks.

It is the most productive age in one&#x02019;s own life, since they struggle for upcoming in their economic status by which they suffer from stress and strain.

Encouraging results were also observed in the placebo group, which may be because of certain dietary restrictions advised to the enrolled patients during trial period. No clinically significant changes were observed in hematological or biochemical parameters after the study.
