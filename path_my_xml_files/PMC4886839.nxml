In recent years, it has become of the most commonly used functional herbs in dietary supplements [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reported medicinal effects have been being supported by clinical studies in the fields of physiology, biology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and pathology [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Saponin, the main active ingredient, is responsible for a variety of proven effects of ginseng, and is usually referred to as ginsenosides. This name refers to a glycoside isolated from ginseng, which distinguishes it from saponin and from other plants. There are close to 60 species of ginsenosides [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and of those ginsenosides, Rg1 belongs to the PT (protopanaxtriol) class and is one of the typical ginsenosides abundant in <italic>Panax Ginseng</italic> [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>According to previous or ongoing studies of the pharmacological activities of ginsenosides, Rg1 treatment reportedly strengthens the hippocampus which plays an important role in memory and learning [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has also been reported to have various effects including enhancement of immune function, inhibition of platelet aggregation, stimulation of protein synthesis (mouse brain), anti-fatigue, anti-stress, anti-inflammation, promotion of hepatocellular proliferation and DNA synthesis, promotion of nerve cell survival, stimulation of cholesterol (activating LDL receptor), and stimulation of adrenocorticotropin secretion [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>However, in the field of exercise science, there are few studies that have evaluated the effect of Rg1 intake. Furthermore, previous studies reported that it is difficult to draw any clear conclusion on the relationship between ginseng and improvement of exercise capacity [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The main limitations for the clinical study are harvest time, and varietal species caused by varying cultivation, which leads to frequently changing profiles of ginsenosides [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A number of limitations were likely present because no specific dose and concentration of single or combined ginsenosides has been clearly validated. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to examine the effect of each specific ginsenoside in ginseng which acts on human body in relation to exercise capacity and associated metabolic processes [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Through this, medicinal or functional foods which can enhance physical health and function can be developed, and specific methods for an ergogenic aid can be presented.</p><p>No positive effect of long-term treatment with Rg1 in human muscle strength and anaerobic power has been observed, though there were positive effects on antioxidant enzymes, immune responses, and VO<sub>2max</sub> [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, the activity of citrate synthase (CS), which is a typical aerobic enzyme used as an indicator of mitochondrial function, increased [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is thought to be very difficult to make a clear conclusion of improved aerobic capacity based on the changes of only one indicator enzyme. Moreover, adverse effects of a long-term treatment with ginseng, such as high blood pressure, digestive disorders, insomnia, and nervousness have been reported [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, considering its use for long-term condition management or as a temporary coping mechanisms in athletes, short-term intake (1-3 times/24 hours) should be assessed. Compared with other tissues, skeletal muscle is the most able to adapt to changes or stimulation. It reacts in a variety of different morphological and biochemical ways by exposure to a certain environment, regular aerobic and anaerobic exercises, and nutritional or pathological stimuli. Because such changes rely on the mobilization pattern of the muscle fibers, it is necessary to selectively observe a muscle group. In this study, aerobic, plantaris muscle fibers from a dominant muscle group were chosen to observe bigger morphological and biochemical changes after 6 weeks of swimming.</p><p>Endurance training was a 6-week course of swimming using Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by acute uptakes of Rg1 three times within 24 hours. Aerobic capacity was tested by swimming time to exhaustion. Immediately after the measurement, the plantaris was extracted and mass changes, CS encoding mRNA production, and CS activity were analyzed. Through these results, the additive effects of a short-term intake of Rg1 on enhanced aerobic exercise capacity acquired through a long-term swimming training were examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_sec2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_sec2-1"><title>Experimental animal</title><p>Experimental animals were 8-week-old male rats of the Sprague-Dawley lineage.

Therefore, it is thought that 6-week swimming exercise and short-term intake of Rg1 did not affect the total body mass of SD rat at all.</p><p>Due to the muscle fiber type composition of the plantaris that it is mainly of type II muscle fibers, it was expected that the changes in the capacity of aerobic exercise caused by long-term swimming were likely to be greater than other hind-limb muscles, which was the reason why the plantaris was chosen for this study [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There was no significant difference in the mass of the plantaris relative to the total body weight based on treatment. The probability that the mass of the plantaris changed significantly by aerobic exercise, especially by the modified 6-week swimming exercise protocol employed in this study [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] has never been suggested in the previous studies, which is consistent with our findings. No previous studies have reported changes in the mass of the plantaris caused by intake of ginsenoside including Rg1 and in particular, it is thought that morphological changes including additional mass were unlikely to be induced by acute uptake of Rg1 following swimming. In conclusion, long-term aerobic exercise, immediately followed by acute administration of Rg1 did not result in morphological changes in the plantaris. And this result is grounds for an interpretation that the increase in the exercise duration time, which is to be discussed later, was caused by changes in biochemical factors.</p><p>The level of CS mRNA expression was measure by RT-PCR and the results showed that the level of mRNA expression was significantly higher in EP and ERG than in NP. The increase of CS mRNA expression in the plantaris caused by long-term aerobic exercise has been confirmed by a previous study [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a tendency toward an increase of mRNA expression caused by Rg1-intake alone was observed, but without significance. So far, no previous study examined the level of CS mRNA expression depending on Rg1 treatment. However, the results presented in this study are consistent with previous studies that long-term exercise stimulated and increased CS mRNA expression in the plantaris, which was detected even in six weeks after the exercise, and Rg1-intake alone was likely to affect CS mRNA expression. However, considering that there was a tendency of reduced or constant level of CS mRNA expression after a certain amount of time as shown in previous studies [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the point that the combined treatment did not bring additive effects can be interpreted as that it suggests the parts to be studied in the future.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the CS activity in the plantaris muscle tissue depending on treatment. CS activity has been used as a biomarker representing the mitochondrial capacity and naturally representative of the capacity for endurance exercise of the skeletal muscle caused by long-term endurance exercise in both animals and humans. In a previous study targeting human, Rg1 (capsule 5mg) isolated from <italic>Panax Notoginseng</italic> was treated two times, one hour before cycling and the previous night, and then the CS activity was shown to be elevated in the blood in three hours after cycling [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in this study, which measured the CS activity in the plantaris muscle tissue, ERG showed the highest activity, but it was lower than the activity shown in previous studies [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and there was no significant difference between treatments. This suggests that though the dose of Rg1 treated within 24 hours stimulated Rg1 production, the protein synthesis caused by mRNA production may have been affected by a time factor, thus it did not influence the enzyme activity enough.</p><p>In swimming time to exhaustion, results showed that compared with NP and NRG, EP and ERG exhibited significance differences with swimming for longer periods of time (more than 2-folds and 3-folds longer, respectively). ERG showed the additive effect by acute intake of Rg1 in addition to the changes caused by long-term exercise. A previous study conducted on cycling time to exhaustion in humans using Rg1 treatment and the results of the study showed that the placebo group showed 31.8&#x000b1;5.0min and Rg1 treatment group showed 38.3&#x000b1;6.7min, which was significant, and the short-term treatment of Rg1 was found to give a positive effect on aerobic capacity [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In another previous study on ginseng treatment, graded exercise was performed after 3-weeks of treatment with <italic>Panax Ginseng</italic> in humans, and the results showed that although no significant difference was observed, the <italic>Panax Ginseng</italic> treatment group showed longer exercise time [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Apart from this, many previous studies related to ginseng and exercise reported that administration of ginseng or Rg1 could give a positive impact on improvement of exercise capacity [<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The results from many studies were obtained using long-term intake of ginseng or ginsenoside, whereas short-term administration studies like this one were extremely rare.</p><p>To sum up, acute intake of Rg1, showed an additive effect on improvement of aerobic exercise capacity, which suggests that many attempts for developing new methods for utilizing efficacy ingredients mainly from ginseng and ginsenoside are necessary in the future. Considering that there are few studies available, and that the reported results are not consistent, not only are the mechanisms of action of a single active ingredient such as Rg1, but also the field research such as doses and timing are required additionally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_sec5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, whether acute uptakes of Rg1 following 6-week swimming can give any additive benefit on aerobic exercise capacity in SD rats was examined. Although CS mRNA production increased in exercise group (EP) and combined treatment group (ERG), there was no significant differences in the CS activity, which indicated that production of a specific mRNA and the protein it encodes do not have a direct relationship to the temporal and positional differences. However, acute uptakes of Rg1 following long-term swimming was shown to provide an additive effect on aerobic exercise capacity when using the swimming time to exhaustion test. This posits that a short-term intake of Rg1 can be used as ergogenic aids. It also notes the necessity of additional research on the mechanism of action and on the details of application protocols.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Ginsenoside Rg1 which was used in this study was supported by Kyung Hee Hanbang Bio Inc. and this article is an extract from Master thesis of &#x02018;Haam Sae Bom&#x02019; at Kyung Hee University in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>JD.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Lung</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>AG.</given-names></name><name><surname>Welsch</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ginseng supplementation does not enhance healthy young adults&#x02019; peak aerobic exercise performance</article-title><source>J Am Coll Nutr</source><year>1998</year><volume>17</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>462</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/07315724.1998.10718795</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9791844</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attele</surname><given-names>AS.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>JA.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ginseng pharmacology: Multiple constituents and multiple actions</article-title><source>Biochem Pharmacol</source><year>1999</year><volume>58</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1685</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00212-9</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10571242</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bahrke</surname><given-names>MS.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>WP.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of the ergogenic properties of ginseng</article-title><source>Sports Med</source><year>2000</year><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>113</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2165/00007256-200029020-00004</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10701714</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="JENB_2015_v19n4_311_B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bahrke</surname><given-names>MS.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>WP.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stegner A.
