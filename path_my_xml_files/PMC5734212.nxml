The rationale for the surgery rests on the tenet that symptom relief is achieved through decompression of the rotator cuff tendon passage. The primary objective of this superiority trial is to compare the efficacy of ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy (DA) in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS), where DA differs only by the lack of subacromial decompression. A third group of supervised progressive exercise therapy (ET) will allow for pragmatic assessment of the relative benefits of surgical versus non-operative treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Analysis</title><p>Finnish Subacromial Impingement Arthroscopy Controlled Trial is an ongoing multicentre, three-group randomised controlled study. We performed two-fold concealed allocation, first by randomising patients to surgical (ASD or DA) or conservative (ET) treatment in 2:1 ratio and then those allocated to surgery further to ASD or DA in 1:1 ratio. Our two primary outcomes are pain at rest and at arm activity, assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS). We will quantify the treatment effect as the difference between the groups in the change in the VAS scales with the associated 95% CI at 24 months. Our secondary outcomes are functional assessment (Constant score and Simple shoulder test), quality of life (15D and SF-36), patient satisfaction, proportions of responders and non-responders, reoperations/treatment conversions, all at 2 years post-randomisation, as well as adverse effects and complications. We recruited a total of 210 patients from three tertiary referral centres. We will conduct the primary analysis on the intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and Dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District and duly registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Conventional wisdom dictates that SIS is caused by&#x02019; impingement&#x02019; of the rotator cuff (RC) between the humeral head and the overlying acromion while lifting the arm. The appropriateness of this mechanistic explanation has been challenged lately where the generic label of &#x02018;subacromial pain syndrome&#x02019; is currently advocated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> The aim of the subacromial decompression procedure, typically carried out arthroscopically, is to decompress the RC tendon passage through the subacromial space through resection and smoothening of the hypertrophied or prominent anterolateral undersurface of the acromion. Management of shoulder pain has been estimated to account for 4.5&#x02009;million visits annually to physicians in the USA alone,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> accounting for US$3&#x02009;billion in costs each year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Since 44%&#x02013;65% of all shoulder complains are related to SIS, it is estimated that annual direct medical costs of SIS are over $1&#x02009;billion in the USA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>
</p><p>Since the introduction of subacromial decompression surgery in the early 1970s<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, the number of procedures has steadily increased across the entire western world. With the advent of arthroscopy, the number of these surgeries has increased dramatically&#x02014;fivefold from the 1980s to 2005 in the USA<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and 700% between 2000 and 2010 in the UK.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Remarkably, there is a stark absence of evidence from high-quality controlled trials to support the existing practice of performing subacromial decompression for patients with SIS. Two recent systematic reviews concluded that subacromial decompression provides no superior benefits in terms of pain relief, function or quality of life compared with non-surgical treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> There is even a placebo controlled trial to show the beneficial effect of exercise therapy&#x000a0;(ET) over placebo physiotherapy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the proponents of the procedure have argued that the evidence is skewed in favour of the therapeutic potential of surgery due to a significant crossover (5%&#x02013;15%) from conservative treatment to surgery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Although such concern is obviously warranted, it should also be recalled that surgeons&#x02019; own perceptions on the success of any surgery might similarly be biased due to a considerable surgical placebo effect.</p><p>The outcome of any medical (surgical) intervention&#x02014;particularly when treating primarily subjective symptoms&#x02014;is a cumulative effect of three main elements: placebo effects, critical therapeutic (surgical) element and non-specific effects, most importantly, the normal variation in the course of the disease and the regression-to-the-mean phenomenon.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Conceding that the act of surgery per se produces a profound placebo response, a &#x02018;true&#x02019; treatment effect is impossible to disentangle from the non-specific (placebo) effects&#x02014;such as the patients&#x02019; or researchers&#x02019; expectations of benefit&#x02014;without a placebo comparison group.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The critical therapeutic element is the component of the surgical procedure that is believed to provide the therapeutic effects (here, subacromial decompression), which are distinct from aspects of the procedures that are diagnostic or required to access the disease being treated (here, shoulder arthroscopy).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other ongoing study aiming to assess the true efficacy of subacromial decompression surgery in patients with SIS using a placebo controlled study design. According to the published protocol of this CSAW (Can Shoulder Arthroscopy Work?)&#x000a0;trial,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the investigators have chosen a very similar approach to that of our&#x000a0;Finnish Subacromial Impingement Arthroscopy Controlled Trial&#x000a0;(FIMPACT). In brief, the CSAW trial is a three-group pragmatic randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;comparing arthroscopic acromioplasty, active monitoring with specialist reassessment and investigational shoulder arthroscopy only. CSAW aims for recruitment of 300 patients with SIS to assess the efficacy of the surgery against no surgery, the need for a specific component of the surgery (acromioplasty) and the quantification of the possible placebo effect. As readily apparent, the two trials (FIMPACT vs CSAW) are very similar in design with the only notable differences being the primary outcome measure (pain at rest and after activity vs Oxford Shoulder Score, a score that assesses both pain and activities of daily living&#x000a0;impairment), the primary outcome assessment point (24 months vs 6 months) and the intervention delivered for the third group (ET vs active monitoring with specialist reassessment), respectively.</p><p>The primary hypothesis of our FIMPACT trial is that arthroscopic subacromial decompression&#x000a0;(ASD) is superior to diagnostic arthroscopy&#x000a0;(DA) in patients with SIS. In addition, we will perform a pragmatic comparison of surgical and non-surgical treatment options (ASD vs ET). The relative benefits of ASD and ET will be assessed without a priori hypothesis of the superiority of one or the other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of study design</title><p>The&#x000a0;FIMPACT trial is an ongoing multicentre, three-group randomised controlled superiority study with a primary objective to assess the efficacy of ASD versus DA in patients diagnosed with SIS. Our design also enables the pragmatic comparison of surgical and non-surgical treatment strategies (ASD vs ET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). To obtain three balanced study groups (of similar group size), we performed a twofold, sequential randomisation as follows: First, we randomised patients to surgical or conservative treatment in a 2:1 ratio and then randomised those allocated to surgery to ASD or DA in a&#x000a0;1:1 ratio. The initial patient screening for the trial began at one site (Tampere) on 1&#x000a0;February 2005 and was then expanded to two additional tertiary referral centres in March 2006 and December 2006 to improve recruitment and overall generalisability of the results. The recruitment was completed (all 210 required patients enrolled) in August 2013.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow&#x000a0;chart of the trial: enrolment, assigned intervention and follow-up scheme.&#x000a0;MRA,&#x000a0;MRI with intra-articular contrast; RC, rotator cuff.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014087f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained on 28&#x000a0;December 2004 from the institutional review board&#x000a0;of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District (R04200).

These participants were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a recruitment surgeon confirmed the clinical diagnosis of SIS. To qualify as a recruitment surgeon, all trial surgeons had to have experience of more than 500 shoulder arthroscopies before the start of the trial. Detailed clinical examination of the shoulder was performed on all referred patients to rule out possible instability, clinical signs of RC rupture, frozen shoulder or other causes of symptoms. Standard X-rays and MRI were obtained from all potential participants and assessed by both a musculoskeletal radiologist and an orthopaedic surgeon. For patients found eligible for this study (fulfilling indications for ASD), we obtained written informed consent and randomised them into non-operative or operative groups (1:2) immediately after the baseline appointment. If patient had bilateral symptoms, only one shoulder was included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We used specific eligibility criteria to ensure that recruited participants were only those with SIS. Accordingly, a standardised clinical examination was first performed, followed by a subacromial injection test.

This procedure ensured that all potential participants had a reflection period for consent of at least 48&#x02009;hours before giving their final consent to participate. Particular attention was paid to ensure that the participants realised that on entering the study they may receive only DA, in which case the subacromial decompression would not be performed. They were also informed that participation in the study is entirely voluntary and any decision they make would not affect their possible future care. In addition, every participant was informed of their right to withdraw from the trial whenever they desire without the need to supply any reason for such decision.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014087.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary appendix</title></caption><p>

Shoulder complaints other than SIS, such as full-thickness RC tears, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint and instability were ruled out as much as clinical diagnosis allows.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Baseline imaging</title><p>Standard X-rays of the shoulder were obtained to assess possible glenohumeral or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. An MRA&#x000a0;was also obtained to rule out any other intra-articular or extra-articular pathologies.&#x000a0;A musculoskeletal radiologist and an orthopaedic surgeon assessed all the images.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Randomisation and concealment</title><p>We used a two-phase sequential randomisation. In phase I, the participants were randomised into non-surgical or surgical treatment with allocation ratio 1:2. In phase II, those allocated to surgical treatment were further randomised to ASD or DA with 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>An independent statistician with no involvement in the execution of the trial prepared separate randomisation lists for each study centre using a computer-generated algorithm. Randomisation was carried out using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. The envelopes were kept in a secure, agreed location at each centre. To ensure concealment, block randomisation was applied using blocks varying in size randomly, the block size known only by the statistician.</p><p>To initially enter a participant into the study (phase I), an envelope containing the treatment assignment (non-surgical (ET) or surgery (ASD or DA), ratio 1:2) was opened during the baseline appointment. Participants randomised to ET started standardised physiotherapy within 2 weeks of the baseline appointment. Participants allocated to surgical treatment were scheduled for surgery aimed to be completed within 12 weeks of randomisation.</p><p>At the day of surgery, a DA was first carried out to confirm the eligibility of the participant (to rule out full-thickness RC tear and other obvious intra-articular pathology). Research/staff nurse then completed the randomisation procedure (phase II) by opening an envelope containing the surgical treatment allocation (ASD or DA, ratio 1:1). The allocation was revealed to the surgeon by showing the paper, but not expressed verbally.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2m1"><title>Diagnostic arthroscopy</title><p>All participants in the two operative groups first underwent arthroscopic examination of the shoulder with the use of standard posterior and lateral portals and a 4&#x02009;mm arthroscope. To maintain concealment, the surgery was carried out under general anaesthesia. The orthopaedic surgeon evaluated and graded possible intra-articular pathological changes. The RC integrity was also&#x000a0;evaluated from the subacromial space without performing routine bursectomy. If the integrity of the RC could not be assessed, bursal tissue was bluntly stretched with troachar or resected on the tendon side to allow visualisation. If arthroscopic examination revealed any unexpected pathology (such as capsular pathology, full-thickness RC tear or osteoarthritis), the patient was treated according to&#x000a0;current clinical practice guidelines for the given pathology while under the same anaesthesia. In such a case, the participant was excluded from the trial. Patients with partial tears were included in the study, while patients with a full-thickness tear were excluded and RC repair was carried out.</p><p>After the arthroscopic examination of the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space, confirming the eligibility of the participant, the participants were randomly assigned to receive either ASD or DA only. If the patient was allocated to the DA group, the operation was terminated. To ensure concealment of the participants and the staff other than those in the operating theatre, the participants were kept in the operating theatre for the required time to perform subacromial decompression.</p></sec><sec id="s2m2"><title>Arthroscopic subacromial decompression</title><p>Debridement of the subacromial bursa was performed with a shaver and/or electrocoagulation, followed by the resection of the bony spurs and projecting anterolateral undersurface of the acromion by a shaver as described by Ellman.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2m3"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>In both the ASD and the DA groups, the postoperative rehabilitation was identical. All surgically treated participants received one visit to an independent physiotherapist for guidance and instructions for home exercises. Subsequent rehabilitation was carried out according to the standardised rehabilitation protocols of the participant centres. Since the initial rehabilitation after a surgery needs to be &#x02018;tempered&#x02019; due to joint irritation, the rehabilitation protocol of the operatively treated groups (ASD and DA) was not identical to the ET group.</p></sec><sec id="s2m4"><title>Exercise therapy</title><p>In the ET group, supervised progressive physiotherapy was started within 2 weeks of randomisation using a standardised protocol. The protocol was based on the same principles as the regimen shown effective for the treatment of SIS earlier,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> but was updated&#x02014;with the help of the principal investigator of the original study<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02014;to conform with the state-of-the-art ET for SIS. The regimen was based on daily home exercises, and included 15 visits to an independent physiotherapist for guidance and monitoring of the progress, carried out approximately once a week. The aim of the supervised exercise treatment was to restore painless, normal mobility of the shoulder girdle, eliminate any capsular tightness and to increase the dynamic stability of the glenohumeral joint and the scapula.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Compliance to treatment allocation and possible crossover</title><p>Participants allocated to the&#x000a0;ET group were told at the time of giving consent that they would be allowed to consider crossing over to the ASD group if they didn&#x02019;t get adequate relief of symptoms (preferably no sooner than 6 months post randomisation). Similarly, in the two surgical treatment groups, the participants were informed of the possibility of unblinding if debilitating symptoms persisted 6 months or more after operation. If the participant was allocated to the&#x000a0;DA group, ASD was offered. If the participant had undergone ASD, he/she was offered extended physiotherapy. No prespecified criteria were used for determining&#x000a0;&#x02018;inadequate relief of symptoms/debilitating symptoms&#x02019;, rather it was left to the participants and the study physicians to

All attempts were made to make follow-up as convenient for the patients as possible. Participants were required to visit the outpatient clinic only at 6 months and 24 months (and 5 years&#x000a0;and 10 years) postrandomisation, while the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups were carried out using mailed questionnaires to minimise inconvenience to the participants. The follow-up visits had no more discomfort for the participant than the routine clinical shoulder examinations. The follow-up schedule did not involve extra costs to the participants. Follow-up rate was monitored throughout the trial and patients who did not return follow-up questionnaires would receive reminder telephone calls.

The&#x000a0;FIMPACT trial was powered to detect a minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) in a VAS Pain Score (improvement of at least 15; assumed SD 25) between ASD and DA (or ET). To achieve a somewhat unconventional (stringent) 90% study power and using a two-sided type I error rate (5%), our trial requires 68 patients per study group to show clinically meaningful advantage of ASD over DA (or ET).

Acknowledging the potential of surgery to produce powerful placebo effects,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> our primary comparator is DA, differing from the ASD only by lacking the critical therapeutic element of the ASD (subacromial decompression). We will also conduct the pragmatic comparison of surgical and non-surgical treatment options of SIS by including a third group of progressive ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>, ASD vs ET).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretations and generalisability</title><p>Our interpretation scheme primarily rests on the tenet that the minimum requirement for the clinical viability of ASD is that it needs to show superiority to DA&#x02014;a therapeutically inert and thus a clinically non-viable option.

This design should thus yield findings that are widely applicable to patients with characteristic clinical signs and symptoms of SIS. We will also compare ASD with a&#x000a0;non-operative treatment option for SIS, the progressive ET, in a more pragmatic comparison, which is confounded by the lack of blinding of the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study design and interpretation of results.&#x000a0;ASD,&#x000a0;arthroscopic subacromial decompression; DA, diagnostic arthroscopy; ET, exercise therapy; SIS, subacromial impingement syndrome.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014087f02"/></fig><p>The generalisability of our primary (efficacy) comparison may be questioned as the patients are carefully selected (strict eligibility criteria) and treated by experienced shoulder surgeons.

As for the skill&#x000a0;level of the surgeons, the index surgical procedure (ASD) is a relatively simple procedure and thus likely not very sensitive to individual surgeons&#x02019; experience. For example, the amount of bone removed from the undersurface of the acromion seems to have at best a marginal effect on the outcome.

</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Rationale for outcome assessment and statistical analysis</title><p>Traditionally, the assessment of the treatment effects of two or more interventions has relied primarily on the statistical significance of the mean differences of the intervention groups. However, as described in a recent paper,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> to truly assess the clinical relevance of a treatment, one also needs information about the distribution of individual responses. In essence, one needs to look at how many people on treatment and on comparator group(s) had a response at least as great as the MCID. Such individuals have been described as &#x02018;responders,&#x02019; and this approach of comparing treatment groups as a &#x02018;responder analysis&#x02019;.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> The authors<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> suggested that &#x02018;<italic>Clinical trials should specify in their protocol that they will report the distribution of results in individual participants as well as the mean difference. Researchers should publish plots of individual results and responder analyses in clinical trial reports.</italic>&#x02019; The FIMPACT trial adheres to this suggested approach. Accordingly, we will elaborate several relevant and often interrelated issues, such as the study power, the primary outcomes and their interpretation, the MCID, as well as the approach we have chosen for carrying out a responder analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Study power</title><p>Traditionally the sample size is calculated based on the MCID or MCII, that is, the smallest change in measurement that signifies an important/detectable improvement in a patient&#x02019;s symptom(s). MCII/MCID is not a static value even for one outcome instrument, but rather can have different values when assessed with different methods or <italic>in different patient populations</italic>. We chose VAS at rest and during arm activity as our primary outcomes, because shoulder pain is the primary complaint of patients with SIS. The FIMPACT trial was powered to detect an improvement of at least 15 on a 0&#x02013;100 VAS scale<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> between ASD and ET. This yielded a sample size estimate of 70 participants per group. To safeguard against lack of study power, we chose a statistical threshold of 90% over the more conventional 80%. In this context, Norman <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> recently introduced a thought-provoking proposal arguing that a standard (&#x02018;off-the-peg&#x02019;) sample size of 64 per group would be just as valid an estimate as one obtains by more traditional (&#x02018;made-to-measure&#x02019;) sample size calculations.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Finally, although the statistical power is a vital step in the <italic>planning phase</italic> of any clinical trial, the actual quality of evidence (certainty in the obtained estimates) can only be appropriately assessed from the CI of the data obtained.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Responder analysis</title><p>As noted above, instead of focusing only on the statistical significance of the mean differences between treatment groups in the VAS (ie, the mean improvement from baseline to 24 months), we will also carry out &#x02018;a responder analysis&#x02019;. In principle, this analysis allows physicians to inform a patient of his or her chance of experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement from the treatment, both in absolute terms and in comparison, to a control group. The difference between responders and non-responders can be considered the net&#x000a0;benefit of the treatment. One proposed means to carry out a responder analysis relies on the assessment of the proportion of patients reaching the patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) and the patient-disappointing symptoms state (PDSS). As no universal consensus exists on either the PASS or the PDSS in the context of SIS, we chose to anchor our responder analysis to the patient&#x02019;s assessment of satisfaction with the shoulder treatment outcome: Patients reporting very satisfied or satisfied will be categorised as &#x02018;Responders&#x02019; and those reporting very dissatisfied or dissatisfied as &#x02018;Non-responders&#x02019;. Given the obvious coarseness of this approach, we plan to evaluate the appropriate criteria for PASS and PDSS in more detail in the future, exploring the potential contribution of, for example, arm pain at rest and at activity, shoulder function, and night pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Ethics of placebo surgery</title><p>A recent systematic review of the use of surgical placebo shows that in more than half of these studies the treatment group that included critical surgical/therapeutic element had no greater effect than a placebo group.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The review also showed that risks of AEs were small and the placebo group was safer than the surgery under investigation. These findings make a compelling case for the use of surgical placebo controls when a placebo effect may be present. Regarding the ethics of surgical placebo controls, the authors of the review state &#x02018;<italic>Placebo controlled surgical trials raise important ethical concerns but are justified when there is a genuine equipoise; that is, a disagreement in the medical community about whether one treatment is superior to another, because standard treatment does not exist or its efficacy is questioned.</italic>&#x02019; They continue by concluding: &#x02018;<italic>Placebo controlled trials in surgery are as important as they are in medicine, and they are justified in the same way. They are powerful, feasible way of showing the efficacy of surgical procedures. They are necessary to protect the welfare of present and future patients as well as to conduct proper cost effectiveness analyses. Only then may publicly funded surgical interventions be distributed fairly and justly. Without such studies ineffective treatment may continue unchallenged.</italic>&#x02019; Our views regarding the ethics of using a surgical placebo group are perfectly aligned with these notions.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>One possible confounder in our trial is that subacromial pain is also the hallmark symptom of a RC tear, although the latter patients usually also represent with muscle weakness. To exclude patients with a (clinically&#x000a0;relevant) RC tear, our eligibility screening included two preoperative assessments: (A) clinical exams targeted at finding obvious weakness of the RC muscles and (B) MRA, an imaging modality with a shown 92 specificity and 94 sensitivity for &#x02018;full-thickness&#x02019; RC tears.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> In addition to these, we also carried out (C) a DA in the ASD and DA groups prior to randomisation. Despite the thorough <italic>preoperative</italic> screening, 10% (14/136) of the participants allocated to the two surgical groups had to be excluded because of acromioclavicular&#x000a0;arthrosis (n=1) or intra-articular pathology found at DA (n=13). Although this does not have any effect on our primary comparison (ASD vs DA), one could argue that the ET and operatively treated groups (ASD and DA) are not fully comparable. At the same time&#x000a0;we don&#x02019;t know the clinical relevance of small RC tears or superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, which don&#x02019;t result in obvious muscle weakness and/or are not apparent in MRA. In the end, if this bias proves clinically relevant in our analysis, it will skew our results by favouring the ASD group in the pragmatic comparison (ASD vs ET). Another concern related to the pragmatic comparison (ASD vs ET) is that the progressive ET regimen carried out in the ET group is different from the postoperative rehabilitation carried out by patients in the ET group, for obvious reasons; surgically treated patients need time to recover from the initial surgical trauma. Furthermore, patients with ASD are also subject to some degree of postoperative immobilisation, extended sick leave, and modifications in pain medication and activities, all of which potentially have an effect on the outcome of treatment.</p><p>Another obvious concern related to our study design is the discrepant timing of the start of the actual treatment between the ET and the two surgical groups due to the time required to arrange the surgery. Acknowledging this, the 2-year follow-up was chosen as our primary time point for assessing the benefits of treatment, as we assume that by this time the potential confounding effect of slightly different follow-up times should be diluted to a minimum. This is also the reason why we use data from the shorter-term follow-up visits (ie, visits performed at 3&#x000a0;months, 6 months&#x000a0;and 12 months after randomisation) primarily to illustrate the trajectory of the treatment response in the three groups. Concerns over the varying time span from the randomisation of the patients to the trial to the actual induction of treatment (due to delay in surgery) also applies to the CSAW trial.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> To compensate for the waiting list effects, the CSAW investigators have chosen a slightly different strategy: Although the primary outcome assessment is performed at 6 months after randomisation in the&#x000a0;CSAW trial, they have introduced additional follow-up assessments, referenced from surgery, for patients waiting for longer than 4 months for their surgery after randomisation. They have also set a secondary outcome measurement point at 1&#x02009;year postrandomisation</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Ethics</title><p>FIMPACT trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
