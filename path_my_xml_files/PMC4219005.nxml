The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay of genetic, metabolic, biochemical, and biomechanical factors with variable components of inflammation. Subsets of patients with OA develop an inflammatory and erosive form of the disease. As one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases, the condition leads to pain in and around the affected joints and to swelling, stiffness, deformity, and gradual loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This disease not only affects older people, but also the younger working population. The pathologic mechanisms and its triggers are still not known. Treatment options are limited to symptomatic therapy and (rarely) surgical intervention. Compared to the research results of hip OA and knee OA, there are very few basic research activities in the field of hand OA. However, over the past 15&#x000a0;years, there has been an increase in the number of clinical trials in OA including hand OA. Nevertheless, effective treatments for OA are limited, since many treatments have only small symptom-relieving effects. There are few therapeutic studies in patients with hand OA investigating oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs, and other topical drugs. For the symptomatic slow-acting drugs in OA (SYSADOA) and disease modifying drugs in OA (DMOADS), very few studies can be identified, and unfortunately, many publications are available only as abstracts. Most of these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used a broad range of outcome measures, some of them poorly standardized. Differences in disease definition between studies make it hard to generalize the results for clinical practice. Many studies were underpowered or planned as pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HCQ (originally an antimalarial drug) is a disease modifying drug (DMARD) used for inflammatory erosive OA in clinical practice. HCQ has been used since the 1950s for the treatment of various rheumatic and dermatologic diseases. Current research has further enhanced our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanisms of these drugs, involving inhibition of endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which inhibits B cell and dendritic cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With this understanding, the use of these medications in rheumatology is broadening.</p><p>In OA and hand OA, symptomatic therapy with NSAIDs or coxibs is the most frequently administered treatment. Regarding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;-antagonists, one pilot study with adalimumab (ADA) in patients with erosive/inflammatory OA (EOA) of the hands demonstrated that ADA was well tolerated; however, treatment with ADA for three months did not significantly improve signs and symptoms of EOA, and most patients did not achieve an ACR20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Three studies of HCQ in EOA, including one abstract and one letter, are available. HCQ at a dose of 200 to 400&#x000a0;mg daily was effective in seven patients with evidence of EOA on X-ray. This study was an open retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The result of an open retrospective study of eight patients with EOA of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and a dosage of 400&#x000a0;mg daily demonstrated that in six patients an improvement of synovitis, morning stiffness, and global assessment was seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in 15 patients with EOA of PIP and DIP joints and radiological changes consistent with OA showed that HCQ was more effective than placebo on clinical (Ritchie-Index) and biological assessments (ESR, IL_2receptor level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To summarize, the review of published data on hand OA raises more questions than it answers with regard to the evaluation of therapeutic agents in hand OA. Moreover, the few RCTs that have been performed were in small patient populations and lack standardized outcome assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A task force of the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recently published guidelines and recommendations for clinical trials in hand OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite initial evidence for good efficacy of HCQ, there has not been a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in a larger patient group. In the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) evidence-based recommendations for the management of hand OA, HCQ was not included as therapeutic option because of the current lack of randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The evidence of HCQ in hand OA has never been investigated in controlled randomized studies, although there are clinical indications for good effectiveness in daily rheumatologic practice. Until now, HCQ is only used for hand OA in daily practice once all other available therapies have failed. HCQ treatment of patients with other rheumatic diseases shows that the drug is very well tolerated if management for the prevention of possible side effects (e.g. retinopathy) is carried out adequately. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that HCQ decreases the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b1; by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 by endotoxin-stimulated whole blood was also noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Monotherapy of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with chloroquine results in a decrease in serum levels of IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; production by antimalarial drugs, which mainly affect monocytes, may be independent of the lysomotropic action of the drugs and related to nuclear effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. HCQ acts as prostaglandin antagonist by inhibition of phospholipase A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory OA synovial tissue have a similar pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. OA cartilage shows lower production of proteoglycans, type II collagen, and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, HCQ potentiates Fas-mediated apoptosis of synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This background and the knowledge of the effectiveness in RA patients raise the question of whether this drug may also be effective in hand OA. When compared with other immunomodulatory agents, antimalarial drugs have a favorable safety profile. Our understanding of the toxicities and modes of action of these drugs may suggest new applications and modified treatment regimes in hand OA where there is huge unmet clinical need. On the other hand, more studies are needed to further explore the relationship between self-reported and radiographic outcomes and the relationship with other domains such as biomarkers and other imaging modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The aim of OA TREAT is to investigate the efficacy of HCQ by clinical and radiological outcomes compared to placebo in patients with severe and refractory inflammatory hand OA. The co-primary hypotheses are that patients receiving HCQ have a lower Australian-Canadian OA Index (AUSCAN) score in the dimensions for pain and hand disability at week 52 and that they have a lower rate of radiographic progression from baseline to week 52 compared to patients receiving placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial is based on a call of investigator initiated trial funding 2009 by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung [BMBF]) and is carried out with German rheumatologic and statistical stakeholders with experience of treating hand OA.

We considered differences in change scores in the AUSCAN scales pain and hand function, which were observed in RCTs comparing NSAIDs (lumiracoxib or ibuprofen) with placebo as clinically relevant differences that also should be detected with a sufficient power in this RCT. For these reasons, we aim to detect an effect size (ES) of 0.4 for pain (SD: 4.3) and of 0.25 for function (SD: 7.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An ES of 0.25 is also considered to be relevant for changes in the radiographic scores. Based on these assumptions, a sample size of n=255 per group is sufficient to achieve a power of 95% for the multiple endpoint test (first primary hypothesis) and an 80% power for the second primary endpoint (radiographic progression). The sample size is also sufficient to achieve an at least 80% power when comparing the two AUSCAN subscales pain and hand function separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization, treatment assignment and allocation concealment</title><p>Randomization will be undertaken during normal working hours (Monday to Friday from 9:00 to 17:00) by the German Rheumatologic Research Center (Deutsches Rheumatologisches Forschungszentrum, DRFZ) of participating centers upon receipt of a randomization request form and after blinded review of X-rays of both hands.</p><p>Identical HCQ and placebo capsules will be produced to ensure allocation concealment. Upon production, study medication will be packed into numbered bottles according to a randomization schedule. This will be prepared by the DRFZ using a computerized random number generator, thereby guaranteeing full allocation concealment. Trial medication will be issued in numerical order by the pharmacy of the Charit&#x000e9; - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin. Participants in each site will be randomly assigned to the intervention arm or the placebo arm in a ratio of 1:1 and the randomization will be double-blind.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blinding</title><p>As this is a double-blind study, all parties involved including the investigator, study coordinator, and subject will remain blinded to each subject&#x02019;s treatment throughout the course of the study. The blind will be maintained at all times until all data has been collected and the study database locked. Participants will be randomized centrally by computer generated random numbers stratified by center. Patients and investigators are blind to the treatment allocation. A sealed envelope containing the blinded information will be provided to the investigator and retained by him/her in a locked or secured area. This envelope may be opened in the case of emergency. Unopened envelopes will be returned to the sponsor at the end of the study. Use of NSAIDs and rescue medication (acetaminophen) will be assessed carefully throughout the trial. The possible influence of these drugs on the outcome will be discussed. Radiographs will be read in a concealed time order by two readers blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All patients who received at least one dose of the study medication will be included in the statistical analysis of the efficacy and safety of HCQ (modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population). To control the familywise error rate of 5%, a closed test procedure was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the first step, the first primary hypothesis is tested by means of the multiple endpoint tests according to L&#x000e4;uter and O&#x02019;Brian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Using this test the outcome in the AUSCAN scales pain and hand function at week 52 is compared between the treatment groups. The multiple endpoint test compares a standardized sum of both outcome measures (AUSCAN pain and function). Since we can assume that the outcome in pain and hand function are correlated, this test is more powerful than a Bonferroni-type test procedure or Hottelling&#x02019;s T<sup>2</sup> test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the case of a significant difference of the first primary hypothesis, the second primary hypothesis (radiographic outcome at week 52) will be tested by means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based on ranks (nonparametric ANCOVA). Parametric ANCOVA with baseline status as co-variable will be applied to compare secondary outcomes (pain, function, quality of life parameters (SF-36)). Changes in the co-use of NSAIDs and/or analgesics will be compared between both groups. To estimate whether any imbalance in the use might have influenced the outcome in pain and function the suggestions by Dougados <italic>et al</italic>. for comparing different drugs and different dosages will be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the unlikely case that in the verum arm the dosages are more frequently increased by 50% or more (including an increase from 0&#x000a0;mg to half of the full dosage), this finding will be taken into account in the interpretation of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data collection and data management</title><p>All subject data obtained during the study will be recorded using pseudonyms.

Access to this list is only provided to the local study personal and the study monitor. The original source files and medical records directly related to the study can be accessed by study monitors, auditors or inspectors from regulatory authorities. All data collection of pseudonomized data will be done on standardized case report forms (CRFs), which will be completed by site staff, verified by the principal investigator, and returned to the clinical trials unit for double data entry. All data will be recorded electronically at the sponsor&#x02019;s site by independent data managers. The sponsor will maintain a list of personnel authorized to enter data into the database. Validation of correct data entry will be ensured by the named data managers to check for discrepancies and to ensure consistency of the data. Validated data will be entered into an electronic trial database. Any addition, change or correction to the entered data must be approved by the investigator and will be recorded. Records of correction will be kept together with the case report form. Regular backups of the electronic data will be performed.

The sponsor must provide a trained monitor to assist the investigator(s) in conducting the clinical study. The monitor must visit the clinical study center on a regular basis and at least once before the first subject has been enrolled, once during the course of the study, and finally at study completion. The monitor has the responsibility of reviewing the ongoing study with the investigator(s) to verify adherence to the protocol and to deal with any problems that arise. At all times the sponsor must maintain the confidentiality of the study documents. It is the responsibility of the study monitor to verify the study documents against the subject&#x02019;s original medical records. The investigator (or his/her deputy) agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

The trial monitoring requires a high degree of professional expertise of the monitor. We have a variety of very specific outcome criteria, which are new to the involved trial sites. The focus of monitoring will be on developing, checking and adjusting the trial procedures, and on providing training, mentoring and support to study staff in response to the issues identified. In addition to the on-site monitoring, the following activities are planned: central monitoring of fax data and data management, training of and information on trial staff, and specific support of trial sites (information and download website) and investigators (investigator meetings). Independent audits will also take place in the course of study. The monitoring will be performed for 33% of source data verification, 100% of inclusion and exclusion criteria and 100% of primary endpoint criteria. Pre-study visits prior to the start of the study were carried out for 6&#x000a0;months in advance.

Treatment options are currently limited to symptomatic therapy and (rarely) surgical intervention, with NSAIDs or coxibs being the most frequently administered treatment. Unfortunately, their symptom-relieving effect is often too small, and adverse effects can be substantial. There is, therefore, huge unmet clinical need for effective and safe treatment options.</p><p>There are currently few therapeutic options to treat hand OA. Often NSAIDs are prescribed. In long-term use, however, these effective drugs have a very high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and impairment of the renal function. Coxibs are alternatively available, but cardiovascular side effects have been reported for both NSAIDs and coxibs. Although clinical trials showed a trend for a good efficacy of HCQ in hand OA, the development of the drug was not pursued further. A major reason was the lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry. In the treatment of RA and SLE, HCQ is a very effective drug and its side effect profile has been known for many years. Provided that all safety measures are carried out, this drug is very well tolerated and also safe in continuous treatment. Hand OA is not a life-threatening illness, but leads to a severely impaired quality of life due to pain. In addition to the definition of termination criteria, safety-related parameters are regularly investigated and questioned (for example, AE, SAE) during the study. Before the start of the study, the patients will be educated in detail about the associated risks. Patients will receive a decision time of at least 24&#x000a0;hours before giving written consent. Furthermore, the patient may withdraw his consent at any time during the study. The project will follow all regulations and legal requirements for data protection, AMG/GCP, and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The co-primary clinical endpoints in this study are the changes in AUSCAN dimensions for pain and hand disability at week 52. The AUSCAN (Australian/Canadian hand OA Index) is a patient-centered self-administered questionnaire developed specifically for hand OA studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It consists of three subscales and a total of 15 items: pain subscale (rest, gripping, lifting, turning, and squeezing), stiffness subscale (morning stiffness), and a physical function subscale (turning taps/faucets, turning a round doorknob or handle, doing up buttons, fastening jewelry, opening a new jar, carrying a full pot, peeling vegetables/fruits, picking up large heavy objects, and wringing out wash cloths) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been validated in both OA and RA patients. Associations with grip strength and radiographic severity of hand OA have been demonstrated. Post-validation experience in phase III clinical trials has confirmed the responsiveness of the AUSCAN. Versions with 5-point Likert scales, 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) and 11-point numerical rating scales (NRS) are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this study, we chose the NRS version as it combines the simplicity of the Likert scale with the high responsiveness of the VAS. The most commonly used approach to analyze the questionnaire is by summation of the 15 components (total AUSCAN score), resulting in scores between 0 and 150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The following potential limitations of the study should be noted: generalizability of the results may be limited by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and results may not apply to the entire target population. However, selection criteria were kept as broad as possible to ensure maximal generalizability. For ethical reasons, changes in the NSAID dosages including new treatment starts or treatment terminations are allowed. Since an imbalance in the use of co-medications might have an influence on the outcome in the clinical parameters, the use of NSAID/analgesics is recorded at each study visit and will be analyzed as a secondary outcome. In case there is any imbalance, we anticipate an increased use of co-medication in the placebo group, which could weaken the differences between both treatment arms especially regarding the AUSCAN scales for pain and hand function. However, even if this increased use of NSAIDs/analgesics would reduce the assumed effect sizes for both scales by 25%, the power of the multiple endpoint test comparing the first primary outcome will be greater than 80%. In the unlikely case of an increased use of NSAIDs and/or analgesics in the verum arm, this observation will be considered in the interpretation of the findings to discuss the possibility of a false positive result.</p><p>HCQ has been used since the 1950s for the treatment of various rheumatic and dermatologic diseases. It is also used for inflammatory erosive OA in clinical practice, but there are no high-quality clinical trials to support its use in hand OA. Three pilot studies of HCQ in EOA are available, but their results are contradictory, population sizes are small, and there is a lack of standardized outcome measures. Despite a favorable safety profile and initial evidence for good efficacy of HCQ, there has not been a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in a larger patient group. HCQ was therefore not included as a therapeutic option in the EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of hand OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To close this gap, we are currently performing the trial OA TREAT to investigate the efficacy of HCQ by clinical and radiological outcomes compared to placebo in patients with severe and refractory inflammatory hand OA. In contrast to other current studies on symptomatic hand OA, for example, HERO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], OA TREAT focuses on erosive hand OA, a more severe subset of hand OA with very limited therapy options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment and follow-up of participants are in progress.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ACR</term><def><p>American College of Rheumatology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACR20</term><def><p>ACR20 criteria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADA</term><def><p>adalimumab</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMG</term><def><p>Arzneimittelgesetz, German Medicinal Products Act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUSCAN</term><def><p>Australian-Canadian OA Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BfArM</term><def><p>Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMBF</term><def><p>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung, German Ministry of Education and Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>c-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCA</term><def><p>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DGRh</term><def><p>Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Rheumatologie e.V., German Society of Rheumatology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIP</term><def><p>distal interphalangeal joints</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMARDs</term><def><p>disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMOADS</term><def><p>disease-modifying drugs in osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSB</term><def><p>Data Safety and Monitoring Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRFZ</term><def><p>Deutsches Rheumaforschungszentrum, German Rheumatism Research Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EC</term><def><p>Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EOA</term><def><p>erosive and inflammatory osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ES</term><def><p>effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESR</term><def><p>erythrocyte sedimentation rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EudraCT</term><def><p>European Clinical Trials Database</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EULAR</term><def><p>European League Against Rheumatism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FKZ</term><def><p>F&#x000f6;rderkennzeichen, reference number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP-V</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice -
