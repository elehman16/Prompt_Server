Effective against gingivitis, TCs have not been proven to protect against other infectious diseases. The FDA, which is reviewing TCs, has requested further information on their efficacy.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold>&#x02003;Stanford's Outcomes Research in Kids (STORK) is a rolling cohort of pregnant women and their babies followed to age 36 months. STORK includes a nested, randomized intervention of HPCP with and without TCs to assess the effect of TCs on reported infection. Mothers report daily infectious diseases symptoms in babies using a weekly survey. We compared cumulative infection rates (reported days sick/total days followed) in each intervention arm. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a subset of 20 babies. Analyses were blinded to intervention arm; Chi-square test or quasi-Poisson regression were used as appropriate.</p><p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold>&#x02003;A total of 119 babies have been born with 52 (43.7%) and 63 (52.9%) randomized to the TC and non-TC arms, respectively (4 were not randomized). As of April 2014, babies had been followed for a median of 48 weeks (range: 3-135 weeks). Breast feeding rates were similar in both arms (p = 0.56). The cumulative infection rate was different between arms (8.3% and 12.3% in the TC and non-TC arms, respectively; p &#x0003c; 0.001) as was the median infection rate (i.e., per baby) (4.4% vs 7.7%, p =0.07). Among sick babies, the proportions of days of cold, cough, ear pulling/tugging, diarrhea and fever did not differ significantly between arms; the proportion of vomiting days was less in the TC arm (7.2 vs 11.1%, p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Urinary triclosan was detected in 7 (88%) of 8 breastfed babies in the TC arm (mean: 125 pg/ml). While these levels are lower than those seen in TC-using adults (data not shown), they are significantly higher (p = 0.02) than levels in non-breast fed babies in the TC arm (N = 2), babies in the non-TC arm (N = 7) and babies who were not randomized (N = 3) (19.4, 11.7 and 8.8 pg/ml).</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusion.</italic></bold>&#x02003;In this preliminary analysis, residence in a household randomized to TC-containing HPCP is associated with a lower incidence of infectious disease symptoms in infants. Low levels of TC exposure in infants appear to derive from breast-feeding.</p><p><bold><italic>Disclosures.</italic></bold>&#x02003;<bold>All authors:</bold> No reported disclosures.</p></body></article>
