Exercise therapy of the ankle plantar flexors (i.e. tendon loading) is considered crucial during conservative rehabilitation. Alfredson&#x02019;s isolated eccentric and Silbernagel&#x02019;s combined concentric-eccentric exercise programs have both shown beneficial results, but it is unknown whether any of these programs is superior for use in clinical practice. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of both programs on clinical symptoms. Secondary objectives are to compare the effectiveness of both programs on quality of life and functional outcome measures, to investigate the prognostic value of baseline characteristics, to investigate differences in cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">Eighty-six recreational athletes (21&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years of age) with unilateral chronic midportion AT (i.e. &#x02265; 3&#x000a0;months) will be included in this multicenter assessor blinded randomized controlled trial. They will be randomly allocated to either a group performing the Alfredson isolated eccentric training program (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43), or a group performing the Silbernagel combined concentric-eccentric program (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43). In the Alfredson group, participants will perform eccentric heel-drops on their injured side, twice daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks, whereas in the Silbernagel group, participants perform various concentric-eccentric heel-raise exercises, once daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Primary outcome measure will be the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment &#x02013; Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain during daily activities and sports, duration of morning stiffness, global perceived effect, the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and the Euroqol instrument, and functional performance measured with the heel-raise test and the countermovement jump. Additionally, alongside the RCT, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. Assessments will be performed at baseline and after 12, 26, and 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study is the first to directly compare the Alfredson and the Silbernagel exercise program in a randomized trial.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] When not adequately managed, the injury may cause long term absenteeism of sports and daily activities. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] Treatment of midportion AT is initially conservative, usually requiring several months, with a plethora of possible treatment options. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Historically, AT is considered as an inflammatory condition, but more recently it has been regarded as a failed healing response of the tendon, with minimal inflammatory influence. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] In 2009, Cook and Purdam proposed a model that considers tendinopathy as a continuum, in which three somewhat interchangeable stages can be distinguished: 1) reactive tendinopathy, 2) tendon dysrepair, and 3) degenerative tendinopathy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] According to the authors, these stages all require tailored load management and exercise intervention strategies. The model was recently revisited, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but it is still generally agreed that exercise therapy (i.e. tendon loading) is crucial to promote improvement of symptoms and function. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Several exercise programs have shown favourable results in mid-portion AT, with both beneficial effects on pain and function. Recent studies concluded that there is strong evidence for eccentric exercise therapy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] particularly according to the Alfredson eccentric exercise program. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In the Alfredson program, the plantar flexor muscle-tendon unit is loaded eccentrically by performing heel drops on the injured side, while using the non-injured limb to (concentrically) return to the start position. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] A total of 180 repetitions is performed daily, and this may be a great time-consuming burden for the patient, potentially compromising compliance and consequently the effectiveness of the program. Although the majority of studies using the Alfredson program reported significant improvements post-intervention, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] it should be noted that other studies reported less positive effects. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] Moreover, a recent study of Stevens &#x00026; Tan (2014) showed that a less stringent &#x0201c;do-as-tolerated&#x0201d; eccentric protocol can lead to equal improvements in pain and function compared to the Alfredson protocol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which may be advantageous from a patient perspective. However, as exercises were performed only for a period of 6 weeks, and mid- and long-term follow-up measurements (i.e. &#x0003e; 6 weeks) were lacking, conclusions should be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par21">Also, exercise programs other than isolated eccentric loading showed to be effective in AT. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] In a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), Beyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that heavy slow resistance training (HSRT) using gym equipment leads to equally good clinical improvement compared with the Alfredson program. Furthermore, in an earlier systematic review, Malliaras et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] already concluded that there is equivalent evidence for the Silbernagel concentric-eccentric exercise program, although this conclusion was based on limited evidence. Unlike the Alfredson protocol, the Silbernagel protocol also comprises concentric and even plyometric loading of the Achilles tendon. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] From a patient perspective, a potential benefit of the Silbernagel program over the Alfredson program, may be the frequency of the exercises (i.e. only once a day). This may encourage training compliance and consequently can result in better outcomes. Furthermore, a combination of concentric and eccentric loading may better restore concentric muscular deficits, as training gains are known to be specific to the contraction mode. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Although both the Alfredson and Silbernagel program have shown favorable results in midportion AT, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] comparison of the results is hampered by heterogeneity of study populations.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] Participants are asked to stand on one leg with a straight knee, supporting with their fingertips to the wall for balance. They are asked to perform as many heel raises as possible, with a straight knee and a frequency of one heel raise every 2&#x000a0;s, avoiding forward body sway. The test is terminated when the participant stops, cannot keep the frequency, or when the technique is incorrect for two consecutive repetitions. The total number of heel raises will be used for data analysis. Secondly, the one-legged countermovement jump (CMJ) will be used to evaluate jump height. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] This test has previously been used as a functional outcome measure in patients with midportion AT. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Although jump height is determined by many other muscle groups, research has shown that the calf muscle complex accounts for an important part of the CMJ movement.

Participants are asked to quickly bend their knee as much as they want and then immediately jump upwards to their maximum height. They are allowed three maximal trials, and the best jump height (in cm) is used for data analysis. Pain during the heel raise tests and CMJ is recorded on a 0&#x02013;10 numerical pain rating scale.</p><p id="Par53">Differences in cost-effectiveness between both programs will be investigated by collecting several variables that are related to direct and indirect (medical) costs during follow-up assessments.

Compliance will be calculated by dividing the amount of exercises actually performed by the prescribed amount of exercises (i.e., 2&#x000d7; per day for the Alfredson group and 1&#x000d7;/day for the Silbernagel group).

If necessary, missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all continuous variables, and means and SDs will be reported (or median and interquartile range for non-parametric data). For nominal and categorical data, proportions will be calculated and reported.</p><p id="Par59">Baseline comparability of the two groups will be assessed by the Student t-test (parametric data), and non-parametric tests where appropriate.

This study protocol describes the first RCT directly comparing the effectiveness of both programs. We designed a pragmatic study, in which we try to replicate how both programs are described in the clinical setting. By using the VISA-A &#x02013; a condition-specific validated questionnaire that is widely recommended for use in research and clinical practice &#x02013; as the primary outcome measure, we hope that comparison of our results to other studies and clinical practice will be enabled.</p><p id="Par62">Besides the effectiveness on symptom reduction and QOL, our study also compares the effectiveness of both programs on functional performance of the muscle-tendon unit. This comparison has not previously been performed, whilst research has shown that functional deficits of the muscle-tendon unit may still persist after 1 year in patients with AT, even though symptoms have fully recovered. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">We will also assess differences in cost-effectiveness in the mid-term and long term. Cost-effectiveness may be an important parameter for clinical decision making, but to date, research investigating cost-effectiveness in AT treatment is scarce. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] We expect no difference in direct intervention-related costs, since both programs are performed at home and the amount of supervising physiotherapy sessions is similar, but we are predominantly interested in potential differences in indirect costs (e.g. absenteeism of work, school and sports) between both programs.</p><p id="Par64">Recruitment for this trial will be performed in different institutions, i.e. sports medicine clinics, hospitals, and general practices. Therefore, participant characteristics may differ, and this potentially could lead to different subgroups of participants. No stratified randomization for referral type is performed, but by including recreational athletes, it is expected that both study arms will consist of relatively homogeneous groups. Furthermore, we try to collect important participant characteristics that may cause potential bias to the results of this study. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that the participants&#x02019; metabolic health is not fully covered, whilst research showed that this may be a confounding factor. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">We feel that the pragmatic nature of our study is a strength, as it mimics the clinical setting. Nevertheless, a potential limitation of this pragmatic design that we cannot draw any conclusions on the underlying mechanism of possible differences in effectiveness, since we have not controlled for many of the potential contributing factors.</p><p id="Par66">Additionally, our study does not include a study arm performing no exercise intervention. Therefore, it remains unknown whether potential improvements are caused by the exercise programs or by the natural course of the condition. Although it is generally agreed that exercise therapy is crucial in the treatment of AT, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] we acknowledge that the lack of a non-exercise (wait-and-see) group is a potential limitation of the study design.</p><p id="Par67">In summary, this multicenter two-arm RCT will compare the effectiveness of the Alfredson isolated eccentric to the Silbernagel combined concentric-eccentric program for treatment of chronic midportion AT.
