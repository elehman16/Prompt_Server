However, it remains unclear if alterations in sustained DMN suppression, variability and connectivity during prolonged cognitive engagement are implicated in adult ADHD pathophysiology, and to which degree methylphenidate (MPH) remediates any DMN abnormalities. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial of MPH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831622" id="ir0005">clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831622</ext-link>) explored large-scale brain network dynamics in 20 adults with ADHD on and off MPH, compared to 27 healthy controls, while performing a reward based decision-making task. DMN task-related activation, variability, and connectivity were estimated and compared between groups and conditions using independent component analysis, dual regression, and Bayesian linear mixed models. The results show that the DMN exhibited more variable activation patterns in unmedicated patients compared to healthy controls. Group differences in functional connectivity both between and within functional networks were evident. Further, functional connectivity between and within attention and DMN networks was sensitive both to task performance and case-control status. MPH altered within-network connectivity of the DMN and visual networks, but not between-network connectivity or temporal variability. This study thus provides novel fMRI evidence of reduced sustained DMN suppression in adults with ADHD during value-based decision-making, a pattern that was not alleviated by MPH. We infer from multiple analytical approaches further support to the default mode interference hypothesis, in that higher DMN activation variability is evident in adult ADHD and associated with lower task performance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Increased temporal variance of the default mode is associated with poor decision-making.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Ability to sustain default mode suppression is reduced in adult ADHD.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">The DMN is more highly connected to attention networks in ADHD.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Methylphenidate increased DMN precuneus connectivity, but has otherwise weak effects.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Excessive activity of the DMN is evident in ADHD and associated with poor decision-making.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adult ADHD</kwd><kwd>Dopamine</kwd><kwd>Reward</kwd><kwd>Decision-making</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>Functional networks</kwd><kwd>DMN</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by age-inappropriate inattention and/or impulsivity/hyperactivity (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>).

ADHD persists into adulthood for many patients (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Biederman et al., 2011</xref>), but it is currently unclear whether normalization of brain function from stimulant medication is equivalent in adults and children with the condition (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Bush et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Epstein et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Schrantee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Brain-behaviour relations are built on the interaction between multiple intrinsic functional neural networks comprised of spatially distributed regions through temporally correlated activity (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Disruptions within or between such networks may result in behavioural abnormalities (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Sripada et al., 2014</xref>). These intrinsic functional networks are most commonly studied during rest, but show coherence during both rest and task engagement (<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). One approach to elucidating the involvement of functional brain networks on cognitive operations is to study how strongly specific networks are engaged during cognitive tasks, for instance, by analysing the correlation between network time series and known task parameters. Another way of assessing the relevance of functional networks is by studying temporal BOLD signal variance. It is presumed that signal variance reflects the dynamic allocation of resources to brain regions utilized during cognitive operations, such that greater variability is indicative of greater flexibility or adaptability of those regions (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Grady and Garrett, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">It has been proposed that DA modulates signal integrity in the brain (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study found that younger, higher performing adults had greater blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal variability in task-relevant cortical regions than older (likely DA depressed) adults during a working-memory task (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>d-amphetamine</italic> (which increases DA availability) increased signal variability in the older participants, which also improved task performance. This raises the question whether abnormal signal variability may be found in psychopathologies with known DA deficits, such as ADHD, and whether a DA agonist will increase BOLD variability in task-positive networks and task performance.</p><p id="p0045">Disrupted interplay within and between &#x0201c;task-positive&#x0201d; (i.e. networks essential for task execution) and &#x0201c;task-negative&#x0201d; functional networks (i.e. networks supporting off-task processing) is implicated in ADHD where it manifests as inattention and impulsivity (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Castellanos and Proal, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007</xref>). In particular, the task-negative <italic>default mode network</italic> (DMN), which includes the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial frontal cortex, has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role. The DMN is mostly active during rest, attenuated during externally oriented cognition, and is thought to be involved in self-referential or internally oriented processes (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>default mode interference hypothesis</italic> proposes that inattentiveness in ADHD may be caused by insufficient down-regulation of the DMN during goal-oriented processes (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Castellanos and Proal, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007</xref>). Reduced suppression of the DMN may disrupt task-positive networks and lead to lapses of attention and excessive &#x0201c;mind-wandering&#x0201d;. <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Weissman et al. (2006)</xref>, for instance, showed that reduced deactivation of the precuneus (posterior DMN) preceded attentional lapses during a goal-oriented task. Indeed, patients with ADHD have documented weakened within-network connectivity in the DMN and several task-positive networks (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2009</xref>), as well as increased functional and structural connectivity between the DMN and task-positive networks during rest (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">The pattern of decreased within network connectivity and increased between network connectivity has furthermore lead to the proposal that functional networks are less clearly segregated in ADHD (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Hoekzema et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>). Functional connectivity networks are more strongly differentiated in adults than children (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Fair et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Rubia, 2013</xref>), and it has been suggested that reduced differentiation of functional networks in patients with ADHD is caused by a brain maturation lag (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Fair et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Sripada et al., 2014</xref>). Reports of more diffuse functional networks also in adults with ADHD suggest that network differentiation reaches an earlier plateau than in healthy controls (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Hoekzema et al., 2013</xref>), and the disruptions in functional connectivity thus become more established features of the mature ADHD brain.</p><p id="p0055">Functional connectivity is suggested to be improved by increased DA availability (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Nagano-Saito et al., 2008</xref>). <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Liddle et al. (2011)</xref> found that DMN suppression during task was improved by MPH, and others have found that MPH increases DMN suppression as a function of task difficulty (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Metin et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the therapeutic effect of MPH, a DA reuptake inhibitor frequently prescribed for treating ADHD symptoms, may partly be mediated through its effects on large-scale brain connectivity. Importantly, while MPH is often only discussed in the context of DA, it also has an agonistic effect on the noradrenaline (NA) system (<xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2016</xref>). There are therefore two routes by which increased striatal DA can influence cortical functioning, despite low expression of the DAT in the cortex. First, manipulation of cortical activity through striatal DA via the cortico-striatal loop neurons (e.g. <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Grace et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Krugel et al., 2009</xref>). And secondly, due to the relatively stronger expression of the NA transporter (<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Schroeter et al., 2000</xref>), via heightened NA availability in the cortex.</p><p id="p0060">More generally, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Sidlauskaite et al. (2016)</xref> question whether documented abnormalities in DMN suppression in ADHD are in fact reflecting difficulties in sustaining DMN suppression, as their study shows that initial DMN suppression when cued to execute a task is not impaired in ADHD. However, this hypothesized dysfunction in sustaining DMN suppression has yet to be explored in ADHD. Moreover, a study of network connectivity found that MPH reduced the connectivity between the DMN and attention networks during rest in healthy adults (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>). Only one study, however, has explored disruptions both within and between functional networks in adults with ADHD (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>), and the possible amelioration of such disruptions by MPH remains unexplored.</p><p id="p0065">Taken together research suggests that patients with ADHD struggle to engage with tasks due to weak down-regulation of the DMN during task transitions, and that MPH increases the ability to suppress the DMN and also reduces its temporal coherence with task-positive networks. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of MPH on adults with ADHD, we aimed to characterise functional brain-network abnormalities during decision-making in adult patients with ADHD and the possible ameliorating effects of MPH. To this end, based on event-related fMRI data obtained from 20 patients and 27 controls, where the patients were randomly assigned to MPH (short: medicated patients) or placebo (short: unmedicated patients) in a repeated-measures cross-over design. We used group independent component analysis (ICA) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</xref>) to define the group level brain network nodes and dual regression (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>) to estimate the individual spatial maps and associated time series. A multiple analysis approach was adopted to illuminate the subject from different angles, where we assessed the intrinsic networks' engagement by known task variables, the temporal variance of the networks, and both the within and between network connectivity of the networks. We expected typical task-positive networks to have BOLD time series that correlate with decision phases of the task GLM, indicating that these networks are involved in task execution. Further, we anticipated reduced task related engagement of functional networks in adults with ADHD compared to controls during task transitions, and that MPH would improve task related modulations of networks. We additionally anticipated that temporal variability in task-positive networks would be reduced in the patient group compared to controls. Given the documented abnormalities in DMN activation during task in ADHD, we also predicted increased temporal DMN variability in the patient group, indicating that the DMN is overactive when it should be suppressed. Because of previous reports of DA agonists increasing BOLD variability, we also predicted that MPH would increase temporal variability in task-positive networks. In order to support previous reports of less segregated functional networks in ADHD, we lastly investigate within-network connectivity in the posterior DMN (precuneus) and between-network connectivity between the DMN and task positive networks in ADHD unmedicated patients, and also expected an amelioration of any connectivity abnormalities as a result of MPH.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods and materials</title><p id="p0070">This is a secondary investigation of a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of methylphenidate on adults with ADHD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831622" id="ir0010">clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831622</ext-link>), and we only briefly describe the study protocol here.

A total of 20 patients (13f/7m) and 27 controls (19f/8m) were included in the final analyses. All viable datasets were included to maintain statistical power. While there was a robust difference in age after exclusion (patients being meanly 2.5 (SD 1.9)&#x000a0;year younger than controls), the practical difference between a 27 and 29-year-old, ages where there are few expected cognitive differences related to age, should be negligible. All control participants were right-handed (missing data from one participant), and in the patient group there were 4 left, 15 right, and 1 ambidextrous participants. All male patients were diagnosed as predominantly inattentive subtype, while the female patients were both inattentive (8) and of combined type (5).

By studying the activation patterns and signal variance of 18 identified signal components (which we call nodes), and the connectivity between these nodes (the edges), we found aberrant activity and connectivity of the DMN in the ADHD sample.</p><p id="p0225">Importantly, the nodes identified corresponded to common functional resting-state networks, and all nodes but one displayed task-dependent activity changes, suggesting the dynamics of intrinsic functional networks were altered by cognitive engagement. Several analyses indicated abnormal activation of the DMN in the patient sample. With regards to the task-dependent activity changes in the functional networks, adults with ADHD showed increased levels of trial-by-trial suppression of the DMN compared to controls. Given the frequency of choice trials and lack of rest-periods during scanning, increased DMN suppression during each trial indicates that unmedicated patients were less able to sustain DMN suppression while anticipating upcoming decisions. This result was corroborated by increased DMN variance when patients were off medication compared to controls, suggesting that adults with ADHD displayed excessive DMN activity throughout the task. Increased DMN variance was also correlated with reduced performance on the task, which further supports the negative effect of excessive DMN activity during tasks. The DMN was additionally more positively connected to the left ventral attention network (VAN), while there was a general pattern of reduced connectivity between other nodes in ADHD. Contrary to our expectations, there were few robust effects of MPH on network connectivity.</p><p id="p0230">Multiple analytical approaches thus suggest that the DMN is overactive in adults with ADHD during decision-making, as indicated by increased trial-triggered DMN suppression and increased DMN signal variance. A pattern of increased DMN signal variance, reduced coupling between two attention nodes, and increased coupling between the DMN and the left ventral attention network (VAN) was evident when patients were unmedicated compared to controls, and also associated with reduced task performance across groups, indicating they are general network changes correlated with reduced performance. MPH robustly reduced precuneus connectivity in the DMN and reduced connectivity within core visual nodes.</p><sec id="s0110"><label>4.1</label><title>ADHD patients show reduced DMN down-regulation that is also associated with reduced performance</title><p id="p0235">The DMN was implicated in several analyses, both in regards to quantifying differences between patients and controls, but also in relation to task performance and effects of MPH.</p><sec id="s0115"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Variable DMN suppression during decision-making</title><p id="p0240">The task GLMs indicate that DMN activity was reduced during the decision phase in all participants and that reduced DMN activity was also related to increased accuracy. This pattern was more pronounced in patients than controls (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Given the difficulties with attention in ADHD, and previous studies indicating that decreased DMN suppression precedes attentional lapses (<xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>), it is possible that patients struggle to keep DMN suppressed between trials, and need to re-suppress it to execute the task. Such a process would result in the greater trial-by-trial variation in DMN suppression seen in the patient group.</p><p id="p0245">The analyses of node signal variance corroborate this explanation, as patients showed higher DMN variance than controls. Neural variance is thought to partly reflect the flexibility of the brain to explore and adopt different network configurations (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Deco et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>), and, in this context, the DMN is expected to display decreased variance during externally oriented tasks. Indeed, we found that increased DMN signal variance was associated with poor task performance (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). While a recent study found that increased DMN variance in young adults was associated with increased performance on a spatial working memory task (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Guitart-Masip et al., 2015</xref>), the current results indicate that DMN variability as measured by temporal variance of a DMN independent component is associated with lower task performance. Together these results provide novel evidence that adults with ADHD show reduced sustained DMN suppression during decision-making between trials and re-suppress the DMN at each choice, and that such excessive DMN variance is associated with reduced task performance.</p><p id="p0250">The interpretation of the DMN as overactive in adult ADHD is inferred by multiple analyses pointing in that direction. However, it was not possible to test this possibility directly, as there were no longer periods of rest during the experiment, nor did we have a resting condition. We thus could not test the activation level of the DMN in non-task periods. It is therefore also possible that increased task related suppression and DMN variance result from greater dynamic range of the DMN. However, given the current literature on the DMN in ADHD, and that increased DMN variance was associated with reduced task performance, this explanation seems unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Abnormal DMN connectivity with the precuneus and the left VAN</title><p id="p0255">The two edges between the DMN nodes and frontoparietal node 12 were the only edges with higher positive correlations in unmedicated patients than the controls <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Frontoparietal node 12 includes the temporoparietal junction, and inferior and middle frontal gyrus, and likely reflects the left ventral attention network (VAN). The VAN is commonly described as right lateralized, but these areas in the left hemisphere have also been implicated as important to attention processes (<xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">Vossel et al., 2014</xref>). Increased structural and functional connectivity between attention networks and the DMN has been reported previously in adult ADHD (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>), and reduced segregation between task-positive networks and the DMN has been suggested to arise from reduced regulation of the DMN by task-positive networks (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Fassbender et al., 2009</xref>). These results are therefore consistent with previous studies, and together suggest that the DMN is overly connected to attention networks during cognitive engagement in ADHD, possibly contributing to manifested symptoms of inattention.</p><p id="p0260">Additionally, MPH decreased precuneus connectivity to the DMN in the patient group (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Precuneus activation has been implicated in ADHD, where both higher activation during task engagement (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Tomasi et al., 2009</xref>), and lower activation during rest (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Castellanos et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2008</xref>) compared to controls were reported. MPH has been found to increase DMN suppression in precuneus during a Stroop task in adolescents with ADHD (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). The precuneus has also been implicated in non-spatial attentional shifts, and <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Tomasi et al. (2009)</xref> found that precuneus deactivation was amplified with increased cognitive load in a sustained attention task. These authors furthermore showed that MPH decreased levels of DA transporter binding in the striatum (indicating increased DA in the synapse), which in turn was related to increased precuneus deactivation. MPH related precuneus connectivity may thus be mediated by striatal influences. Alternatively, as DA transporter is, compared to NA transporter, minimally expressed in the cortex (<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Schroeter et al., 2000</xref>), precuneus connectivity may be altered by MPH through noradrenergic influences.</p><p id="p0265">More generally, while animal models of ADHD (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Meneses et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Sagvolden et al., 1992</xref>) and most neurobiologically detailed theories of ADHD propose a central role of DA (<xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2016</xref>), the current evidence is consistent with the view that both DA and NA levels are modulated by MPH, and their availability is associated with ADHD symptoms. For instance, catecholamine transporter blockers of DA and NA transporters affect levels of both DA and NA (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Han and Gu, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Bymaster et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Seeman and Madras, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, a recent functional connectivity study found MPH affected connectivity of cortical brain regions with the ventral tegmental area but also the locus coeruleus (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Kline et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0270">Together with our results, this suggests that increased catecholamine signalling through MPH medication facilitates attention by modulating deactivation in precuneus, a key region of the DMN. These observations are also in line with recent studies demonstrating decreased task-related DMN suppression in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Haatveit et al., 2016</xref>) and in elderly compared to young healthy adults (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>), in particular considering that both schizophrenia and cognitive aging have been associated with catecholamine alterations (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000e4;ckman et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000f8;rum et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Howes and Kapur, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><label>4.1.3</label><title>Less segregated functional networks in ADHD</title><p id="p0275">In addition to irregular connectivity in the DMN, there were patterns of reduced within-network connectivity in visual, subcortical, and frontoparietal networks in patients off medication.

The combination of widespread reduced connectivity within multiple nodes, decreased coupling between nodes of the same network, and increased connectivity between the DMN and VAN supports the hypothesis that patients with ADHD have more diffuse functional brain networks than controls (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Hoekzema et al., 2013</xref>).

Importantly, these effects of connectivity and task performance did not differ between the groups. Unmedicated patients had a stronger connection between the DMN and left VAN and weaker connection between the two task-positive nodes than the controls, and this is the same pattern associated with decreased task performance across all participants. Interestingly, in task-positive node 10 and the VAN controls additionally have stronger frontoparietal within&#x02013;node connectivity than patients. It is thus not only that the connection between the two task-positive networks is malfunctioning in ADHD, but also that the nodes themselves are disrupted.

The DAN shows the largest activation during the decision phase of all the nodes, and controls more actively engaged the DAN than patients. Furthermore, the DAN was less coupled to visual and sensorimotor nodes in patients off medication compared to controls (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Studies have shown that the frontoparietal network can dynamically change its degree of functional coupling with perceptual and sensory areas based on task demands (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aln&#x000e6;s et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Chadick and Gazzaley, 2011</xref>), and that such changes in coupling may act to bias perceptual decision processes (<xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). While the edges connecting sensorimotor and visual nodes to the DAN were not directly related to task performance, the diminished coupling between such regions in patients off medication may be a contributing factor to reduced performance in the patient group.</p></sec><sec id="s0135"><label>4.3</label><title>Weak effects of methylphenidate on functional connectivity</title><p id="p0290">Other than the reduction in precuneus connectivity in the DMN (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C), the reduction of connectivity in two visual nodes, and decreased variance in the sensorimotor nodes, the drug manipulation yielded fewer effects than expected. Given the increase of DA availability brought about by MPH and DA's importance in reward signalling (<xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2001</xref>), we expected some effects of medication on brain networks. The primary, pre-registered analyses of this study were concerned with the representation of task-specific information and the integration of such information in the brain (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Mowinckel et al., n.d.</xref>). While the results supported several of our hypotheses, the effects of MPH were also weaker than anticipated. There we found that MPH improved task accuracy, ameliorated the decreased representation of gain magnitude in the left striatum, and that functional connectivity between regions important for decision-making was improved by MPH as a function of symptom severity. Possible explanations for the weak effects of MPH, such as sample size and characteristics, are discussed in the limitations section.</p><p id="p0295">With regard to network variance, MPH reduced network variance in the sensorimotor network, but had no effect on the DMN, which was the only node where patients had aberrant variance. Given the previously reported increase in BOLD variance in older participants as a result of <italic>d-amphetamine</italic> (AMPH) (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>), which also improved task performance, we expected similar effects of MPH. Here we assessed the temporal variance on dual-regression time-series, while <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al. (2015)</xref> calculated the standard deviation of all voxels across task blocks, a difference which might explain result discrepancies. Also, while AMPH and MPH both inhibit DA reuptake from the synapse, AMPH additionally stimulates DA release (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fischer and Cho, 1979</xref>). AMPH thus has two mechanisms by which DA availability increases, likely resulting in higher availability of DA compared to MPH. Furthermore, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al.'s (2015)</xref> older participants had decreased BOLD variability in regions important to task execution, which was improved by AMPH. The only network with aberrant variance in patients in the current study was the task-negative DMN, and MPH did not alleviate this abnormality. In contrast, the effects of MPH on network variability in the current sample were reductions of variance in the sensorimotor network and the OFC. It is possible to interpret this reduction as an attenuation of overactive motor processes in ADHD (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Mostofsky et al., 2006</xref>), but as none of these nodes exhibited abnormal variance, this seems unlikely.</p><p id="p0300">While we observed within-network changes in response to MPH in the precuneus of the DMN and in core visual areas of visual networks, these changes are network specific. MPH might more successfully increase within-network connectivity, while not being strong enough to alleviate developmental disruptions in larger between-network dynamics. Although speculative, increasing connectivity within networks that are already established, but function at a reduced capacity, might be easier than changing disruptions between different networks that themselves function sub-optimally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0140"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0305">In order to study deficits in adults with ADHD, without the uncertainty that follows from a patient sample with multiple comorbidities that require treatment with other psychopharmacological substances, our patient sample might not be generalizable to the whole ADHD population. While we deliberately matched patients and controls on key characteristics such as gender and age, we were more lenient when it came to educational attainment. The choice of leniency arose from the proposal that &#x0201c;overmatching&#x0201d; on certain characteristics that have arisen as a result of the disorder itself would lead to an underestimation of the abnormalities associated with the disorder (<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Seidman et al., 1997</xref>). Such multi-collinearity is often dealt with by statistically controlling for other regressors, but leads to uninterpretable results as naturally co-occurring phenomena are artificially separated (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Chapman, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="p0310">Another limitation arises from our wish to test the effects of MPH on a sample of adults who were receiving treatment with MPH; all patients had therefore been receiving MPH treatment for a minimum of one month prior to testing. Previous studies of MPH effects in healthy adults have been on MPH-na&#x000ef;ve participants, and the PET literature suggests strong effects of acute MPH on DA transporter binding in the striatum in previously unmedicated adults with ADHD (<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Tomasi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2007</xref>). Studies on the effects of MPH in patients used patients having received long-term medication (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Liddle et al., 2011</xref>). Using ADHD patients on MPH treatment has two related implications for the interpretation of our results. First, it is possible that the difference between the on and off MPH conditions is due to withdrawal effects, as opposed positive effects of MPH in the MPH condition. Second, because it is known that MPH can also have chronic effects on neurotransmitter functioning, it is possible that our results underestimate the full effects of MPH, because acute cession of MPH will not remove the chronic effects. A generalization of our results to a population of patients who have never received MPH should therefore be made cautiously. We outline elsewhere the experiments required to differentiate acute and chronic effects of MPH (<xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2016</xref>). The very low to unidentifiable levels of ritalinic acid in the blood of the patients in the placebo condition at least make it unlikely that patients were under the influence of MPH in the placebo condition.</p><p id="p0315">Finally, due to an MRI scanner upgrade data-collection ended prematurely, resulting in a smaller ADHD sample than aimed for. While the sample size is comparable to that of other fMRI studies in ADHD (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Cortese et al., 2012</xref>), it might still not be enough to robustly detect changes in network dynamics as studied here. However, the use of rigorous statistical methods through permutation testing and Bayesian inference should ensure the robustness of the results reported here, despite some of its limitations.</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0320">This study provided novel evidence for difficulties in sustaining DMN suppression during decision-making in adults with ADHD, which necessitates re-suppression of the DMN at each choice. The excessive activation of the DMN was also associated with poor task performance and corroborated by two different analytical approaches. While we found no evidence of a positive effect of MPH on the stability of DMN suppression, MPH decreased precuneus connectivity in the DMN, which is commonly found in studies of DA agonists. Moreover, a pattern of higher connectivity between and lower connectivity within the left ventral attention network and the DMN was not only associated with reduced task performance, but also found in the patient sample compared to controls. The results of this study thus support the default mode interference hypothesis, in that excessive activity of the DMN is both evident in adults with ADHD and associated with lower task performance. We also provided further support towards reduced brain network differentiation in ADHD, which here was not remediated by MPH medication.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><title>Financial disclosures</title><p id="p0325">Funding was provided by the <funding-source id="gts0005">Norwegian Research Council</funding-source> (#249519), the <funding-source id="gts0010">South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority</funding-source> (#2012051), and the <funding-source id="gts0015">Department of Psychology, University of Oslo</funding-source> (#143660).
