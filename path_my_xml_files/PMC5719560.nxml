Interventions targeting primary school children&#x02019;s afterschool discretionary time could increase PA. Teaching assistants (TAs) are a school resource and could be trained to deliver after-school PA programmes. Building on earlier work, this paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised feasibility study of a teaching assistant-led after-school intervention aimed at increasing PA levels of year 4 and 5 children (8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years old).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Phase 1&#x02014;pre-baseline: 12 schools will be recruited. In all schools, self-reported PA will be measured in all consenting year 3 and 4 children. In four schools, pupils will additionally wear a waist-worn Actigraph accelerometer for 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par3">Phase 2&#x02014;baseline: schools will be randomised to one of two enhanced recruitment strategies being tested for children: (1) a club briefing and (2) the briefing plus a taster Action 3:30 session. Up to 30 children per school will be able to attend Action 3:30 sessions and will provide baseline data on height, weight, psychosocial variables and accelerometer-measured PA.</p><p id="Par4">Phase 3&#x02014;intervention and follow-up: Schools randomised into intervention or control arm. Intervention schools (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) will receive a 15-week after-school programme when children are in years 4 and 5, run by TAs who have attended a 25-h Action 3:30 training programme. Control schools (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) will continue with normal practice. Follow-up measures will be a repeat of baseline measures at the end of the 15-week intervention.</p><p id="Par5">Phase 4&#x02014;process evaluation: session attendance, perceived enjoyment and perceived exertion will be assessed during the intervention, as well as the economic impact on schools. Post-study qualitative assessments with TAs, school contacts and pupils will identify how the programme could be refined. Accelerometer-determined minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day will be calculated as this is likely to be the primary outcome in a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par6">The Action 3:30 cluster randomised feasibility trial will assess the public health potential of this intervention approach and provide the information necessary to progress to a definitive cluster randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par7">

Physical activity in childhood is also associated with lower levels of a number of risk factors, including insulin, glucose, blood pressure and body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and with improved emotional well-being and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the benefits of regular physical activity, objectively measured UK physical activity data show that 51% of 7-year-olds do not met the recommendation of an hour of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Whilst physical activity during childhood has been shown to moderately track into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], physical activity levels typically decline with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with the end of primary school being a key period of decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Stimulating children&#x02019;s interest in, and increasing their feelings of competence in relation to, being physically active at this point could ameliorate this decline.</p><p id="Par21">Schools provide opportunities to implement public health interventions to large numbers of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; however, physical activity during the primary school curriculum is limited to 2&#x000a0;h of physical education (PE) per week. As a result, the school curriculum provides restricted opportunities for children to meet PA guidelines or develop their physical skills adequately during this key period of motor coordination and skill acquisition. Therefore, extending and maximising the quality of the current provision is likely to be a cost-effective means of increasing physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Time after-school is a key period that could be utilised to promote physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Children who are inactive after school are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; therefore, maximising the activity opportunities after-school could be an effective means of increasing physical activity in primary school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many children already participate in extra-curricular programmes for additional academic support, music, art-based activities and competitive sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Provision may be enhanced by the UK government announcement in the 2016 Budget that the primary school PE premium (which often funds after-school programmes) will be doubled to &#x000a3;320 million from September 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, current extra-curricular provision is dominated by fee-paying provision from external practitioners, such as football coaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the current economic climate, more cost-effective means of delivering these programmes, such as the use of existing school staff, are required.</p><p id="Par23">Teaching assistants (TAs) support schools and students in many ways. Many TAs would welcome an opportunity to deliver after-school activities but lack the skills and confidence to do so. Head-teachers are keen to allow TAs to deliver after-school activities because (a) it is consistent with the Extended Schools and NICE guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; (b) commercial activity session providers are expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and (c) it shows that the school is developing the skills of its workforce. Training TAs is an intervention approach which, if shown to be effective, could be rolled out nationwide and could be sustainable within existing school systems.</p><p id="Par24">We recently completed an evaluation of the original Action 3:30 afterschool intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The original feasibility study was conducted in 20 schools and participants were Year 5 and 6 pupils (9 to 11&#x000a0;year olds). Results showed that the Action 3:30 intervention could be implemented as planned, was liked by schools, children and TAs, and holds promise as a scalable physical activity approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The adjusted difference in weekday MVPA at the end of the intervention was 4.3&#x000a0;min higher (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;2.6 to 11.3) in the intervention arm. Exploratory, analyses indicated that the original intervention may hold more promise to increase boys&#x02019; activity (8.6&#x000a0;min, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.8 to 14.5) than girls&#x02019; (0.15&#x000a0;min, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;9.7 to 10.0). The effect on mean levels of MVPA among boys is among the best that have been shown for physical activity interventions in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, more work is needed to improve the content for girls, recruit less active participants, improve attendance and increase the TAs&#x02019; ability to manage disruptive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of the revised version of Action 3:30 which has been reworked to more successfully appeal to and engage girls and recruit less active children. Specifically, we have the following objectives:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par26">Objective 1: Optimise the intervention to increase activity in boys and girls.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Objective 2: Identify effective means of recruiting low-active children.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">Objective 3: Assess intervention fidelity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Objective 4: Estimate the effect of allocation to the Action 3:30 intervention on weekday MVPA of participants and related physical activity behaviours.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Objective 5: Collect the information needed to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial and assess the implementation potential of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Objective 6: Assess whether progression criteria for conducting a definitive trial are met (see below).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par32">Action 3:30 is a cluster randomised feasibility trial with school as the unit of allocation. Twelve schools will be recruited, with eight primary schools from South Gloucestershire local authority and four from North Somerset local authority. Schools will be recruited to provide variation in school size and the percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals (an indicator of deprivation). Participants will be pupils who are in years 3/4 (aged 7&#x02013;9) at the baseline assessment in each of the schools. Data will be collected at two time-points: baseline (T0) which will take place between May and July 2017 and then during the last 6 intervention sessions (T1) which will be in February of the next academic year, meaning pupils will be in years 4/5 (aged 8&#x02013;10) during the intervention and T1 data collection. The study design also includes an opt-out phase (phase 1) which will occur prior to T0 and will be used to compare the activity levels of children who consent to join the study compared to the overall sample of eligible children. Each of these phases is outlined below.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Phase 1: opt-out phase (pre-baseline)</title><p id="Par33">All children in years 3 and 4 in the 12 study schools will be asked to complete the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] prior to the main study commencing. In four South Gloucestershire schools, children will also be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7&#x000a0;days. Opt-out parental consent will be used. This will allow for analysis of differences in physical activity levels between those who are recruited to phase 2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Phase 2: baseline (T0)</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par34">We aim to recruit 30 year 3/4 pupils from each school. As girls are less active than boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we will aim for a minimum of 40% of the sample to be girls. All year 3 and 4 children able to regularly take part in physical education lessons will be eligible. In schools where more than 30 children consent, 30 will be randomly selected for the study.</p><p id="Par35">Two methods will be trialled for phase 2 recruitment: briefing (recruitment method A) or briefing plus taster session (recruitment method B). A goal of this project is to examine which of the two approaches is most effective for recruitment, to inform a recruitment strategy in a definitive future trial. Recruitment method A will involve a short briefing in each class to explain the study and provision of student information sheets and parental study information (information sheet and parental consent form to return). Recruitment method B will involve the briefing plus a taster session. Taster sessions will be led by coaches from Bristol City Council (a collaborating partner) and will involve a 20&#x02013;30-min activity session like that of the Action 3:30 after-school club. Four schools in South Gloucestershire and two in North Somerset will be randomly selected to receive the taster sessions. Written parental consent will be obtained for all participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A brief questionnaire will be sent home to parents who do not give consent for the main study to assess the reasons for not wanting their child to take part.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par36">All measures will be taken at baseline (T0) prior to randomisation and again during the last six intervention sessions (T1) and will be conducted by trained members of the research team. At both time points, children will wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for seven consecutive days to assess physical activity levels. The raw accelerometer data will be integrated into 10-s intervals at point of download. Periods of &#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;min of zero counts will be recorded as &#x0201c;non-wear time&#x0201d; and removed. Children will be included in analysis if they provide &#x02265;&#x02009;3 valid days (500&#x000a0;min of data between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.). Minutes in MVPA will be established for weekdays and weekends, using cut-points developed for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Accelerometer counts per minute (cpm), an indication of the volume of total activity, will also be derived. Sedentary time will also be estimated based on a cut-point of less than 100&#x000a0;cpm. MVPA and total activity will also be assessed during the period after-school.</p><p id="Par37">At each time point, children will complete a questionnaire assessing activity-based perceptions of autonomy, relatedness, competence and enjoyment using established scales. Children will also complete the KIDSCREEN-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Child Utility 9D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (CHU9D) questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life. These questionnaires will be completed on tablet devices to aid data completion.</p><p id="Par38">Children&#x02019;s height and weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm with their shoes, coats and jumpers removed, using a portable SECA stadiometer and digital SECA scale, respectively. Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be calculated and converted to an age- and sex-specific body mass index standard deviation score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Data on socioeconomic status and ethnicity of child will be collected via parental questionnaire sent home at T0.

</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Allocation strategy</title><p id="Par41">Randomisation will take place after baseline (T0) data collection has been completed. School is the unit of randomisation. Six schools will be randomly allocated into the intervention arm and six into the control arm, stratified by local authority area (South Gloucestershire:North Somerset at a ratio of 2:1 in each arm) and recruitment method (recruitment method A:B at a ratio of 1:1 in each arm). There is potential that recruitment method B may influence children to increase their physical activity prior to baseline measurements; hence, equal numbers of taster session schools will be allocated to control and intervention arms so that any effects of the taster sessions would be balanced between the two arms and can be separated from intervention effects. Allocation will be performed (computer-generated allocation) by an independent member of the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration who will be blind to the school identity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 3: the Action 3:30 intervention and T1 data collection</title><p id="Par42">Each intervention school will receive the Action 3:30 after-school club for a total of 15&#x000a0;weeks. The intervention will run between November and March, when the children are in years 4/5. To minimise the displacement of existing after school provision intervention, schools will be encouraged to run the two weekly sessions whenever it is most convenient to do so in the timetable, providing it takes place straight after school.</p><p id="Par43">To deliver the intervention, two TAs from each intervention school will attend a 25-h (5-day) training programme focussing on delivering a physical activity programme after-school. Action 3:30 is based on principles derived from Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and as such, the programme will focus on promoting children&#x02019;s perceptions of autonomy, belonging and competence in relation to physical activity. Among a range of techniques to promote autonomy, TAs will be encouraged to provide choice within the activities, such as leading warm-ups and adapting games and in regard to the speed at which activities progress. TAs will be trained to support competence by setting progressive activities targeting quick success balanced by optimal challenge. They will give specific praise for attempts as well as outcomes. Relatedness will be supported through empathetic TA-child interactions. Our previous study showed that TAs are able to deliver Action 3:30 in line with these strategies and the revised version of the TA training aims to clarify misunderstandings and common problems.</p><p id="Par44">The 5-day training programme will be delivered by the Coach Development Manager at Bristol City Council. Once trained, TAs will deliver Action 3:30 twice a week for 15&#x000a0;weeks. Each session will last 60&#x000a0;min. Thirty detailed session plans have been produced and TAs will be asked to deliver sessions in the prescribed order. The session plans include a range of activities and games and emphasise participation and enjoyment. For 22 of the session activities, there is a video recording of model delivery; on 19 session plans, there are links to additional online resources; and on all 30, there are reminders for the TAs on how to embed the core principles of SDT within the session. Pupils will additionally be provided with 10 home activity cards that will be distributed after every three sessions.

Many children do not engage in a sufficient amount of physical activity, especially within the school curriculum. Primary school is a key period to establish physical activity behaviours, preferences and skills. The after-school period is an ideal time to provide physical activity provision. However, there is currently a lack of research-based well-evaluated after school interventions. The original Action 3:30 study showed that this intervention has the potential to improve the physical activity of children. However, in the original study, the intervention was more effective for boys than girls and recruitment strategies required improvement. We also identified that it would be important to identify whether it is possible to increase external validity by allowing a second enrolment of pupils. The goal of this study is to systematically test, via a feasibility study, whether addressing these issues results in a public health intervention that shows sufficient promise to warrant evaluation via a larger, cluster randomised controlled trial.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CACE</term><def><p id="Par8">Complier Average Casual Effect</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHU9D</term><def><p id="Par9">Child Health Utility 9D wellness scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par10">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cpm</term><def><p id="Par11">Counts per minute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par12">Intraclass Correlation Coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p id="Par13">Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAQ-C</term><def><p id="Par14">Physical Activity Questionnaire for older Children</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p id="Par15">Physical education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDT</term><def><p id="Par16">Self-Determination Theory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p id="Par17">Time point 0 (baseline)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1</term><def><p id="Par18">Time point 1 (follow up)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TA</term><def><p id="Par19">Teaching assistant</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was designed and delivered in collaboration with the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC), a UKCRC Registered Clinical Trials Unit in receipt of National Institute for Health Research CTU support funding.
