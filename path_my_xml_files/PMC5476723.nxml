Loteprednol etabonate 0.5% gel, a medium strength topical corticosteroid, is noninferior to a standard postoperative PRK regimen of a strong topical corticosteroid (prednisolone acetate 1%) followed by a taper with a low-potency topical corticosteroid (fluorometholone 0.1%) in preventing corneal haze and minimizing intraocular pressure spikes. As health insurance medication coverage and drug availability change, PRK postoperative corticosteroid use can be tailored based on what is economically feasible for the patient with low risk of side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The corneal wound resulting after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) induces keratocyte transformation to myofibroblasts.<xref rid="b1-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Myofibroblasts produce disorganized collagen, causing the appearance of corneal haze and leading to increased light scattering and decreased visual acuity.<xref rid="b1-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The mainstay in prevention of visually significant corneal haze involves decreasing the corneal inflammatory response with anti-inflammatory medications such as topical corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory medications.<xref rid="b2-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Previous studies have demonstrated topical corticosteroids to be beneficial in modulating post-PRK corneal inflammatory response, as well as reducing regression.<xref rid="b3-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Rabbit models have also shown topical steroids to be superior in reducing &#x0201c;peak haze&#x0201d; amounts compared with another ophthalmic immunomodulatory agent, cyclosporine A 0.05% (Restasis).<xref rid="b5-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (loteprednol) is an ester-based corticosteroid that exerts local therapeutic effects and is then quickly broken down into inactive metabolites by nonspecific esterases found in the cornea.<xref rid="b5-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The relatively fast metabolism of loteprednol gives it a lower side effect profile than other steroids, including a smaller effect on intraocular pressure (IOP).<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the ophthalmic literature, there is currently no consensus on a standard post-PRK corticosteroid regimen.</p><p>A previous retrospective study from our department demonstrated a similar incidence of haze and increased IOP in patients treated with loteprednol 0.5% suspension or flourometholone (fml) 0.1% suspension after both groups received prednisolone acetate 1% suspension for the first 3&#x02013;4 weeks postoperatively after PRK.<xref rid="b9-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Given the known lower incidence of increase in IOP with loteprednol relative to traditional corticosteroids,<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in this study, we aimed to compare the rates of this complication in patients using a taper of loteprednol with that of patients using prednisolone tapered to fluorometholone 0.1% (prednisolone/fml) after PRK.

The trial is registered clinicaltrials. govt NCT03123614. Patients underwent our standard refractive screening examination with 1 of 5 surgeons (MDM, PAF, JMF, CRF, and BZ), during which their candidacy for refractive surgery was determined, and the risks and benefits of all potential refractive procedures for which they medically qualify, which may or may not include PRK, were discussed. Eligible patients gave informed consent to participate in the study. Patients with a history of prior refractive surgery, keratoconus, forme fruste keratoconus, inferior steepening, and baseline untreated IOP of over 21 mmHg were excluded. Monovision eyes or near-targeted eyes were excluded from the study as well.</p><p>Corneal epithelium was gently debrided after exposure to ethanol 20% in balanced salt solution for 35&#x02013;40 seconds and placed in an 8.0 mm well. Laser ablation was performed using the Alcon Allegretto Wavelight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EX500 excimer laser (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA) according to the surgeon-optimized nomogram.<xref rid="b10-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Mitomycin C 0.02% (MMC) was used in 62 eyes (24 loteprednol eyes and 38 prednisolone eyes) whose ablation depth was greater than 60 microns after the laser ablation. Immediately after ablation or MMC, the ocular surface was rinsed with chilled saline for 30 seconds. This was followed by one drop of prednisolone acetate 1%, a topical fluoroquinolone, a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and a soft bandage contact lens.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 postoperative steroid regimens. Group 1 used loteprednol 0.5% gel in both eyes, starting at a frequency of 4 times per day for the first week, and then tapered to 3 times per day for 3 weeks, then 2 times per day for 1 month, and finally daily for 1 month. Group 2 used prednisolone acetate 1% suspension in both eyes, starting at a frequency of 4 times per day for the first week, then 2 times per day for 3 weeks, and subsequently converted to fml 0.1% suspension. Fml was used 3 times per day for 1 month, then 2 times per day for 1 month, and then stopped. Group 2 either received name brand or generic corticosteroid based on insurance coverage.</p><p>The primary outcome measures were incidence and grade of postoperative corneal haze and incidence of increased IOP &#x02265;10 mmHg above baseline or any IOP over 21 mmHg. Examiners were masked to the treatment arm when obtaining measurements of IOP and grading corneal haze. Secondary outcome measures included uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and manifest refraction spherical equivalent. Study outcome measures were evaluated for each treated eye of each subject at each study time point. The surgeon had the liberty to alter routine clinical management if IOP was elevated sufficiently to require medical intervention, if there was significant postoperative corneal haze, or if there were other postoperative complications. If enhancement surgery was deemed necessary and performed during the 1-year postoperative period, study data collection ended for that eye at the time of the enhancement.</p><p>Eyes were evaluated with the following procedures:

There were 114 eyes in the loteprednol group (60% male, 40% female) and 147 eyes in the prednisolone/fml group (52% male, 48% female). The mean age was 34.6 years in the loteprednol group and 35.3 years in the prednisolone/fml group. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent for the loteprednol group was &#x02212;3.72 D &#x000b1;2.12 and &#x02212;4.03 D &#x000b1;1.99 for the prednisolone/fml group (<italic>P</italic>=0.245). Average preoperative pachymetry readings were 537.2 and 545.4 in the loteprednol and prednisolone/fml groups, respectively.</p><p>MMC was used in 24 loteprednol eyes and 38 prednisolone eyes. There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative refraction or 3-month visual acuity outcomes in patients who had adjunctive MMC in either group.</p><p>Haze occurred in 3 out of 114 (3%) loteprednol eyes and in 7 out of 147 (5%) prednisolone/fml eyes (<italic>P</italic>=0.43). Haze was not seen in any loteprednol eyes with adjunctive MMC but was seen in 3 prednisolone/fml eyes with adjunctive MMC. There was significantly more haze in prednisolone/fml eyes treated with MMC than those without MMC (<italic>P</italic>=0.05), but there was no significant difference in lotemax eyes that received adjunctive MMC compared to those who did not receive MMC (<italic>P</italic>=0.12). Overall, when all eyes treated with MMC were compared to eyes without adjunctive MMC, there was no significant difference in haze formation (<italic>P</italic>=0.13). Despite the presence of haze, 2 loteprednol eyes and all prednisolone/fml eyes had a UCVA of better than 20/20 at the 3-month visit. One loteprednol eye with 1+ haze lost 1 line of UCVA 3 months postoperatively.</p><p>Mean pre- and postoperative IOP measurements are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-11-1113">Table 2</xref>. The mean preoperative IOP for the loteprednol arm was 14.4&#x000b1;2.11 mmHg and 14.3&#x000b1;2.13 mmHg in the prednisolone arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.76). At 3 months, the mean IOP was 13.15&#x000b1;2.43 mmHg in the loteprednol group and 12.22&#x000b1;2.38 mmHg in the prednisolone/fml group (<italic>P</italic>=0.003). Clinically significant elevation of IOP only occurred in 8 eyes of 4 patients. These patients were slightly older than the average patient with a mean age of 42.8 years. Two eyes were in the loteprednol arm and 6 eyes were in the prednisolone/fml arm. All IOP elevations occurred at or before the 1 month visit and were controlled with topical ocular antihypertensives and tapering of topical steroids. No surgical intervention was required for IOP elevation during the study period.</p><p>Visual acuity outcomes are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-11-1113">Figure 1</xref>. The mean 3-month postoperative logMAR UCVA was &#x02212;0.078&#x000b1;0.10 and &#x02212;0.075&#x000b1;0.09 in the loteprednol and prednisolone groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.83). The mean post-operative logMAR best corrected visual acuity at 3 months was &#x02212;0.120&#x000b1;0.059 and &#x02212;0.114&#x000b1;0.03 for the loteprednol and prednisolone arms, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.41). The mean spherical equivalent at 3 months was &#x02212;0.10 D &#x000b1;0.29 and &#x02212;0.11 D &#x000b1;0.30 for the loteprednol and prednisolone arms, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.72). Snellen visual acuity was excellent in both groups. In the loteprednol arm, 101 (89%) eyes achieved UCVA of 20/20 or better and 81 (71%) eyes achieved UCVA of 20/15 or better at 3 months. Similarly, 134 (91%) prednisolone eyes achieved a UCVA of 20/20 or better and 100 (68%) achieved a UCVA of 20/15 or better at 3 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent data from The European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery (EUREQUO) demonstrate that PRK is becoming increasingly popular compared to LASIK as a refractive surgical option.<xref rid="b12-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the changing healthcare insurance environment, many insurance plans are beginning to alter coverage for commonly used ophthalmic steroid drops. This has the potential to create an extra cost burden on PRK patients who need treatment for several months after their laser ablations. We have seen this in our practice with unpredictable drug pricing, variable insurance coverage, and availability of some steroid medications depending on numerous factors, which make it difficult for patients to obtain the necessary medicines in a timely and affordable manner.</p><p>Our results show an equal efficacy and a low incidence of side effects of loteprednol taper versus a prednisolone/fml taper with respect to haze formation and clinically significant IOP elevation. These findings support the use of either postoperative steroid regimen in patients after PRK.</p><p>Corneal haze formation was not significantly different in either group. Overall, 3.8% of patients had haze, but only 1 eye (0.3%) had visually significant haze at 3 months. Other studies have found rates of haze formation after PRK to be anywhere from 2%&#x02013;21%, and our study found similar results.<xref rid="b13-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Even when mild corneal haze was present, patients were often able to maintain an excellent UCVA as the haze slowly resolved. Both steroid regimens were shown to be effective in preventing haze development while avoiding common intraocular side effects. Five eyes (3 loteprednol and 2 prednisolone/fml) developed trace, late haze between months 3 and 6 that was visually insignificant. There was significantly more haze formation in prednisolone/fml eyes with adjunctive MMC compared to those without adjunctive MMC. Given the small number of patients who received MMC in our study, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from this trend. Eyes with adjunctive MMC after PRK may warrant closer observation of eyes without adjunctive MMC.</p><p>IOP elevation due to steroid response was uncommon in our study and was seen at or before the 1 month visit in all patients regardless of which drop they were using. At 3 months, patients in the loteprednol arm had statistically significant higher mean IOP than those who were at the end of the fml taper. This was clinically insignificant as no eyes in either group had abnormal IOP readings at the 3-month time point. These findings confirm the results of previous studies; the incidence of increase in IOP is low with medium (loteprednol)<xref rid="b7-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and low strength (fml)<xref rid="b16-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> topical corticosteroids. Our previously published retrospective chart review of loteprednol versus fluorometholone after PRK found very similar results with regard to IOP elevation after PRK.<xref rid="b9-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Busool et al reported that there was a correlation between high IOP after PRK and corneal haze formation.<xref rid="b17-opth-11-1113" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In their study, 16.98% of eyes with corneal haze versus 4.25% of eyes without corneal haze had IOP elevation. Only 1 eye with haze in our study also had high IOP.</p><p>Visually significant haze was exceedingly uncommon in our patient population (1 eye, 0.3% of eyes). In addition, visually insignificant haze occurred in 3.8% of eyes (10 eyes). The long-term significance of nonvisually significant haze or even visually significant haze that resolves is unclear. We plan to follow patients up to a year after PRK to see if haze or elevated IOP has any effect on outcomes compared to patients without these findings.</p><p>Visual and refractive results from our study were excellent in both groups, with nearly all eyes achieving a UCVA of 20/20 or better by 3 months. Differences in logMAR visual acuity, preoperative refractive errors, postoperative residual refractive errors, and UCVA were statistically insignificant at all time points.</p><p>We have concluded that topical treatment with a loteprednol 0.5% taper after PRK is clinically noninferior to a prednisolone acetate 1%/fluorometholone 0.1% taper with respect to haze prevention, IOP elevation, and refractive results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first prospective randomized study directly comparing a postoperative loteprednol taper to a prednisolone and fml taper in patients after PRK. We hope this study will continue to build evidence for multiple prophylactic steroid regimens that can be used after PRK, and that this will help physicians and patients achieve safe, optimal results when undergoing this procedure as it continues to grow in popularity worldwide.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported in part by an unrestricted grant from Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc., NY, USA, to the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>None of the authors have a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.
