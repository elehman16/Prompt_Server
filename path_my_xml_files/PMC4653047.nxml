This study was conducted to assess the non-inferiority of a 6-month depot formulation of TAP-144-SR (TAP-144-SR [6M]) 22.5 mg to a 3-month depot formulation of TAP-144-SR (TAP-144-SR [3M]) 11.25 mg in prostate cancer patients in Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 48-week Phase III, open-label, parallel-group comparative study. TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5 mg (6M group) and TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25 mg (3M group) were administered to 81 and 79 subjects, respectively. The primary endpoint was the rate of serum testosterone suppression to the castrate level (&#x02264;100 ng/dl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Serum testosterone of all subjects excluding one subject in the 3M group was suppressed to the castrate level throughout 48 weeks. The estimated between-group difference (6M group &#x02212; 3M group) in suppression rate was 1.3% (95% confidence interval: &#x02212;3.4, 6.8), and its lower confidence interval was more than &#x02212;10% of the pre-determined allowable limit value to judge the non-inferiority. The prostate-specific antigen concentrations were stable throughout the study in both groups. Progressive disease in the best overall response based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors was 0.0% for the 6M group and 2.6% for the 3M group. Adverse events occurred in 92.6% in the 6M group and 89.9% in the 3M group. Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 2.5% in the 6M group and 3.8% in the 3M group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>TAP-144-SR (6M) was not inferior to TAP-144-SR (3M) for the suppressive effect on serum testosterone level.

The incidence rate of prostate cancer is expected to keep increasing due to the prevalence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and aging, and the number of patients who develop prostate cancer predicted for 2020&#x02013;24 in Japan is 105 800 per year, which is higher than for any other types of cancer (<xref rid="HYV149C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>It is well-known that cell growth in prostate cancer is stimulated by androgens (<xref rid="HYV149C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hormone therapy and orchiectomy providing androgen deprivation have been established as the standard treatments for prostate cancer. The hormone therapy, monotherapy or combined androgen blockade therapy, includes luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists or an LH-RH antagonist that inhibits the production of testosterone following the suppression of gonadotropin release (<xref rid="HYV149C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Leuprorelin acetate is a LH&#x02013;RH agonist that is commonly used worldwide. Leuprorelin acetate was initially daily administered to patients, but the development of new formulation technology enabled 1-month (USA: 7.5 mg; EU and Japan: 3.75 mg), 3-month (USA: 22.5 mg; EU and Japan: 11.25 mg) and 6-month (USA: 45 mg; EU: 30 mg) depot formulations for prostate cancer, easing the burden on patients and physicians by reducing the number of injections and improving the quality of life of patients. A 6-month (24-week) depot formulation (TAP-144-SR [6M]) with the same formulation as that used in the USA has been developed in Japan (<xref rid="HYV149C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and a Phase II study was conducted in Japanese treatment-naive prostate cancer patients. The results showed that the optimal clinical dosage of TAP-144-SR (6M) in Japan was 22.5 mg (<xref rid="HYV149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) since the serum testosterone level of all six subjects who received the dosage subcutaneously was suppressed below the castrate level and no new safety signals were observed compared with the safety profile of the approved 1-month and 3-month (TAP-144-SR [3M]) depot formulations of TAP-144-SR. A double-peak pharmacokinetic profile was found in the Phase II study.</p><p>A Phase III, open-label, parallel-group comparative study was therefore conducted to assess the non-inferiority of treatment with TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5 mg compared with TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25 mg for 48-week suppressive effect on serum testosterone in prostate cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A Phase III, open-label, parallel-group comparative study of TAP-144-SR (6M) to TAP-144-SR (3M) was conducted to evaluate the hormone dynamics, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of the two formulations in prostate cancer patients who have remained stable on TAP-144-SR (3M) treatment. Subjects who were receiving the marketed product for 3 months (TAP-144-SR [3M]) were randomized to the TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5 mg arm (6M group) or the TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25 mg arm (3M group), and received two subcutaneous injections of TAP-144-SR (6M) or four subcutaneous injections of TAP-144-SR (3M) over a period of 48 weeks. The subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment groups, using dynamic allocation with the following factors of randomization: (i) TNM classification (&#x02264; any T any N M0 or any T any N M1); (ii) with or without treatment with nonsteroidal antiandrogen; (iii) with or without radiotherapy or surgical therapy; and (iv) study sites. This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable laws and regulations. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating study sites.

The secondary endpoints included the following: serum testosterone concentrations, serum LH concentrations, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations and serum TAP-144 concentrations from the start of study drug administration through Week 48. The efficacy, PSA, soft tissues and bone lesions were evaluated based on the response evaluation criteria in &#x02018;General Rule for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer&#x02019; (4th edition) (<xref rid="HYV149C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The soft tissues were evaluated based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (<xref rid="HYV149C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Bone lesions were determined using bone scintigraphy. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drug, and the Hormone level Analysis Set (HAS) was defined as the population of subjects in whom serious protocol deviations were not reported, who satisfied the minimum requirements of the protocol, and in whom primary endpoints were evaluable. The suppression rate of serum testosterone to the castrate level thorough 48 weeks in the FAS was analyzed by calculating the incidence rate by treatment group and the point estimates and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The point of estimate and the two-sided 95% CIs of the difference between the treatment groups (i.e. 6M group minus 3M group) was calculated by Newcombe Score Confidence Limits (<xref rid="HYV149C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). If the lower confidence bound for this percentage was greater than or equal to the allowable limit value (&#x02212;10%), it was judged that the non-inferiority of TAP-144-SR (6M) to TAP-144-SR (3M) was confirmed. It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis was performed by applying the same analysis method used for the primary analysis in the HAS and in the case of a lower testosterone level (&#x02264;50 ng/dl). Summary statistics were obtained for the secondary efficacy endpoints in the FAS.</p><p>The required sample size was estimated to be 75 subjects in each treatment group, a total of 150 subjects, from which the condition was set to 10% allowable limit value, with a significance level of 5% on both sides, and ensuring 80% power.</p><p>For the safety analysis, AEs and their severity were analyzed by treatment group. AEs were coded by System Organ Class and Preferred Term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.1, and their severity was graded based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (<xref rid="HYV149C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Subject demographics</title><p>A total of 205 patients were screened, and 160 of the 162 randomized subjects received the study drugs with a breakdown of 81 subjects in the 6M group and 79 subjects in the 3M group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="HYV149F1">1</xref>). Among the subjects who received the study drugs, 76 subjects in the 6M group and 74 subjects in the 3M group completed the study. Five subjects in each treatment group discontinued the study for the following reasons: AEs (two subjects in the 6M group and three subjects in the 3M group); major protocol deviations (one subject each in both groups); elevated PSA levels (two subjects in the 6M group and one subject in the 3M group).

One subject who did not maintain the castrate level in the 3M group did not meet the inclusion criterion. The serum testosterone level in this subject was 388 ng/dl before treatment with the study drug, 267 ng/dl after 1 week and 55 ng/dl after 2 weeks of treatment. For the sensitivity analysis, the same analysis that was applied to the primary analysis was utilized in the HAS as the secondary analysis. The results in both analysis sets were similar. In the case of the lower serum testosterone level (&#x02264;50 ng/dl), the suppression rate of serum testosterone throughout the 48 weeks (FAS) in the 6M group was 98.8% (80/81 subjects) and that in the 3M group was 98.7% (78/79 subjects). The estimated between-group difference in the suppression rate was 0.0% (two-sided 95% CI: &#x02212;5.5, 5.7).

In this study in which the suppression of testosterone was investigated in patients receiving hormone therapy, it is shown that the testosterone levels were suppressed to the castrate level of &#x02264;100 ng/dl throughout the 48 weeks in both treatment groups, excluding one subject in the 3M group whose testosterone level was not suppressed at the time of study initiation (inclusion criterion deviation). When testosterone suppression was assessed at the lower level of &#x02264;50 ng/dl in reference to the recent castration level (<xref rid="HYV149C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="HYV149C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), 1 subject in the 6M group had a testosterone level exceeding 50 ng/dl in addition to the above-mentioned subject in the 3M group. This subject in the 6M group had a transient increase in testosterone (53 ng/dl) after 8 weeks of treatment with the study drug. In the previous Phase II study in hormone therapy naive patients, it has been shown that no subjects had a testosterone level exceeding 50 ng/dl after 4 weeks in the 22.5 mg subcutaneous injection group (<xref rid="HYV149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Taking into account the present and previous results, the 22.5 mg of TAP-144-SR (6M) reliably suppresses serum testosterone in prostate cancer patients.</p><p>The PSA concentrations were stable throughout the study and there were no differences in disease progression assessed by the PSA values between the two groups. The results of best overall response assessed by RECIST indicated Stable Disease in all evaluable subjects, excluding two subjects in the 3M group who had Progressive Disease. Therefore, the effects of TAP-144-SR (6M) were comparable to those of TAP-144-SR (3M).</p><p>The incidence rate of AEs was 92.6% in the 6M group and 89.9% in the 3M group (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="HYV149TB3">3</xref>). The AEs reported in the 6M group were similar to those observed in the 3M group, and injection site reactions were frequent in both treatment groups. Injection site reactions have been reported in studies of degarelix, LH-RH antagonists, as well as leuprorelin acetate (<xref rid="HYV149C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, a series of injection site reactions were reported in 30.9% of subjects in the 6M group and 22.8% of subjects in the 3M group, and the injection volume of both was 1 ml per injection. The injection site reaction in the 6M group was slightly greater than in the 3M group; however, none of the injection site reactions in the 6M group were severe. One event of injection site erythema was Grade 2 but the other events were all Grade 1 in the 6M group. One event of injection site ulcer in one subject was reported as Grade 3, one event of injection site induration and injection site erythema, respectively, in two different subjects were reported as Grade 2 and the others events were all Grade 1 in the 3M group. There were no injection site reactions that resulted in discontinuation of the study in the 6M group, but two subjects discontinued the study due to injection site reactions in the 3M group. In a study using degarelix, injection site reactions were reported in 46.3% (<xref rid="HYV149C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), of which the initial injection volume was 3 ml per injection and the volume of the following maintenance injections was 4 ml per injection. Considering that both studies were conducted using subcutaneous injections, the frequency of injection site reactions might have been associated with the injection volume, because the study of degarelix, in which a higher volume than that of TAP-144-SR (6M) or TAP-144-SR (3M) in this study was used, showed a higher frequency of injection site reactions.</p><p>In the previous Phase II study, Grade 3 hypertension was reported in three out of six patients in the 22.5 mg intramuscular injection group (<xref rid="HYV149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this study with subcutaneous injections, hypertension was reported in five subjects (6.2%; Grade 3 in one subject and Grade 2 in four subjects) in the 6M group and in three subjects (3.8%; Grade 2 in all the subjects) in the 3M group, but no subjects discontinued the study due to hypertension. The results also showed that the changes in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the 6M group throughout the treatment period were slightly decreased, but no remarkable changes were observed. Since the same trend was observed in the 3M group, these results suggest that the effects of TAP-144-SR (6M) on the blood pressure are similar to those found with TAP-144-SR (3M).</p><p>It has been reported that androgen deprivation therapy increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) (<xref rid="HYV149C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). DM was observed in six subjects (7.4%, Grade 2 in all subjects; five subjects coded DM and one subject coded Type 2 DM) in the 6M group and three subjects (3.8%, Grade 2 in all subjects) in the 3M group, but none of these subjects discontinued the study due to DM. The glucose levels in the 6M group and the 3M group hardly changed throughout the study. These results indicate that there are no significant differences between TAP-144-SR (6M) and TAP-144-SR (3M) concerning the risk of aggravation or the onset of DM and an increase in insulin resistance.</p><p>It has been shown that the QTcF interval was prolonged for longer than 10 msec after 24 weeks of treatment with TAP-144-SR (6M) in treatment-naive prostate cancer patients in the previous Phase II study (<xref rid="HYV149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Similar prolongation with leuprolide acetate was reported in another study, and the results showed that the change in the QTcF interval from baseline was 14.0 msec after 12 months in the leuprolide 7.5 mg group (<xref rid="HYV149C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, in this study, the QTcF interval did not fluctuated much throughout the 48 weeks of the treatment period in subjects receiving hormone therapy in both treatment groups. Therefore, reduced testosterone, rather than a direct pharmacological effect of leuprolide acetate, could have caused the prolongation of the QTcF interval because prolongation of the QTcF interval was not observed in subjects in whom the serum testosterone had already been suppressed to the castrate level. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the QTcF prolongation with degarelix was also reported in hormonal therapy-naive prostate cancer patients, and the change was 13.0 msec after 12 months (<xref rid="HYV149C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="HYV149C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and some reports that indicate that the changes in the testosterone level would be related with prolongation of the QTcF interval (<xref rid="HYV149C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="HYV149C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>TAP-144-SR (6M) can reduce the frequency of injections, and could thus reduce the burden on patients and medical staff. However, the intervals between visits might be much longer, and medical practitioners and staff need to keep reminding patients of the next appointment to visit the hospital.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of TAP-144-SR (6M) in the Phase II study exhibited a double peak (<xref rid="HYV149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), which was different from that of TAP-144-SR (3M), indicating that TAP-144-SR (6M) was sustainably released for 24 weeks. In this study, there were no significant differences in efficacy and safety between TAP-144-SR (6M) and TAP-144-SR (3M) in prostate cancer patients, and no safety concerns were observed. TAP-144-SR (6M) was therefore confirmed to have excellent usability for the treatment of prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that TAP-144-SR (6M) is not inferior to TAP-144-SR (3M) for the suppressive effect on serum testosterone level. The efficacy of TAP-144-SR (6M) was comparable to that of TAP-144-SR (3M), and TAP-144-SR (6M) was as well tolerated as TAP-144-SR (3M). Since TAP-144-SR (6M) can reduce the frequency of injections and the burden on patients and medical staff, and provide an option as a new administration method in the clinical setting, it is expected to become widely applied to patients depending on the patients' medical condition and life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited</funding-source>.
