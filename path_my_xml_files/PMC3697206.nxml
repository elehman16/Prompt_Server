Plasma exchange is also applied as an adjuvant in exacerbations of relapsing MS. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of combination therapy with mitoxantrone and plasma exchange versus mitoxantrone alone in patients with aggressive MS.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty patients with aggressive relapsing remitting MS were randomly put into two groups. The first group underwent monthly plasma exchange for three successive months, followed by 12 mg/m<sup>2</sup> mitoxantrone at the end of each course and two more doses of 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> mitoxantrone in 3-month intervals. The second group received the same doses of mitoxantrone only without plasma exchange.

It is also the leading cause of disability among the youth. Control of disease activity in rapidly worsening or aggressive MS is a great challenge for clinicians. Although there are different definitions for aggressive MS in the literature, it can be best defined as occurrence of at least two relapses with sequel or an increase of at least two points in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score during the last 12 months with the presence of at least one gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion on the patient&#x02019;s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed within the last 3 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Although treatment with first-line disease-modifying drugs is proved to reduce the number of relapses and slow down disability progression, they have varying degrees of efficacy on disease control in patients with aggressive MS. Recent evidences suggest that treatment outcome may be improved in such patients by adding various agents to their treatment protocol as combination therapy. One of such combinations for patients at high risk of disability progression is induction therapy with a cytotoxic agent followed by either switching to or adding a disease-modifying drug such as interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;) or glatiramer acetate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have shown the efficacy of induction therapy with mitoxantrone on relapse rate, EDSS score, and MRI activity in patients with rapidly worsening MS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, mitoxantrone is regarded as the choice among cytotoxic agents.</p><p>Some other studies assessed the effect of combining a cytotoxic agent such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide with plasma exchange (PE).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] PE is a modality that is now applied as an adjunctive in the treatment of exacerbations in relapsing forms of MS (Level B) and also in the treatment of fulminant CNS demyelinating diseases that fail to respond to high-dose corticosteroids (Level C).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Investigations on this type of combination therapy had controversial results.

They were also matched on demographic and clinical characteristics. Both groups consisted of clinically definite MS patients (revised Mc Donald criteria 2005),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] aged between 18 and 55 years with EDSS score of 1&#x02013;5. All of them were defined to have aggressive MS containing the criteria of at least two relapses with sequel or an increase of at least two points in EDSS score during the last 12 months with the presence of at least one Gd-enhancing lesion on the patient&#x02019;s MRI performed within the last 3 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] None of them ever received mitoxantrone and had no contraindications for it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] They did not use corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressants in the past 3 months. All of the patients were under treatment with IFN-&#x003b2; before enrolling in our study. Five patients had received Avonex, 23 were on Rebif, and 12 were on Betaferon.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Baseline clinical and laboratory assessments and treatment protocol</title><p>At the first visit before treatment was started, an expert neurologist took a thorough history and performed physical examination on each patient. Past clinical attacks were confirmed and annual relapse rate (ARR) was determined for each one. Brain and spinal cord MRI with Gd was asked for every individual. Then, all patients were given intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (Pharmacia company, Diegem, Belgium) 1000 mg daily for 5 days. Females were instructed to use an effective contraceptive method.</p><p>After 30 days of corticosteroid therapy, all patients were reevaluated by the same neurologist and their EDSS scores were recorded. Lab examinations including complete blood cell count (CBC), liver function tests (LFT), besides electrocardiography (ECG), chest X-ray (CXR), and echocardiography were requested for each patient. Patients with abnormal test results were excluded.</p><p>We started monthly PE (plasma exchange machine: Haemonetics, model TCS2, USA) 25 ml/kg for 5 cycles, with replacement of 0.9% saline and 5% human serum albumin for the first group, followed by monthly IV infusion of 12 mg/m<sup>2</sup> mitoxantrone (EBEWE Pharma, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at the end of each PE course for three successive months. Then, we continued treatment by adding two more 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> doses of mitoxantrone in 3-month intervals. The second group received the same doses of mitoxantrone only without PE. Except MRI, all patients had to have CBC, LFT, and echocardiography reports prior to each dose of mitoxantrone to check for any probable abnormalities. Treatment with IFN-&#x003b2; was started for both groups after the last dose of mitoxantrone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Short-term and long-term follow-up</title><p>We planned to reevaluate the patients at two stages: first when induction therapy was completed (short-term follow-up) and then 9 months later (long-term follow-up).

A relapse was defined as new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs in the absence of fever, persisting for at least 24 h in a patient with a stable condition in the last month.</p><p>Secondary progression anytime during the study period led to exclusion of patient from the study and showed the need for a new treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>MRI protocol and analysis</title><p>Brain and spinal cord MRI was performed using a 1.5 T scanner at a single center including T1-weighted (with and without Gd) images, T2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and proton density sequences. Slices of 3-mm thickness were acquired for each sequence. Post-contrast T1-weighted imaging was performed 5 min after injection of 0.1 ml/kg Gd given over 30 sec.</p><p>All patients underwent brain and spinal cord MRI at two stages, along with follow-up clinical assessments. We decided to delay the follow-up MRI scan for 30 days if the patient experienced a relapse and was treated with corticosteroids to avoid the probable effect of steroids on MRI scan.</p><p>A neuroradiologist blinded to groups analyzed all MRI scans. Number of existing lesions in different anatomical locations and also active lesions (Gd-enhancing T1-weighted lesions) in post-treatment MRI (at the end of induction therapy) were compared with the baseline scan.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was evaluation of the changes in EDSS score, relapse rate, and also MRI images (number and location of plaques, number of Gd-enhancing lesions, and black holes) at the end of induction therapy.</p><p>The secondary outcome included assessment of changes in the EDSS score and ARR from baseline to the end of the study, and absolute changes in brain and spinal cord MRI (number and location of plaques, number of Gd-enhancing lesions, and black holes) from baseline to month 17.</p><p>In this paper, we only considered the therapeutic effects of combination therapy on the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed on a computer using SPSS ver. 18 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

Nine females experienced transient amenorrhea and one patient had moderately intractable nausea after mitoxantrone infusion. No clinically symptomatic cardiac event was found in any of our patients. Similarly, no PE-related complications such as symptomatic hypocalcemia, hypotension, infusion site complications, or hemolysis were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-5"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Therapeutic PE constitutes an extracorporeal blood purification technique designed to remove large molecular weight particles from plasma. The aim of the procedure is to deplete the blood of various immunological factors, such as circulating autoantibodies, immune complexes, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators, which may be associated with disease pathology. Clearly, this is a short-term solution since antibodies are made by B cells that will continue to synthesize pathogenic autoantibodies in response to repeated antigenic stimulation after the PE is completed. So, the transitory effects of PE require the combination of short-term active PE with long-term immunosuppression. Also, the sudden elimination of feedback inhibition of B cells due to sudden decline in autoantibody levels may synchronize their activity and make them particularly sensitive to a pulse of immunosuppression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>We designed this study based on the possible benefit of these immune mechanisms.</p><p>As shown in other studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] the therapeutic effect of mitoxantrone induction therapy on our patients&#x02019; clinical status was significantly evident. Patients&#x02019; EDSS and relapse rate decreased during the first 8 months of treatment in both groups. On MRI images, however, patients who underwent PE showed less favorable response to treatment compared to those who received mitoxantrone only.</p><p>There are some probable mechanisms responsible for this result. First of all, we should consider that PE may result in an increased antibody production after the procedure. The study of Goldammer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] on the influence of plasma immunoglobulin level on antibody synthesis demonstrated that in almost all patients (88%) who underwent PE, the total immunoglobulin G (IgG) level reached pre-treatment values within 24 h of the procedure and the level remained within normal range during further course. The responsible mechanism is proved to be changes of catabolism and immunoglobulin backflow instead of increased antibody re-synthesis. It is probable that significant number of our patients also experienced increased autoantibody level after PE by a different mechanism that mitoxantrone had no effectiveness on it. Mitoxantrone inhibits B-cell function and antibody secretion, but has no effect on the rate of antibody catabolism or rapid antibody redistribution from extravascular to intravascular space. So, in this way, PE could reduce the strict therapeutic effect of mitoxantrone on lowering antibody levels.</p><p>Another possible mechanism was explained by the investigation of Horng Yeh <italic>et al</italic>. In this study of 18 healthy volunteers, a single session of membrane PE activates the cellular immunity in terms of increased B cells and higher T-helper/T-suppressor ratios.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] This role of PE on immune system has a contrary effect on mitoxantrone function that exactly does the reverse.</p><p>All the studies on the effectiveness of PE in acute relapse of MS showed promising effects;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] however, studies on combination therapy of an immunosuppressant (cyclophosphamide) and PE had controversial results. The short-term beneficial effect of combination therapy with adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH), cyclophosphamide, and PE versus ACTH, cyclophosphamide, and sham exchange was reported by Weiner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Similar results were reported by Khatri <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial that investigated the efficacy of PE, methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide in comparison with methyl prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and sham treatment among patients with a progressive form of MS, which showed clinical benefit after 5 months in the PE group compared to the sham treatment group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In both these studies, PE was performed in longer intervals than in our survey. This protocol probably increases the amount of excluded antibody by PE as a result of enough time available to remove redistributed antibodies from extravascular space. The other prominent characteristic of these two studies was administration of cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone/ACTH during the PE treatment period, which perhaps prevented the accumulation of unfavorable effects of PE such as increased B-cell and T-helper numbers.</p><p>A larger trial from the Canadian Cooperative Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, which randomized patients with chronic progressive MS to receive daily intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone, daily oral cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone in alternate days and weekly PE, or placebo and sham PE, showed no improvement in the EDSS in 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The precise effect of PE cannot be determined in this study because of different administration protocol of cyclophosphamide and prednisone in the study arms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of PE either could not be revealed in Hauser <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s study which compared a short course of high-dose IV cyclophosphamide and ACTH (caused 80% disease stabilization) with ACTH alone (20% disease stabilization) and with low-dose cyclophosphamide with ACTH and PE (50% disease stabilization) because of the prominent effect of high-dose cyclophosphamide in comparison to its low dose in PE group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] None of these studies investigated the effect of combination therapy on MRI activity.</p><p>In conclusion, although PE is useful in the treatment of corticosteroid-unresponsive MS attacks based on the suggested role of humoral factors in the pathogenesis of MS, it seems that its benefit on aggressive form of MS needs special treatment protocol that at least includes longer intervals between PE courses to increase the efficacy and decrease the adverse effects of compacted exchanges on immune system and also co-administration of immunosuppressive drug during the PE courses to reduce the enhancing effect on B-cell and T-helpers. However, more trials are needed to determine the exact role of PE and the desired number or volume of exchanges to achieve the best therapeutic response. The long-term effect of PE on mitoxantrone induction therapy remains to be determined in our patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Edan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Clanet</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Confavreux</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lyon-Caen</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Lubetzki</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Therapeutic effect of mitoxantrone combined with methylprednisolone in multiple sclerosis: A randomized multicenter study of active disease using MRI and clinical criteria</article-title><source>J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry</source><year>1997</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>112</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9048709</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boggild</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immunosuppression followed by immunomodulation</article-title><source>J Neurol Sci</source><year>2009</year><volume>277</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>S50</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19200868</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Edan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Comi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lebrun</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brassat</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lubetzki</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Stankoff</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The French-Italian mitoxantrone-interferone-beta trial: A 3-year randomised study</article-title><source>Mult Scler</source><year>2007</year><volume>13</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>S22</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Le Page</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Filippi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Edan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><collab>French-Italian mitoxantrone-interferon-b trial group</collab><article-title>comparison of two therapeutic strategies in aggressive relapsing-remitting MS: Mitoxantrone as induction for 6 months followed by interferon-b 1b versus interferon-b 1b.
