For example, Web-based community campaigns commonly produce weight losses of only 1.2-1.8kg.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) We previously reported that adding an evidence-based Internet behavioral weight loss program to a community initiative significantly enhanced weight loss outcomes.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) Given the public health impact of wide-reaching community campaigns, it is important to identify additional novel strategies to further enhance weight loss without substantially increasing costs.</p><p id="P6">Financial incentives are being used by over 67% of large employers to motivate health behavior change and reduce healthcare costs.(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) While incentives have been shown to improve initial weight losses in previous trials, (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) these trials typically involve large amounts of money ($150-$400/person).(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) Moreover, once the incentive period is over, weight regain has been shown to be greater in programs with financial rewards. For example, two randomized trials comparing weight loss prescriptions with vs. without incentives showed that participants randomized to the incentive interventions experienced significantly greater weight regain during the no incentive follow-up period compared to those not receiving incentives.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) Similarly, studies have shown that higher financial motivation for weight loss is associated with significantly greater weight regain.(<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) Moreover, in contrast to traditional programs where weight loss is maintained for 6 months following the intensive treatment phase,(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) weight regain in incentive interventions occurs immediately upon incentive removal.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) Thus, a review of the financial incentive weight loss literature concluded that longer-term study of the effectiveness of such interventions is needed.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) Using behavioral economic principles, which suggest that better results might be obtained by providing <italic>frequent small</italic> incentives, <italic>varying</italic> the size of the incentive, and rewarding <italic>behavior</italic> change in addition to weight loss, we developed a novel incentive approach that might maintain the beneficial effects of incentives while minimizing the disadvantages of both cost and magnitude of weight regain.</p><p id="P7">Another strategy to increase weight losses in a community Internet program may be to add optional group sessions. Group sessions have been shown to improve weight losses, likely due to the support provided by intervention staff.(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) However, such programs are costly.(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) Thus, it is important to examine not only the efficacy of such an approach, but also the cost.</p><p id="P8">The primary aim of this study was to examine whether weight losses produced during a 12 week Internet behavioral program delivered in a community wellness initiative could be improved by adding either small financial incentives or optional group sessions.

The standard SURI program is team-based; 3 participants enroll with 5-11 team members and compete against other teams on weight loss and activity. Those who enrolled in SURI and were interested in weight loss were invited to participate in the research study. The first 676 who expressed interest were screened for the study. Exclusion criteria included age &#x0003c;18 or &#x0003e;70; BMI&#x02265;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>; current or planned pregnancy; uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., heart problem); previous study participation; unreliable Internet access; planned relocation; and non-English speaking. Those who reported a medical condition affected by weight loss obtained physician&#x02019;s consent to participate.

Approximately 50% of participants were the only participant within their team, but to avoid contamination, when multiple individuals were recruited from the same SURI team they were assigned as a single unit within the simple randomization procedure to ensure that all team members were randomized to the same study arm. The study statistician completed all randomization procedures. Participants were assessed at the end of the 3 month intervention and after an additional 9 months with no further intervention (i.e. 12 month follow-up). Procedures were approved by a local Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="S10"><title>SURI+Internet Behavioral Weight Loss (SI)</title><p id="P11">Participants in SI received the standard 3 month team-based SURI program plus an Internet behavioral weight loss program. As part of the SURI program, participants received access to a website where they submitted weekly weight and activity data, a pedometer, a paper log for recording weight and activity, newsletters and community resources on healthy eating and exercise, and recognition for meeting weight and exercise goals.</p><p id="P12">Given our prior findings that adding an Internet behavioral intervention improved weight losses in SURI,(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) all participants in SI also received an Internet behavioral intervention. Before SURI began, participants attended a one time, in-person group session where they received a weight loss goal (lose 1-2lbs/week), calorie and fat gram goals (&#x0003c;250lbs:1200-1500kcals/day, 30-40g fat/day; &#x02265;250lbs:1500-1800kcals/day, 40-50g fat/day), and physical activity goals (gradually increase to 250mins/week) and were taught how to self-monitor and how to use the behavioral weight loss website. The Internet behavioral program included weekly multimedia videos based on the Diabetes Prevention Program.(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) It also had a self-monitoring platform where participants submitted their daily weight, calorie, and activity information and received weekly, automated feedback on their progress. Participants received automated weekly reminders to report their self-monitoring information into the platform. <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental information</xref> on meal plans, prepackaged meals, and meal replacements was also on the website.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>SURI+Internet Behavioral Weight Loss+Incentives (SII)</title><p id="P13">SII participants received all components described above. In addition, they received incentives for adherence and weight loss.

To reinforce and engage participants at intervention outset, larger incentives were delivered at the beginning of the program (Week 1: $8, Week 2: $10) and incentive size varied thereafter ($1, $2, $7, etc.). If participants completed all reporting, they earned a maximum of $45 during the entire program. The SII website included a &#x0201c;bank&#x0201d; which displayed the participant&#x02019;s previous week&#x02019;s earnings and total earnings. Weekly reminders to submit information into the study website were framed using regret aversion language (&#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t miss out on your money, be sure to submit your information by Sunday at midnight&#x0201d;).(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) In addition to incentivizing self-monitoring, we incentivized achieving a clinically significant weight loss. Those who lost 5-10% of initial body weight were entered into a $50 raffle. Those who lost &#x02265;10% were entered into a $100 raffle. Ten winners were chosen from each raffle.

All planned secondary analyses were conducted at the P=.05 level. Baseline group differences were examined using analyses of variance (ANOVA) or chi-square tests. ANOVAs were used to examine adherence to the intervention, while post-hoc pairwise multiple group contrasts were conducted with a stepdown bootstrap procedure that controlled the overall Type I error rate for multiple group contrasts within each analysis at the P=.05 level of significance.(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) A longitudinal linear mixed model analysis(<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) examined whether intervention groups differed on weight loss at post-treatment (month 3) and at the 12 month no treatment follow-up assessment.

Missing data were handled under the assumption of missing at random.(<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) Group differences in weight regain from month 3 (post-treatment) to the 12 month follow-up were examined using an ANCOVA, with month 3 weight loss as a covariate and the stepdown bootstrap procedure for group contrasts of the adjusted means. Group differences in &#x02265;5% weight loss were examined using logistic regression; participants with missing values were assumed to have not achieved a &#x02265;5% weight loss. Consistent with recent work in the field,(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) cost-effectiveness analyses were done as a within-trial analysis from the payer, participant, and societal perspectives and included participants with both cost and weight data. Group staff and rent costs were allocated to participants who attended sessions; other costs were allocated evenly to all participants in the group. Per capita costs from the payer, participant, and societal perspectives were determined.

We found that only small financial incentives significantly improved initial weight losses and increased the proportion of participants achieving a &#x02265;5% weight loss during the treatment period relative to SI. Although the primary aim focused on initial (3 month) outcomes, we were also interested in the longer-term effects in the absence of any further intervention. We found that participants in SIG had significantly less weight regain than the other two groups during the no treatment follow-up period and consequently, overall weight losses in SII and SIG were significantly greater than SI at month 12. Moreover, the proportion who maintained a 5% weight loss was greater in SIG compared to SI at 12 months.</p><p id="P28">The effective incentive program tested herein differed in several ways from those used in prior studies: the amount of money was smaller and varied week to week, the incentives were added to an Internet intervention as opposed to an in-person intervention, and adherence to self-monitoring behaviors was reinforced in addition to weight loss. Our results suggest that there are benefits to our approach. For example, an earlier trial added financial rewards of $100/person/month to a 6-month Web program and yielded a 1.8% weight loss;(<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) in contrast, we used substantially smaller incentives and a shorter program and were able to achieve superior weight losses (6.4%). Moreover, our approach of providing small incentives for adherence to self-monitoring increased this behavior which, as shown in prior studies,(<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) promoted better weight loss outcomes. Thus, using small, variable rewards to incentivize core intervention behaviors may have a downstream effect on overall treatment outcomes. Finally, even though we only incentivized submission of self-monitoring data, participants in the incentive arm also viewed more intervention videos, suggesting a spillover effect. Given that Internet programs commonly suffer from suboptimal engagement,(<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) these data suggest that small incentives, delivered in accordance with principles from behavioral economics, are an effective method to improve engagement and therefore treatment outcomes in Internet delivered interventions for obesity, or other health conditions.</p><p id="P29">A major concern often raised about the use of financial incentives is that when they are removed, participants regain weight at a greater rate than programs without financial rewards.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) However, in our study, weight regain in the incentive condition did not differ from the Internet alone condition, which did not involve financial rewards. Our use of small incentives may have reduced the magnitude of weight regain relative to earlier studies by facilitating participants&#x02019; attribution of weight loss to personal efforts rather than large extrinsic rewards. Also, given that self-monitoring is a behavior strongly associated with weight loss maintenance,(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) by incentivizing reporting and, therefore, self-monitoring, we may have facilitated habit development for monitoring, which contributed to better longer-term weight control in this incentive trial relative to other incentive trials for weight loss.</p><p id="P30">Contrary to our hypothesis, adding optional group sessions to the Internet initiative did not significantly improve initial (3 month) weight loss outcomes relative to the control condition. In order to appeal to the SURI audience (i.e. individuals enrolling in a low-intensity community campaign) group sessions were optional. Consequently, participants attended less than half of the available meetings. Thus, even though group attendance was associated with greater initial weight loss, given low attendance, the impact of group meetings on weight outcomes was likely attenuated.</p><p id="P31">While only SII was superior to SI at the end of the 3 month treatment phase, at month 12, <italic>both</italic> SII and SIG had greater overall weight losses compared to SI. The difference between the 3 and 12 month results was related to greater weight regain in the incentive and control conditions, relative to the optional group condition. We considered the possibility that topics covered in optional groups promoted additional skill development that facilitated weight maintenance. However, there was no evidence that attendance at group sessions had an effect on weight regain or 5% weight loss (P&#x02019;s&#x02265;.36). Thus, it is unclear why participants in this arm experienced less regain following treatment relative to the other arms. It is also is important to note that group sessions significantly increased the costs of the program. Even with sensitivity analyses that reduced the transportation costs and participant time associated with attending groups, the group approach was less cost-effective than incentives at both 3 and 12 months.</p><p id="P32">Given the large number of individuals who enroll in community programs such as Shape Up RI, using small financial incentives within a community campaign may represent a way to successfully produce clinically significant weight losses in large numbers of individuals at very modest costs and, therefore, help to prevent the development of obesity related diseases. Our findings may also be relevant for popular corporate wellness programs. Many companies are using <italic>large</italic> rewards (over $300/employee) to promote weight loss.(<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) Our results suggest that coupling <italic>small</italic> incentives with an <italic>evidence-based incentive structure</italic> may yield excellent outcomes and decrease program costs. If implemented within this context, additional cost analyses would be necessary to more accurately determine the cost-effectiveness of this approach from the perspective of the corporation (e.g., productivity, presenteeism, etc.).(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</p><p id="P33">Limitations of this study include a predominantly female and White sample. In addition, treatment stopped at the end of the 12 week community program. As seen in almost all prior weight loss trials, the weight losses were greatest at the end of the 12 week intervention, with gradual weight regain over the no treatment follow-up period. Ongoing intervention has been shown to be critical for preventing weight regain and optimizing long-term outcomes.(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) Therefore future studies should consider the impact of lengthening the intervention beyond three months.(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) Specifically, it would be important to determine whether extending the use of small incentives throughout the 12 month follow-up would reduce the magnitude of weight regain and improve overall weight loss outcomes.</p><p id="P34">Strengths of the study include its randomized design, use of novel approaches to enhance weight losses within an Internet community initiative, objective assessments of primary outcomes and adherence metrics, and large sample size relative to other financial incentive weight loss trials.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) This trial also included an examination of the cost-effectiveness of different approaches to enhance weight losses within a community campaign; such data are crucial to key stakeholders when deciding whether to implement a large-scale intervention. Moreover, this trial involved a follow-up, which allowed for the examination of the effects of each intervention on weight regain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S25"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><media xlink:href="NIHMS632165-supplement-supplement_1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e540" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><p>Role of the funding source: This study was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
