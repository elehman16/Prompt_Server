<bold>Objective</bold>: To assess morning stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients switched from immediate-release (IR) to delayed-release (DR) prednisone.</p><p>
<bold>Method</bold>: Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis-1 (CAPRA-1) is a 12-week, randomized, multicentre, active-controlled study of morning stiffness that consisted of a double-blind phase and a 9-month open-label extension. Patients receiving IR prednisone with no significant improvement after the double-blind study were switched to DR prednisone. Morning stiffness duration and median absolute and relative changes in pain and global assessment were evaluated (3, 6, and 9&#x000a0;months).</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: In patients switched from IR to DR prednisone (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;110), statistically significant reductions in morning stiffness occurred over 3&#x000a0;months and were sustained for 9&#x000a0;months. Absolute reduction of morning stiffness was ~50&#x000a0;min with &#x0003e; 40% relative reduction at each visit. Interleukin (IL)-6 levels were reduced by the same amount. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reductions in morning stiffness were maintained at &#x0003e; 67&#x000a0;min at each visit along with significant improvements in pain and patient global assessment. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis seen over the 9-month study.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>: Patients receiving disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and IR prednisone who had not had significant reductions in morning stiffness demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements when switched to DR prednisone.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Horizon Pharma, Inc.</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><ref-count count="11"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>There is circadian variation in the signs and symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the physical impact of the disease typically peaking, along with inflammatory cytokines, during early morning hours (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Cytokine levels, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, correlate with morning disease activity and often decrease with treatment (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Considering the early morning rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent morning stiffness, timed delivery of glucocorticoids (GCs) can maximize effectiveness (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although delivery of GCs at the optimal delivery time (02:00&#x000a0;h) can be accomplished with conventional-release GCs, it requires the patient to awaken and may be inconvenient (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A delayed-release (DR) prednisone tablet enables timed delivery of prednisone to target the circadian pattern of inflammatory mediators when taken just before bedtime (around 22:00 h).</p><p>Results from the double-blind Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis-1 (CAPRA-1) study in patients with moderately to severely active RA on stable disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy showed that DR prednisone given at night reduced the duration of morning stiffness compared with immediate-release (IR) prednisone given in the morning (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this new analysis was to assess morning stiffness during the 9-month open-label extension phase of the CAPRA-1 study in patients who had responded inadequately to IR prednisone and who were switched to DR prednisone.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Method</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>Patients from the double-blind portion of CAPRA-1 previously randomized to IR prednisone were switched to DR prednisone.

A GC formulation that releases prednisone when the inflammatory processes are the highest may be an appropriate treatment strategy to alleviate increased stiffness and pain in the waking hours (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy and safety of DR prednisone, when added to DMARD therapy, has been established in double-blind, randomized trials, both in those previously receiving prednisone (CAPRA-1) and in those not previously receiving prednisone (CAPRA-2) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In this analysis, statistically significant reductions in absolute and relative changes in morning stiffness occurred within 3&#x000a0;months after patients who had not responded to IR prednisone were switched to DR prednisone. The responses were similar to those patients continuing on DR prednisone from the double-blind phase of the study and reductions were maintained throughout the 9-month open-label extension phase. Furthermore, patients previously treated with DR prednisone who continued on DR prednisone maintained the efficacy demonstrated in the double-blind phase, indicating no tachyphylaxis. Following prior therapy with IR prednisone, patient-reported pain and global assessment improved after switching to DR prednisone. Both pain VAS and PGA-VAS were significantly different at 3&#x000a0;months; and at 9&#x000a0;months there was a relative reduction of approximately 16.0% in pain (p<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.1318). Given that patients were previously treated for more than 3&#x000a0;months with IR prednisone therapy and had been on stable doses of GCs coming into the CAPRA-1 trial, it would not be entirely unexpected that VAS-measured pain would not differ dramatically. This finding may reinforce patients&#x02019; assessment of the hierarchical importance and differentiation of pain vs. morning stiffness (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The baseline pain was almost identical in both groups, and both groups experienced statistically significant decreases in absolute pain VAS from the beginning of the open-label evaluation to the end of the analysis 9&#x000a0;months later (p<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.006). After 9&#x000a0;months of treatment with DR prednisone, there was a greater than 50% reduction in levels of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in patients with uncontrolled RA and is associated with morning symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Patients who switched from IR to DR prednisone in the open-label phase achieved and maintained reductions in morning stiffness that were comparable to those of patients who received DR prednisone continuously. These reductions were statistically and clinically significant (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This indicates that patients still experiencing morning stiffness while receiving IR prednisone may benefit from switching to DR prednisone. Data from a recently published 4-month open-label, observational study similarly suggest that switching patients from IR prednisone or 6-methyl-prednisone to DR prednisone can markedly decrease the duration of morning stiffness (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Patients who switched to DR prednisone showed improvements in duration of morning stiffness, numerical rating scale pain scores, and global assessment scores (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>This novel analysis has some strengths and weakness; it mirrors the real-world clinical scenario where patients often switch from ineffective therapies over time and offers insights for everyday clinical practice situations in which physicians are considering alternatives for their patients who have not responded adequately to conventional GC formulations. Only patients who had at least one diary measurement in the open-label extension phase were included in this analysis and thus represent an analysis of completers, which may bias the results.</p><p>DR prednisone was effective in reducing the duration of morning stiffness in patients previously treated with IR prednisone, and the results were maintained for 9&#x000a0;months. Considering the emotional and physical burden experienced by patients with RA, bedtime treatment with DR prednisone may offer patients a convenient way to benefit from early morning administration of GCs, as suggested by initial improvements in morning stiffness, pain, and global assessment following the switch from an ineffective 3-month course of IR prednisone, administered traditionally upon awakening.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Amanda McGeary Tollen of JK Medical Communications, Inc, Conshohocken, PA, USA, for medical writing support; this editorial support and the study were funded by Horizon Pharma, Inc, USA.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal">
