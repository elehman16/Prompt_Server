Simulator training programs are widely implemented into surgical, urological and gynecological resident curricula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some of the challenges that MIS poses to surgeons and surgeons in training are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>loss of depth perception and special orientation due to two-dimensional (2D) vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>],</p></list-item><list-item><p>perceived inversion of movement from the handle to the working end of the instrument &#x0201c;the fulcrum effect of the abdominal wall&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>],</p></list-item><list-item><p>loss of haptic feedback due to resistance inside the trocars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the use of long laparoscopic instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>],</p></list-item><list-item><p>limited motion freedom and degrees of freedom (DOFs) due to the use of long rigid instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>It is known that expert MIS surgeons learn to adjust to and compensate for these challenges. But when novices first start training of their basic MIS skills, they have to adjust to all these challenges at the same time making acquiring these skills a notoriously difficult task. Lack of training due to lack of time and motivation is a known problem, even though it is generally agreed among residents that simulation training of MIS skills is essential and should be obligatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Allowing novices to gradually adjust to the challenges MIS poses, by letting them train under direct vision before they switch to indirect vision, could be of benefit both in time consumption and in motivation. In theory, the main benefit would be that they do not have to compensate for the lack of depth perception and special orientation at the same time as learning how to manipulate the long rigid instruments and adjusting to the fulcrum effect. Compensating for a lack of depth perception requires the novice to use a variety of 2D cues such as light and shade, relative size of organs, organ interposition, texture gradient, aerial perception and motion parallax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Because the effect is speculated to be more extensive in complex tasks compared to simple tasks, we chose to examine the effect of direct vision on the learning curve of the laparoscopic suture task. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of training under direct vision prior to training with indirect vision on the learning curve of the laparoscopic suture task. To this extend, we examine the consumed training time, the economy of movements, tissue handling skills and the novice&#x02019;s opinion during the training.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study population</title><p>Novices (i.e., first- and second-year medical students in the preclinical phase of their studies) were recruited by means of advertisement on bulletin boards in the Medical Faculty of Leiden and in the Medical Library of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). They participated on a voluntary basis. Students with prior laparoscopic or simulator experience as well as students with prior experience in suturing more than once were excluded. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], statistical differences between force parameter outcomes were already detected with a sample size of six after training laparoscopic suturing with versus without visual feedback. Since the visual impact on the study groups in the current study was expected to be somewhat comparable, the aim was to recruit minimally six novices per group.</p><p>After enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire providing demographic information (i.e., gender, hand dominancy, prior suturing experience, experience in computer gaming and self-perceived dexterity on a seven-point Likert scale). Novices were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group using the Web site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>. In both groups, novices performed one intracorporeal suture task six consecutive times (see detailed description below). The intervention group first performed the training task three times under direct vision in the interventional setup (trial one till three). Following these three interventional trials, the novices in the intervention group performed the training task three times in the control setup (trial four till six). The control group performed the training task six times in the control setup (trial one till six).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Training setup</title><p>The laparoscopic box trainer was equipped with a TrEndo tracking system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for motion analysis and force measurement platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for analysis of interaction forces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants used two laparoscopic needle drivers (Ethicon, E705R), one in each hand. Since none of the subjects had previous experience with needle drivers, each subject had the opportunity to manipulate the buttons and handle for 5&#x000a0;min outside the training box before the first training task. Both the intervention group and the control group performed their training task in the same training setup with the mere difference that the intervention group could look through the transparent cover of the box during the intervention. By consequence, the effect of training with direct vision prior to training under regular conditions can be investigated.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Physical box trainer (LUMC, Leiden). <bold>A</bold> Experimental (open) setup with transparent top so that the novices could look at the task under direct (3D) vision. <bold>B</bold> Standard (closed) setup: the transparent top was covered with a non-transparent plate and the image of a 0&#x000b0; scope was presented on a monitor in a fixed position (2D vision)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="464_2015_4211_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Task</title><p>Prior to training the task, a demonstration video was shown. Then, a step-by-step graphical explanation of the knot tying technique is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Next, the video was demonstrated again while instructions were given about specific requirements (entry and exit point of the needle, when to use a double and single loop, etc.). The training task consisted of the placement of a simple suture followed by tying an intracorporeal knot in a standardized way. The exercise started with the needle (Vicryl 3-0 SH plus 26&#x000a0;mm, Ethicon, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) prepositioned in the needle driver and both needle drivers on a pre-marked place (start position). A proper bite (8&#x000a0;mm) has to be taken of the suturing pad in a pre-marked area. After pulling the needle and a substantial part of the thread through, a 3-throw knot was tied. This was done by making a double forward loop, followed by a single reverse loop and finally a single forward loop. During the training, the examiner coached a participant, if necessary, to perform the task correctly and to ensure that every suture was performed in the standardized manner. One examiner coached all participants throughout the entire trial.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Step-by-step overview of the suture task performed in each trial.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] indicated that the steepest part of the suturing learning curve can be found within the first three trials.

Novices that train in the open box spent 27&#x000a0;% less time training, while they achieve similar proficiency after six trials and subjectively report less frustration. This could affect novices&#x02019; motivation for training MIS skills. In standard laparoscopic trainings setups, novices have to adjust to all challenges MIS poses at once. By allowing them to start their training under direct vision instead of with 2D vision, they do not have to compensate for the lack of depth perception and special orientation at the same time as learning how to manipulate the long rigid instruments and adjusting to the fulcrum effect. As mentioned before, compensating for a lack of depth perception requires specific additional skills from the novice such as the using a variety of 2D cues such as light and shade, relative size of organs, organ interposition, texture gradient, aerial perception and motion parallax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>It is generally known that motivation for laparoscopic training is inversely related to laparoscopic experience. The motivation to learn can be intrinsic (from the trainee) and extrinsic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The latter are exams, assessments, promotion, financial profits, prolonging registration, etc. These factors can be influenced by staff and program directors (e.g., by providing compulsory training time during working hours, inter-individual competitions and feedback). Several studies have focussed mainly on extrinsic motivational factors, for example, van Empel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has given trainees complete box trainers to make training at home available. Unfortunately, the average time trained at home (298.5 min; SD 383.1&#x000a0;min) was significantly lower than the self-reported desired training time (1687.6&#x000a0;min; SD 1225.9&#x000a0;min). Verdaasdonk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that the competition element stimulated with a price was useful to attract mainly experienced trainees. These studies might suggest a significant role for intrinsic motivational factors. Intrinsic factors are motivators of such improvement of personal achievement (improvement of skills and knowledge), be prepared for new situations, security, but also fun and competition. These factors vary per person and are difficult to alter. The fact that novices in the group 2 (standard set up) rate their self-perceived dexterity after the training significantly lower than before the training together with the higher reported level of frustration in this group might suggest that the training in group 2 could decrease intrinsic motivation compared to the training in group 1 (training with direct vision first).</p><p>The importance of simulation training of MIS skills is stressed by residents themselves, and in surveys, they agree that simulation training is essential and should be obligatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, voluntary simulation training remains a challenge. Besides a lack of motivation, a lack of time is the most common reported reason for not training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study shows that a considerate amount of time (27&#x000a0;%) can be spared by training under direct vision. A study by Hodgson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in which they examine the influence of various DOFs of laparoscopic instruments, has also shown that performing tasks under direct vision saves time (22&#x000a0;%). This time-saving effect was even larger (33&#x000a0;%) when in addition to direct vision extra DOFs were added.</p><p>When the optimal time is to switch from the experimental setup (direct vision) to the standard setup, indirect vision remains unclear. It can be speculated that most benefit will be gained when a trainee trains under direct vision until they master the skills to adjust to the fulcrum effect, the loss of haptic feedback and to the limited motion freedom and degrees of freedom (DOFs). Since trainees in this study switched to the standard setup after the third trial, we cannot answer this question.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. Therefore, we calculated the sample size needed to demonstrate a difference between the two groups for the different parameters (force as well as motion related) during the needle driving phase (phase 1) as well as the knot tying phase (phase 2) with a power of 80&#x000a0;% and a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 to demonstrate significance. The sample size needed varies between <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;261 (for phase 2; left path length) and <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.409.518 (for phase 1; right volume) The very large sample size needed for each parameter suggests that we would not find any differences, even if we would have extended our trial.</p><p>A limitation of the scoring system for suture quality is a lack of blindness of the scorer, which can result in bias. It was attempted to minimize bias due to lack of blinding by predefining the scoring system precisely. When it comes to the force and motion measurements, blinding is not an issue, as these measurements are objective and therefore not subjected to bias.</p><p>Several studies have shown advantages of 3D camera visualization over 2D visualization, mainly in saving time and surgeons&#x02019; preference, while others (using older visualization techniques) have reported equivalency in task performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This new technique is still relatively expensive, especially for training purposes. Providing physical box trainers with a transparent top is a cheap adjustment, and because it makes a camera and monitor system unnecessary, it should be possible to provide every starting trainee with their own training setup.</p><p>In conclusion, novices benefit from starting their training of difficult basic laparoscopic skills, such as suturing, in a transparent box trainer under direct vision. It takes them less time, and they get less frustrated by the training with the same end result on their economy of movements and tissue handling skills. Furthermore, it is a cheap adjustment to the standard box trainer setup, making it possible to provide trainees with their own training setup for the start of their basic laparoscopic skills training.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all students that participated in this study and Gertjan Hultzer en Ren&#x000e9; Rodenburg from the skillslab of the Leiden University Medical Center for providing all necessary facilities to perform this study.</p><sec id="d30e984"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Sharon P.
