Combination treatment was considered bioequivalent to single treatment if 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) for geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of analytes fell within the interval 0.80&#x02013;1.25 based on maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), pulse rate and blood pressure (BP), clinical laboratory assessments, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among 80 enrolled subjects, 77 were included in pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. Combination LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR was bioequivalent to LDX alone, based on exposure to <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine (GMR [95&#x000a0;% CI], C<sub>max</sub> (ng/mL): 0.97 [0.82, 1.14], AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>: 0.95 [0.81, 1.12]). Exposure to VEN with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR (vs. VXR alone) was increased (C<sub>max</sub>: 1.10 [0.88, 1.38], AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>: 1.13 [0.88, 1.45]) and ODV decreased (C<sub>max</sub>: 0.91 [0.77, 1.06], AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>: 0.83 [0.71, 0.96]), whereas composite VEN&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ODV was bioequivalent to VXR alone (C<sub>max</sub>: 0.96 [0.84, 1.09], AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>: 0.98 [0.85, 1.13]). TEAEs with LDX or LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR were similar. Maximum mean increases from baseline were: pulse rate, +8.73 to 12.76 beats/min with either treatment alone and +17.67 to 20.85 beats/min with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR; systolic BP, +4.32 to 6.56&#x000a0;mmHg with either treatment alone and +12.96 to 13.78&#x000a0;mmHg with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR; diastolic BP, +5.39 to 5.74&#x000a0;mmHg with either treatment alone and +12.09 to 12.46&#x000a0;mmHg with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR. One participant was withdrawn due to a serious TEAE (presyncope). No unexpected, clinically meaningful trends or changes from baseline in mean laboratory or ECG parameters were observed during the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In healthy adults, combination LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR (vs. LDX alone) did not alter exposure to <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine.

After oral administration, active <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine is released via enzyme-mediated biotransformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The investigation of LDX in clinical trials for major depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] indicated a need for additional information about pharmacokinetics and safety, including the potential for drug-drug interactions.</p><p>LDX does not inhibit any cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme tested to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but its active component, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, weakly inhibits CYP2D6 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In vitro studies suggest that exposure to amphetamine or its metabolites, as would follow LDX administration, might inhibit the CYP enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], raising the possibility of drug-drug interactions. The CYP family of isoenzymes is also primarily responsible for the metabolism of several key medications used to treat patients with indications of interest in the LDX research programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Coadministration of LDX with compounds for which these CYP enzymes play a metabolic role could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of one or both drugs, marked by prolonged clearance, increased maximum plasma concentrations, and increased overall exposure.</p><p>Venlafaxine extended-release (VXR), a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is indicated for treatment of major depressive disorder, as well as generalized and social anxiety disorders and panic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Venlafaxine (VEN), the active component of VXR, is metabolized to active <italic>O</italic>-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) by CYP2D6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], making it a useful substrate by which to test for potential interaction of LDX with the CYP2D6 system. Coadministration of VXR with LDX may lead to changes in VEN metabolism, potentially marked by increased exposure to VEN. Moreover, in adults, VEN exerts well-characterized effects on cardiovascular functioning, marked by modest mean increases in blood pressure and heart rate. In a small number of individual patients (i.e., 0.7&#x02013;1.3&#x000a0;%), larger sustained increases in blood pressure have led to treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mean increases in blood pressure and heart rate have also been observed in adults following administration of clinically optimized doses of LDX and other <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine- or methylphenidate-containing medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], raising the possibility that combination LDX/VXR treatment may potentiate these cardiovascular effects. It is, therefore, of particular interest to carefully examine vital sign parameters during coadministration of these drugs.</p><p>The primary objective of the present investigation in healthy adults was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug LDX and LDX-derived <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine and VEN and its active metabolite, ODV, when LDX and VXR were administered alone and in combination. A secondary objective was to examine the safety of combination LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR treatment, including pulse rate and blood pressure parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study of LDX was an open-label, two-arm, single-sequence crossover investigation with randomization to treatment sequence investigation in healthy adults, consisting of a screening period, a 38-day treatment period, and safety telephone follow-up. There were two treatment arms: A (initial titration with LDX over 15&#x000a0;days followed by the addition of VXR, titrated over an additional 15&#x000a0;days) and B (initial titration with VXR over 15&#x000a0;days followed by the addition of LDX, titrated over an additional 15&#x000a0;days). During pre-dose baseline assessments, participant blood samples were obtained for CYP2D6 genotyping. To minimize the potential for adverse effects during initiation of treatment with either LDX (e.g., dizziness, palpitations) or VXR (e.g., nausea, vomiting), doses were gradually titrated upward at 5-day intervals to maximal doses of LDX 70&#x000a0;mg/day and VXR 225&#x000a0;mg/day; at the end of the study, VXR doses were also gradually decreased over a 1-week period.

For pharmacokinetic analysis, serial blood samples were collected up to 24&#x000a0;h after dose administration on days 1, 15 and 30; on these study days, samples were obtained pre-dose (at &#x02212;0.5&#x000a0;h) and at the following times post-dose: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and at 0/24&#x000a0;h on days 2, 16, and 31. On days 14 and 29, a single blood sample was obtained at 0.5&#x000a0;h pre-dose. Plasma concentrations of LDX, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, VEN and ODV were measured using validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. Samples from days on which participants were dosed with LDX alone were analysed for LDX and <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine only; samples from days on which participants were dosed with VXR alone were analysed for VEN and ODV only; and samples from days on which participants were dosed with both LDX and VXR were analysed for LDX, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, VEN and ODV. Briefly, LDX, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, VEN and ODV concentrations in human plasma were determined using a LC-MS/MS method validated over the range of 1&#x02013;100&#x000a0;ng/mL for LDX and 2&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ng/mL for <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine; over the range of 0.5&#x02013;250&#x000a0;ng/mL for VEN and 1&#x02013;500&#x000a0;ng/mL for ODV all based on 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of human plasma. Human plasma containing LDX, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, VEN and ODV, and internal standards, D8-LDX, D5-amphetamine or D6-VEN and D6-ODV, was extracted with ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1) in the presence of saturated sodium chloride/sodium hydroxide for LDX/<italic>d</italic>-amphetamine and with ethyl acetate in sodium phosphate buffer for VEN/ODV. Following centrifugation, the organic layer was transferred and evaporated. After the addition of formic acid for LDX/<italic>d</italic>-amphetamine and ethyl acetate for VEN/ODV and reconstitution in mobile phase, an aliquot was injected onto a AB SCIEX API&#x02122; 4000 LC-MS/MS (Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a high-performance liquid chromatography column. The peak area of the m/z 264&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;84 LDX product ion was measured against the peak area of the m/z 272&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;92 D8-LDX internal standard product ion. The peak area of the m/z 136&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;91 amphetamine product ion was measured against the peak area of the m/z 141&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;96 D5-amphetamine internal standard product ion. The peak area of the m/z 278&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;58 VEN product ion was measured against the peak area of the m/z 284&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;58 D6-VEN internal standard product ion. The peak area of the m/z 264&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;58 ODV product ion was measured against the peak area of the m/z 270&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;58 D6-ODV internal standard product ion. Peak area integrations were performed using Analyst software (version 1.4.2) from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Concentrations were calculated using 8-point curves ranging from 1 to 100&#x000a0;ng/mL for LDX and 2 to 200&#x000a0;ng/mL for <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine with separate weighted linear regression; ranging from 0.5 to 250&#x000a0;ng/mL for VEN and 1 to 500&#x000a0;ng/mL for ODV with separate weighted linear regression. Based on a sample volume of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, the method had a lower limit of quantification of 1&#x000a0;ng/mL for LDX and 2&#x000a0;ng/mL for <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine; 0.5&#x000a0;ng/mL for VEN and 1&#x000a0;ng/mL for ODV.

For this study, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of LDX given alone and in combination with the antidepressant VXR were described in healthy adults. Combination LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR did not alter exposure to <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine (vs. LDX alone). Although small changes in exposure to VEN (increased) and ODV (decreased) were seen, total VEN&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ODV exposure showed no change with combination treatment (vs. VXR alone) as demonstrated by bioequivalence testing. Changes from baseline in pulse rate and blood pressure were greater in magnitude during coadministration compared with either drug being administered alone. The TEAE profile with coadministration was similar to that when LDX was given alone.</p><p>LDX does not inhibit any CYP isoenzymes tested to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but its active component, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine, weakly inhibits CYP2D6 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CYP2D6 is the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of various antidepressant and second-generation antipsychotic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because VEN is primarily metabolized to active ODV via <italic>O</italic>-demethylation that is dependent on CYP2D6 isoenzyme activity (to a lesser degree, it is metabolized via CYP3A4-dependent <italic>N</italic>-demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), VXR was chosen as a representative compound to test potential for interaction with LDX. The current pharmacokinetic findings confirm that <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. With LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR coadministration, slight but statistically significant increases in VEN exposure and slight decreases in ODV exposure were observed. The clinical impact of such changes is likely not significant. Both VEN and ODV are pharmacologically active, with similar neurotransmitter receptor affinity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR coadministration, exposure to the two active compounds (VEN&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ODV) taken together was unchanged. Given these facts, the observed small changes in VEN and ODV pharmacokinetics are not expected to alter VXR-mediated clinical outcomes.</p><p>As expected, the single poor CYP2D6 metabolizer who completed the study exhibited higher levels of VEN and lower levels of ODV than were seen in the other participants who were extensive or intermediate metabolizers; total VEN&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ODV exposure, however, was similar to the overall group mean. This finding highlights the potential clinical importance of <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition for individuals receiving LDX in combination with other medications. The small pharmacokinetic changes currently observed with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR coadministration do not rule out the possibility of clinically significant pharmacokinetic alterations when LDX is administered in combination with other compounds. Further research may be required to determine the potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions between LDX and other widely prescribed compounds that are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or which also inhibit CYP2D6 enzyme activity.</p><p>Safety observations with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR coadministration were in line with expectations. The most common TEAEs reported with combination treatment were generally similar to those seen with LDX alone. As expected, common TEAEs with VXR alone included anorexia, dry mouth, nausea, somnolence and headache; with LDX alone, these included dry mouth, anorexia and palpitations. Also as expected, with either LDX alone or VXR alone, small mean increases in pulse rate and blood pressure occurred, and these increases were greater in magnitude when LDX and VXR were coadministered. As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a&#x02013;c, these increases tended to emerge gradually over several days; no participant was discontinued due to an increase in pulse rate or blood pressure.</p><p>The present investigation had several limitations that warrant consideration. The sample comprised primarily healthy adult white men; thus, findings might not be generalizable to younger or older individuals, adults with medical or psychiatric co-morbidities, those of other racial or ethnic backgrounds, or women. LDX and VXR were coadministered at their maximum approved therapeutic doses (LDX 70&#x000a0;mg/day and VXR 225&#x000a0;mg/day); changes in VEN and ODV pharmacokinetics were not characterized using different (i.e., lower or higher) LDX and VXR doses. This study examined pharmacokinetics and safety during short-term coadministration of LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR; pharmacokinetics and safety with longer-term combination treatment are unknown. Comparison of data on vital signs to data gathered from previous outpatient clinical trials (summarized in the respective product information of LDX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and VXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) should consider limitations due to several factors: (i) participants were housed for a relatively long time period in a CSC where normal routines of diet, activity and exercise were disrupted; (ii) LDX and VXR were tested in combination only at the highest recommended doses; and (iii) monitoring of vital signs in outpatient clinical trials occurs at various times of the day, whereas in the current trial vital signs were recorded according to a well-defined schedule, relative to time of dosing and time course of plasma drug levels. Despite these limitations, the current study provides useful information to help clinicians develop appropriate procedures for dosing and safety monitoring when LDX is coadministered with VXR in a diverse adult population. As with each agent alone, monitoring of vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure) is recommended should LDX and VXR be coadministered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In healthy adults, combination LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR (vs. LDX alone) did not alter exposure to <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine. Although small changes in exposure to VEN (increased) and ODV (decreased) were seen with combination treatment, supporting evidence that <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, total VXR +&#x000a0;ODV exposure showed no change (vs. VEN alone). Increases in pulse rate and blood pressure observed when LDX and VEN were administered alone were consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Changes from baseline in vital signs were greater in magnitude during coadministration compared with when either LDX or VEN was administered alone. The TEAE profile with LDX&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VXR coadministration was similar to that seen with LDX alone. This study provides useful information to help clinicians develop appropriate procedures for dosing and safety monitoring when LDX is used as combination therapy with VXR in an adult population. As with each agent alone, monitoring of vital signs (e.g., pulse rate, blood pressure) is recommended with combination therapy of LDX and VXR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>M. B.
