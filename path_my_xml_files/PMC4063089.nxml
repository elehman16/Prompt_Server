Propofol may improve intubation conditions in a dose-dependent manner.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Kwon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that the administration of additional dose of propofol (0.5 mg/kg) prior to intubation may improve intubation conditions significantly without affecting hemodynamic variables. Above study described the effects of only one additional dose of propofol on intubation conditions and that was, as a bolus. Therefore, we designed this study to compare three different additional doses of propofol infusion on intubation conditions and hemodynamic changes before and after laryngoscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval and written informed consents, 140 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), physical status I, II and patients aged 18-60 years, scheduled for elective surgery, were enrolled in a prospective randomized double-blind study. Other inclusion criteria included patients with normal airway and body mass index less than 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and more than 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included sensitivity to propofol and anesthesia with techniques, different from the protocol of this study.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated by using random allocation software into one of four groups as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>The randomized process and the identity of the study drugs were blinded from the patients, the participating Anesthesiologist during surgery and the investigators who collected the post-operative data.</p><p>In all groups, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg was administered intravenously prior to induction. After the loss of consciousness was confirmed, atracurium 0.6 mg/kg was administered within 10 s. In each group, additional dose of propofol was infused within 90 s by infusion pump. Laryngoscopy was performed 2 min after atracurium administration.</p><p>Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were examined and recorded at pre-induction, immediately prior to laryngoscopy, 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after laryngoscopy. If MAP was less than 60 mmHg, 5 mg ephedrine was given. If HR was less than 50 bpm, 0.5 mg atropine was administered. For blinding purposes, person who was responsible for administration of induction drugs, was varied from whom collected data. Side-effects included, hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;60 mmHg), bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 bmp), tachycardia (HR &#x0003e;100 bpm), laryngospasm, bronchospasm and cyanosis were examined and recorded. If intubation conditions were unacceptable (poor or impossible), atracurium 0.2 mg/kg was administered and then endotracheal intubation was performed. Intubation conditions were examined and categorized by Magorian <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] scoring system as follows: Excellent = when jaw is relaxed, vocal cords are abducted and immobile and there is no diaphragmatic movement. Good = when the jaw is relaxed, vocal cords are abducted and immobile, but there is some diaphragmatic movement. Poor = when the jaw is relaxed, but vocal cords moving and coughing or bucking happens. Impossible: When the jaw is not relaxed and vocal cords are closed. We considered excellent and good as acceptable intubation conditions and poor and impossible as unacceptable intubation conditions. We categorized laryngoscopy grades by Cormack and Lehane[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] classification as one of the following: Grade 1 = most of the glottis opening can be seen; Grade 2 = only the posterior portion of the glottis or only arytenoid cartilages are visible; Grade 3 = only the epiglottis but no portion of glottis is visible; Grade 4 = Neither the glottis nor the epiglottis can be seen. Duration of performing laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation was also recorded. A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 35 in each group was required to detect a difference in the numbers of patients with adequate intubation conditions of at least 20% among the four groups (power 80%, &#x003b1; error = 0.05).</p><p>Data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (version 16) system. Qualitative data were analyzed by Chi-square test. We used analysis of variance to evaluate mean of quantitative data among four groups. Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or numbers. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 140 patients were enrolled in the study.

There was no significant difference in laryngoscopy grades between four groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Intubation conditions were acceptable in 91.4% of Group A patients, 94.2% of Group B patients, 97.1% of Group C patients and 68.5% of Group D patients. Intubation conditions were significantly better in group C than other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Furthermore, the number of patients with excellent intubation conditions was significantly higher in Group C (71.4%) than Group A (31.4%) and Group B (37.1%) and Group D (11.4%) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). One case of impossible intubation condition was reported in group D. After administration of atracurium, intubation was performed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. No significant difference was noted in the mean of added doses of atracurium between four groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Difficult airway and failed intubation include a range of difficult mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult intubation and failed intubation. The most dangerous situation is a cannot ventilate intubate situation[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 anesthetics and oxygenation failure can lead to death or hypoxic brain damage. Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation induce sympathetic reflex stimulation with raised catecholamine plasma levels, that may lead to hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, intracranial or intraocular hypertension.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This adverse autonomic response may be severe during a difficult intubation. Our study showed that infusion of propofol 1.5 mg/kg added to an initial bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg improves intubation conditions significantly without inducing hemodynamic changes. Recent studies have described the effects of increasing doses of propofol on intubation conditions. Lieutaud <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that increasing doses of propofol especially when used with a muscle relaxant improved intubation conditions significantly. In their study, 95% of patients who received propofol 2.5 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, had clinically acceptable intubation conditions. Gore <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] evaluated intubation conditions with different doses of propofol without muscle relaxant. They used different doses of propofol as 2, 2.5 and 3 mg/kg with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg. They found that ideal intubation conditions without muscle relaxant can be achieved with propofol 3 mg/kg without significant hemodynamic changes. In this study, laryngoscopy was performed 7 min after fentanyl injection, as some authors have described that the peak action of fentanyl comes after 7 min.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, in many studies as our study laryngoscopy was performed earlier. Kwon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that the administration of additional dose of propofol (0.5 mg/kg) prior to intubation may improve intubation conditions significantly without inducing hypotension. They found that adding a booster of propofol, increases it's plasma concentration at intubation, thus it might augment intubation conditions. The muscle relaxing mechanisms of intravenous anesthetics, especially propofol, have been investigated in several studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Some authors have demonstrated a central (cortical and spinal cord) mechanisms to describe muscle relaxing properties of propofol. Dueck <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] explained that propofol bolus administration impaired the central part of the motor system by decreasing in &#x003b1;-motor neuron excitability as shown by a decreased spinal F wave. Some authors have described a peripheral mechanism. Fujii <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] used electromyography to show that subhypnotic and anesthetic doses of propofol decrease diaphragmatic contractility in dogs. Haeseler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that propofol inhibited human skeletal muscle sodium channels in a voltage-dependent manner. Several recent studies have described the effects of propofol on hemodynamic status.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Propofol leads to hypotension by peripheral vasodilation and negative inotropic and chronotropic properties, especially in patients with cardiovascular diseases, following its rapid administration.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Moreover, propofol's effect on cortical vagal tone can result in bradycardia and conductive disturbances.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Chang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed that propofol produces vasodilation by an endothelium-independent mechanism and may act as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocker, similar to that of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, verapamil. In our study, we found that infusion of the increased doses of propofol did not affect the hemodynamic status. MAP 3 min after laryngoscopy was significantly lower in Group D than Group A. we think that the higher dose of propofol at induction might cause that. It's important to note that our study had limitations. We just studied on patients with ASA I and ASA II and not younger than 18 years or older than 60 years. Moreover, we didn&#x02019;t investigate the effects of combination of propofol with sedatives on intubation conditions. Furthermore, we didn&#x02019;t measure the plasma concentration of propofol in the study groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Infusion of propofol 1.5 mg/kg added to an initial bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg improves intubation conditions significantly without inducing hemodynamic changes or side-effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors wish to sincerely thank the support of all the colleagues in Kashani Hospital Medical Center affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Isfahan, Iran.
