This risk of specific complications is low and generally similar in both treatment options. Moreover, the burden of the study is not much higher compared to standard treatment. Follow-up is standardized according to current trauma guidelines. Literature indicates that both treatment options from the study are accepted for displaced distal radius fractures. No clear advantage for one treatment options is found at present in the literature, although there is no level I evidence present. This trial will provide level-1 evidence for the comparison of consolidation and functional outcome between two treatment options for non-displaced distal radial fractures. The gathered data may support the development of a clinical guideline for conservative treatment of distal radial fractures.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Netherlands National Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3552">NTR3552</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fractures of the distal radius are common injuries and account for up to 15% of all extremity fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Most of these patients can be treated non-operatively in a plaster of Paris, with excellent functional results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Usually a immobilization period of four till six weeks is preferred. The duration of immobilisation has been questioned earlier in literature. Some authors believe that three weeks is long enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], while others consider one week of immobilization is sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other authors even consider that there is no need for plaster immobilsation in case of a non-displaced distal radial fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The duration of immobilization of distal radius fractures depends on whether these fractures can displace into an unacceptable position. Most radial fractures are liable to displace within the first two weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], only 7% to 8% displace after this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and none after six weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A minimum period of three weeks of immobilization seems safe.</p><p>Two randomized controlled trials compared three-weeks with five-weeks immobilization in a plaster back slab, in a total of 133 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Most patients had minimally displaced distal radial fractures. Both trials found no significant differences in either anatomical or functional outcomes after 9&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] follow up. Separate data for complications were not given. Jensen&#x02019;s RCT in 1997 showed in 62 patients with an undisplaced extra-articular distal radius fracture that even one week of immobilization did not differ from three weeks of immobilization when comparing radiographic results or functional outcome defined by the, Gartland and Werley score after 26&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Separate results for complications were not provided.</p><p>The studies mentioned above have their limitations in follow-up, modest patient groups or methods. In a review of Handoll 2008 concerning conservative interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults it was also concluded that there is no scientific support for a preferred treatment strategy, including length of immobilization, for non-displaced distal radial fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>For example the Gartland and Werley score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was used to assess functional outcome in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This is the most commonly described instrument in the literature for evaluating outcome after wrist surgery, but it has not been validated so to date. In the other study radiography, wrist motion, grip strength and pain were measured after one year and no outcome measure instruments were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thereby in all the studies serious complications were not reported separately, patient satisfaction and resource implications were rarely mentioned and there was an inadequate description of inclusion criteria. The variety of fracture classification systems, with associated issues of reliability and validity further complicates comparison between studies and their outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Obviously, the ultimate treatment is short, safe and leads to an early return of function. In achieving this, reduction of the immobilization period may be beneficial. The short period of immobilization could speed up the functional recovery or reduce the number of days absent from work. Since there is little knowledge about the best immobilisation period for non-displaced distal radial fractures, there is a need for a RCT. In this study functional outcome will be the primary outcome and this will be assessed using validated instruments, namely the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) and the Disability of Arm and Shoulder (DASH) forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><sec><title>Rationale for the trial</title><p>Nowadays, usually an immobilization period of four till six weeks is preferred. Despite the minimal evidence in literature this immobilization period can be questioned. A randomized clinical trial with sufficient power is needed to provide scientific support for a preferred treatment strategy for non-displaced distal radial fractures. The aim of this trial is to compare the results of three weeks of cast immobilization with five weeks of cast immobilization of non-displaced distal radial fractures with respect to functional outcome, the incidence of non-union, pain scores, and complications.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be conducted as a prospective randomized clinical trial (see Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) in which three weeks of plaster cast immobilization is compared with five weeks of plaster cast immobilization.

All patients should be independent in activities of daily living. Evaluation of eligible patients will take place either at the emergency department or at the outpatient department of the Spaarne Hospital, Hoofddorp. Patients are eligible using the following in- and exclusion criteria:</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1. Age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years.</p><p>2.

Instead of 30 items, the Quick-DASH uses 11 items (scored 1&#x02013;5) to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The right and left elbow will be assessed separately. At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated. The scores will be transformed to a 0&#x02013;100 scale for easy comparison. A higher score indicates greater disability.</p><p>Like the DASH, the <italic>Quick</italic>-DASH contains 2 optional modules to measure symptoms and function in athletes, performing artists and other workers whose jobs require a high degree of physical performance. These optional models are scored separately; each contains four items, scored 1&#x02013;5. All items must be completed for a score to be calculated.</p><p>PRWE score is the most responsive instrument for evaluating the outcome in patients with distal radius fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The secondary outcome measures are:</p><p>1. Range of motion.</p><p>2. Pain (assessed by the VAS scale).</p><p>3. Complications: dislocation, complex regional pain syndrome and mal/nonunion.</p><p>Pain level will be determined using a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS), in which zero implies no pain and ten implies the worst possible pain.</p><p>ROM will be measured on both sides using a goniometer.</p><p>In addition to the outcome variables mentioned above, the following data will be collected:</p><p>a) Intrinsic variables (baseline data): age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists&#x02019; ASA classification, tobacco consumption, alcohol consumption, comorbidity, social status/household composition, dominant side, and medication use.</p><p>b) Injury related variables: affected side, mechanism of injury.</p><p>c) Intervention-related variables: time between injury and start of physical therapy and number of physical therapy sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>After inclusion, all patients will be followed for one year in total.

Currently, the decision for the duration of immobilization of distal radial fractures is predominantly based upon the personal preferences of the treating physician. The studies done for assessing the immobilization periods of distal radial fractures have their limitations of using a non-validated outcome score list, which makes it impossible to conclude with certainty shorter immobilization periods of distal radial fractures are preferred. Considering this statements, a new randomized trial with sufficient power is needed to provide evidence for a definitive, generally acceptable guideline for the treatment of non-displaced distal radial fractures. The results of this study will help to clarify the question if shorter periods of immobilizations are favorable in adult patients with conservatively treated distal radial fractures, thereby considering functional outcome, pain scores, incidence of non-union, and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
