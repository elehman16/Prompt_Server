When this articular cartilage is damaged, its mechanical properties are severely compromised. Unlike many tissues in the body, cartilage is physiologically limited in its ability to regenerate and heal itself after being structurally compromised. Therefore, small defects in cartilage tend to worsen over time and can lead to larger defects.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>A common technique used to repair cartilage damage is osteochondral autografting. In this procedure, small osteochondral cores are harvested from sites such as the proximal anterolateral femoral trochlea to be used as donor osteochondral grafts. The chondral lesion is excised with the harvesting tube, and the osteochondral graft is inserted. Simultaneously, the donor graft is prepped before being press-fit into the lesion. The donor graft is created with a larger diameter than the recipient site to create a snug fit, eliminating the use of fixatives; however, this process requires the graft to be forcefully inserted, typically by impacting the grafts multiple times until they are fully seated.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This forceful insertion can lead to decreased cell viability and may affect survivorship and durability of the osteochondral graft<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="bibr7-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and is responsible for the depth-dependent chondrocyte death shown by histological studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="bibr11-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Borazjani et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> characterized the biomechanics of the graft insertion process by seating 10 human donor plugs into condylar recipient holes at the knee and found the applied loads and impaction taps quite variable. To mechanically describe the impact intensity of the insertion process, the variable impulse (i.e., the integral of applied load over time) was used. Although this study provided valuable clues about impact insertion and the spread of cell death within cartilage, a relationship of impact intensity and graft viability was not reported.</p><p>Our laboratory recently evaluated osteochondral graft cell viability that underwent a constant impulse while varying load.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> During characterization of surgical impaction, our lab determined the median value of impulse to be 7.0 Ns. In agreement with Borazjani et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the study concluded that impaction does decrease graft cell viability when compared with nonimpacted grafts.

This information will be helpful to determine optimal press-fit conditions of osteochondral plugs because a tighter press-fit will require a higher impulse for plug seating and vice versa. We hypothesized that a decreased impulse during impaction will lead to increased cell viability of osteochondral tissue during transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-1947603510367913"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section7-1947603510367913"><title>Specimen Harvest</title><p>Osteochondral plugs were obtained from the condylar trochlea of bovine stifle joints of 6-month-old calves.

It was found that a decreased impulse during impaction will lead to increased cell viability of osteochondral tissue during transplantation. This is an important result, as increased cellular viability of osteochondral grafts is considered to lead to its increased survivorship and durability.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, a certain minimum impulse will be necessary to guarantee initial stability of the graft to provide acceptable anchorage. These optimal insertion conditions have yet to be defined.</p><p>The investigation required the use of a pneumatically controlled impaction device (SmartImpactor&#x02122;, Rush University Chicago, IL) to deliver a consistent maximal load and impulse.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To improve the efficiency of the device, new operational and monitoring software has been developed and was used in this study. Previous investigators in our lab have developed this device for a study with a similar setup. In that study, different load levels were targeted to insert osteochondral plugs into an experimental recipient device. Ten plugs per load level, 8 mm in diameter, 10 mm long, with 2 &#x000b1; 1 mm cartilage thickness were exposed to a series of 7 taps. The maximum force during each hit was measured and the variation determined. Based on these measurements, the coefficient of variation for load levels of 37 and 75 N was &#x0003c;2%.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Similar variation was found in this study using 50 N as target load.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that impaction of osteochondral grafts generates damaging loads that cause chondrocyte death, particularly in the superficial zone.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Higher load magnitudes were associated with higher cell death when the overall impaction impulse was kept constant.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Hence, it was suggested that lower load magnitudes and a greater number of hits be used to ensure proper fit. In this study, however, it was shown that loads as small as 37 N (requiring 74 hits for complete insertion) can still have deleterious effects on chondrocyte viability. It is evident from the above and our study that the overall impaction impulse plays a major role. The design of our study involved multiple impaction cycles on each osteochondral plug, at a constant load and loading rate, to reach varying values of impulse. Both the applied load and impulse levels represented clinically relevant values.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In a clinical setting, the necessary impulse for plug seating is dependent on recipient hole tolerances, subchondral bone quality, and bone thickness.</p><p>As expected, our study demonstrated an inverse relationship between impulse and chondrocyte viability. As the impulse submitted to the osteochondral plugs was increased, the cell viability of the chondrocytes decreased, as was expected. This relationship was seen on day 0 and to an extent on day 4, but was lost by day 8. This might be due to the culturing technique but could also be related to the plug retrieval process. It was shown earlier that blunt trauma generated with a trephine causes cell death adjacent to the lesion edge.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The tissue reaction following trauma may have compromised the cartilage during culturing.</p><p>Our study had several additional limitations. This study focused on osteochondral plug characteristics of autografts, which have a smaller surface area (&#x0003c;0.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) than allogafts (&#x0003e;2 cm<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The decreased diameter cannot distribute the loads to a large surface area, which may lead to increased stress magnitudes. However, the general principle of the surgical impaction effects on the biology of the osteochondral plugs is the same for both autografts and allografts. In particular, the average impulse per hit was strikingly similar in clinical insertion studies in our laboratory with autograft<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and others who used allograft.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In both cases, an average impulse of 0.6 Ns per hit was measured. We were also unable to study stress-strain relationships during the insertion process because displacements are not recorded using the pneumatic impaction device. Such a device was used because conventional material-testing machines are incapable of producing consistent load magnitudes at high loading rates for the experimental setup of this study.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Last but not least, the study was also conducted <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is a different surrounding than <italic>in vivo</italic>, omitting the contributing factor of other tissues in the repair process. For example, the utilized plug length of 10 mm might be too short for stable fixation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Also, this study did not evaluate the process of plug harvesting, which is similarly important for the viability of the graft.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The clinical significance that can be extrapolated from this study is that a lower impulse during impaction will lead to an increased cell viability of osteochondral plugs. This increased cell viability should lead to a higher degree of biomechanical function of the transplant and facilitate improved incorporation into the host tissue. Further studies should look into defining necessary press-fit conditions to ensure safe initial anchorage of the plug while maintaining the highest cell viability possible. It is ultimately the press-fit characteristics that define the required impulse to seat the plug and require appropriate instruments, taking the biological tolerances into account.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1947603510367913" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> Brian J.
