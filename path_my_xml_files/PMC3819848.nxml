A total of 124 ASA I and II adult patients of either sex, aged between 18 and 60 years receiving general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for orthopedics, gynecological, and general surgical procedures of intermediate duration (60-240 minutes) were included in the study. The number of patients required in each group was determined using power analysis based on previous study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Incidence of postanesthetic shivering was estimated to be around 60%. The sample size required detecting 40% reduction at 5% level of significance and 80% power was 31 patients in each group. Patients with obesity (body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c; 35), history of convulsions, neuromuscular disease, allergies, and those requiring administration of blood or blood products or procedures requiring large volume of irrigating fluids (&#x0003c;2 L) were excluded from study. Patients whose first temperature reading on placing temperature probe intraoperatively, was found to be less than 36&#x000b0;C or greater than 38&#x000b0;C were also excluded. Patients were randomly divided into groups by using sealed, opaque envelopes. The groups were thiopentone and tramadol (TT), thiopentone and saline (TS), propofol and tramadol (PT), and propofol and saline (PS). Blinding was achieved by labeling tramadol or saline as &#x0201c;study drug&#x0201d; which was prepared by an anesthetist not involved in study. All the patients received same anesthetic technique and drugs in same doses except propofol 2 mg/kg or thiopentone 5 mg/kg for induction of anesthesia. Fentanyl 2 g/kg was used for analgesia at induction and 1 g/kg in incremental doses (last dose was given at least 30 min before &#x0201c;study drug&#x0201d;) and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg as muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation followed by 10 mg boluses as required. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen to achieve and maintain a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1 at all times. All IV fluids were warmed to 37&#x000b0;C before transfusion by inline fluid warmer. Apart from routine intraoperative monitoring (electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), continuous temperature monitoring was done via nasopharyngeal temperature probe. All patients were covered by standard sterile drapes and OR temperature was maintained at 22 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C. Additional measures (warming mattress and woolen and warm air blankets) were taken if patients&#x02019; temperature dropped below 35&#x000b0;C. &#x0201c;Study drug&#x0201d; (tramadol 1 mg/kg or saline in equal volume) was given 15 min before wound closure and IV metoclopramide 10 mg was given just before skin closure as prophylaxis to postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). After skin closure, isoflurane and nitrous oxide were switched off and residual neuromuscular block was reversed with a mixture of glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg and trachea were extubated. Patients were covered with blanket and transferred to PACU (ambient temperature of 24 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C) where they received supplemental oxygen 4 L/min and monitored for SpO<sub>2</sub> and hemodynamic variables (ECG, NIBP). In addition, patients were observed for occurrence and severity [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] of POS, PONV, and pain at six different time intervals (on leaving or on arrival in PACU, at 15, 30, and 45 min of arrival in PACU and on discharge from PACU). Observations were recorded on the predesigned data collection form. Additional boluses of IV tramadol 0.5 mg/kg, 15 min apart (maximum 3 mg/kg) were given to patients with shivering grade &#x02265;2. All those patients who suffered from pain &#x02265;3 VAS (on a scale of 0-10) were treated with boluses of IV fentanyl 25-50 g. Patients were discharged according to PACU discharge protocol.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grades of shivering</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-29-521-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 16. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to compute for quantitative variables like age, BMI, duration of anesthesia, duration of patient staying in OR and change in temperature.

Several techniques have been used to diminish postoperative hypothermia: Warming blankets; warmed intravenous solutions; heated, humidified inspired gases; and increasing ambient air temperature. Baker <italic>et al.</italic>, demonstrated that complete intraoperative rewarming after mild hypothermia is difficult, and despite aggressive manipulation of convective heating devices and water blankets, the average rate attainable is 0.7&#x000b0;C/h making prevention even more important in the intraoperative period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our study, we took adequate precaution to prevent hypothermia by covering all patients with standard sterile drapes. Additional measures (warming mattress and woolen and warm air blankets) were taken if patients&#x02019; temperature dropped below 35&#x000b0;C. All patients were normothermic upon arrival in PACU (approximately 36.0 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C). Among the pharmacological modalities used for prevention and treatment of POS, tramadol has been used effectively in different doses to prevent postoperative shivering,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] however literature comparing the effect of induction agent on the efficacy tramadol is lacking.</p><p>In this study we found that there is statistically significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in the incidence of grade 2 and 3 POS episodes in group receiving tramadol, four (12.9%) in tramadol groups (TT) and 23 (43.4%) in saline groups (TS). These results are comparable to the study done by Mohta <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>](used thiopentone as induction agent), where patient receiving tramadol in different doses had less episodes of POS when compared to normal saline as antishivering agent.</p><p>Comparison of induction agent shows that the incidence of POS in patients receiving propofol (PS Group) versus thiopentone (TS group) was 17 (54.8%) and 24 (77.4%), respectively; which was higher as compared to findings of Cheong <italic>et al.</italic>, and Singh <italic>et al.</italic>, showing lower incidence in the thiopentone group as compared to propofol group, 25 and 50% and 10 and 22%, respectively; but this could be explained by the fact that both these studies included only those patients who underwent minor surgical procedures which were associated with minimum perioperative heat loss. Average duration in our study was approximately 110 &#x000b1; 10 min more than the duration mentioned in these studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Although propofol or tramadol alone as antishivering agents equally reduces the incidence of POS (54.8% in both PS and TT groups); in TS group it was the highest 24 (77.4%). Combining these both antishivering agents (propofol + tramadol) results in absence of POS requiring treatment in PT group.</p><p>Timing of giving antishivering agent is also important. According to Zahedi, the incidence of shivering is highest in the first 30 min of recovery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This was consistent with the findings of our study which showed that the maximum number of patients suffered from shivering on arrival in the PACU and in vast majority of patients, the POS had disappeared within 30 min of arrival in the PACU. Regarding the peak antishivering effect of Tramadol, Zahedi showed it to be 5 min after intravenous injection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In our study, tramadol was given at the start of skin closure and by the time patient reached the PACU, at least 20 min would have passed to the administration of tramadol. The highest incidence of shivering was on arrival in the PACU. Question arises that what should be the ideal time to use prophylactic tramadol. Results of our study shows that the peak antishivering effect of tramadol occurs after about 30 min of its administration, and therefore it should be administered even earlier. However, further studies are required to find the optimum timing of prophylactic use of tramadol to prevent POS in the PACU.</p><p>As deleterious effects of POS are related to its severity, active treatment is indicated in more severe forms to minimize these effects. We recorded the severity of POS with grade I POS being the one not requiring treatment while grade 2 and 3 being significant POS requiring treatment. The episodes of significant shivering requiring treatment was greatest in the TS as compared to all other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), whereas none of the patients in PT group required antishivering treatment. These results were comparable with the study done previously by Mohta <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] where the incidence of shivering requiring treatment (grade 2 and 3) was 42.4% in thiopentone only group and 6% in equivalent dose tramadol group.</p><p>The occurrence of PONV was unremarkable among the study groups, which could be due to the prophylactic use of metoclopramide in every patient. There were no significant alterations in the hemodynamic parameters during the study period among the groups. Tramadol, a synthetic opioid, can be effectively used for the prevention and treatment of moderate to severe pain. Therefore, we observed significantly lower requirement of rescue analgesia in tramadol groups.</p><p>The limitation of our study was that we included only ASA I and II relatively stable patients and were without known coronary artery disease, and therefore we did not found any cardiovascular complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The prophylactic use of tramadol in a dose 1 mg/kg administered at the time of skin closure when propofol is used as an induction agent significantly reduces the episodes of POS requiring treatment. Another advantage of tramadol is the reduced requirement of postoperative analgesia in these patients in the recovery room.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source
