Participation in leisure-time physical activities may be an important source of habitual physical activity (HPA) for children with CP, who as a group have lower levels of HPA and increased sedentary time compared with their typically developing peers. The proposed study aims to compare the efficacy of a participation focused therapy (ParticiPAte CP) to usual care in a pragmatic, randomised waitlist controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Thirty-six children with CP (18 in each group), classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I to III, aged between 8 and 12 years will be recruited across South East Queensland, Australia. Children will be randomised to receive either ParticiPAte CP or waitlist usual care using concealed allocation. ParticiPAte CP is an individually tailored, goal-directed intervention model of pragmatic participation-focused therapy using a toolbox of evidence-based strategies in the treatment of children with CP. This will include goal-setting; identification of barriers and facilitators to participation goals, strategy formation and planning and communication guided by principles of Self-Determination Theory using strategies of Motivational Interviewing. The intervention comprises 8&#x02009;weekly sessions of 1&#x02009;hour duration conducted by a physiotherapist in the child's home or community.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12615001064594.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>participation</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>behaviour change</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Foundation, Cerebral Palsy Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To our knowledge, this is the first pragmatic randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a participation-focused physiotherapy intervention on physical activity participation in children with cerebral palsy in an adequately powered study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is designed to detect whether improvement in child perceived leisure time physical activity participation goal performance and satisfaction will translate into increased levels of habitual physical activity as measured by triaxial accelerometry.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inclusion of instruments measuring process-related outcomes including child motivational orientation for physical activity, behavioural barriers to physical activity participation and parental autonomy-supportiveness will enable examination of the hypothesised mechanism of action.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Individualised intervention parameters may introduce challenges in replication of the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exclusion of an objective activity capacity measure limits the ability to examine the effect of increased activity capacity on physical activity goal attainment.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is an umbrella term for a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture attributed to non-progressive disturbances to the developing brain in the perinatal period.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Motor impairments may be accompanied by secondary musculoskeletal complications and disturbances of sensation, cognition, perception or behaviour.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Children with CP experience limitations in their performance of day-to-day activities and restrictions to their participation in home, school and community life.</p><p>The WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: Child and Youth Version (ICF-CY) defines participation as &#x02018;involvement in a life situation&#x02019; (p. 9).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This definition has, however, been criticised as conceptually unclear, with overlap of the term with other constructs within the ICF-CY (such as activity and environment).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> Key distinctions between participation and other related constructs have been proposed. Participation refers to &#x02018;performance at the societal level&#x02019; (p.&#x000a0;23) as opposed to the individual, and is associated with the fulfilment of social roles.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Participation is described as a relational concept that is dependent on context, and may be influenced by characteristics of the environment predominantly over characteristics of the individual.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

</p><p>Compared with their typically developing peers, children and youth with CP experience a greater number of barriers to participation in leisure-time PA.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> In a cross-sectional study using the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY), parents of children and youth aged&#x000a0;5&#x02013;17 years with (n=282) and without (n=294) various disabilities reported that environmental factors (eg, physical access, attitudes of others, adequacy of programmes and services, availability of equipment) and/or personal and intrapersonal factors (eg, lived experience, motivation, peer relations) were barriers to participation in addition to activity limitations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It has been suggested that the interplay of activity limitations and environmental factors is important,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and that the environment has a mediating role in explaining the participation of children with disabilities.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p><p>Physical activity is defined as any body movement using skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure (varying continuously between low and high levels).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Habitual physical activity (HPA) is PA performed during the usual activities of daily living throughout a period of time (day, week, etc) varying through periods of rest, work and leisure.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x000a0;HPA may be categorised with intensity-related thresholds (called cut-points). The categories establish the amount of energy expenditure: sedentary (little to no energy expenditure above rest), light PA (LPA, moderate levels of energy expenditure) or moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA, highest levels of energy expenditure).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Participation in leisure-time PA may be an important source of HPA for youth with CP.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A cross-sectional study of 62 children with activity monitors in free-living (unrestricted, usual activity at home, school and weekend) conditions identified that ambulant children and young people with unilateral and bilateral CP aged 7&#x02013;13 years (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS I&#x02013;III)) were less active on weekend compared with week days.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Children who were more physically active on weekends were more likely to participate in organised sports.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

</p><p>The broad nature of participation and the complexity of interactions with personal and environmental (contextual) factors leads to challenges in the conceptualisation, development, delivery and measurement of outcomes in participation-focused experimental interventions. A model of participation-focused therapy has been proposed, whereby the intervention is goal-oriented, family&#x000a0;centred, collaborative, strength-based, ecological and self-determined.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In participation-based therapy, interventions are carried out using a five-step process: (1) develop collaborative relationship with the family and child, (2) determine mutually agreed&#x000a0;on goals for participation, (3) assess child, family and environment strengths and what needs to occur, (4) develop and implement the intervention plan and (5) evaluate processes and outcomes with child and family.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The participation-based therapy model stresses the importance of individuality&#x02014;optimal participation is an individually&#x000a0;defined (and family/culturally influenced) construct and therefore individualised outcome measures, such as Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), may offer a more valid means to evaluate the success of a participation intervention.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>A recent systematic review investigating interventions aimed at improving participation outcomes for children with disabilities found that only three out of the seven included studies had participation as the primary outcome.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The majority of studies targeted body structure and function and activity domains of the ICF-CY, with participation considered a secondary outcome. The systematic review of seven comparison intervention trials in children with developmental disabilities aged&#x000a0;5&#x02013;18 years, concluded that interventions such as strength training and activity-based exercise programmes had minimal impact on participation outcomes, while individually tailored programmes incorporating coaching, mentoring and education achieved favourable results on discrete aspects of participation.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A second systematic review evaluated PA and behaviour change interventions aimed to increase participation in active physical recreation and HPA in children and youth with CP aged 5&#x02013;18 years.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Included interventions predominantly used strategies (such as skills practice) targeting body structure and function and activity domains of the ICF, assuming there would be secondary improvements in participation frequency and/or HPA level.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Results did not support this assumption; there were no clinically meaningful effects of therapy and behaviour change interventions on HPA level and leisure-time PA participation frequency and intensity.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Additionally, only two of the eight studies incorporated mutually agreed on goals for participation,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> in line with the model of participation-based therapy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The review highlighted that PA is a complex health behaviour, and the majority of interventions tested were not underpinned by theories of human behaviour and motivation.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is an influential theory explaining a variety of phenomena associated with human motivation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> Basic Psychological Needs Theory describes three basic psychological needs associated with motivation: (i) autonomy (being the initiator and regulator of one's actions), (ii) competence (feelings of self-efficacy and the capacity to produce behaviour that achieves desired outcomes) and (iii) relatedness (the feeling of being connected to others and experience of meaningful reciprocal relationships).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> According to SDT, internally generated (intrinsic) motivation for sustaining behaviour is promoted through the fulfilment of these needs.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> An autonomy-supportive climate is one whereby a person's autonomy is fostered and respected, fuelling intrinsic motivation. The opposite, a controlling climate, pressures people to behave in certain ways and undermines intrinsic motivation.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Intrinsic motivation is often identified as a strong correlate or predictor of maintenance of healthy PA behaviours.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</p><p>Interventions to increase leisure-time PA participation or levels of HPA in typically developing children that are based on SDT have demonstrated positive outcomes.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref> A systematic review of 66 empirical studies that have measured SDT-related constructs with respect to exercise and PA behaviours, found that overall there is good evidence to support the use of SDT in explaining exercise and PA behaviour across a wide variety of contexts in both &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; and &#x02018;diseased&#x02019; populations.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> One behavioural intervention approach that is aligned with SDT is Motivational Interviewing (MI), a clinical &#x02018;brief intervention&#x02019; counselling technique.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</p><p>MI has been used to promote PA behaviours in people with chronic health conditions.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x000a0;MI is a style of communication that is practical to implement in healthcare settings and in the community.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> A systematic review and meta-analysis identified 37 MI interventions conducted in paediatric populations with health behaviours as the target outcome (such as management of obesity, asthma, dental health or sleep).<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Based on effect size calculations (Hedge's <italic>g</italic> thresholds; small&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.2, medium&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.5, large&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0.8), there were small, significant effects on both physical (<italic>g</italic>=0.18, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.17&#x000a0;to 0.20) and psychosocial (<italic>g</italic>=0.22, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.19&#x000a0;to 0.25) outcomes. Interventions delivered to the parent and child as a dyad were shown to be more effective in achieving health-related outcomes than interventions delivered to parent or child separately.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The essential elements of MI are communication techniques which promote &#x02018;partnership&#x02019;, &#x02018;compassion&#x02019;, &#x02018;evocation&#x02019; and &#x02018;acceptance&#x02019; within and between the patient and practitioner.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> These communication techniques can be used by therapists seeking to promote an autonomy-supportive climate and work towards modifying PA and health behaviours.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Four fundamental processes of MI evolve from building a relational foundation (&#x02018;engaging&#x02019;), to communicating with the client in a guiding fashion with a direction or goal in mind (&#x02018;focusing&#x02019;, &#x02018;evoking&#x02019;) and finally discussing strategies or actions (&#x02018;planning&#x02019;).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> These processes align with participation-based therapy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>Behaviour changing interventions including MI typically have complex mechanisms of action, involving multiple interconnected elements.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x000a0;The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is an integrative framework of behaviour change theories comprising 14 domains.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> The TDF can be a useful means of categorising barriers and facilitators to behavioural change and behaviour changing strategies and processes within interventions.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47&#x02013;49</xref> The TDF can be used in multiple ways to apply a theoretical lens to behaviour change, including as the basis for qualitative interviews, process examination and quantitative questionnaires.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> The TDF has been commonly used in implementation science fields, although has a broader application that may help explain the clinical trial outcomes of behaviour changing therapies.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>
</p><p>An individually&#x000a0;tailored and goal-directed therapy intervention incorporating elements of MI may be effective in improving leisure-time PA participation in children with CP. This intervention would identify and target child and family-specific barriers and facilitators (across all domains of the ICF-CY and TDF) to individually defined participation goals. The intervention would create an autonomy-supportive environment to foster intrinsic motivation for sustainable participation in PA, through fulfilment of basic psychological needs. It is important to test participation-focused therapy in a randomised trial to determine the effect on participation outcomes. ParticiPAte CP is an individualised, goal-directed, family&#x000a0;centred, ecological, participation-based and motivational physiotherapy intervention. Our proposed pragmatic, randomised, waitlist controlled trial seeks to determine if ParticiPAte CP can result in increased leisure-time PA participation goal attainment, translating into increased HPA level, compared with usual care in children with CP aged 8&#x02013;12 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The main aim of the proposed study is to determine if 8&#x02009;hours of an individualised ParticiPAte CP programme can increase child and parent perceived performance of and satisfaction with participation in three to five self-identified leisure-time PA participation goals, compared with usual care.

Children will be excluded if they (1) have limited ability to communicate insight into a preferred future (needs, wants and desires) in spoken English and/or through an interpreter or augmentative and alternative communication (ie, Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) levels IV&#x02013;V and/or children with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability as defined by the&#x000a0;10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems as IQ&#x0003c;50<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>; (2) have uncontrolled epilepsy (as this may impact on safety to engage in certain PA); (3) have a severe visual impairment or blindness (defined as 6/60 or lower vision, when appropriately corrected, in the better eye or in the written opinion of an ophthalmologist the cortical visual impairment, visual field loss and/or other deficits result in a combined approximate acuity of 6/60 or lower); (4) have severe asthma exacerbated by exercise that is not controlled with medications under an asthma management plan and/or (5) have orthopaedic and/or neurological surgery 6&#x02009;months prior to and/or planned during the entire study period including follow-up assessments.

Allowing for 20% drop out and missing data on actigraphy, a total of 36 parent-child dyads (18 per group) will be recruited. This study has been powered to detect a difference on the primary outcome of interest. Effects on secondary outcomes are not able to be accurately estimated due to limited previous evidence, and the results of this trial will assist in power calculations for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Parent-child dyads will be recruited in cohorts of 6&#x02013;12 prior to baseline assessment. When a cohort is filled, further prospective participants will be directed to wait for the next cohort. The allocation sequence will be determined by computer-generated random numbers in blocks of four, stratified into one of four groups based on GMFCS (I or II vs III) and gender (male vs female). These factors were chosen for stratification as they are associated with participation and PA outcomes in the study population.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Participants will be allocated to either immediate treatment or waitlist control. The randomisation process is as follows: (i) the child's name, the position at which they had been recruited into the study and their strata (eg, participant name, 13, GMFCS III, female) will be written on the front of an opaque envelope and given to a non-study personnel (who has access to the randomisation sequence that is hidden from the investigators); (ii) the non-study personnel will identify the next available allocation (immediate treatment/waitlist) within the child's strata, cross it off so that it may not be allocated again, then place a folded piece of paper stating child's allocation into the envelope and seal it; (iii) the child's envelope is opened in front of the parent-child dyad after completion of baseline outcome measures except 7-day HPA monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Blinding</title><p>As per allocation procedure, allocation will be blinded to both the treating/assessing therapist and participating parent-child dyads until completion of baseline (T0) COPM goal-setting and questionnaire-based outcome measures. Parent-child dyads will be aware of their group allocation during HPA monitoring at baseline, as this will occur in the 7&#x02009;days immediately following the baseline goal-setting. The treating/assessing therapist and parent-child dyads will be aware of group allocation during the remaining study time points. As this is a pragmatic study, the COPM is being completed as it would be in a clinical scenario (set and scored by the treating therapist). The COPM and GAS goals are however being assessed by a blinded rater against criteria for goal content, scaling and technical proficiency (see the&#x000a0;'Goal Attainment Scaling'&#x000a0;section). Questionnaire-based outcomes will be completed by the child and parent/caregiver directly onto Qualtrics (an online survey platform). Where participating children require assistance to read questions or operate the computer, they will be requested to seek the help of a trusted adult not involved in the study (eg, other family member or teacher) to avoid introducing bias. The survey responses are not able to be modified by the researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Adverse events and safety</title><p>Any minor (eg, delayed-onset muscle soreness requiring ice or rest, injuries not requiring medical attention, psychological distress) or major (eg, injuries requiring medical attention) adverse event associated with ParticiPAte CP will be screened on a weekly basis by the treating therapist by verbal questioning and recorded. Minor or major adverse events will be reported to senior study personnel RB and LS, and referred to the ethics committees if of a serious nature. No data monitoring committee has been implemented as the study is not a drug trial. The treating therapist will be trained in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Swimming activities will be completed with direct parent/caregiver supervision. Risk assessments with mitigation strategies will be completed prior to participation in activities considered to be high-risk by mutual agreement between therapist and parent/caregiver (eg, activities in open water, contact sports). Prior to baseline assessment, parents/caregivers will complete a PA readiness questionnaire to record their child's medical conditions and medication regime relevant to leisure-time PA participation. Any decision to describe interim results, stop or terminate the trial will be made by the investigators with oversight from the ethics committees where necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Study procedure</title><p>The efficacy of ParticiPAte CP will be tested using a waitlist randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(RCT) conducted according to CONSORT guidelines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> A waitlist design allows for comparison against usual standard of care, without disadvantaging the control group by prevention of access to a potentially effective treatment. Approximately six cohorts of 6&#x02013;12 participants will be recruited from December 2015 and commenced between April 2016 and April 2017. It is aimed to run cohorts consecutively over the study period to reduce bias introduced by the seasonal nature of many available community PA programmes.

Make-up sessions will be scheduled within 1&#x02009;week if participants and/or the physiotherapist need to cancel a scheduled session. The location of the middle six sessions is expected to be at the child's home, with community (eg, park, swimming pool, basketball court) and/or school visits dependent on the specific participation goals identified by the child and their parent/caregiver. The child with CP and their primary caregiver are the primary targets of the intervention, however, other family members may be involved to varying extents (eg, by being present at sessions, completing activities and/or participating in discussions), depending on both the goals and the broader family/community context.

ParticiPAte CP is aimed to increase child-parent dyad perceived performance and satisfaction with self-identified leisure-time PA participation goals, in children aged 8&#x02013;12 years with CP classified at GMFCS I&#x02013;III. This protocol describes a strong theoretical basis for the ParticiPAte CP intervention, and the model of therapy using a toolbox of strategies across ICF and TDF domains including communications consistent with MI. The intervention is tailored to individual parent-child dyads, based on an assessment of modifiable barriers to participation. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first pragmatic randomised trial investigating a model of participation-focused physiotherapy. Secondary outcome measures including triaxial accelerometry will help to identify whether an effect on goal attainment translates into HPA performance. Other measures of barriers to behavioural change and motivational climate will support or refute the hypothesised mechanism of action; the development of child and family self-determination. It is expected that the results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals and international academic conferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e191" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015918.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e192" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015918.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the support of Professor Robert Ware, Biostatistician, in consulation regarding the randomisation, blinding and statistical analysis sections.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SR, RB and LS conceived the study and defined the original study protocol.
