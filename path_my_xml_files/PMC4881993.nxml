In Zimbabwe, to achieve the 1.26 million circumcisions needed to be performed by 2015 to achieve optimal MC coverage, a new approach was needed. The primary objective of the current trial was to assess the performance (safety, procedure time, and cost) of the PrePex device compared to forceps-guided surgical circumcision.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This Phase II, randomized, open-label trial in Zimbabwe involved healthy, non-circumcised adult male volunteers who were randomly assigned to the PrePex device (n = 160) or surgical arm (n = 80). Three doctors and 4 nurses, all certified on both circumcision methods, performed the procedures. The PrePex device procedure involves a plastic ring with a rubber O-ring that necrotizes the foreskin to facilitate easy and minimally invasive removal. Total procedure time was the primary endpoint. Adverse event (AE) data were also gathered for 90 days post-procedure. All 80 participants in the surgical arm and 158 participants in the PrePex arm achieved complete circumcision. The total procedure time for the PrePex device was approximately one-third of the total surgical procedure (4.8 minutes, Standard Deviation [SD]: 1.2 versus 14.6 minutes; SD: 4.2; p&#x0003c;0.00001). There were 2 AEs for 2 participants (rate of 1.3%, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.0025&#x02013;4.53%), which were resolved with simple intervention. The AEs were device related, including 1 case of pain leading to device removal and 1 case of removal of the device.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The trial supports previous studies&#x02019; conclusions that the PrePex procedure is safe, quick, easy to apply, and effective in terms of procedure time as an alternative to traditional surgical circumcision. The PrePex device has great potential for use in overburdened health systems and in resource-limited settings and is recommended for use in rapid scale-up of adult MC in Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01956370">NCT01956370</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>United Nations Population Fund, Harare</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tshimanga</surname><given-names>Mufuta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The United Nations Population Fund funded this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/">http://www.unfpa.org/public/</ext-link>).

MC coverage of 80% of men 15&#x02013;49 years is recommended to achieve the highest impact on HIV incidence [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In Zimbabwe, approximately 10% of the male population is circumcised [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 2009, the country initiated a national MC program based on the forceps-guided surgical procedure, which resulted in approximately 50,000 circumcisions through the program&#x02019;s end in 2011. However, the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) estimates that 1.26 million circumcisions should still be performed by 2015 to achieve optimal MC coverage [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Alternative solutions to accelerate MC scale-up were sought. In October 2011, MOHCC commissioned a 3-phase RCT of the PrePex<sup>TM</sup> device (<italic>Circ MedTech Limited</italic>) in order to determine its safety, performance, and ease of use (the device involves a plastic ring with a rubber O-ring that necrotizes the foreskin to facilitate easy and minimally invasive removal). The trial included: 1) a safety phase to determine the safety and efficacy of the PrePex device; 2) a comparative phase to assess the performance of the PrePex method compared to surgical circumcision; and 3) a field study to assess the ease of use by trained nurses. The safety phase results demonstrated that the PrePex device is safe for MC in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The current article presents the Phase II comparative study that assessed the PrePex device performance (safety, procedure time, and cost) compared to surgical circumcision.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>This phase II, randomized, open-label trial compared the performance of the PrePex device to forceps-guided surgical circumcision in healthy adults using pre and post-circumcision measures over a 9-week study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156220.s002">S1 Trial</xref> Protocol; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156220.s001">S1 CONSORT</xref> Checklist). A randomized design was chosen for phase II to avoid multiple sources of bias arising from the inability to separate trial effects (such as patient selection, trial eligibility, and assessment schedule, and treatment locations) from treatment effect on clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Power and sample size calculations were based on the primary endpoint of total procedure time. As we intended to compare two independent group means for procedure duration, we used the following formula to derive the sample size in each group: N = {4 (&#x003c3;)<sup>2</sup> [Z<sub>crit</sub> + Z<sub>pwr</sub>]<sup>2</sup>} / D<sup>2</sup> where &#x003c3; is the assumed SD of each group, the Z<sub>crit</sub> value is the desired significance criterion (0.05), the Z<sub>pwr</sub> value is the desired statistical power (80%), and D is the minimum expected difference between the two means: SD = 15; Z<sub>crit</sub> = 1.645; Z<sub>pwr</sub> = 1.96; and D = 20&#x02013;8 = 12. Thus N = {4 (15)<sup>2</sup> [1.645 + 1.96]<sup>2</sup>} / 12<sup>2</sup> = 81.2, which was rounded up to 80 for the surgical arm and 160 for the device arm for a 1:2 ratio. An unbalanced randomization of 2:1 was used to accumulate more data on the new PrePex device and is also in keeping with the WHO framework for clinical evaluation of devices for male circumcision.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned by a simple randomization method to either the PrePex (probability = 2/3) or surgical arm (probability = 1/3). Safety, pain, compliance, satisfaction with the procedure and cosmetic results, time to complete healing, and cost-effectiveness were secondary outcomes measured over the 90-day study.</p><p>The study included clinical, psychosocial, and costing components. The clinical component involved trained doctors using the PrePex device on participants, who were observed and interviewed over multiple review visits to determine the safety and efficacy of the device. The psychosocial component involved private participant interviews by trained psychosocial interviewers to examine psychosocial factors associated with the procedures. Survey measures were assessed immediately before circumcision, 14-day post-circumcision, and 90-day post-circumcision to document and track changes in attitudes towards and satisfaction with circumcision.</p><p>The costs of the procedures were compared under the costing component. For the surgical arm, 3 routine follow-up visits were assumed; for the device arm, 4 were assumed. Unit cost data for commodities and consumables were collected from the study procurement records, the Supply Chain Management Services commodities forecast, and Population Services International. In some instances, unit cost was based on an average price for the item. Costs were compared for cost-effectiveness with a cost-analysis endpoint related to training, personnel time, infrastructure, tools, and materials. Indirect operational costs and overhead costs were excluded, but have been assumed to be the same for both arms, and so, would not impact the findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study site</title><p>The MC study site was Spilhaus Centre, a family planning clinic in Harare, which provides free surgical MC. The reception area, the examination area, the operating room, and the procedure room are dedicated to performing 15&#x02013;20 MCs daily, but can perform as many as 40&#x02013;60 daily MCs. Counseling rooms and waiting areas are shared with family planning clients. Nurse employees were trained for study participation and provided an extra allowance. Doctors were employed on a locum basis and paid on a daily basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study population</title><p>Male adult residents in Harare aged at least 18 years, who were scheduled for voluntary circumcision, were targeted for enrollment. Only participants who signed the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe&#x02019;s (MRCZ) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) and met all eligibility criteria qualified for trial enrollment.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: Male aged &#x02265;18 years; uncircumcised and agreement to be circumcised; HIV sero-negative; ability to understand study procedures and requirements, and freely give informed consent for participation in this study; agreement to abstain from sexual intercourse and directly rubbing circumcised area (up to 70 days post-procedure) and until the end of the follow-up, and to return to the healthcare facility for follow-up visits (or as instructed); agreement to follow instructions about sexual abstinence and return visits; and consideration by the investigator to have potential for good compliance for the duration of the study based on (1) type of employment&#x02014;e.g., a cross border trader will often be traveling to neighboring countries and may miss review visits; and (2) place of residence; those of no fixed abode, those residing out of Harare and too far from Spilhaus clinic were likely to find it difficult to come for multiple review visits required for the study.</p><p>Participants ineligible for this study included those that met any of the following exclusion criteria: active genital infection, anatomic abnormality, or other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator prevented the participant from undergoing a circumcision; having phimosis, paraphimosis, warts under the prepuce, torn or tight frenulum, narrow prepuce, hypospadias, epispadias; known bleeding/coagulation abnormality; uncontrolled diabetes; did not agree to anonymous video and photographs of the procedure and follow-up visits; HIV sero-positive; refusal to take HIV test; and &#x0003c;18 years.</p><p>Reasons for each participant&#x02019;s exclusion were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Randomization</title><p>Upon trial enrollment, participants were randomly assigned to either the PrePex or surgical arm. Numbered marbles (1&#x02013;240) were placed in a box. The data manager generated an Excel spreadsheet list of randomly assigned study arm numbers, which was given to the nurses. The participant picked one numbered marble from the box, which was then set aside. The participant was assigned that number. The nurse verified which study arm the participant was assigned to according to the randomization list. If a participant opted out of the assigned arm, he was excluded from the study. His marble was put back in the box.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Training</title><p>PrePex Masters from Rwanda conducted the training using the most up-to-date program and certified 3 PrePex operators (physicians, including 1 urologist, 1 general surgeon, and 1 general practitioner) and 4 assistants (nurses). All 3 PrePex operators and two assistants (nurses) were actually trainers of trainers on the national surgical MC training program. They completed surgical training in 2009&#x02013;2010, were all trained on PrePex during the phase I trial and then retrained for the phase II trials. The nurses were senior-registered general nurses with over 10 years of experience. The training program included didactic and practical sessions to ensure that each operator successfully participated in at least 10 device applications and 10 device removals. All operators underwent one-day protocol training to familiarize themselves with the ICF, Case Report Forms (CRF), and other data collection tools. This was an additional day for practical sessions on the protocol. Before this day the team had a 1-week protocol and ethics training conducted jointly by the research council of Zimbabwe, the external data monitoring team from Malawi and the project principal investigators. The PrePex training was done separately and this took about 2 weeks covering theory and practical application.</p><p>The national MC program runs regular surgical circumcision training sessions, which were used in this trial. The program included 2.5 days of MC theory and 3.5 days of practical sessions to ensure that each doctor successfully performed at least 12 circumcisions using the recommended forceps-guided method.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>PrePex device and procedure</title><p>The PrePex device is composed of an inner ring, elastic ring, placement ring and a sizing accessory. All components are single-use (disposable). Circ MedTech Limited supplied the PrePex devices, sizing plates, spatula, scissors, forceps, and Lidocaine cream. All other materials were procured from local pharmaceutical and medical suppliers in Zimbabwe.</p><p>The procedure was performed in a clean, non-sterile environment in 2 stages: device application and foreskin/device removal, which followed the same protocol of an earlier RCT [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], except that dermal anesthetic cream (5% Lidocaine) was applied during placement to avert 1-hour post-placement discomfort. After device placement, a packet of 18 tablets of Paracetamol was given to each participant to take as needed (dosage: 2 tablets, 3 times a day).</p><p>After the foreskin and device removal, participants were instructed not to touch the dressing and to return for a follow-up visit 2 days post-removal for dressing removal and documentation of any adverse event (AE) and/or pain. Paracetamol was given to participants who continued to feel pain. Participants underwent weekly follow-up visits for routine documentation of AEs, pain, and healing status of circumcision site until complete healing was achieved. Complete healing was defined as complete epithelialization with no drainage from the circumcision site as per WHO Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Services for MC.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Forceps-guided surgical circumcision procedure</title><p>All surgical circumcisions were performed under local anesthesia using the forceps-guided method consistent with the national guidelines adapted from the WHO Manual for Male Circumcision under Local Anesthesia Version 2.5C January 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>For the PrePex arm, a standard visit schedule was used that included a screening and device application visit on day1, foreskin and device removal visit on day 7, and weekly follow-up visits thereafter until wound healing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0156220.t001">Table 1</xref>).

Categorical variables were presented across both arms and within each arm as frequencies and percentages. Confidence intervals (95%) for the incidence of AEs were calculated by an exact binomial method. Continuous variables were summarized by mean, median, standard deviation (SD; 2-sided 95% confidence intervals [CI]), and range). Chi-square/Fisher exact tests (proportions) or t-tests (quantitative variables) were used to compare rates or means, as appropriate. The study was designed with a 0.05 alpha level. P-values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered therefore significant. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted for all psychosocial variables of interest.</p><p>Key assumptions were made to calculate the unit cost for the surgical and device procedures. Shared costs were allocated to circumcision using allocation factors, such as share of staff time or square metres of facility space used. A cost minimization analysis was done using the Male Circumcision Costing Workbook (MC Workbook) [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] developed by Futures Institute.

All interviewers and nurses attended study protocol training sessions, as well as a Good Clinical Practices (GCP) course offered jointly by the Research Support Centre, College of Medicine of Malawi, and MRCZ. The study was monitored by international monitors (Research Support Centre, College of Medicine of Malawi) for Good Clinical Practices and international standards, such as ISO 14155. A Data Safety Monitoring Board was established to provide required oversight in all phases of the trial. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01956370); the delay in registering the study with clinicaltrials.gov, which occurred after enrolment started, was caused by the delay in obtaining the letter of support from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.

There were no severe AEs, although there were 2 device-related AEs which were due to participants removing the device (1.3%). These AEs were successfully resolved without any complications, further demonstrating the safety of PrePex device, even when removed by inquisitive users. In the largest study conducted to date in Uganda, this type of event occurred in 5 out of 625 participants (0.8%), which is considerably lower [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The device-related AE (1.3%) was higher than the rates reported in Rwanda, which ranged from 0% to 0.77% [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but lower than device-related AE rates reported in the large observational studies from Uganda and Kenya (2.3% and 6.8%. respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The clinical effectiveness of the device in this study as defined by WHO would be 98.7%, which emphasizes the point that surgical circumcision services will still be necessary unless effectiveness is 100%. However, we note that the sample size of this study, as well as the others published to date, does not allow for very precise estimation of AEs, making comparisons of AE rates difficult and the estimation of clinical effectiveness imprecise.</p><p>The PrePex procedure time required approximately one-third the time of the surgical procedure (4.8 minutes versus 14.6 minutes), which is consistent with results reported in Rwanda [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Participants in the surgical arm experienced more pain than those in the PrePex arm. Less pain during erection in the PrePex arm may be attributed to the fact that the PrePex Inner Ring diameter is designed to be larger than the measured penis sulcus.</p><p>Six weeks after surgery or device application, 87% of PrePex circumcisions healed compared to 76% of surgical circumcisions, which is a little longer than the expected range of the healing time of 4&#x02013;6 weeks after surgical circumcision in adult males [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Although surgical time and AE rates are similar between the 2 trials, in Rwanda, the surgeries were performed by a highly experienced surgeon who used the dorsal slit method rather than the forceps guided method. While the forceps-guided method is faster than the dorsal slit method and requires less skill, the latter method is likely to lead to less trauma, which could have resulted in faster healing.</p><p>Overall satisfaction with the circumcision was high at the 2-week interview and increased by 90 days, with a trend of greater increase in satisfaction in the surgery arm</p><p>The unit cost of a PrePex procedure was $8.27 less than that of surgical circumcision. These findings are similar to those reported in Rwanda [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and have important implications for rapid MC scale-up in Zimbabwe and other resource-limited settings, as PrePex circumcision can be more cost-effective than surgical circumcision. In Kenya, cost-effectiveness of the PrePex device was dependent on a number of issues, including the proportion of participants with phimosis or tight foreskins in which dorsal slit circumcision surgery would be necessary, the cost of the device and the number of ring sizes [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To be fully cost-effective, staff utilization must be also maximized and sites need to function at maximum capacity to take advantage of improvements in operator efficiency, thus achieving the best cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Zimbabwe, PrePex circumcision could potentially be done more by nurses than doctors, therefore becoming more accessible at peripheral health facilities and less costly [<xref rid="pone.0156220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The study limitations include the inadequate follow-up times for the surgical arm participants to allow for accurate assessment of the healing time, and the low participation response on satisfaction post-procedure (surgical arm: 37.5% at 2 weeks post-procedure and 63.8% at 90 days post-procedure; PrePex arm: 65% at 2 weeks post-procedure and 68.8% at 90 days post-procedure). For the cost analysis, personnel costs included were not calculated at the official government salary scale, but they approximate those used by the existing program and the rates paid during the study. If the program is scaled up based on government pay scales and no allowances are paid, the staff costs would be much lower. It is unlikely, however, that the government pay scales are sustainable over the life cycle of MC scale-up due to being very low. AE costs were excluded from the costing analysis, as insufficient data were collected to accurately calculate them. The time taken to resolve AEs was not accurately recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The trial results support previous studies&#x02019; conclusions that the PrePex procedure is safe, quick and easy to apply, effective in terms of surgical time, and cost-effective as an alternative to surgical circumcision. The PrePex device has great potential for use in overburdened health systems, in resource-limited settings, and for adult MC scale-up in Zimbabwe. However, future studies will be needed to define efficacy in regards to prevention of HIV transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156220.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist for the trial with match of questions to manuscript sections.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156220.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156220.s002"><label>S1 Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>The approved trial protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156220.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Health and Child Care for the guidance and technical support in this study and the United Nations Population Fund for funding all study requirements.</p><p>The authors would also like to thank Circ MedTech for their technical support in this study and, specifically, for the timely transportation of all PrePex devices and consumables procured.
