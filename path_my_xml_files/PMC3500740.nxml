In sports nutrition, creatine monohydrate is often combined with dextrose (a monosaccharide) for the purpose of enhanced absorption and cellular uptake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In a prospective, randomized, double blind, active-comparator-controlled, parallel group pilot study, 30 male subjects, age 27.0 &#x000b1; 4.6 years, with BMI of 24.75 &#x000b1; 1.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a body surface area (BSA) of 1.953 &#x000b1; 00.75 m<sup>2</sup>, were randomly assigned to ingest 3 grams of creatine monohydrate (CM) in combination with isomaltulose (ISO) or dextrose (DEX) in 1 of 3 concentrations (5 gm liquid, 17 gm capsules or 50 gm liquid). Rate of absorption (t<sub>Max</sub>) and overall absorption (from BSA adjusted AUC<sub>0-8h</sub> and C<sub>Max</sub>) of CM was determined via changes in serum creatine over an 8-hour test period. Blood was collected at baseline and 0.5, 1, 2.5, 4 and 8 hours post ingestion with efficacy endpoints including C<sub>Max</sub>, t<sub>Max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-8h</sub> and &#x003bb;<sub>Elim</sub> derived from normalized concentration vs. time curves for serum creatine (AUC by trapezoidal integration). Serum creatine levels were normalized by BSA using the Mosteller formula. For PK parameters, paired Student t test (or Wilcoxon if non-normally distributed) was used and for categorical variables, Fisher Exact test (or Chi-Square if necessary) was used. Statistics were calculated by <italic>R</italic> v2.14.0 (www.r-project.org).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For the 17 gm concentrations, ISO had a significantly higher C<sub>Max</sub> than DEX (18.1 &#x000b1; 1.5 vs 12 &#x000b1; 1.6 mg/dl*m<sup>2</sup>; p&#x0003c;0.001) and for the 50 gm concentrations, the C<sub>Max</sub> trended higher for ISO than DEX (19.1 &#x000b1; 6.4 vs 13.1 &#x000b1; 3.3 mg/dl*m<sup>2</sup>; p=0.099). The AUC for the 50 gm concentration was significantly higher for ISO than DEX (54.6 &#x000b1; 9.2 vs 40.3 &#x000b1; 10; p=0.046). The 17 gm (1.9 &#x000b1; 0.8 hrs) and 50 gm (1.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 hrs) concentrations were associated with larger t<sub>Max,</sub> which trended toward significance over the 5 gm concentration (1 &#x000b1; 0 hrs) for ISO (p=0.078) and was not significant for DEX. For all 3 concentrations, the C<sub>Max</sub> and AUC were significantly higher for ISO than DEX (17.8 &#x000b1; 4.7 vs 13.5 &#x000b1; 2.8 mg/dl*m<sup>2</sup> and 50.8 &#x000b1; 17.1 vs 38.8 &#x000b1; 10.3; p=0.005 and p=0.027 respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CM appears to be absorbed more efficiently when combined with ISO over DEX supported by a significantly higher C<sub>max</sub> for the 17 g concentration and a significantly higher AUC for the 50 g concentration. The 17 and 50 gm formulations appear to be superior to the 5 gm concentration. ISO appears to be a beneficial carbohydrate for facilitating the delivery of creatine to the body.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Hong Kong Life Sciences Company Limited.
