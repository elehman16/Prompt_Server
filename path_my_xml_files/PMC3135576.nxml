Moreover these points have also been demonstrated as treatment points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Sensitivity of tenderness and the number of tender points, being closely related to symptom severity can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a certain treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture treatment includes tender or trigger points known as <italic>Ah-Shi </italic>or 'Oh-Yes' for treatments of myofascial pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Studies have shown that application of acupuncture at these points improves symptoms in these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Needling points are most commonly chosen according to the anatomical structure or tenderness at the points, whereas the depth of needle penetration is determined with the consideration of the patient's sensation known as <italic>deqi </italic>and/or resistance felt by the practitioner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previously we have demonstrated that acupuncture with deeper insertion at the segmental muscle was more effective than that with shallow insertion in patients with chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the required depth and site of needle penetration have not been determined.</p><p>In general, insertion of needles on the affected muscles affected sensitized nociceptors whereas skin insertion did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Muscle containing nociceptors such as polymodal-type receptor was demonstrated to be sensitized by various factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Sensitized polymodal-type receptors in the muscle lesion caused muscle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] which was found mostly within the connective tissues of the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In particular, the fascia and/or muscle were the most sensitive deep tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most thin afferent fibers in muscle innervate polymodal-type receptors. Acupuncture stimulation at the affected muscle in myofascial pain could easily activate these receptors and consequently increase pain thresholds <italic>via </italic>internal analgesic system such as descending inhibition and/or diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs) in the brain stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, we think that acupuncture stimulation at the affected muscle may be most effective on the improvement in the pain thresholds.</p><p>The present study aims to determine whether acupuncture needling can relieve muscle pain. Effects of different depths of the needle penetration for relieving muscle pain under the DOMS model were also compared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 22 healthy volunteers (8 male and 14 female) aged between 18 and 28 years (mean 21.9 years) gave informed consent and participated in the study. All participants were recruited from the students of Meiji University of Integrative Medicine (Kyoto, Japan), in good health and not engaged in any physical training programs involving the exercise of the extensor digital muscle. At least six months after the first trial were required for a participant to be recruited again for the evaluation of the contra lateral side. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Meiji University of Integrative Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening</title><p>All participants were screened for injury or pain (<italic>eg </italic>bone fracture, bruise and/or sprain of upper arm), medication, pregnancy, hemophilia, diabetes, asthma, weight-training, intense fear of needles and participation in any similar trial within the past year. All participants were instructed to avoid any form of exercise for the duration of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Eccentric exercise</title><p>The participant sat on a chair with a movable weight (metal screw nut with a long-shaft bolt) attached to his/her third finger. The position of the weight (475 g) was adjusted such that the participant could remain the horizontal position for at least 10 seconds. The participant was asked to remain the position as long as possible. When bent 20 degrees downward at the matacarpophalangeal joint, the finger was reset to the original horizontal position manually by an investigator. This exercise was repeated until the participant was exhausted; three sets of the loaded exercises were performed with five minutes resting period. During the exercise, electromyogram (EMG) of the extensor digital muscle was monitored and displayed on an oscilloscope. Inappropriate movement by the participant during the exercise was corrected by the investigator when necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>A research assistant who was otherwise not involved in the study screened and enrolled participants at a research desk.

Pressure pain threshold (PPT) was determined as the minimum pressure (indicated as arbitrary units) that elicited the sensation of tenderness with a finger type pressure algometer (a probe of 6 mm in diameter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

A stainless steel needle electrode insulated with acrylic resin (180 &#x003bc; m in diameter, impedance 391 &#x000b1; 30 k&#x003a9; at 1 kHz; Nisin Medical Institute, Japan) was used as a cathodal monopolar stimulating electrode. The needle was inserted manually and held in a guide tube attached to skin with adhesive tape. A metal surface anodal electrode was attached to the skin 10 mm apart from the needle. Participants were requested to press the button when he felt painful sensation (pain threshold), which triggered the digital display of the stimulus current and terminates the current stimulus pulse.</p><p>Needle was inserted stepwise at 0.5-1.0 mm and measured the pain thresholds of the skin, fascia and muscle. Depth in the fascia was determined by the needling stiffness (physical resistance for the manual insertion of needle) alongside with ultrasonic echo imaging (LOGIQ&#x02122;400, GE Medical Systems, Japan).</p><p>Measurement was taken by one of the authors (YM) who had not been informed of the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental schedule</title><p>This study was designed as an observer-blinded, randomized and controlled clinical trial.

A statistically significant difference was found only between the acupuncture stimulation of muscle (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and skin (<italic>P </italic>= 0.020) groups immediately after treatment, suggesting that acupuncture stimulation of muscle is effective for DOMS.</p><p>Several studies on the efficacy of acupuncture and/or dry needling treatment for pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] indicated three important parameters, namely site, mode and intensity of the stimulation, are important for achieving efficacy of acupuncture and/or dry needling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In past studies, the stimulation sites were traditional acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; however, our recent studies suggested that the response to tenderness points, such as trigger points, could be greater than that to the traditional acupoints or non-tenderness points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, our previous trial found that needling at the tender point on the affected muscle were more effective in the treatment of neck pain than that in the non-affected muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The present study provided further evidence by demonstrating a statistically significant difference (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) between the affected muscle (segmental muscle: the extensor digital muscle) and the non-affected muscle (non- segmental muscle: the anterior tibial muscle) on pressure pain thresholds, suggesting that tender point on the affected muscle may be more effective in treatment of muscle pain than the non-affected muscle.</p><p>Furthermore, the present study demonstrated a difference among the depths on pressure pain thresholds and electrical pain thresholds. As previous studies found that the applied pressure was transmitted to the muscle tissue through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and activated muscle nociceptors responsible for pain sensation in the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the thickness and physical properties of these tissues may strongly influence the pressure transmission. Moreover, the pressure obviously excited cutaneous receptors and probably induced pain sensation in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, the origin of the pain was unclear in previous studies. On the other hand, electrical pain thresholds of skin, fascia and muscle were measured with a pulse algometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The pulse algometry used in the present study allowed us to measure deep pain threshold and selectively at different sites. Thus, the origin of the pain became clear in the present study.</p><p>Our results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>)showed that among the tested depths (5-10 mm) the acupuncture stimulation on the affected muscle at 10 mm was most effective on the improvement in the PPT and EPT. The present study was limited by its small sample size. Further studies of larger sample size are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study shows that acupuncture stimulation of muscle increases the PPT and EPT of fascia.
