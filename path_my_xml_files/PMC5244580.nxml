However, recent studies have shown that HCC patients undergoing RFA have a higher rate of local tumor progression (LTP) compared with HCC patients treated with resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Independent factors associated with LTP include tumor size, sub-capsular location, blood vessel proximity, and an insufficient ablation margin (AM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The term &#x0201c;ablative margin&#x0201d; refers to the 0.5 to 1.0-cm-wide region of normal tissue around the tumor that should ideally be removed during tumor ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, AM is one of the most important factors for the prediction of LTP in HCC patients after RFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, regular medical imaging methods, including CT, MR, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), are not able to accurately evaluate AM because the tumor and surrounding normal liver tissue mix and merge in the ablative area, and the boundary between normal tissue and the ablative area is difficult to identify. Thus, using the current imaging methods, it is challenging to determine whether the zone of ablation encompasses the range of the AM around the index tumor.</p><p>In recent years, novel medical imaging methods have been explored to assess AM in HCC patients after ablation, including CT-CT image fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], MR-MR image fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-CT/MR image fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], MR with impaired clearance of ferucarbotran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and MR with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our group has reported that CEUS-CT/MR image fusion, which can be applied intraoperatively, is useful for assessing AM in HCC patients receiving ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An accurate evaluation of AM based on CEUS-CT/MR image fusion allows physicians to perform supplementary ablation, increasing the number of adequate AM and reducing the probability of LTP. However, direct measurement of AM in HCC patients is not feasible because the gross specimen is usually unavailable in ablation patients. Therefore, the rate of LTP has been widely used as the standard to evaluate the accuracy of AM in most studies. Tumor tissues that are not covered by AM during HCC ablation are usually a major cause of LTP. However, AM is not the only independent factor associated with LTP after ablation. Therefore, the accuracy of CEUS-CT/MR image fusion in assessing AM should be further evaluated.</p><p>In this study, we established a phantom model to evaluate AM based on US-CT image fusion. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of CEUS-CT/MR image fusion for the evaluation of the AM of liver tumors, both in an in vitro phantom model and in the clinic. The gross specimen of the phantom after RFA was used as a gold standard. The clinical AM results obtained using CEUS-CT/MR image fusion and MR-MR/CT-CT image fusion were compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>The materials used to construct the phantom model included carrageenan (Dehui Marine Biological Technology Cor., Ltd., Qingdao, China) and a number of additives such as oral ultrasonic contrast agent (Hangzhou Huqingyutang Medical Technology Cor., Ltd., Hangzhou, China), gastric window contrast agent (Huqingyutang Cor., Hangzhou, China), milk, and Congo red.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Establishment of the phantom model</title><p>The phantom model included a spherical tumor model (2&#x000a0;cm in diameter, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), an AM model (a 5-mm layer of AM gel around the tumor model, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), and a cylindrical parenchyma model (10&#x000a0;cm in height and diameter, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), in which the AM model was embedded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

</p><p>Image fusion was performed by an experienced ultrasound doctor who was blinded to the ablation. A series of CT data in DICOM format were uploaded in fusion mode into the ultrasound system to automatically generate images. The areas of the tumor model and 5-mm&#x000a0;AM in the 3D CT images were outlined using red and blue circles, respectively. At the beginning of image fusion, the registration marks in the phantom models were used to choose one transverse section of the CT image and the ultrasound image of the same section. The CT and ultrasound images were then overlapped and fused. After registration of this section, additional fine tuning was performed to enable a more precise adaptation. The distance between the CT and ultrasound images of the same registration mark in overlapping mode could be measured and used as the error of image fusion. A successful image fusion was defined when the error of image fusion of all registration marks was less than 2&#x000a0;mm. Otherwise, the registration was repeated. The image fusion was considered a failure if a successful fusion could not be achieved after three attempts. In overlapping mode, inclusion of the tumor within the ablative area of the model and the AM mode could be decided. The position and thickness of the thickest part of the AM model was recorded if the AM was not completely covered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A-2, B-2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Evaluation of the AM in the gross specimen</title><p>The phantom was cut along the section showing the thickest residue in the AM model by image fusion.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>Phantoms have been widely used to evaluate the effects of thermal treatments. Previous studies, however, have mainly focused on other topics, such as temperature monitoring, energy distribution, the relationship between RF and electrical conductivity, and development of the heating algorithm applied in drug delivery. It is not clear whether phantoms are good models for the evaluation of AM using a CEUS-CT/MR image fusion system. Therefore, in the present study, we established a phantom model to evaluate AM using CEUS-CT/MR image fusion. In our study, we found that the peculiarly thermal invertibility and thermal sensitivity of the carrageenan gel were useful for distinguishing the ablative zone, the remaining &#x02018;tumor&#x02019;, and the AM after RFA. While the carrageenan hybrid gel used in the present study was not the best material for the evaluation of thermal ablation, especially for temperature variation and energy distribution, we took full advantage of the physical properties of the carrageenan gel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to assess the accuracy of the evaluation of complete RF using an image fusion system that matched pre-RFA and post-RFA images in a tissue-mimicking phantom.</p><p>We developed a hybrid gel phantom using carrageenan and other substances, which have a number of important properties, i.e., sufficient strength, low fragility, and low cost. Carrageenan, a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide extracted from red algae, consists of repeating galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose units linked by alternating &#x003b1;-1,3- and &#x003b2;-1,4-glycosidic linkages. Carrageenan can be used in a phantom model because it is inexpensive and safe, as well as broadly applied for the production of gel products and other foods. Additive agents played significant roles in the construction, imaging, and observation by the naked eye. For example, NaCl was added to the carrageenan gels to adjust the gel conductivity. US contrast agent and iodipin were used to improve the echo or to enhance attenuation. In addition, Congo red, an indicator used for the diagnosis of amyloidosis by generating a bright and distinct red color, was easily distinguished from the opaque gel. The red color may have infiltrated the peripheral gel due to the diffusion of Congo red. However, we believe that Congo red has no influence on the results of the AM evaluation if the whole procedure, including manufacturing, RFA, and assessment of the ablative zone, is completed within 6&#x000a0;h. Using carrageenan together with other substances, we were able to create a large and robust phantom model with excellent shape retention. The turbidity and low fragility of the carrageenan gel in the phantom model ensured accurate image registration. In addition, we designed a phantom that mimicked the tumor lesion (i.e., a visible sphere) to assess the AM using the fusion imaging system after RF. The easy heating and coagulation of the phantom model allowed us to assess the post-RFA destructive zone more accurately. Improved visualization of the target by US and CT, as well as the distinct color of the materials, also improved the ablation assessment. Therefore, the phantom model established herein was successfully used for the evaluation of the AM of the HCC tumor.</p><p>The present experimental study results suggest that the US-CT fusion image system can be used to accurately and effectively evaluate AM. However, in one case, US-CT image fusion revealed that the AM was completely covered by the ablative area, and even less than a 1-mm&#x000a0;AM was observed in the gross specimen. The false-positive case could be caused by registration error and magnetic positioning system error. Given that the phantom model was idealized to evaluate AM, the feasibility and accuracy was further validated in a clinical assessment.</p><p>In our clinical study, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CEUS-CT/MR image fusion for the evaluation of AM were 100.0, 80.0 and 90.0%, respectively, suggesting that CEUS-CT/MR image fusion is a good tool for evaluating AM after HCC ablation. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion combines the advantages of CEUS and CT/MR and expands the use of both imaging methods, including the high spatial contrast resolution of CT/MR and real-time guidance, accessibility, and practicality of ultrasound. In addition, CEUS-CT/MR image fusion greatly improves intraoperative AM evaluation and the localization of tumor lesions compared with MR-MR image fusion.</p><p>We discovered three false-positive cases in the clinical study, which might be due to the ability of CEUS to only demonstrate blood perfusion of tissues rather than necrosis. The high temperature of the local zone of ablation may cause swollen tissues and small vessel occlusion, limiting the infiltration of blood into the ablated area. However, occluded small vessels can be reperfused after the local tissue temperature decreases, suggesting that the ablation zone may be over-measured by intraoperative CEUS.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. First, the phantom model cannot completely mimic dynamic tissues and organs, such as respiratory movements, which may reduce the accuracy of the registration for image fusion and affect the imaging assessment. While the assessment was performed successfully in the idealized phantom model, some unknown problems may be present in the in vivo experiments, which must be identified and resolved. Second, the phantom models applied in the present study were used for US-CT image fusion, whereas most of the clinical cases were evaluated by CEUS-CT/MR image fusion. Thus, the accuracy of the results may be biased. Third, all of the patients enrolled in this study were male, which may also bias the results. Therefore, further studies with more experience, a larger sampling size and better technology are needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we successfully established a phantom model for the evaluation of AM using US-CT/MR image fusion. Our results suggest that US-CT/MR image fusion is an accurate approach for evaluating AM after tumor ablation based on both an in vitro model and a clinical study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AM</term><def><p>Ablative margin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEUS</term><def><p>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTP</term><def><p>Local tumor progression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFA</term><def><p>Radiofrequency ablation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all participating clinicians and general practitioners.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
