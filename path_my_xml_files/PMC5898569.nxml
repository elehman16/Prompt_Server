Secondary aims are to determine whether there are: 1) differential changes in depressive symptoms (cognitive, somatic and affective); 2) persistence of treatment effects over 24 weeks (from recruitment) and any consequences of delaying treatment; 3) changes in anxiety symptoms; and 4) associations between changes in depression symptoms and program adherence, as well as changes in physical fitness, psychological and blood biomarker measures. It is hypothesised that the exercise program will improve overall depression severity scores in the intervention group relative to the control group, differentially effect depressive symptom subscales, and that these benefits will persist at follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0030">This is an assessor blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining efficacy and differential depressive symptom effects of an integrated MI and multi-modal exercise intervention in youth with MDD.

The trainers were provided with a copy of the MI intervention protocol to allow additional practice of skills before their first MI session with a participant. Following the training, PTs received two, 1-h, individualised coaching sessions with the psychologist who provided the training. With verbal permission from the participants, PTs were asked to record all of their MI sessions using a specifically provided, digital audio recorder.

Participants exercised in supervised small groups (3&#x02013;5 people) three times per week for 1&#x000a0;h. The structured exercise training protocol included resistance training for the development of local muscular strength, endurance and power and aerobic exercise for the development of cardiorespiratory fitness (aerobic fitness) across 4 blocks of progressive intensity (A, B, C and D), and adhered to National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In novices, progressive resistance training provides a form of exercise where progressive improvements are almost always observed, and this provides positive feedback about accomplishments to participants. Resistance training was monitored throughout the intervention period by recording work (sets x repetitions x load) performed at each session. For the resistance training component different blocks involved different types of exercises. This included leg press, leg curl, calf raise, leg extension, shoulder press, chest press, seated row, lat pull down, tricep push down, bicep curl, bench press, back extension, plank holds, bench squats, static lunges, dumbbell flys, dumbbell single arm pull, push ups, hammer curl, assisted chin ups, squat press, kettle bell swings, walking lunges, medicine ball slam/sprawl, bar bell overhead press, and supine pull up.</p><p id="p0270">The aerobic exercise component incorporated interval training on cardio equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, recumbent bikes, cross trainers, step machines, rowing machines. Aerobic conditioning was monitored using heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) for each session and the duration of each session. High intensity interval training (HIIT) was offered in block D to maximise improvement in aerobic fitness. Target heart rates were determined during initial exercise testing and used to maintain the relative intensity of activity over the training period. Heart rates were monitored using the heart rate monitors on the gym equipment and via a Polar team monitoring system interfaced to an iPad while performing resistance exercise. Ratings of perceived exertion for the session were recorded at the end of each exercise session by the PT.</p><p id="p0275">Throughout the 12-week exercise intervention participants were asked to wear a pedometer each day and to record their steps in the daily online monitoring questionnaire. Step counts were measured using the Yamax SW200 pedometers (Yamax Corporation, Kumamoto City, Japan). The pedometers were provided to participants at their first personal training session and they were instructed on how to wear them (remove when sleeping, showering or swimming) and record their step counts using the daily online monitoring survey. Participants were encouraged to engage in some form of physical activity (walking, cycling, swimming etc.) on their non-group supervised exercise days. To help facilitate this, participants received a free, unlimited 12-week gym membership at the University Sports Centre with access to the pool and a range of exercise classes in addition to their supervised training during the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec id="sec2.5.1"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="p0280">A sample size calculation was performed on the primary outcome measure of change in depression severity.

We will use multiple imputation to address any key missing data and, where appropriate, undertake sensitivity analyses comparing imputed and non-imputed data sets. Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat equivalent analysis strategy to investigate change in outcome measures pre-to post-treatment and to assess the dosage effect of exercise participation on reductions in symptom severity across time points. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics will be compared across the two groups. Participant baseline psychological, physiological and biological characteristics will be presented using descriptive statistics stratified by overall depression severity (mild/moderate versus severe). The primary statistical analyses will utilise generalised linear mixed models, and specifically generalised estimating equations (GEE), for examining both initial treatment effects (efficacy analyses) and the persistence of treatment effects across time points. This analysis strategy will use all available data for each participant, whilst accounting for individual variation (i.e., within-subject effects) and the cross-over aspects of the design. Planned comparisons will be used to examine change across assessment time points (baseline, 6 weeks, post-treatment, follow-up). We will also examine relationships between program engagement (e.g., session attendance and concurrent physical activity monitoring) and changes in depression symptoms in the combined post-treatment data. The significance level for all tests has been set at <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.01 to partially control for potential Type 1 errors associated with multiple comparisons, with statistical trends also noted at <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.05; this is the equivalent of a Bonferroni-adjusted family-wise error rate with 5 members per family (e.g., depression diagnosis, overall depression severity and cognitive, somatic and affective depressive symptom subscales).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Recruitment patterns</title><p id="p0290">Participants were recruited across three waves over a 2.5-year period from community, clinical and University settings (Wave 1: June to September 2013; Wave 2: February to October 2014; and Wave 3: February to October 2015). Recruitment was set to coincide with the start of school terms or University semesters and to finish before the end of year breaks when participants or families could be away on holidays. Across the three recruitment waves, there were 162 initial enquiries of 70, 56 and 36 respectively, with 131 participants confirming interest and participating in an initial phone screen.

Prevalence rates are as high as one in five young people experiencing MDD before their 18th birthday <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> with many receiving limited or no treatment <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Several decades of research suggest exercise offers physical and psychological health benefits which extend to the treatment of depression, either as an adjunctive or stand-alone treatment <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However, at this stage, the mechanisms of action are unclear, with researchers proposing both biological and psychological explanations for treatment effects <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. It is also not clear if treatment effects extend to younger age groups as the vast majority of efficacy trials have focused on adult and older populations. Promisingly, there have been a number of recent studies which suggest exercise may benefit young people, but, existing research is limited by methodological issues such as the use of non-clinical samples and an overreliance on self-report measures <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0305">One unique aspect of this trial is the use of a combined exercise intervention, which incorporates both aerobic and resistance training exercise. A recent review <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> strongly supports the use of aerobic exercise interventions as treatment for depression in adults but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of resistance training or combined (multi-modal) exercise interventions. We chose a multi-modal intervention on the basis that it may have wider appeal to young people, and that the short-term gains in performance common when commencing resistance training may be encouraging and help maintain motivation.</p><p id="p0310">High rates of non-compliance are commonly reported in exercise trials among individuals with severe depressive symptoms and this constrains research seeking to determine the efficacy of exercise for depression <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Individuals with depression are less likely to engage in exercise and report lower intention to exercise and reduced self-efficacy compared with non-depressed individuals <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Symptom barriers such as motivational deficits <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> and somatic complaints may present additional constraints. To benefit from an exercise program, individuals need to be able to move beyond symptom barriers to engage in exercise on a frequent basis for a period of time <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Strategies which enhance intention to exercise, address exercise barriers and help generate coping skills may help increase exercise compliance <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Previous research has sought to increase compliance to exercise by using health education, with variable success. Other strategies have included goal setting, self-monitoring, enhancing social support, and modifying cognitions during exercise <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>.</p><p id="p0315">The current trial offers a unique contribution to existing research investigating efficacy of exercise in youth with MDD by addressing treatment engagement to help improve the outcomes of an exercise intervention among young people with a MDD. Our study seeks to determine if a single session of MI delivered as a pre-exercise intervention strategy increases engagement and improves the outcomes of an exercise intervention among young people with a MDD. The trial builds on previous pilot work conducted by the same research team, which integrated MI delivered by a psychologist with a multi-modal exercise training intervention delivered by a PT among youth diagnosed with MDD. In the current trial, a PT delivered both the MI and exercise intervention to the young person to help develop a collaborative and supportive environment to increase treatment engagement and retention.</p><p id="p0320">This study will also add to our understanding of any differential effects of exercise on depressive symptom profiles and their relationship to cognitive, behavioural and biological factors. At this stage, little is known about how exercise targets depressive symptom domains in young people with depression. Preliminary results from our pilot study suggests exercise differentially targets depressive symptoms with largest overall improvement observed in the affective subscale followed by cognitive and somatic subscales <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Different depressive symptoms may show different response rates to exercise and understanding this may offer important insights into the potential mechanisms of action of exercise on mind, body and behaviour. Similarly, a closer examination of relationship between depression and depressive symptom subscales and exercise adherence will improve our understanding of the dose response relationship between exercise and depression. Exploring relationships between changes in cognitive variables such as automatic thoughts, dysfunctional attitudes, behavioural activation and somatic symptoms will also help build our understanding of the specific effects of exercise. Biomarkers such as markers of inflammation and BDNF are increasingly associated with depression and inclusion of these indices is another strength of the study.</p><p id="p0325">Our trial includes an objective assessment of depression with a current clinical diagnosis of MDD addressing a key methodological constraint of previous research. We targeted recruitment of participants with varied depressive severity levels and our pragmatic design allowed young people who were currently exercising or receiving treatment to participate, increasing the generalisability of results to real-world clinical practice. We successfully recruited 68 participants across three waves and our recruitment strategy maximised youth participation in the study by actively recruiting during school or study terms to mitigate against the adverse impact of holiday disruptions.</p><p id="p0330">Despite these strengths, there are a number of important limitations to this study. This includes potential bias, due to the 2.5 year time period over which the sample was recruited, to enable recruitment during school or study terms to mitigate against the impact of holiday disruptions. However, our results suggest that participant characteristics such as age and gender were similarly represented across waves minimising potential recruitment bias. It also highlighted the importance of considering family support and engagement in treatment when recruiting youth into exercise studies, where an ongoing commitment is also required from family members to support the young person in treatment (e.g. transportation to and from the training venue). To enhance treatment engagement, the MI intervention was integrated with exercise; however, a study design incorporating assessment of a third group who do not receive the MI component is required to further delineate the relative effects of MI on exercise engagement. Further, our study recruited young people with current MDD, some of whom were experiencing severe depressive symptoms and were at risk of imminent suicide. Notably almost two thirds of our recruited participants; disproportionately females, reported depression severity rates that fell into the severe range. Ensuring we were appropriately assessing suicide risk and linking young people to appropriate youth mental health services required careful consideration. The development of our suicide risk protocols from the first point of phone contact helped identify and support young people who were at risk of harm; however, it also increased the time required to conduct the initial phone screens, as depression is often associated with suicidal ideation. Similarly, the psychological evaluations also incorporated a detailed suicide risk assessment and were often time intensive. Despite these challenges, this work was an essential part of the study in order to ensure the safety of the young people who approached researchers as part of recruitment to the trial.</p><p id="p0335">Although closely monitored, our pragmatic study design did not exclude participants who were currently participating in some form of physical activity or treatment for their depression, as we aimed to establish adjunctive exercise benefits for this age group and increase generalisability of findings. However, the synergistic effects of combined treatment effects cannot be ruled out. As a final point, given the limited number of youth efficacy trials in this field, our research sought to investigate the effects of the intervention from a psychological, physiological and biological perspective. This will help increase our understanding of specific treatment effects not only as they relate to depression diagnosis and severity but also by helping to identify specific information about how exercise targets depression symptom domains, the impact of exercise on other outcomes of interest, and how these characteristics interrelate to moderate or mediate treatment outcomes. However, to do this required extensive assessments and may have increased participant burden and reduced study acceptability, contributing to the longer time required for recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0340">Given the limitations and accessibility of current psychological and pharmacotherapy treatment approaches, there is an urgent need to extend treatment options for youth with MDD. Data from this trial will provide additional information about the efficacy of an integrated MI and exercise intervention for the treatment of depression in youth, both in the short-term (post-treatment) and longer-term (three month follow-up) across both groups. It will contribute to our understanding of differential effects of exercise on depressive symptom profiles and their relationship to cognitive, behavioural and biological factors. This will help increase our understanding of the benefits of exercise across psychological, physiological, biological domains and determine the relative merits of exercise for treating depressive symptoms, which may be helpful to treating professionals and their young patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0345">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0350">This work was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Hunter Medical Research Institute</funding-source> (HMRI) and Beyond Blue.
