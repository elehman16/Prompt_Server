Progression of the disease, if not abated, may lead to the erosive loss of bone and cartilage in affected joints and subsequent physical disability. The early inclusion of effective therapies aimed at tight control of disease activity minimizes the risk of irreversible erosive damage [<xref rid="ket465-B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref>].</p><p>International recommendations suggest treatment initiation with MTX administered as monotherapy, which, in the event of an inadequate response, can then be supplemented with or switched to additional synthetic DMARDs or a biologic agent [<xref rid="ket465-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Patients at risk for aggressive disease (e.g. those with autoantibody positivity, early erosive damage, etc.) may benefit from the early inclusion of a biologic agent, such as a TNF inhibitor, as a biologic combination with MTX suppresses inflammation and halts erosive damage more effectively than the addition of synthetic DMARDs [<xref rid="ket465-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In fact, high disease activity along with the presence of risk factors may warrant the immediate inclusion of a TNF antagonist in the treatment regimen [<xref rid="ket465-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], given the relatively narrow window during which aggressive disease may be halted. Western trials of biologic agents have compared initial combination therapy <italic>vs</italic> initial MTX monotherapy in such patient populations [<xref rid="ket465-B8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref>], however, studies in Eastern populations are lacking, where environmental, genetic and medical and/or disease management differences may impact drug effectiveness and tolerability.</p><p>The combination of adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-&#x003b1;, with MTX has been shown in global clinical trials to significantly reduce disease activity, improve physical function and prevent structural damage more effectively than MTX monotherapy in MTX-naive patients with early RA and high disease activity [<xref rid="ket465-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The HOPEFUL-1 trial (adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, outcome study for the persistent efficacy under allocation to treatment strategies in early RA) was conducted to assess the effect of adalimumab in combination with MTX <italic>vs</italic> MTX alone as a first-line therapy in Japanese patients not previously treated with MTX who had high disease activity and risk factors for aggressive disease. The trial consisted of a 26-week randomized controlled period (adalimumab + MTX <italic>vs</italic> placebo + MTX) followed by a 26-week open-label (OL) period (OL adalimumab + MTX). Adalimumab in combination with MTX was superior to placebo + MTX during the 26-week blinded period [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; the current post hoc analysis assessed whether there was continued separation between the treatment strategies through week 52 (i.e. 26 weeks after all patients began receiving combination therapy).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Adult patients &#x02265;20 years of age with active RA, as defined by the 1987 revised ACR criteria [<xref rid="ket465-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], of &#x0003c;2 years duration and not previously treated with MTX were eligible for enrolment in this study. In addition, patients were required to have at least 10 tender joints (of 68 assessed), 8 swollen joints (of 66 assessed), CRP &#x02265;1.5 mg/dl or ESR &#x02265;28 mm/hour and at least one joint erosion (JE) or RF positivity. Exclusion criteria included prior exposure to more than two DMARDs, previous treatment with CYC, ciclosporin, AZA, tacrolimus or biologic DMARDs, and patients with a chronic infection, interstitial pneumonia or a history of tuberculosis or malignancy. The study was conducted with the approval of the study site ethical review boards and in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki; all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This phase 3 trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00870467 [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) was conducted at 94 centres in Japan from 11 April 2009 through 1 August 2011 and consisted of two periods. During the first period (blinded period), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week + weekly MTX (initiated at 6 mg/week) or placebo every other week + weekly MTX for the first 26 weeks. The dose of MTX could be increased to 8 mg/week at week 8 if a &#x02265;20% improvement in the tender or swollen joint count from baseline was not achieved or at the discretion of the investigator, except in the case of a safety concern. Reduction of MTX to 4 mg/week was also permitted and at the discretion of the investigator. For ethical reasons, patients were eligible to be rescued with OL adalimumab + MTX if they experienced a &#x02265;20% increase from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts at week 12, 16 or 20 (rescue period). Patients completing 26 weeks of study drug, either during the blinded or rescue period, were eligible to receive OL adalimumab + MTX for an additional 26 weeks (OL period)<italic>.</italic></p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS) from baseline to week 26. Details of the scoring of radiographs as well as the results of the primary endpoint have been described [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, 22 and 20 bilateral joints of the hands, wrists and feet were scored for JE and joint space narrowing, respectively, the sum representing the mTSS [<xref rid="ket465-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Radiographs were read by two independent radiologists blinded to time, treatment and sequence at baseline, rescue (if necessary), week 26, and week 52, or at early termination. Clinical assessments included the 28-joint DAS with ESR (DAS28-ESR), the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI). These assessments are composite measures of disease activity and may include tender and swollen joint counts, acute phase reactants (CRP or ESR), patient&#x02019;s global health on a visual analogue scale (VAS), patient&#x02019;s global assessment on a VAS and/or physician&#x02019;s global assessment on a VAS. Physical function was assessed through the disability index of the HAQ (HAQ-DI). Effectiveness measures for this post hoc analysis included the change from baseline to week 52 in DAS28-ESR and mTSS, the proportions of patients in DAS28-ESR remission (&#x0003c;2.6), with low disease activity (&#x02265;2.6 to &#x0003c;3.2), with moderate disease activity (&#x02265;3.2 to &#x02264;5.1) or with high disease activity (&#x0003e;5.1), the proportions of patients achieving various definitions of clinical remission [SDAI &#x02264;3.3, CDAI &#x02264;2.8, Boolean (TJC &#x02264;1, SJC &#x02264;1, CRP &#x02264;1 and patient&#x02019;s global assessment &#x02264;10 on a 100-mm VAS)] and functional (HAQ-DI &#x0003c;0.5) remission, the proportions of patients without radiographic progression (defined as &#x00394;mTSS &#x02264;0.5) from baseline to week 52, as well as the proportions of patients experiencing clinically relevant radiographic progression (&#x00394;mTSS &#x0003e;3).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed throughout exposure to adalimumab + MTX. AEs of interest were summarized on the basis of initial treatment assignment (adalimumab + MTX or placebo + MTX) as both the number of events and events per 100 patient-years (E/100 PY). AEs were coded using Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) version 13.1. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as any event with an onset date on or after the first dose of adalimumab + MTX and up to 70 days after the last dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>This post hoc analysis included data from the per protocol set (PPS), which excluded all patients with a major protocol violation. All analyses are based on the initial treatment assignment (adalimumab + MTX or placebo + MTX) and included patients entering into the OL period following completion of the blinded or rescue period. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for discrete and continuous variables, respectively. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used to impute missing data. LOCF was used for the analysis of radiographic progression to avoid the overestimation of mTSS in the control group. The last value during the blinded period was carried forward for those patients who entered into the rescue period but did not enter into the OL period. The safety analysis set included all patients receiving at least one dose of adalimumab + MTX.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 333 patients initially randomized, 155 and 151 completed 26 weeks of therapy from the initial adalimumab + MTX and placebo + MTX groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket465-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of these, 10 patients from the adalimumab + MTX group and 24 patients from the placebo + MTX group completed the 26-week study following receipt of OL adalimumab + MTX rescue therapy. A total of 152 patients from the initial adalimumab + MTX and 150 patients from the initial placebo + MTX group entered into the OL period, with 137 and 141, respectively, completing the 52-week study. Withdrawal of consent appeared to be the primary reason for discontinuation in the OL period.

Additionally, 26 weeks of OL adalimumab + MTX therapy in the initial placebo + MTX group led to a shift in the distribution of patients in the varying levels of disease activity (remission, low, moderate or high disease activity) such that the balance at week 52 was comparable with those who received adalimumab + MTX throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket465-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B). Furthermore, differences that were apparent between treatment groups at week 26 in the proportions of patients achieving additional composite measures of clinical or functional remission were less striking following an additional 26 weeks of OL adalimumab + MTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket465-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B and C).

The majority of patients experienced at least one AE during exposure to adalimumab + MTX, although relatively few (&#x0223c;22%) were considered to be at least possibly related to the study drug; additionally, AEs described as serious or severe were rare (&#x0223c;2%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ket465-T2">Table 2</xref>). Throughout the study there were 305 infectious AEs reported, the most common being nasopharyngitis occurring in 29.8% of patients. Almost half of patients who experienced infectious AEs were assessed as probably or possibly related to adalimumab. A total of eight patients experienced nine serious infections during the course of the study. Serious infections included five cases of pneumonia reported in four patients, two cases of gastroenteritis, and one case each of bronchopneumonia and enteritis infectious. Five serious infections (3.3 E/100 PY) occurred in patients who received adalimumab + MTX throughout the study and four serious infections (5.1 E/100 PY) occurred in patients who received OL adalimumab + MTX only during the OL period. Hepatic and haematological events were relatively mild in severity and rare in frequency. Some elevations in liver function test levels were observed &#x0003e;2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Increased alanine aminotransferase was observed in 8.6% of patients, abnormal hepatic function in 7.4% and increased aspartate aminotransferase in 6.7%. A 55-year-old female who received initial adalimumab + MTX developed lupus-like syndrome and discontinued therapy at day 182 (week 26). There were no malignancies, tuberculosis, demyelinating disease or deaths during exposure to adalimumab + MTX.

Hence early intervention with effective therapy capable of suppressing inflammation and preventing disease progression is the cornerstone of disease management [<xref rid="ket465-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. MTX is considered to be an anchor drug for the treatment of RA and international organizations recommend an initial trial of MTX for a duration of 3&#x02013;6 months prior to treatment escalation to a biologic DMARD (e.g. TNF inhibitor) [<xref rid="ket465-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For patients at greatest risk for disease progression, delaying the addition of a TNF inhibitor by 2 years can impact long-term outcomes [<xref rid="ket465-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Whether an MTX trial of more limited duration (e.g. 3&#x02013;6 months) is associated with suboptimal outcomes remains unclear.</p><p>The HOPEFUL-1 trial was designed to evaluate the 52-week clinical, functional and radiographic effectiveness of initial treatment with adalimumab + MTX <italic>vs</italic> adalimumab addition following up to 26 weeks of treatment with placebo + MTX in Japanese patients with early, aggressive RA not previously treated with MTX. Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for a panel of clinical, functional and radiographic endpoints following 26 weeks of blinded therapy [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Differences between treatment groups in clinical and functional parameters disappeared rapidly following the addition of OL adalimumab + MTX at week 26, with comparable levels of disease activity observed within 8 weeks of OL adalimumab addition. Despite slowed radiographic progression upon OL adalimumab + MTX treatment, significant structural damage accumulated in many patients exposed to 26 weeks of placebo + MTX [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], resulting in more severe progression in the initial placebo + MTX group that could not be completely reversed upon switching to adalimumab + MTX.</p><p>During the blinded period (the first 26 weeks) of this study, inflammation persisted to a greater extent in those who received placebo + MTX <italic>vs</italic> adalimumab + MTX [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The addition of adalimumab + MTX led to a rapid suppression of inflammation, irrespective of whether treatment was initiated with combination therapy or whether a 26-week trial of placebo + MTX was administered. Over the short term, the persistence of elevated disease activity experienced by those in the placebo + MTX group did not appear to translate into a functional difference, as the proportions of patients achieving a state of normal function at week 52 were not different between the two treatment strategies. However, other measures of mental/physical ability and productivity were not assessed in the current analysis, and the possibility remains that long-term advantages to the early adoption of adalimumab + MTX exist in this capacity. In contrast, quantitative differences in the accumulation of structural damage persisted through 52 weeks, despite all patients receiving OL adalimumab + MTX after week 26. This observation underscores the irreversible nature of erosive bone and cartilage loss present in RA patients. Unique to this trial was the prevalence of significant damage accumulation over a relatively short timeframe [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a phenomenon not seen in recent clinical trials of MTX-naive populations [<xref rid="ket465-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and rather more consistent with observations from the PREMIER trial [<xref rid="ket465-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Typically, mean &#x00394;mTSS values are driven by relatively few patients who accumulate significant damage over time, with the remainder of the population experiencing little, if any, damage. Although this was true for HOPEFUL-1, more than one third of patients in the initial placebo + MTX group experienced clinically relevant progression through week 52. Identifying those patients most at risk for damage accumulation continues to be challenging, as the reliability of prediction models that accurately classify patients based on pre-treatment characteristics is relatively poor [<xref rid="ket465-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ket465-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study population, an abnormal CRP baseline value was identified as an important predictor of damage accumulation in MTX-treated patients [<xref rid="ket465-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expanded analyses combining baseline characteristics with genetic/biologic markers are needed to increase the accuracy that outcomes can be predicted.</p><p>Adalimumab + MTX treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported studies of Japanese RA patients and consistent with global trials of TNF inhibitors in combination with MTX.</p><p>As with all studies, important limitations exist. At the time the study was conducted, the maximum approved dose of MTX was 8 mg/week and MTX was not allowed as the first-line DMARD in Japanese patients with RA. In 2011 the maximum approved MTX dose was increased to 16 mg/week and was also allowed to be prescribed as a first-line DMARD. Therefore the possibility exists that more aggressive MTX doses, typically used in western trials, may have more adequately limited progression of structural damage than the lower doses used in this study, although clinical trial data supporting the optimal dose of MTX in combination with TNF inhibitors is lacking. In addition to a lower allowable dose of MTX, the average weight of the studied Japanese population differentiates this study from other global adalimumab studies. Despite a lower mg/kg MTX dosing, clinical and radiographic outcomes of adalimumab + MTX were robust, indicating that lower doses of MTX in combination with adalimumab are capable of significantly reducing the signs and symptoms of RA.</p><p>Another important limitation is that the therapeutic regimen of the initial placebo + MTX group was switched to OL adalimumab + MTX at week 26 for all patients regardless of whether a good response was observed during the blinded period. Switching only those patients with an inadequate response to initial placebo + MTX may have yielded a better approximation of the harm of delayed adalimumab + MTX therapy, as was performed in the OPTIMA trial [<xref rid="ket465-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, this analysis pooled patients who received rescue adalimumab + MTX therapy with those who were able to tolerate 26 weeks of placebo + MTX. Lastly, the relatively short follow-up time precluded long-term analysis of the socio-economic impacts and perhaps unique long-term benefit/risk profiles associated with the different treatment strategies for this population.</p><p>While the addition of OL adalimumab + MTX following the blinded period was able to improve clinical and functional outcomes comparable to patients initiated on combination therapy, undeniable benefits pertaining to the prevention of radiographic progression and associated joint damage exist. Early intervention with adalimumab + MTX is important to minimize irreversible structural damage in many Japanese patients with early, aggressive RA not previously treated with MTX.</p><p><boxed-text id="ket465-BOX1" position="float"><caption><title>Rheumatology key messages</title></caption><p>
