Attention is increasingly directed toward the optimization of perioperative management to reduce complications and enhance postoperative recovery. Currently, two different strategies for postoperative pain management after pancreatoduodenectomy are being routinely used: patient-controlled intravenous analgesia and thoracic epidural analgesia.

A total of 370 patients scheduled for elective pancreatoduodenectomy will be randomized after giving written informed consent, and 278 patients are needed for analysis.

The group A intervention includes intraoperative general anesthesia and postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia; the group B intervention comprises combined intraoperative general anesthesia and epidural analgesia with postoperative epidural analgesia. The primary endpoint of this trial is a composite of the gastrointestinal complications (delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, biliary leak, gastrointestinal bleeding, and postoperative ileus) up to postoperative day 30.

However, even specialized centers with highly standardized surgical techniques still report morbidity rates of up to 50&#x000a0;%, mainly due to gastrointestinal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As one of the most important complications, postoperative pancreatic fistula can lead to further adverse effects such as erosion bleeding, intra-abdominal abscess, or sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With regard to patient outcome after pancreatoduodenectomy, the recently published RecoPanc trial (DRKS00000767) compared pancreatogastrostomy with pancreatojejunostomy and showed no significant difference in the rate of pancreatic fistula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Along with the constant refinement of surgical technique during the past two decades, increasing attention is now being directed toward the optimization of perioperative management to reduce complications and enhance postoperative recovery.</p><p>The most common strategies for effective perioperative pain management in major abdominal surgery are patient-controlled intravenous opioid analgesia (IV-PCA) and epidural analgesia (EDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A retrospective study of perioperative pain management strategies in pancreatic surgery published in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found that EDA with additional intravenous analgesia was associated with a lower occurrence of postoperative gastrointestinal and infectious complications than EDA alone. The aim of the trial described here is to verify this association in a multicenter RCT.</p><p>EDA is usually achieved by combined injection of local anesthetics and opioids into the epidural space. This inhibits neural transmission and induces analgesia. Additionally, the action of the sympathetic nervous system is lessened, and vasodilation is provoked. Major abdominal surgery frequently entails large volume shifts and significant blood losses. Some evidence exists that EDA provokes hemodynamic instability in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Typically, vasopressors and large amounts of fluids are administered to counteract undesirable hypotension. These interventions may affect the healing of gastrointestinal anastomoses in a negative manner and possibly increase the incidence of complications such as anastomotic insufficiency. A prospective study identified hypotension during abdominal surgery as a significant risk factor for postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, greater intraoperative fluid administration resulted in more pancreatic anastomotic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pratt et al. showed a significant decrease of 15&#x000a0;% in gastrointestinal complications for patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with postoperative intravenous analgesia versus thoracic EDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although thoracic EDA is effective in pain control, its possible adverse effects on postoperative recovery of patients after pancreatoduodenectomy may represent a major disadvantage. Perioperative pain management with IV-PCA may reduce the individual risk of postoperative complications. The PAKMAN trial will establish whether IV-PCA is able to improve patients&#x02019; surgical outcomes compared with EDA, thereby potentially changing medical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial rationale</title><p>The aim of this pragmatic (effectiveness) trial is the comparison of two different perioperative pain-management strategies in pancreatic surgery with regard to gastrointestinal complications up to postoperative day (POD) 30. We postulate that the healing of anastomoses may be compromised by the increased intraoperative administration of vasopressors and intravenous fluids due to the vasodilatory effect of EDA. The primary objective of the trial is to investigate whether the frequency of the composite primary endpoint of gastrointestinal complications (delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, biliary leak, gastrointestinal bleeding, or postoperative ileus) following pancreatoduodenectomy could be reduced by 15&#x000a0;% by postoperative IV-PCA compared with thoracic EDA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>PAKMAN is an investigator-initiated, adaptive, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label, superiority trial with two parallel study groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility criteria for participating trial centers</title><p>Established trial infrastructures from previously conducted multicenter trials (DISPACT and RecoPanc) will be used for the PAKMAN trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Eight German (Dresden, Freiburg, Giessen, Heidelberg, L&#x000fc;beck, Munich LMU, Stuttgart, and T&#x000fc;bingen), and three other European (Liverpool, Ljubljana, and Verona) high-volume centers with broad expertise in pancreatic surgery will be included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All patients scheduled for elective pancreatoduodenectomy at one of the participating centers will be screened consecutively for eligibility and will be informed about the PAKMAN trial during a pretreatment visit or on the day of admission to the hospital. All subjects must be able to understand the nature and potential individual consequences of the clinical trial, and only adult patients (&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years of age) who provide written informed consent will be included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with chronic pancreatitis and patients with chronic pain syndrome for any reason will not be admitted to the PAKMAN trial because of possible pre-existing pain and tolerance to pain medication. Moreover, patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, stage&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;III according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;IV will be excluded. Furthermore, the presence of contraindication(s) to the use of IV-PCA or EDA (e.g., coagulopathies or allergies), participation in another intervention trial that interferes with the intervention or outcome of this trial, impaired mental state, or language problems will also prohibit inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Subject withdrawal criteria</title><p>Subjects may be withdrawn from the trial at their own request or if a pancreatoduodenectomy is not performed (e.g., because of technical irresectability or metastatic disease). Withdrawn patients will be included in the final report of the trial to ensure complete transparency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pancreatoduodenectomy</title><p>The pancreatoduodenectomy may be performed as a classical, pylorus-preserving, or pylorus-resecting Whipple procedure. Furthermore, partial resection of the portal or superior mesenteric vein is allowed. Pancreatic anastomosis may be performed according to the local standard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Description of trial interventions</title><p>All surgeons and anesthetists who participate in the PAKMAN trial will receive instructions on which treatment procedures are applicable to the two groups. Due to the nature of a pragmatic trial with only a few exclusion criteria and that focuses on effectiveness, no further efforts are proposed to standardize the applied interventions. In both groups, patients will receive intraoperative general anesthesia according to local practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention group A (IV-PCA)</title><p>For postoperative analgesia, intravenous opioids will be used with the help of a patient-controlled-analgesia device according to local practice.

This catheter will be used intraoperatively and postoperatively according to local standards in order to achieve anesthesia and analgesia, respectively. Therefore, local anesthetics will be injected with or without opioid analgesics into the epidural space. EDA has to be used postoperatively for at least 2&#x000a0;days. The type of medication, dosage, and additional pain medication will be documented in detail in the CRF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Concomitant treatment</title><p>All additional medications and/or treatments will be permitted during the trial when considered necessary by the treating physicians. In the event of failed EDA or premature cessation of the EDA, intravenous opioid analgesia will be given as a rescue medication and documented. If epidural hematoma or neurological complications occur, the standardized diagnostic and treatment algorithm suggested by P&#x000f6;pping et al. will be used to assure patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The use of transverse abdominal plane blocks, wound infusion catheters, intrathecal medication, or perioperative IV infusion of lidocaine will be prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Assignment of intervention and randomization</title><p>Consecutively screened and eligible patients will be included in the trial at each center after initiation of the study. To achieve comparable intervention groups for known and unknown risk factors, patients will be allocated in a concealed fashion by preoperative randomization 1&#x000a0;day before surgery using a centralized web-based tool (randomizer.at) provided by the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics, and Documentation of the Medical University of Graz, which has been successfully used in previous trials. Stratification by center will be performed to minimize center effects. Therefore, selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) will be minimized by sequence generation and allocation concealment. Randomization will be conducted exclusively by authorized trial personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Primary and secondary endpoints</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The primary endpoint, defined according to the retrospective trial by Pratt et al. that was used for sample-size calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], is the occurrence of at least one of the following gastrointestinal complications on or before POD 30:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Delayed gastric emptying (grade A &#x02013; C according to the ISGPS (International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery)&#x000a0;consensus definition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pancreatic fistula (grade A &#x02013; C according to the ISGPF (International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula) consensus definition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Biliary leak (grade A &#x02013; C according to the ISGLS (International Study Group of&#x000a0;Liver Surgery) consensus definition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and no other source of ongoing blood loss or the sudden appearance of clinically evident blood either on nasogastric lavage or per rectum, with a subsequent fall in hemoglobin of 2&#x000a0;mg/dl and requiring blood product transfusion, reoperation, or re-intervention (e.g., therapeutic endoscopy or angiography))</p></list-item><list-item><p>Postoperative ileus (absence of bowel sounds, failure to pass flatus, or absence of bowel movement by POD 5)</p></list-item></list></p><p>The composite primary endpoint &#x0201c;gastrointestinal complications&#x0201d; will be assessed from the date of pancreatoduodenectomy up to the end of the study on POD 30.

Confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the full analysis set (FAS), which is consistent with the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle by the inclusion of every patient who was randomized to one of the study groups and received a pancreatoduodenectomy.

The prior assumption is based on the retrospective trial by Pratt et al.

Due to the possible imprecision of the reported rates, a two-stage group sequential design according to O&#x02019;Brien and Fleming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been chosen, with the option of halting the trial for reasons of either futility or efficacy after the primary endpoints of two-thirds of the total patients are known..

With a level of significance <italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x000a0;% and a power of 1-<italic>b</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%, a total sample size of 278 patients (139 per group) is sufficient when applying a two-sided chi-square test (average sample size under H<sub>0</sub>, 201.6; under H<sub>1</sub>, 228.9; calculated with ADDPLAN6). To account for the possibility that the observed difference may be diminished by patient noncompliance and/or dropout (assumed not to exceed 25&#x000a0;%), an additional 92 patients will be recruited to correct for these effects, resulting in 370 patients&#x000a0;(Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Planned investigation scheme</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1306_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>As soon as the primary endpoint has been assessed in two-thirds (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;185) of the total number of patients to be randomized, an interim analysis will be performed.

Specific adaptation scenarios were considered with simulations (100,000 replications each). These included adaptive doubling, tripling, or quadrupling of the second-stage sample size after the interim analysis. The results showed that sufficient power would then be achieved, even if the relative treatment effect of the intervention were overestimated by 10&#x000a0;%, 15&#x000a0;%, or 18&#x000a0;%, respectively. However, when adaptations are performed, the adaptive designs do not apply sufficient test statistics and are less efficient than the fixed designs planned for this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Concerning secondary endpoints, exploratory data analysis will be performed, with both appropriate summary measures for the empirical distribution and descriptive two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values being calculated.

Furthermore, statistical methods are used to assess the quality of data and the homogeneity of the intervention groups.

This protocol is designed to ensure that the trial will be conducted and analyzed in accordance with ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The protocol has already been approved by the independent ethics committee (IEC) of the medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg, and secondary approval of the corresponding ethical bodies of all other participating centers has been or will be obtained. Additional file 2 contains a list of all local ethical bodies that have approved the PAKMAN trial. Recruitment in any center will not start before its individual ethical approval has been obtained. Any amendments will be signed by all parties and submitted to all of the IEC, and the IEC will also be informed at the end of the trial. The trial protocol has been formulated in accordance with the recommendations of the CONSORT and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous research comparing IV-PCA and EDA has focused mainly on the level of pain control itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or on the incidence of cardiac and pulmonary complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The reported mean visual analog pain scores are 3.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6 with IV-PCA versus 2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3 with EDA. This difference is statistically significant but of minor clinical relevance at best and diminishes during the postoperative course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, up to 30&#x000a0;% of the patients with EDA still experience severe pain in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast to the subjective belief of many anesthetists, the failure of epidural anesthesia and analgesia is a frequent clinical problem (failure rate 13&#x000a0;% to 47&#x000a0;% in experienced hands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The postulated benefits of EDA are reduced consumption of anesthetics, improved pain control with higher patient satisfaction, reduced incidence of cardiac and pulmonary complications, reduction of the surgical stress response, early bowel recovery, and enhanced postoperative recovery with shorter hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite these postulated benefits, the influence of EDA on clinically relevant outcomes is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although conclusions from historical studies have been promising, recent studies have shown no relevant effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Only weak evidence exists that EDA is able to decrease postoperative cardiovascular and pulmonary complications for subgroups with major open vascular surgery or high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A 2011 meta-analysis investigating the effects of thoracic EDA on perioperative outcome failed to show a benefit on perioperative in-hospital mortality in noncardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a single-center RCT, the preemptive use of EDA in patients undergoing open colon resection offered no advantage over IV-PCA with regard to the length of the hospital stay, pain scores, quality of life, complications, or hospital costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Even in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, most adverse outcomes are not reduced by the use of EDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the risk of epidural hematoma and paraplegia after EDA seems to be higher than previously assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The German network for safety in regional anesthesia reported the incidence of epidural hematoma after EDA as 1:6,628 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Pain control and the incidence of cardiac or pulmonary complications are critical to patients but form only a minor part of patient-relevant outcome parameters after major surgical operations such as pancreatoduodenectomy. Most trials to date have not correlated analgesic treatment with surgical complications. Our primary endpoint is of high clinical relevance for patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy because nearly every single gastrointestinal complication easily meets the definition of an SAE, and the high morbidity is mainly caused by these very complications. The validity and reproducibility of our results will be secured by a clear-cut definition of all outcome parameters and the use of international consensus definitions, when available.</p><p>The sample size calculation is based on a single retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and possibly, the rates reported there are imprecise. For this reason, a two-stage group sequential design is planned, with the option of stopping both for futility and for efficacy after the primary endpoint is reached in two-thirds of the total patients. In the case of continuation of the trial, the sample size will be adjusted. Furthermore, to account for possible noncompliance and dropout of patients, 25&#x000a0;% more participants will be recruited than are needed.</p><p>The PAKMAN trial is designed as a pragmatic trial because the objective is to depict the effectiveness of interventions in real-life routine practice conditions and produce results that can be generalized. The broad inclusion and narrow exclusion criteria reflect the pragmatic nature of the trial and the aim to obtain results with high generalizability and high external validity. Therefore, a number of interference factors, such as the experience of the surgeon (in terms of number of pancreatoduodenectomies performed (&#x0003c;&#x02009;26, 26-50, 51-75, or &#x0003e;&#x02009;75)), the underlying disease (benign versus malignant), the method of pancreatic anastomosis (pancreatogastrostomy versus pancreatojejunostomy), and the type of general anesthesia (medication, dosage, and type of application) will be assessed and available for subgroup analysis. These factors, however, were not predetermined in the study protocol. Moreover, by randomizing 370 patients, the known and unknown confounders will be distributed equally.</p><p>The risk of performance bias due to nonblinding is low because objective endpoints are used. Blinding of the patients and treating physicians is not possible as a matter of principle. The impact of a blinded observer on the reduction of bias would only be marginal because the primary endpoint (delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, biliary leak, gastrointestinal bleeding, or postoperative ileus) is defined in detail and already well documented (e.g., operation or intervention reports) in daily practice. It seems unlikely that these objective trial results will differ significantly if the observer is unblinded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The difference on which the PAKMAN trial focuses is a qualitative one (induced sympathicolysis due to any kind of EDA against IV-PCA without sympathicolysis). Therefore, only particular key steps of the interventions are predefined, and procedures can otherwise be performed according to local practice. EDA and IV-PCA medication, dose, and mode of application will be documented but not standardized. EDA and IV-PCA will be performed according to the centers&#x02019; standard procedures. Nevertheless, the detailed documentation will allow additional subgroup analysis regarding type/dose of medication for EDA or IV-PCA and frequency of gastrointestinal complications.</p><p>The results of the PAKMAN trial could influence future guidelines and decision-making. Healthcare costs might be decreased by a reduction of the complications themselves and of the treatment and hospital stay required to deal with the complications. Furthermore, any other treatment needed by patients (e.g., chemotherapy) might be delayed less often by complications.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients for the PAKMAN trial started in June 2015 (the first patient was randomized on 30 June 2015), and the trial is expected to be complete in 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1306_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Definition and assessment of all secondary endpoints.
