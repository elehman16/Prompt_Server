and pain was investigated in adults with forward head posture. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty-four adults with forward head posture were classified into groups by duration of
smartphone use: 11 used a smartphone for 10 minutes each (group 1), 12 for 20 minutes each
(group 2), and 11 for 30 minutes each (group 3). Fatigue cervical erector spinae and upper
trapezius muscles was measured by electromyography, and pain before and after the
experiment was evaluated using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. [Results] There was a
significant difference in the degree of fatigue in the left upper trapezius muscles in
group 2 and left cervical erector spinae and bilateral upper trapeziuses group 3. There
was a significant difference in fatigue in the left upper trapezius in groups 1 and 3. The
VAS showed significant differences in all groups before and after the experiment and
between groups 1 and 3. [Conclusion] Pain and fatigue worsened with longer smartphone use.
This study provided data on the proper duration of smartphone use. Correct posture and
breaks of at least 20 minutes are recommend when using smartphones.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Muscle fatigue</kwd><kwd>Smart phone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Smartphones combine a variety of digital devices, unlike conventional telephones.
Smartphones use has led to rapid changes in society by satisfying consumers needs, and their
convenience has greatly expanded their availability. Working on computers and operating
smartphones for long periods of time promote repetitive use of certain muscles, resulting in
muscle fiber injury, cumulative damage from acute trauma, and myogenic tonus, which occur
most often in the neck and shoulders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Repetitive and cumulative trauma to the neck and shoulder causes forward head posture
(FHP), a specific musculoskeletal abnormality<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP weakens the deep cervical flexor muscle, the midthoracic
rhomboid muscle for scapular retraction, and the mid and lower trapezius muscles. FHP also
shortens the pectoralis major and neck extension muscles. Upper trapezius muscle activity is
increased more in FHP than in correct anatomic positions, and most patients complain of pain
from muscle overuse<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Shim and Zhu<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, fatigue and
stress in the neck and shoulders occur more easily with use of touch-screen computers than
with desktops because small-monitor devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs cause people
to look down and to slouch more than with desktops<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Smartphone use in a static position and with an unsupported arm could bring about abnormal
alignment of the neck and shoulders. Because smartphones have small monitors that are
typically held downward near the laps, users must bend their heads to see the screens,
increasing activity in the neck extensor muscles overloading the neck and shoulders
increases muscle fatigue, decreases work capacity and affects the musculoskeletal
system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are a number of studies on posture and motion with computer, laptop and smartphones
use. However, studies are lacking on appropriate durations of use. This study aimed to
investigated the effect of the duration of smartphone use in adults with FHP and the onset
of fatigue and pain in neck and shoulder muscles.</p><p>Objective and quantitative data were obtained regarding appropriate duration of smartphone
use in adults with FHP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 34 patients in their 20s and 30s were enrolled whose tragus was located on the
left side rather than at the lateral acromion angle on radiography in a lateral cervical
view<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The procedure and purpose of the study were excluded to the subjects, who voluntarily
consented to participate. This study excluded individuals with neck pain and those with
congenital deformities, serious surgical or neurological diseases, limb injuries, or limb
pain in the prior 6 months. The study received approval from the Korea Kyungnam University
institutional review board (IRB 1040460-A-2014-022) before participant recruitment
began.</p><p>The average age, height, and weight of subjects was 26.20 &#x000b1; 5.45&#x02005;years, 167.24 &#x000b1; 7.73&#x02005;cm,
and 60.87 &#x000b1; 8.03&#x02005;kg, respectively. Mean VAS score was 1.15 &#x000b1; 0.87 with no significant
differences.</p><p>A goniometer was used on all subjects in order to quantify posture as they began to use a
smartphones.</p><p>The subjects sat comfortably on a stool with their feet on the floor, knee and hip joints
at right angles, and trunk upright. Upper arms were raised to clavicle level to prevent
lumbar overflexion.</p><p>Subjects were allowed to use message services, KakaoTalk, games, and the Internet with no
limitations during smartphone use<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>They were also instructed to focus only on phone use without paying attention to
maintaining neck and lumbar posture. An electromyograms (EMG) was performed initially for
one minute and then for another minute immediately after phone use began. Pain was assessed
before and after smartphone use using the VAS.</p><p>A Galaxy S4 LTE-A smartphone (SHV-E330S, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was
used in this experiment.</p><p>To collect the surface EMG signal from the cervical erector spinae and upper trapezius
muscles, which support stability around the neck and shoulders, a Trigono&#x02122; Wireless EMG
system (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was used<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sampling rate was set at 2,000&#x02005;Hz, and the bandwidth for the EMG signal noise rejection
was set at 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>The analog signals of each muscle were collected and analyzed by Delsys EMG Works
Acquisition software for PC, based on digital signals that were wirelessly sent from the
Trigono base station.</p><p>Before we attached the electrodes, we exfoliated the skin using sandpaper and then cleaned
it with alcohol swabs in order to reduce the muscle resistance to the EMG signals.</p><p>The surface EMG electrodes were attached 1&#x02013;2.5&#x02005;cm apart in parallel with both the cervical
erector spinae and upper trapezius muscle fibers.</p><p>The EMG sensors were attached around both C4 areas for the cervical erector spinae and
slightly outward from the midline between C7 and the acromioclavicular joint for the upper
trapezius muscle<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data from each muscle before and after the experiment were interpreted by mathematic FFT
(Fast Fourier Transform) and spectrum analysis, and the median frequency was used as an
index for muscle fatigue.</p><p>With high muscle fatigue, the frequency spectrum moves toward the lower end<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The collected data were processed with SPSS Version 22.0 using a paired-t test to analyze
muscle fatigue, changes in FHP, and severity of pain before and after the experiment in the
three groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the muscle
fatigue, change in the FHP, and pain by elapsed phone use time. Least Significant Differince
(LSD) was used for the post hoc test, and the level of significance was &#x00251;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In group 2, there was a significant difference in muscle fatigue before (72.73 &#x000b1; 12.19) and

psychologically.</p><p>A survey of adults over age 20 by Eom et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that 18.8% had experienced symptoms related to a
musculoskeletal disorder from smart phone use, and that pain had increased with duration of
use.</p><p>In this study, we investigated muscle fatigue by measuring median frequency. The group that
used the phone for 10 minutes showed decreased median frequency of fatigue in all of the
muscles studied, but without significance (p&#x0003e;0.05). In the 20-minute group, there was a
slight decrement in median frequency, and fatigue decreased significantly in the left upper
trapezius (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>There were no significant differences in muscle fatigue in the right cervical erector
spinae (p&#x0003e;0.05), but significant differences were noted in the left cervical erector
spinae and the left and right upper trapezius muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the group that used the
phone for 30 minutes.</p><p>A significant difference in muscle fatigue in the left upper trapezius was shown between
the 10-minute and 30- minute groups.</p><p>In Park et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, participants who used
a smartphone for 20 minutes showed median fatigue frequency decrements both the upper
trapezius and cervical erector spinae muscles, and also reported more load on the right
shoulder than the left because the right shoulder was used more often . However, in our
study, the 20-minute group presented significant differences in fatigue in the left upper
trapezius (p&#x0003c;0.05), and the 30-minute group showed significant differences in fatigue in
their left cervical erector spinae and left and right upper trapezius (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Previous studies revealed that smartphone overuse places the head in an unvarying posture
and that continuous muscle contraction then brings about muscle weakness and fatigue that
could easily develop into chronic cervical pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, continuous static pressure on specific sites could also increase muscle
fatigue and pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kraemer et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that muscle
fatigue is caused by work that requires repeated movement in static postures.</p><p>Park et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> studied male subjects
using a game that could be operated by both hands. In this study, we enrolled both male and
female participants, and allowed them to use the phones freely for web surfing and
messaging, rather than having them perform only one activity. The subjects held the phones
in their left hands and used their right hands infrequently, which led to a greater load on
the shoulder that performed the same motion.</p><p>All three groups showed significant differences in VAS scores after the experiment, and
there was also a significant difference between the 10-minute and 30-minute groups
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Lee and Song<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> studied pain severity
according to smartphone use duration, and they reported significant differences in reading,
concentration, and headaches, although these could have been transient symptoms from the
smartphone use.</p><p>The participants in this study mostly used their smartphones lowered toward their laps, so
that they maintained fixed postures with their necks flexed. According to Kim et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, looking downward promotes muscle fatigue
more easily than does looking upward.</p><p>Most subjects were using the phones in the wrong position, which could have negatively
affected muscles and joints. Combined with the wrong position, double and even triple
myotonia and myalgia could be triggered<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although we investigated only one session per subject, if adults
with FHP continuously use smartphones, they could be exposed to cumulative pain.</p><p>There is a lack of studies regarding the physical effects of long-term smartphone use.
Thus, we investigated muscle fatigue and VAS scores according to smartphone use time: 10
minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes.</p><p>This study does have limitations. We observed differences with only short-term use but not
long-term or continuous use. In addition, the subjects were limited to adults with FHP, so
we did not have the opportunity to compare this group to those with normal posture, and also
did not analyze differences based on different phone use postures.</p><p>Additional studies are needed regarding cumulative trauma, posture changes in the neck and
shoulders, and treatment methods for related disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Pietikainen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000e4;nninen</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Excessive texting in pathophysiology of first
