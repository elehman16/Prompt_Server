visual display terminal (VDT) use on repositioning and lumbar muscle activity during
continuous sitting. [Subjects] Thirteen males two groups: 7 males in their 20s, 6 males in
their 40s participated in this study. [Methods] The two groups watched a lecture in a
seated position under different conditions. L4 paraspinal muscle activity was recorded
using a surface electromyography system. Repositioning was assessed using a video camera
and Tekscan system. [Results] The repositioning times decreased significantly in the order
to without a VDT in males in their 20s and 40s &#x0003e; with a VDT in males in their 20s &#x0003e;
with a VDT in males in their 40s. The L4 paraspinal muscle activity significantly
increased in order to without a VDT in males in their 20s and 40s &#x0003c; with a VDT in males
in their 20s &#x0003c; with a VDT in males in their 40s. [Conclusion] The results of this study
suggest that the number of repositioning movements during continuous sitting could affect
lumbar muscle activity and could be an important factor for prevention of low back
pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Seated person</kwd><kwd>Reposition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the most common postural problems is the slumped sitting posture, which is becoming
more prevalent due to the increasing use of computers, TVs, video games, and even
backpacks<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sitting posture changes
within approximately 10&#x02005;min to a position that allows comfortable working<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Szeto et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> attributed changes in muscle patterns principally to personal
habitual postures rather than postures dictated by workstations. However, few studies have
been performed regarding the clinical meaning of repositioning or affect on trunk muscles in
people sitting while using a video display terminal (VDT). So, the purpose of this study was
to investigate the effect of different ages and visual display terminal use on repositioning
and lumbar muscle activity during continuous sitting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirteen males (7 males in their 20s, 6 males in their 40s) with a mean height and weight
of 72.5 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;cm and 69.1 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;kg, respectively, participated in this study. The subjects
had no history of musculoskeletal disorders or pain associated with the upper extremity and
spine in the past 6 months. The study purpose and methods were explained to the subject, who
provided informed consent according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki before
participating. Muscle activity of the L4 paraspinal was recorded using surface an MP150WSW
system (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) during 30 minutes of continuous sitting.
This study investigated the number of repositioning movements using a video camera and
Tekscan system (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA, USA) during 30 minutes of continuous
sitting. Repositioning movements were counted using the video camera and Tekscan system when
the gluteal pressure decreased by more than 20% during movement of the trunk. Data collected
by the Tekscan system during the 30 minutes of continuous sitting were analyzed using
COMFOMat research 6.20. Two groups (males in their 20s, males in their 40s) watched a
lecture in a seated position on a chair under 2 conditions. To ensure that the hips and
knees were flexed at 90&#x000b0;, an adjustable-height table and chair with a backrest were used to
set the initial sitting posture. Condition 1 was watching a real-time lecture for 30
minutes. Condition 2 was watching a recorded lecture on a 23-inch monitor (visual display
terminal) for 30 minutes. SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical
analysis. The Two-way (2 &#x000d7; 2) repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the significance.
The alpha level for statistical significance was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The repositioning times decreased significantly in the order to without a VDT in males in
their 20s and 40s (30.2&#x000b1;10.4 and 27.9&#x000b1;12.3) &#x0003e; with a VDT in males in their 20s
(18.9&#x000b1;11.4) &#x0003e; with a VDT in males in their 40s (14.1&#x000b1;9.0) (p&#x0003c;0.05). The L4 paraspinal
muscle activity increased significantly in order to without a VDT in males in their 20s and
40s (22.6&#x000b1;11.3% and 25.6&#x000b1;10.9%) &#x0003c; with a VDT in males in their 20s (30.1&#x000b1;12.0%) &#x0003c; with
a VDT in males in their 40s (34.8&#x000b1;8.4%) (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results showed that L4 paraspinal muscle activity increased significantly in order to
without a VDT in males in their 20s and 40s &#x0003c; with a VDT in males in their 20s &#x0003c; with
a VDT in males in their 40s. I thought that continuous sitting with VDT was a risk factor
for decreased lumbar muscle activity compared with continuous sitting without using a VDT.
Within the sagittal plane, habitual poor postures include flexed and relaxed postures<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The flexed and relaxed postures are easily
adopted by VDT users due to the low muscular effort required in the abdominal muscles, and
they result in increased back muscle tension, which can cause an increased load on passive
paraspinal passive structures<sup>4)</sup>. This result showed that the repositioning times
significantly decreased in order to without VDT in 20s and 40s &#x0003e; with VDT in 20s &#x0003e;
with VDT in 40s. In contrast, L4 paraspinal muscle activity increased. The interfacial
pressure in the gluteal muscles and lower back is dependent on the sitting posture and body
positioning<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During sitting, the upper
body weight is mainly transferred to the ischial tuberosities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Seated persons move frequently to repositioning during continuous
sitting. These movements help to reduce the peak pressures transferred to the ischial
tuberosities. Vergara, and Page suggested that large changes in sitting posture are
indicative of discomfort but that small movements are necessary to alleviate pain caused by
static lumbar and pelvic postures<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
may indicate that sitting conditions that promote movement are more comfortable. Therefore,
the results of this study suggest that repositioning movements during continuous sitting
could affect lumbar muscle activity and could be an important factor for prevention of low
back pain. The results of this study also showed that L4 paraspinal muscle activity
increased significantly in order to with a VDT in males in their 20s &#x0003c; with a VDT in
males in their 40s. It also showed that males in their 40s need to reposition more when
sitting than males in their 20s.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name><name><surname>Grahamslaw</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kendell</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of different standing and sitting postures on
