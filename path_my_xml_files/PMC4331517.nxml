Previous interventions have reported step-count increases, but not change in objectively measured MVPA in older people. We assessed whether a primary care nurse-delivered complex intervention increased objectively measured step-counts and MVPA.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>A total of 988 60&#x02013;75 year olds, able to increase walking and randomly selected from three UK family practices, were invited to participate in a parallel two-arm cluster randomised trial; randomisation was by household. Two-hundred-ninety-eight people from 250 households were randomised between 2011 and 2012; 150 individuals to the intervention group, 148 to the usual care control group. Intervention participants received four primary care nurse physical activity (PA) consultations over 3 months, incorporating behaviour change techniques, pedometer step-count and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, and an individual PA diary and plan. Assessors were not blinded to group status, but statistical analyses were conducted blind. The primary outcome was change in accelerometry assessed average daily step-counts between baseline and 3 months, with change at 12 months a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes were change from baseline in time in MVPA weekly in &#x02265;10-minute bouts, accelerometer counts, and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months. Other outcomes were adverse events, anthropometric measures, mood, and pain. Qualitative evaluations of intervention participants and practice nurses assessed the intervention&#x02019;s acceptability. At 3 months, eight participants had withdrawn or were lost to follow-up, 280 (94%) individuals provided primary outcome data. At 3 months changes in both average daily step-counts and weekly MVPA in &#x02265;10-minute bouts were significantly higher in the intervention than control group: by 1,037 (95% CI 513&#x02013;1,560) steps/day and 63 (95% CI 40&#x02013;87) minutes/week, respectively. At 12 months corresponding differences were 609 (95% CI 104&#x02013;1,115) steps/day and 40 (95% CI 17&#x02013;63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects to steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in the two groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable and enjoyable.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PACE-Lift trial increased both step-counts and objectively measured MVPA in &#x02265;10-minute bouts in 60&#x02013;75 year olds at 3 and 12 months, with no effect on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first trial in this age group to demonstrate objective MVPA increases and highlights the value of individualised support incorporating objective PA assessment in a primary care setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN42122561">ISRCTN42122561</ext-link>
</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In this cluster randomized controlled trial, Tess Harris and colleagues investigate whether a program delivered by primary care nurses to older adults can increase bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors&#x02019; Summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Background</title><p>Worldwide, people are becoming increasingly sedentary. They are sitting at desks instead of doing manual labor; they are driving to work instead of walking; and they are participating in fewer leisure time physical activities. But the human body needs regular exercise to stay healthy. Physical activity helps to maintain a healthy weight and prevents or delays heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Moreover, physically active people feel better and live longer than physically inactive people. The World Health Organization recommends that adults should be active daily and should do at least 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) every week in bouts that each last at least 10 minutes. Moderate-intensity physical activities (for example, brisk walking) require a moderate amount of effort and noticeably increase the heart rate; vigorous-intensity physical activities (for example, running) require a large amount of effort and cause rapid breathing and a substantial heart rate increase.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>When physical activity is objectively measured using an accelerometer (a movement monitor that is usually worn on the waist; unlike pedometers, which simply count the number of steps a person takes, accelerometers record both step-counts and the intensity of physical activity), fewer than 5% of older people achieve the recommended weekly levels of MVPA. These levels could be reached by taking regular brisk walks but how can older people be persuaded to make such walks part of their daily lives? In this cluster randomized controlled trial&#x02014;the PACE (Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation)-Lift trial&#x02014;the researchers assess whether an intervention to increase walking comprising pedometer and accelerometer feedback combined with physical activity consultations provided by practice nurses can lead to sustained increases in physical activity in 60&#x02013;75 year olds. Cluster randomized trials compare outcomes in groups of people (here, husbands and wives living in one household) assigned through the play of chance to receive a test or a control intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers assigned 298 people from 250 households to receive the intervention or usual care and determined the participants&#x02019; physical activity at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months by asking them to wear an accelerometer for 7 days. Intervention group participants received four physical activity consultations with a primary care nurse over 3 months. At the first consultation, the nurse gave each participant a pedometer to measure step-counts, a physical activity diary in which to record their goals and progress, and the PACE-Lift patient handbook. At each consultation, the nurse used behavior change techniques (for example, goal setting) to encourage the participant to walk regularly, gave the participant visual feedback from their accelerometer readings, and devised a personal walking plan. Control group participants received normal care only from the practice. At 3 months and 12 months, both the average daily step-count and the weekly MVPA level had decreased from baseline in the control group but increased in the intervention group. At 3 months, compared to the control group, the average step-count in the intervention group was 1,037 steps/day higher and the MVPA in bouts of more than 10 minutes in the intervention group was 63 minutes/week higher. At 12 months, the corresponding differences were 609 steps/day and 40 minutes/week. There were no significant differences in adverse events (for example, pain), body fat, or other measured health-related outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that the complex intervention tested in the PACE-Lift trial increased both step-counts and objectively measured MPVA among 60&#x02013;75 year olds for at least 12 months. Importantly, all the participants and practice nurses were positive and enthusiastic about the intervention. Moreover, the observed increase in physical activity is estimated to reduce the participants&#x02019; risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes by an estimated 5.5% and 9.1%, respectively. Further trials are needed to determine which aspects of the intervention were responsible for increasing physical activity, to determine whether the intervention&#x02019;s effects will persist for longer than 12 months, and to test the intervention in socio-economically diverse populations (all the PACE-Lift participants came from an affluent, non-ethnically diverse area). However, these findings highlight the value of family practices providing older individuals with individualized support that incorporates objective assessment of physical activity to help them become more physically active.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001783">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001783</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyliving">healthy living</ext-link>; its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/index.html">Physical Activity for Everyone</ext-link> web pages include guidelines for older people, instructional videos, and personal success stories (some information in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The World Health Organization provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/physical_activity/en/">physical activity and health</ext-link> (in several languages); its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_recommendations/en/index.html">Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health</ext-link> are available in several languages</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service information source Choices explains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/Fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx">the benefits of regular physical activity</ext-link>, provides <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/fitness/Pages/physical-activity-guidelines-for-older-adults.aspx">recommendations for older people</ext-link>, and includes tips for exercising and some personal stories</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus has links to other resources about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/exerciseandphysicalfitness.html">exercise and physical fitness</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>More information about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/5">PACE-Lift trial protocol</ext-link> is available</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for patient benefit programme (Grant reference number PB-PG-0909-20055).

Older adults are advised to be active daily and to accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) weekly, in at least 10 minute bouts. This can be achieved through regular walking [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent surveys based on objective PA assessment suggest that less than 5% of this age group achieve recommended PA levels [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Increasing older people&#x02019;s PA is challenging. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., goal-setting, self-monitoring, building self-efficacy) are more effective than health education alone [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Best practice includes gradually increasing to moderate intensity, incorporating PA into daily routines (e.g., walking) and monitoring intensity [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interventions tailored to people&#x02019;s needs and delivered at the individual or household level can encourage walking [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Primary care provides an ideal context for PA interventions; it allows population-based sampling of healthy older people (by individual or household), practice nurse involvement, and continuity of care, with many chronic diseases being indicators for increasing PA. United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks include adults to age 74 and incorporate brief advice on increasing PA, often by practice nurses or health care assistants [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Pedometers provide direct step-count feedback; accelerometers need computer analysis, but record step-counts and PA intensity. Three systematic reviews found pedometer users increased steps/day by 2,000&#x02013;2,500, but trials included few older adults and focused on volunteers or patients with specific conditions, mainly with short follow-up (3 to 6 months) [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two more recent older adult population-based primary care trials showed significant step-count increases at 3 [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 6 months [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but did not report on MVPA and included few men [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>We therefore conducted a randomised trial to determine whether an intervention based on pedometer and accelerometer feedback combined with practice nurse PA consultations increases PA levels in 60&#x02013;75 year olds over 3 months and whether any change is maintained at 12 months. Secondary aims were to assess whether effects were modified by age, gender, body mass index (BMI), disability, exercise self-efficacy or taking part as a couple, and to estimate effects on patient reported outcomes and anthropometric measures. The trial was designed to be population-based and to measure objectively assessed PA, including MVPA (providing a direct link to PA guidelines). Qualitative studies were undertaken with intervention participants and practice nurses to assess the intervention&#x02019;s acceptability and the barriers and facilitators to increasing PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Trial Design</title><p>The trial protocol has been published (<xref rid="pmed.1001783.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A two-arm parallel cluster randomised trial, randomised by household, compared a complex intervention to increase walking carried out over a 3 month period with a usual care control group. The primary endpoint was assessed at 3 months. Further follow-up assessed maintenance of any differences between groups at 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethical Review</title><p>The trial was approved by Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee C, UK (11/H0606/2).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were patients aged 60&#x02013;74 years registered at three general practices in Oxfordshire and Berkshire, UK, who could walk outside and had no contra-indications to increasing PA.

A random sample of 200 eligible households, with either one or two older adults at the same address, was selected per practice.

Two eligible people in a household were invited together (apart if preferred). Recruitment was between October 2011 and September 2012.

Participants were asked to continue with their usual PA while wearing a hip-mounted accelerometer (GT3X+, Actigraph LLC) to record PA (in 5 s epochs) all day (between rising and going to bed) for 7 consecutive days, except for bathing, and to keep a contemporaneous PA diary. Accelerometers and diaries were returned to the practice. Participants not providing &#x02265;5 days of &#x02265;540 minutes (9 hours) per day of data were asked to rewear the accelerometer.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Randomisation and Masking</title><p>Participants with adequate baseline accelerometer data were randomised using the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit internet randomisation service. Randomisation was at household level to avoid couple contamination. Block randomisation was used within practice with random sized blocks, varying between 4 and 6, and 1:1 allocation ratio, to ensure group balance and an even nurse workload. Participants were informed by telephone of their group allocation.

The primary outcome was change in average daily step-count between baseline and 3 months. The secondary outcomes were changes in average weekly time spent in MVPA, MVPA in &#x0003e;10 minute bouts, and in accelerometer counts and counts/minute of wear-time between baseline and 3 months. All primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by accelerometry. Ancillary outcomes were changes in depression (15-item Geriatric Depression Score), anxiety (4-item FEAR score), and pain (4-item self-reported pain score) (see protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>] for full references for all questionnaire measures [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), BMI, and percentage body fat. Adverse events were collated from contemporaneous spontaneous patient reports to nurses or researchers for trial safety purposes. Adverse events were also collected retrospectively from questionnaires in a systematic manner for control and intervention participants at 3 months for trial outcome reporting. Questions covered falls inside and outside the house, fractures, sprains or injuries, and deterioration in health problems.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>12 Month Assessment</title><p>The 12 month assessment was based on postal accelerometry and questionnaires, similar to those for the 3 month assessment.

The protocol stated that patients should have &#x02265;5 days of &#x02265;600 minutes recorded activity to be randomised; 24 patients were randomised not meeting this criteria. The criteria for &#x0201c;adequate&#x0201d; wear-time varies, but researchers generally use criteria of a minimum of 3&#x02013;5 days of data [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with either 600 [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or 480 [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] minutes/day of data. Prior to data unblinding, and agreed by the Trial Steering Committee, the criteria was relaxed to allow days of &#x02265;540 minutes of data to be included, minimising missing days, whilst maximising the likelihood that the data included in analyses accurately reflected activity for the day measured. Thus patients were considered correctly randomised if they had &#x02265;5 days with &#x02265;540 minutes of data/day.

The multi-level model used assumed the random effects were independent and the model was fitted using maximum likelihood. Number of steps on a given day at 3 months was regressed on day order of wear, day of week, month of baseline accelerometery, age, gender, practice, treatment group, and estimated average daily steps at baseline. By including baseline daily steps as a covariate, this effectively measured change in step-count over the 3 months, minimising bias and maintaining power [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Estimated average daily steps at baseline was derived by using a similar two-level model in which daily steps were regressed on day order of wear and day of week. Secondary outcome measures were number of minutes spent in MVPA and MVPA in bouts of &#x02265;10 minutes, as well as counts and counts per minute. These measures were highly correlated with step-count and were analysed using identical approaches. In all presentations MVPA is expressed as estimated number of minutes spent in MVPA (or MVPA in &#x02265;10-minute bouts) per week.

<bold>Barriers and facilitators to PA.</bold> All participants talked about the different intervention elements (use of pedometer and accelerometers; the handbooks and diaries; the nurse consultation; the individualised goal setting and developing strategies for the future). The differences between our two groups were in the perception of these as enablers (or barriers) to increasing walking. Improvers were more positive about the use of the pedometer: <italic>&#x0201c;well I think we were motivated because we had. . . little pace &#x02026; step counters</italic>, <italic>you know on our side</italic>, <italic>and so of course we kept checking to make sure that you tried to achieve the. . . steps a day</italic>, <italic>and we sort of kept motivated&#x0201d;</italic> (participant 13, female, aged 67); individualised goal setting and monitoring <italic>&#x0201c;she was just very very positive</italic>. <italic>If we&#x02019;d had a bad week or whatever</italic>, <italic>you know</italic>, <italic>it had gone down from the week before</italic>, <italic>she just said &#x0201c;Well look how well you&#x02019;re doing</italic>!<italic>&#x0201d;</italic> (participant 28, female, improver, aged 62); the appropriateness of walking as a form of PA for people of &#x0201c;their age&#x0201d; <italic>&#x0201c;Walking certainly</italic>, <italic>because I mean &#x02026; at my age</italic>, <italic>umm</italic>, <italic>virtually anything else is. . . inappropriate&#x0201d;</italic> (participant 14, male, aged 71); and in developing strategies for keeping walking in the future &#x0201c;<italic>Well it&#x02019;s just &#x02026; a habit we&#x02019;ve got into I suppose and we just kept going from that</italic>&#x0201d; (participant 29, male, aged 73). Both groups commented upon a range of constraints to increasing their walking with the weather &#x0201c;<italic>Well</italic>, <italic>no</italic>, <italic>just the weather&#x0201d; (as a limitation on walking)</italic> (participant 7, female, non-improver, aged 71) and existing health problems &#x0201c;<italic>I mean I have high blood pressure and umm &#x02026; uhh &#x02026; osteoporosis so</italic>, <italic>in fact</italic>, <italic>you know</italic>, <italic>the walking benefits very much. . .&#x0201d;</italic> (participant 22, female, improver, aged 65). However, as that participant illustrated, the improvers were able to overcome these barriers and saw the consequent benefits for other aspects of their life.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec037"><title>Main Findings</title><p>In this trial, differences in both step-counts and time spent in MVPA (nearly all within bouts of &#x02265;10 minutes) were observed between the intervention group compared with the control group at 3 months and at 12 months. No effect was seen on other health outcomes, including adverse events. The intervention was well accepted, with 87% attending all four nurse sessions, nearly all wearing the accelerometer before their appointments, and positive comments about all aspects of the trial from participants and nurses. While the intervention itself, particularly the use of accelerometer PA intensity feedback, was novel, the key methodological development was the successful embedding of the intervention within primary care. Primary care provided the sampling frame, an efficient mechanism for identifying unsuitable participants, practice nurses to deliver the intervention, and a supportive environment.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses of This Study</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the largest reported pedometer-based walking intervention for older people, recruiting from a population-based sample and with a high recruitment rate of 30%, higher than other primary care PA trials [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and over 90% retention rate at 12 months. Detailed sensitivity analyses demonstrated the effect estimates were robust. Around half of participants were men, often under-represented in trials [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and there was a balance across age groups. A study limitation is that whilst the intervention was effective in older men and women from an affluent, non-ethnically diverse socio-economic area, generalisability to more diverse populations cannot be assumed. Previously published work on those declining participation in this trial showed that participants were more likely than non-participants to live in affluent postcodes [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The fact that the intervention group at baseline was slightly older than the control group was consistent with their leaving full-time education younger and having slightly higher levels of chronic illness and disability. However, our analyses were based on change, with baseline level of PA being controlled for. Adjusting for baseline activity controls for many factors associated with activity in cross-sectional analyses. Moreover, our effect modification analyses suggests no difference in the intervention by age or disability.</p><p>In the study design, nurses from the practices, rather than researchers or exercise specialists, delivered the intervention and incorporated feedback on participants&#x02019; PA intensity from accelerometers to provide personalised PA goals. As the intervention involved multiple components, we cannot identify which components were important in changing PA, although qualitative evaluations from both participants and nurses emphasised the value of all the different intervention elements. Whilst researchers assessing outcomes were not masked to group status, an important study strength was that the main outcome was accelerometer PA measurement, enabling change in both step-counts and PA intensity to be objectively assessed. Waist-worn accelerometers measure walking accurately, while self-reported PA, particularly walking, is prone to recall bias [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. One potential criticism in using monitors to assess PA is that participants might try harder when being monitored. However, any Hawthorne effect would have been reduced by our 7-day protocol and would have affected both groups [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The fact that the observed changes in the intervention group affected not only steps and MVPA but also bouts of MVPA of at least 10 minutes, suggests that participants were making recommended changes by increasing planned, structured walking.</p><p>A further strength is the inclusion of qualitative findings from intervention participants and practice nurses. The devices and nurse-delivered support were generally valued by all participants regardless of changes in their levels of activity. However, this raises the issue of why some participants engaged with the psychological techniques of goal setting and developing strategies to embed activity into their lives, whilst others did not. A potential weakness may be that we were unable to interview sufficient people, to reach saturation, and to gain a clearer picture of the factors supporting long-term behaviour change. Understanding why and how older people engage with increasing and maintaining changes in PA is likely to require a more complex mixed-methods design that examines individual psycho-social factors, the wider socio-environmental context, and other key determinants of health.</p></sec><sec id="sec039"><title>Main Results in Context of Other Literature</title><p>Our difference between groups in average daily step-count of 1,037 (95% CI 513&#x02013;1,560) is consistent with the PA increases reported in systematic reviews of pedometer-based interventions, although smaller than reviews reported (2,000&#x02013;2,500 steps/day) [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This finding could reflect the fact that PACE-Lift was population-based rather than volunteer-based and that it measured step-counts using accelerometers, whereas the above studies used pedometers; there is no direct conversion factor [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A Japanese study of 68 older women showed that accelerometer feedback of PA intensity helped to increase PA levels [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our study confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of accelerometer PA feedback and suggests this should be explored further.</p><p>Previous walking interventions demonstrating increased time spent in MVPA are based on self-report [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent trials using accelerometery have shown reductions in sedentary time [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and increases in minutes spent walking [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but have been based on very small numbers [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or on women only [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is evidence that people over-report PA, particularly walking [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], so our objective measure of an increase in weekly MVPA of 66 minutes, in a large trial including men and women, is an important finding. In terms of public health advice to achieve MVPA in bouts of at least 10 minutes [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], 63 of the 66 minutes weekly increase was in &#x02265;10 minute bouts. Whilst subgroup differences were not statistically significant, our study was not powered to look directly at these interaction effects and our study suggests that the possibility of the intervention being more effective in men than women and in those attending as couples should not be ruled out. The gender effect is different from that suggested previously [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where the effect size was greater for women; but authors urged caution owing to the lack of data on men. To our knowledge no other pedometer studies have compared effects in couples and individuals; household sampling enabled us to investigate this effect. We intended to sample, randomise, and provide the intervention by household cluster, but it turned out that most clusters were represented for randomisation and treatment by single individuals, which reduced our power for looking directly at the interaction effect of couple versus individual. We did not find a significant effect on anthropometric outcomes at 3 months, and we did not have funding for face-to-face assessments to measure weight and fat mass at 12 months. A meta-analysis of pedometer-based walking interventions and weight loss found that longer interventions and those with longer follow-up had greater effects, but the average increase in step-counts was 4,000 steps/day, which is much larger than in our study [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with another more recent pedometer-based walking intervention, which showed an effect on step-counts, but not on anthropometric measures [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. No significant effect of the intervention on depression or anxiety scores either at 3 or 12 months was found. Whilst walking interventions have reported improved mood [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], published systematic reviews did not include this measure [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other primary care pedometer-based walking interventions have not shown an effect on mental health [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], depression, or anxiety [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Whilst walking is safe [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a large trial in 40&#x02013;74 year old women, which promoted a single walking target, reported significantly more falls in the walking group [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our trial did not find group differences in self-reported pain or adverse events. This finding may be due to our individualised PA plans based on the person&#x02019;s baseline and &#x0201c;starting-low-and-going-slow&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mutrie and colleagues required participants to have a face-to-face check with a general practitioner (GP) at baseline, excluding 35% (167/461) and called for simpler, less time-consuming screening methods [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our two-stage exclusion method, initially using computerised record Read codes and followed by GP examination of potential participant lists, excluding 15% and 9% of potential participants, respectively, was quick and easy to implement, did not require a GP visit, and raised no safety concerns. Our trial confirmed other findings that primary care nurses can be effective in increasing PA levels in older people [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and provided this evidence using objective PA measures. Our nurse PA consultations followed primary care exercise prescribing guidance to chart progress, set goals, and solve problems [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This method fits with pedometer-based systematic review findings, suggesting that interventions with individual tailoring and personalised activity goals are more effective [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec040"><title>Implications for Policy and Practice</title><p>The increase in PA levels in this trial was sufficiently large to have modest but appreciable effects on risks of important chronic diseases. Based on earlier reports quantifying the strengths of associations between PA (particularly walking) and coronary heart disease (CHD) [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the 40 minute weekly difference between the groups in walking observed at one year, if sustained, would be expected to reduce CHD risk by about 5.5% (95% CI 3.9%&#x02013;6.7%) and type 2 diabetes risk by 9.1% (95% CI 4.5%&#x02013;13.5%) (see <xref rid="pmed.1001783.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Text</xref> for full details of how risk reductions were estimated). Importantly, the reduction in risk of diabetes appears largely independent of any impact on BMI [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Our study demonstrates that practice nurses can safely deliver an intervention to increase objectively measured PA levels in older people at 3 months, with a sustained effect at 12 months. Moreover, this was an acceptable population-based intervention, with 30% uptake in the target age group. Researchers wishing to recruit older people to PA sudies should consider the two-stage primary care recruitment method described here, which provides a population-based sample, estimation of recruitment rate, and generalisability, with an efficient, safe way of excluding unsuitable patients. However, the main advantage that primary care offers is an ideal setting for delivering PA interventions in this age group and the opportunity to integrate this into routine care. Our intervention required four PA consultations, each longer than standard practice nurse consultations and training for practice nurses both in using accelerometers and in BCTs. This method has implications for primary care, in that effective delivery of interventions that produce sustained objective PA increases, involving personalised activity goals and feedback of PA intensity, requires more time, training, and support than is currently standard in NHS Health Checks [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or routine care.</p></sec><sec id="sec041"><title>Unanswered Questions and Future Research</title><p>Future trials need to distinguish the different aspects of PA interventions, to understand the effects of the pedometer or accelerometer separately from BCTs and support offered [<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They also need to test interventions in socio-economically diverse populations, and with older people who have higher levels of morbidity and disability. Inclusion of a qualitative dimension to future trials would provide further valuable insights into how older people can embrace PA as part of their daily lives. Robust evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness needs to be gathered before this or similar programmes can be implemented on a larger scale in routine health care. Following demonstration of the effectiveness of this intervention, funding was obtained for a post hoc evaluation of costs and cost-effectiveness, using existing trial evidence, and is currently in process. Increased PA at 3 months is a significant finding, but maintenance of change is of key importance. Our findings that over 50% of the difference at 3 months was maintained at 12 months, 9 months post-intervention, is an important addition to the literature. Longer term follow-up to evaluate the need for maintenance support is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec042"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001783.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Residuals from 3 month models for steps and weekly MVPA in &#x02265;10 minute bouts.</title><p>(a) Steps model: Distribution of residuals from steps model.
