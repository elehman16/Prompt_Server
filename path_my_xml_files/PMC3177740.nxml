These metabolic findings may explain higher rates of infant macrosomia in obese women, which might be targeted in trials to prevent excess fetal growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>It is increasingly recognized that obese women, with presumably normal glucose tolerance (NGT), exhibit similar adverse perinatal complications and fetal overgrowth to women with gestational diabetes. Obesity has been identified by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as the leading health problem in pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In fact, obesity in pregnancies of women with NGT likely contributes to a larger percentage of adverse outcomes and infant macrosomia (birth weight &#x0003e;4,000 g) than does gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) trial demonstrated that lower glucose values than those currently adopted to diagnose gestational diabetes result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), debate persists over what constitutes normoglycemia in pregnancy and whether normal-weight and obese women have similar glycemic patterns if diet is controlled. In addition, the relative importance of other metabolic factors promoting adiposity in infants born to obese mothers requires clarification.</p><p>We prospectively used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to address whether obese women exhibit higher glycemic profiles both early and late in gestation, whether these glycemic profiles are influenced by dietary habits, and which specific glucose parameters correlate with infant percentage body fat. We hypothesized that obese pregnant women who do not fulfill criteria for gestational diabetes might exhibit occult hyperglycemia but that controlling macronutrient composition and energy intake would blunt these differences. We also postulated that 24-h glucose measures (24-h area under the curve [AUC]) would correlate best with infant percentage body fat.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Subjects and screening measures</title><p>Normal-weight (BMI 20&#x02013;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI 30&#x02013;38 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) women with NGT were enrolled from the University of Colorado Hospital vicinity at &#x0003c;15 weeks&#x02019; gestation. Inclusion criteria included having singleton pregnancies, being aged 18&#x02013;35 years, being English speaking, and having a fasting blood glucose (FBG) &#x0003c;95 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria included having a history of diabetes, hypertension, triglycerides &#x0003e;400 mg/dL, chronic diseases; tobacco or alcohol use; or treatment with steroids/&#x003b2;-blockers. A 1-h 50-g oral glucose challenge (50 g) was performed prior to 16 weeks, and if the glucose was &#x02265;135 mg/dL, a 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance test was performed (3-h oral glucose tolerance test). Women who tested positive for gestational diabetes at baseline or 24&#x02013;28 weeks&#x02019; gestation were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Both early (14&#x02013;16 weeks) and late (26&#x02013;28 weeks) in gestation, all women had FBG, insulin, C-peptide, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), and nonesterified free fatty acids (FFAs) measured. Triglycerides were measured in early gestation only. Resting metabolic rate was measured both early and late in gestation (True One 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT; or Vmax CareFusion, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>CGM and dietary control</title><p>Interstitial glucose profiles were measuring using CGMS Gold (MiniMed, Symlar, CA) for 96 h (4 days) in early and late gestation. The CGM system (CGMS) was calibrated four times per day against finger-stick glucose determinations, as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines. During the first 2 days of each 4-day study period, women were instructed to eat and drink whatever they typically consumed (ad libitum). On the morning of study day 3, subjects were given a defined 2-day eucaloric diet prepared by the metabolic kitchen of the Clinical Translational Research Center. Energy intake for the controlled diet was calculated as the measured resting metabolic rate multiplied by 1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The macronutrient composition of the diet was 50% carbohydrate (&#x02264;20% simple carbohydrate), 35% fat, and 15% protein, and calories were distributed throughout the day, with 12.5% of energy at breakfast, 28% at lunch, 28% at dinner. The remaining calories (31.5%) were divided among three snacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Subjects spoke with a dietitian at the end of the 2-day ad libitum diet period to complete a dietary recall, which was used to estimate energy, carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake of the ad libitum diet (Nutrition Data System for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). To minimize any run-in effect, CGM data were analyzed using only the second day of each diet period (days 2 and 4).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Infant adiposity</title><p>Infant weight, length, and head circumference were measured within the first 24 h after birth. Tricep and subscapular skinfolds and abdominal circumference were measured in triplicate by a single observer within 48 h of birth. The sum of the two skinfold measurements and the sex of the child were used to estimate percentage body fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Calculation of power</title><p>Sample size was estimated based on published CGMS findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>); a difference of 9 mg/dL was detected between 1-h postprandial glucose in 42 normal-weight women (103 &#x000b1; 13 mg/dL) and 15 obese women (112 &#x000b1; 13 mg/dL). Forty participants was predicted to result in 94% power with &#x003b1; = 0.025 for a two-sided, two-group <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat for Windows version 2.03 (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Missing data from the 24-h CGMS profiles were replaced with data corresponding to the same time period from the adjacent day for the same diet. To examine the effects of the control versus ad libitum diets and early versus late pregnancy, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with one-factor repetition was used. A Tukey post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons. Percentage relative cumulative frequency curves were generated to comprehensively depict CGMS data. For plasma measurements, <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare differences among groups. When data were nonnormally distributed, a Mann-Whitney rank sum was used. Pearson product moment correlations were used to correlate maternal metabolic parameters with neonatal size measurements. A forward stepwise regression was used to generate models between infant adiposity and maternal metabolic parameters. Data are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SEM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s11"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Study measurements occurred at 15.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 weeks&#x02019; (early) and 27.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 weeks&#x02019; (late) gestation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> depicts maternal demographics, fasting plasma measures, and size-related infant outcomes. Of 50 subjects initially enrolled, 12 did not complete the study because of the demands of the study (<italic>n</italic> = 4), an early (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or late (<italic>n</italic> = 2) diagnosis of gestational diabetes, lack of completion of both study phases (<italic>n</italic> = 3), incomplete newborn data (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (<italic>n</italic> = 1). There were no differences between groups in maternal weight gain or FBG. Fasting insulin, C-peptide, and FFAs were higher in obese compared with normal-weight women, both early and late in pregnancy. Triglycerides were not a primary metabolic variable in the study, as designed, and only were measured early to ensure that subjects were not at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis. However, triglycerides were significantly higher in the obese mothers (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Birth weight, gestational age, and infant macrosomia were not statistically different between the offspring of both groups. However, percentage body fat was significantly higher in the offspring of obese compared with normal-weight subjects, as were measurements of the triceps, subscapular, and the sum of both skinfolds.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Maternal and infant characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal weight</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Obese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maternal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.4 &#x000b1;

Given the lack of appreciable effect of the ad libitum versus control diet on glycemic parameters, all comparisons between the groups were subsequently analyzed on the control diet.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>CGMS data and macronutrient intake in normal-weight and obese subjects late in pregnancy on control and ad libitum diets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left" scope="col" colspan="1"/><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control<hr/></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ad libitum<hr/></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control<hr/></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ad libitum<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" align="center" scope="colgroup" rowspan="1">Normal weight</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal weight</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Obese</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Obese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glucose (mg/dL)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Fasting glucose</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87 &#x000b1;

The strongest correlation with infant percentage body fat was early fasting triglycerides in pregnancy, although late fasting FFAs, fasting insulin, and the mean daytime glucose also were highly correlated independent of maternal BMI. This is the first CGMS study to carefully control diet in addition to gestational age and to use the percentage relative cumulative frequency curves to portray all of the glycemic data. The higher glycemic patterns in the obese women were unrelated to diet.</p><p>Previous studies using CGM in pregnancy have not controlled for diet or examined the relationship between glycemic patterns and neonatal adiposity. The only CGM study comparing glycemic patterns in normal-weight versus obese women did not control for gestational age; women were studied between 23 and 36 weeks&#x02019; (29.7 &#x000b1; 6.2 weeks) gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In that study, normal-weight women exhibited a mean 1-h postprandial glucose of 103 mg/dL compared with 112 mg/dL in obese women, similar to our mean of 102 mg/dL and 115 mg/dL, respectively. All values were much lower than current standards that recommend a 1-h postprandial glucose &#x02264;140 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It was a surprise that unlike our study, obese women in the first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) demonstrated lower nocturnal glucose compared with normal-weight women, but dietary intake was uncontrolled. The only CGM study in pregnancy in which gestational age was controlled for included normal-weight healthy pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 32) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A mean 2-h postprandial glucose of 100 mg/dL was reported at 30 weeks&#x02019; gestation and similar to our study, with a mean of 96 mg/dL at 26&#x02013;28 weeks&#x02019; gestation in our normal-weight women. One-hour postprandial values were not reported in this study, and diet was not controlled, but diet records showed consistent caloric intake over the course of pregnancy. Those data, with our data, bring current postprandial therapeutic targets into question.</p><p>In addition, we graphically present the percentage of relative cumulative frequency curves of all glucose values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref><italic>.</italic> Glucose concentrations are shifted to the right in obese women, indicating a higher glucose exposure to the fetus over a 24-h period. This was true even when diet was controlled, suggesting the potential for greater fetal hyperinsulinemia. Of interest, only glycemic profiles later in pregnancy were associated with infant percentage body fat, and the strongest predictor was the mean daytime glucose, a value representing the fed state between 6:30 <sc>a.m.</sc> and 11:30 <sc>p.m.</sc></p><p>An unexpected finding was that the strongest correlations with infant percentage body fat were not indices of glucose availability but triglycerides (<italic>r</italic> = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), measured early, and FFAs (<italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) measured late in pregnancy. Other investigators have shown that fasting maternal triglycerides and FFAs in the third trimester are correlated with birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and, more recently, these metabolites were found to correlate with estimates of neonatal adiposity by skinfold measures in well-controlled patients with gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Furthermore, investigators from this study have previously reported that the increase in triglycerides from early to late pregnancy was the most predictive of neonatal adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) in both normal-weight and obese women. Although early maternal BMI correlated with neonatal adiposity (<italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), it did not add to the predictive value of triglycerides in a stepwise regression model. Our data show that in addition to lipids, fasting maternal insulin, an estimate of maternal insulin resistance, and mean daytime glucose, which reflects the postprandial state, also are significant correlates of infant percentage body fat in glucose-tolerant women late in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>A number of limitations warrant additional consideration. It is possible that the ad libitum diet was not significantly different from the control diet in both populations because the women were being actively monitored by CGM, affecting their behavior. In our study, the mean glucose, mean daytime glucose, and 1-h postprandial dinner glucose late in pregnancy were correlated with infant percentage body fat but not 1-h postprandial breakfast. This may be a result of only 12.5% of the total calories being given at breakfast, as recommended by Peterson and Jovanovic-Peterson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) compared with 28% at lunch and dinner. Differences between the postprandial measures may have been blunted because the remaining calories were distributed throughout the day as snacks. Therefore, the measure that is likely to best represent the fed state is the mean daytime glucose, which was the glycemic measure most correlated with infant percentage body fat. An incongruity in the data are that the plasma FBG levels are lower in normal-weight and obese women late in pregnancy (74 &#x000b1; 2 and 78 &#x000b1; 3 mg/dL, respectively) compared with the fasting CGMS values on controlled diets. This may be attributed to the technical aspects of the CGMS-derived glucose values and variable times between bedtime snack consumption and arising in the morning during the CGM period, compared with a consistent 9- to 10-h fast for the plasma samples.</p><p>In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that obese pregnant women with NGT manifest higher glycemic profiles than normal-weight women when both diet and gestational age are tightly controlled. Thus, &#x0201c;relative hyperglycemia&#x0201d; in obese women with NGT may contribute to excess fetal fat accretion and partially explain the observed increased macrosomic rate in the literature. However, obese women also manifest higher fasting triglyceride and FFA levels than normal-weight women, which correlate most strongly with infant adiposity. Such findings have direct implications for future interventional studies targeting these metabolic parameters in glucose-tolerant women to prevent excess fetal growth.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>See accompanying editorial, p. <related-article related-article-type="commentary" id="d32e1282" vol="34" page="2331" ext-link-type="pmc">2331</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>D.H.B. received support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant K24-DK-002935.
