velocity, the functional reach test (FR) and the simple reaction times (SRT) in young
amateur baseball players after lumbar spine patterns of neuromuscular joint facilitation
(NJF) treatment. [Subjects] The subjects were 11 young amateur baseball players. An NJF
intervention and a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) intervention were
performed. The interventions were performed one after the other with one week between
them. The order of the interventions was completely randomized. [Methods] The baseball
pitching velocity, the FR and the SRT were evaluated before and after treatment. [Results]
In the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, FR and
SRT after treatment. In the PNF group, there was a significant difference in SRT after
treatment. [Conclusion] NJF intervention shortens the SRT, increases the baseball pitching
velocity and FR, and may be recommended to improve performance in baseball players.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation</kwd><kwd>Baseball pitching velocity</kwd><kwd>Functional reach test</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) is a new therapeutic exercise based on kinesiology

baseball players after lumbar spine patterns of neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF)
treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were eleven young amateur baseball players (mean age, 21.6 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years; mean
height, 173.0 &#x000b1; 4.0&#x02005;cm; mean weight, 68.4 &#x000b1; 11.6&#x02005;kg). A NJF intervention (NJF group) and
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) intervention (PNF group) were performed on
all subjects. The interventions were performed one after the other with one week between
them. The order of the interventions was completely randomized. All subjects were screened
before the start of the study by filling out a medical history questionnaire. The
questionnaire addressed whether subjects had a history of cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal,
somatosensory, or neurological disorders. If so, they were excluded from the study. All
subjects gave their informed consent for participation in the study. All experimental
procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Jilin
Dianli Hospital.</p><p>A physical therapist conducted the clinical examination, which included measurement of
baseball pitching velocity, the FR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
the SRT.</p><p>When measuring the baseball pitching velocity, the distance between the pitching rubber and
home plate is 18.44&#x02005;m according to the officially recognized rules of baseball. The
velocities of five balls were measured with the pitchers attempting to pitch into the strike
zone as quickly as possible. The averaged value was used for analysis. The pitching velocity
measurement instrument used was sports radar gun SR3600 (Dynatec Corporation, Kobe,
Japan).</p><p>A digital audio player/recorder (Rio Japan, Kawasaki, Japan) was used as an auditory
stimulator to measure the SRT. The recording device was a digital voice recorder (Panasonic
Corporation, Osaka, Japan). An auditory stimulation file was prepared on a computer in
advance. The file was created as a series of 16 warning signals and auditory stimuli (50&#x02005;ms)
using the overtone opinion processing software DigiOnSound5 (DigiOn, Fukuoka, Japan). The
file was recorded on the digital audio player/recorder; and the digital audio
player/recorder was connected to a digital voice recorder and a headset using a two-socket
adaptor so as to form an auditory cue box. The timing of the warning signal was completely
random and always sounded 2&#x02013;5 seconds before the auditory stimulus. The auditory cue box was
attached to the abdominal region of the subjects to measure the reaction time. The subjects
were required to respond to the auditory cues by loudly saying the word &#x0201c;Pa&#x0201d; as quickly as
possible. The headset was placed on the subjects. The warning signal, auditory stimulus and
response of the subjects were recorded on the digital voice recorder. The SRT was measured a
total of five times consecutively while the subjects sat on a chair. Prior to the
experiment, the subjects were informed of what would be done in the experiment, and they
performed trial runs to familiarize themselves with the procedure. The data were input into
a personal computer, and the DigiOnSound5 sound processing software was used for the
analysis.</p><p>Four lumbar spine patterns of NJF were used. The patterns were the pelvic anterior
elevation-proximal fixation pattern, pelvic posterior depression-proximal fixation pattern,
pelvic anterior depression-proximal fixation pattern, and pelvic posterior
elevation-proximal fixation pattern. Each pattern was performed three times at random as a
passive exercise and as a resistance exercise for the right and left sides of the subjects.
In the NJF group intervention, both proximal resistance and distal resistance exercises were
performed. In the PNF group intervention, only distal resistance exercise was performed. The
intervention was performed by the same physical therapist to avoid individual variations in
treatment.</p><p>Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for statistically significant differences,
and the factors were intervention and group. If a significant interaction was found, the
paired t-test was performed to compare before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed
using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of statistical significant was set as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, FR and

amateur baseball players. After NJF intervention, there were significant increases in the
baseball pitching velocity and the FR, and the SRT was shortened after treatment.</p><p>An important difference between the interventions methods was that proximal fixation of the
lumbar vertebrae of the spines was performed in the NJF group. Mobilization of the lumbar
facet occurred as a result of proximal fixation. The function of the lumbar facet was
improved by the NJF intervention. Trunk function was improved, the power from the lower
limbs was transmitted easily to pitch arm, and the pitching velocity was increased in the
pitching motion. This implies that the flexibility of the trunk was improved and that the FR
was increased by the proximal fixation.</p><p>The shortened SRT means that arousal levels and attentiveness were improved after the NJF
intervention and PNF intervention. Therefore, NJF may be recommended to improve performance
in baseball players.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Huo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: Neuromuscular Joint Facilitation.
