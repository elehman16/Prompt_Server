The modern trabeculectomy is a safe and effective procedure, with a high success rate. The chief aim is to allow aqueous to bypass the trabecular meshwork into the sub-conjunctival space, but at the same time, ensuring an optimum intraocular pressure (IOP) as well as maintaining the anatomy of the anterior chamber (AC).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>However, the success rate of trabeculectomy is reduced in patients younger than 40 years, black race, chronic use of topical medications as beta-blockers or pilocarpine and chronic conjunctival inflammation. To raise the success rate in high-risk group, adjuvants to trabeculectomy as antimetabolites, amniotic membrane transplantation, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) implants, have been tried to enhance and maintain the hypotensive effect of trabeculectomy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Mitomycin C (MMC) is an antimetabolite that induces DNA damage by alkylation and possibly crosslinking. Free radicals are also generated that can damage many nonspecific aspects of cell function including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Unfortunately, antimetabolite-augmented glaucoma surgery can be associated with a higher frequency of prolonged wound leaks, hypotony with choroidal effusions and maculopathy, thin avascular blebs, and/or bleb leaks with late infection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Recently, a new biodegradable porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) copolymer matrix implant has been proposed for glaucoma surgery. Ologen collagen matrix (Aeon Astron Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) is a biodegradable implant, available in various shapes and dimensions that may maintain the hypotensive effect in glaucoma surgery.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Its porous structure should force conjunctival fibroblasts and myofibroblasts to grow into the pores and impair connective tissue lay down reducing scar formation and wound contraction. After the implantation, the device should completely degrade within 90&#x02013;180 days.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of trabeculectomy augmented with either Ologen implant or intraoperative different concentrations of MMC (0.02 and 0.04 mg/ml). We will investigate the hypothesis that Ologen implant may be a safer alternative to the use of antimetabolites as an adjuvant in trabeculectomy surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting and venue</title><p>This was a prospective, interventional, open-label, comparative clinical study conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Assiut University, between December 2014 and April 2016.

Primary OAG (POAG) was diagnosed on the basis of IOP measurements more than 21 mmHg, open angle on gonioscopy (Grade 3 or 4 on Schaffer grading system for angle width), glaucomatous visual field defects consistent with glaucomatous optic disc changes. PNAG was diagnosed by the presence of narrow or occludable angle on gonioscopy (Grade 2, or 1 on Schaffer grading system for angle width in at least 180&#x000b0; of the total circumference of the angle in primary position without indentation), glaucomatous optic disc changes, visual field defects and IOP more than 21 mmHg. Exclusion criteria were pregnant or lactating female, previous intraocular surgery, one-eyed patients, previous ocular trauma, uveitis-induced glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, aphakic/pseudophakic glaucoma, systemic connective tissue disease and missing more than 3 follow-up visits. Trabeculectomy augmented by either MMC or Ologen implant was indicated to study subjects if they had uncontrolled IOP under maximum antiglaucoma medications (3 antiglaucoma drugs) or due to poor socioeconomic status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patient evaluation</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Preoperative assessment</title><p>Preoperative baseline data were obtained 1 day before surgery and included ocular and medical history (including the use of topical antiglaucoma medications and their number, presence of systemic diseases, for example, diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment (Landolt C chart), Manifest refraction (Huvitz auto-refractor-keratometer), Anterior segment assessment (Haag-Streit Slit lamp), IOP measurement (ICare rebound tonometer and Goldmann applanation tonometer, measurements were carried out at the same time of the day [from 10 am to 2 pm] to eliminate the effect of diurnal variation), gonioscopy (Goldmann 3-mirror contact lens), fundus Biomicroscopy to assess retina and optic disc parameters (e.g., vertical C/D ratio) (+90 D Volk non-contact lens) and visual field assessment (Octopus automated perimetry).</p><p>After recruitment of the patients, they were allocated into one of three treatment groups; trabeculectomy augmented by Ologen implant, trabeculectomy augmented by MMC (0.4 mg/ml) or trabeculectomy augmented by MMC (0.2 mg/ml).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Preparation of Mitomycin C with different dilutions</title><p>Mitomycin-C Kyowa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Biochem Pharmaceutical Industries, India) 10 mg vial was used.

Ologen should completely be degraded within 90&#x02013;180 days after its implantation. When inserted under the conjunctiva at the time of trabeculectomy, it not only acts as a reservoir but also helps to separate mechanically the conjunctiva and episcleral surface and prevent adhesions between them.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Ologen consists of &#x0003e;90% lyophilized porcine atelocollagen and &#x0003c;10% lyophilized porcine GAG. Atelocollagen is a highly purified pepsin-treated type I collagen. Currently, two types of Ologen are used in glaucoma surgery, 12 mm in diameter with 1 mm of thickness and 6 mm in diameter with 2 mm of thickness.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Under peri-bulbar (2 cc of bupivacaine 0.5% +2 cc of xylocaine 2% +1 cc of hyaluronidase 1500 IU/ml) or general anesthesia, a partial thickness corneal traction suture was applied 2 mm from the limbus using 5/0 vicryl suture. A fornix-based conjunctival flap at the superior limbus was dissected along with the underlying tenon's capsule exposing the sclera. A trial to control bleeding was first attempted by micro-sponge application, and if failed, gentle electrocautery was applied. Delineation of a 4 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm rectangular superficial scleral flap was achieved by #15 surgical scalpel blade. Partial thickness superficial scleral flap was created by using a curved crescent knife to about 2/3 scleral thickness till reaching clear cornea. In the MMC Group, MMC soaked sponges (with concentration of 0.4 mg/ml or 0.2 mg/ml) were placed in the sub-conjunctival space over a wide area up to the fornices and beneath the superficial scleral flap for 3 min (first sponge was used to sweep the sub-conjunctival space and deep scleral bed, then 3&#x02013;4 sponges were embedded in the subconjunctival space). The sponges were then removed, and the area exposed to MMC was copiously irrigated with 30&#x02013;50 cc of saline. Fashioning of corneoscleral tissue block measuring 1 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm was performed using a microvitreoretinal blade (MVR blade) preceded by a paracentesis. By using Vanna's scissors, the internal tissue block was removed and wide basal peripheral iridectomy was done. The superficial scleral flap was closed with two 10/0 Nylon suture at the angles. In Ologen group, a 6 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm Ologen implant was placed on top of the sclera and the conjunctiva (overlying the superficial scleral flap), and then the conjunctiva was secured with two 8/0 Vicryl wing sutures. A 10/0 Nylon transverse mattress suture was done to avoid an aqueous leak. Wound sealing test was done by intra-ocular irrigation of saline through the paracentesis to check for wound leak and bleb formation. Stromal hydration was done for the closure of paracentesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Postoperative medications</title><p>Postoperatively, all patients were treated with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops 5 times daily for 4 weeks followed by gradual tapering according to physician judgment, gatifloxacin eye drops 5 times daily for 2 weeks, and cyclopentolate 1% eye drops 3 times daily for 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>Postoperative visits were scheduled at day 1, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 12, and week 24.

We found the success rate of trabeculectomy at week 24 was similar in MMC groups and higher than Ologen group (90% and 80% in the MMC and Ologen groups, respectively) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>].</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Slit-lamp photography of trabeculectomy 1 and and 6 months post-operatively.

They reported about early hypotony in 60% of cases in Ologen group as compared to 30% in MMC 0.2 mg/ml. This could be attributed to their surgical protocol of loose single suturing of the scleral flap. They also reported a single case of suprachoroidal effusion. We reported shallow AC more common than Rosentreter <italic>et al</italic>. In contrary of the current study, they reported more frequent cases of early hypotony in all treatment groups. No cases of Tenon cyst was reported in contrast to 2 cases in the study conducted by Rosentreter <italic>et al</italic>. We could explain such finding by the 24-week follow-up duration, while Tenon cyst takes more time to develop in most of cases. Also, no cases of bleb leak were found in the study. On the other hand, Rosentreter <italic>et al</italic>. reported 3 cases of bleb leak on Ologen group and 2 cases in MMC group. This could be explained by watertight closure of conjunctiva along with transverse mattress suture at the limbus securing the conjunctival sealing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Cillino <italic>et al</italic>. reported higher rates of early hypotony in both MMC 0.2 mg/ml and Ologen groups (40% and 20%, respectively) than found in the current study. Also, they reported higher rates of suprachoroidal effusion in MMC 0.2 mg/ml and Ologen groups (25% and 10%, respectively) than current study, although the single case of suprachoroidal effusion was with a higher concentration of MMC (0.4 mg/ml).[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Senthil <italic>et al</italic>. had reported similar rates of postoperative complications regarding shallow AC and hypotony. However, they presented a higher rate of early hyphema in Ologen group and attributed it to loose scleral flap suturing (as recommended by the manufacturer) that allowed the ooze from the cut-ends of the sclera to enter into the AC. Also, a higher but similar rate of suprachoroidal effusion had been documented (21% in Ologen group and 15% in MMC 0.4 mg/ml).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the Ologen implant may be a safe and effective alternative to MMC for improving the long-term success rate of trabeculectomy surgery and may avoid the side effects associated with the use of adjunctive therapy, such as MMC. Limits related to the small sample size must be overcome by further larger sample size and randomized trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of this implant. However, MMC-augmented trabeculectomy yielded a lower IOP reduction, but the Ologen augmented trabeculectomy provided a safe adjuvant in terms of surgical complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interventional study to compare the safety and efficacy of Ologen collagen implant with different concentrations of MMC (both high concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and low concentration of 0.2 mg/ml).</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>None to declare.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trabeculectomy.
