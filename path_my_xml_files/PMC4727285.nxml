Screening is widely recommended for the early detection of CRC and is associated with improved survival outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In England, the National Health Service (NHS) runs an organised population-based screening programme for CRC (the &#x02018;NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme&#x02019;; BCSP) which offers biennial guaiac faecal occult blood testing (gFOBt) to men and women aged 60&#x02013;74 years. However, uptake of the BCSP is the lowest of the three organised cancer screening programmes in England, with only 54&#x000a0;% of the age-eligible population taking up the screening test offer for CRC, compared with around 75&#x000a0;% in the breast and cervical cancer screening programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Multi-component reminders, such as follow-up postal-reminders with scheduling assistance and successive rounds of telephone reminders are among the most effective methods to improve uptake of cancer screening services, yielding results over and above those of one-off postal reminders alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In recent studies, researchers have also focused on the potential of mobile health (m-health) technologies to promote adherence to healthcare appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several studies have highlighted that pre-appointment text-messages are not only an effective alternative for delivering reminders, but an acceptable and often preferred method of communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In the United States, a randomised trial examining the effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy to increase uptake of gFOBt-based CRC screening through community health centres found that text-message reminders, when used in conjunction with postal and automated telephone reminders, achieved uptake rates of 82&#x000a0;% (which compared favourably with the 37&#x000a0;% rates observed in the usual care group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the context of organised screening in the UK, two recent studies found that text-message pre-appointment reminders were effective at increasing attendance at routine breast screening appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; the effectiveness of text-message reminders to promote uptake of gFOBt screening for CRC in the NHS BCSP however, has not been examined yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Unlike pre-appointment reminders for the NHS Breast Screening programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] a reminder for CRC screening would act as an additional prompt to complete and return a gFOBt kit beyond the standard 4&#x000a0;week postal reminder.</p><p id="Par8">This paper, therefore, describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which will examine the effectiveness of adding a text-message reminder to the current NHS BCSP.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par9">The primary aim of this RCT will be to test the effectiveness (intention-to-treat analysis) of a text-message reminder to promote gFOBt uptake in the English BCSP (i.e. the total proportion of people adequately screened).</p><p id="Par10">The secondary aim will be to examine the efficacy (per-protocol analysis) of the text-message reminder to promote gFOBt uptake among screening-eligible adults with a registered mobile number at their General Practice (GP).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">This study will be a non-clinical RCT with two parallel arms (control &#x00026; intervention).

All GPs based within six pre-selected Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs: NHS organisations that manage patient care in GPs in defined geographical areas) will be invited to participate in the study. CCGs have been pre-selected on the basis that they are London-based and consistently achieve low CRC screening uptake rates (less than 50&#x000a0;%). Namely, we will invite GPs from the following CCGs: Greenwich, Croydon, Lewisham, West London, Hammersmith &#x00026; Fulham, and Hounslow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par14">GPs will be eligible to take part in this study if: 1) they have been using text messaging services to communicate with their patients for a minimum of 12&#x000a0;months (this is to ensure that the individuals who will be included in this study have been given the opportunity to opt-out and/or consent to their GP contacting them via m-health services); and 2) they are not part of any other project or initiative to improve CRC screening uptake in London (to minimise confounding).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment of general practices</title><p id="Par15">All GPs located within the six aforementioned CCGs (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;290) will be sent an invitation to participate in this study.

The invitation letter will stipulate that a practice can only take part in the study if the practice meets the inclusion criteria and provides written consent. Similar studies examining the effectiveness of primary care-based materials to promote CRC screening have achieved response rates as high as 80&#x000a0;% when practices were offered an opt-out for their collaboration in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

A gFOBt kit and instructions follow 8&#x02013;10 days later; the individual is asked to collect samples from three consecutive bowel motions and to then return the completed kit to the Hub in a pre-paid envelope for processing. Repeat gFOBt kits are sent out where the returned kit has been completed improperly (a &#x02018;spoilt kit&#x02019;), where there is a technical failure in processing the kit or where there is an unclear result. A reminder letter is sent out after four weeks after the initial invitation. If thirteen more weeks pass with no response, the screening episode is closed (i.e. after 18&#x000a0;weeks) and the individuals practice receives a letter of notification regarding their non-participation in the programme. If the test results are abnormal, a referral is made to the local screening centre for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Text-message Reminder (Intervention Group)</title><p id="Par17">Those who are randomised to the intervention group will be invited to participate in the NHS BCSP as per standard practice; and, additionally, receive a text-message reminder if they have not returned the test kit within eight weeks of receiving their initial invitation letter (i.e. three weeks after the non-response reminder letter).

The expected uptake of CRC screening in the control group (43.51&#x000a0;%) was based on the uptake in the selected CCGs in London between May and October 2014. The anticipated improvement in uptake in the intervention group (5 percentage points, to 48.51&#x000a0;%) was based on the results from similar studies evaluating the effectiveness of text-message reminders to facilitate uptake in other areas of healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

A direct communication from primary care via a text reminder is therefore likely to benefit patients in their decision making by recommendation of bowel screening through a trusted source. In turn, if the text-message reminder is effective, the NHS (and Primary Care) would benefit by having to treat fewer late stage CRCs, due to an increase in uptake and, subsequently, screen-detected cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The challenge arising from delivering text-message reminders in this way will depend upon the acceptance and willingness of healthcare professionals to adopt innovations in information technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This will be evaluated after the recruitment process of the GPs, and the response rate will be useful in the future recruitment of GPs for research using m-health technologies.</p><p id="Par44">Another important issue will be mobile phone coverage and more specifically the accuracy of the mobile phone records in primary care.
