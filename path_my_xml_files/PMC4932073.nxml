mobilization (IASTM) in patients. The purpose of this study was to investigated the
effects of the Graston technique and general exercise on pain and range of motion (ROM) in
patients with CLBP. [Subjects and Methods] 30 patients with CLBP participated in the study
(Graston technique: 15; Control: 15). Before and after the 4-week intervention program,
pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Lumbar ROM was measured using a
smartphone. The main effects and interaction were analyzed by two-way repeated ANOVA.
[Results] A significant time-by-group interaction was observed for the VAS and ROM. A post
hoc paired t-test showed that pain decreased significantly post-intervention within the
Graston group. The lumbar ROM significantly increased post-intervention in both groups.
[Conclusion] The Graston technique and general exercise resulted in pain relief and
increased ROM. However, the Graston group showed significantly increased VAS and ROM more
than control group. These findings suggest that the Graston technique can be useful as a
pain decrease and ROM increase for patients with CLBP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Graston technique</kwd><kwd>Range of motion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>CLBP patients when bending forward to going back because of the balance of the posterior

patients than in healthy subjects. This study demonstrated that neuromuscular coordination
between trunk and hip could be abnormal in patients with CLBP<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization or simply (IASTM) is a new range of tool which
enables clinicians to efficiently locate and treat individuals diagnosed with soft tissue
dysfunction. IASTM is a procedure that is rapidly growing in popularity due to its
effectiveness and efficiency while remaining non-invasive, with its own indications and
limitations. Gehlsen et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated
the effects of 3 separate IASTM pressures on rat achilles tendons. They concluded that
fibroblast production is directly proportional to the magnitude of IASTM pressure used by
the clinician. Davidson et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> supported
Gehlsen et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> by concluding that
intramuscular (IM) significantly increased fibroblast production in rat achilles tendons by
using electron microscopy to analyze tissue samples following IM application. Davidson et

rough endoplasmic reticulum following IM application. Thus, indicating micro trauma to
damaged tissues, resulting in an acute fibroblast respons<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this study indicate that an application of IASTM to
the posterior shoulder provides acute improvements in both glenohumeral horizontal adduction
range of motion (ROM) and internal rotation ROM among baseball players<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, we determined the changes in the pain and ROM of back muscles after
therapy using the Graston technique in patients with CLBP. We hypothesized that Graston
technique would increase ROM and decrease pain more than the general exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 30 patients (17 females, 13 males) with low back pain who visited B
Hospital, Busan, Korea. Inclusion criteria included onset of low back pain of less than 12
weeks, CLBP (&#x0003e;90 days at time of enrolment)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exclusion criteria were a history of back surgery<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients who had spinal fracture within six
months and spinal tumor or other malignancy, and medicine for psychiatric disorder and who
had possibility of exaggerated complaints due to automobile or accident insurance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. All of the participants read and signed an
informed consent form approved by the Inje University Ethics Committee for Human
Investigations. Control group (n=15) age 33.0 &#x000b1; 9.9, height 165.6 &#x000b1; 7.9, body weight 61.8 &#x000b1;
12.9, and VAS score 48.9 &#x000b1; 14.6. Graston group (n=15) age 40.6 &#x000b1; 14.6, height 169.3 &#x000b1; 10.2,
body weight 63.9 &#x000b1; 15.6, and VAS score 50.6 &#x000b1; 12.7.</p><p>To measure lumbar ROM, hip ROM inclinometer application, Android 4.0 phone (Samsung Galaxy
S3, SHV-E210S) was used. Data were collected using an Android 4.0 phone ROM was recorded.
The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.90<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Graston group used the DR. YOUSTM (SEED Technology; Bucheon, Republic of Korea) for
Graston technique. The intervention was used to provide were used to IASTM the Graston
technique of subjects.</p><p>Pain level was evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS; 100&#x02005;mm)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Zero indicated no pain and 100&#x02005;mm indicate the worst pain level.
The VAS score of 17&#x02005;mm is reported as minimal clinically important difference<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar, hip ROM was measured with an
inclinometer application. To measure lumbar flexion/extension, the neutral position, with
feet 15&#x02005;cm apart and heels aligned with floor tape. Smartphone placement were used at the
T12&#x02013;L1 between interspinous junction and S1 tubercle<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient was asked to maximally flex/extend, keeping the knees
straight, at which points readings were taken from inclinometer application. The method
purport to record true lumbar flexion/extension without sacral involvement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure lumbar lateral bending,
smartphone placed at T12&#x02013;L1 between over the sacrum according. The patient in full lateral
bending right/left. Hip flexion ROM was measured with participants in the supine position
smartphone was firmly attached with adhesive tape to the anterior aspect of the thigh, two
centimeters proximal to the superior pole of the patella. The reading on the smartphone held
against the skin laterally at the midpoint of the thigh (determined as midway between the
lateral femoral condyle and greater trochanter) with the leg relaxed in neutral hip
rotation, were recorded<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maximal active
hip flexion was then performed with the knee in flexion and recorded at the point at which a
pain was experienced. This position was then maintained for three seconds to allow the
smartphone to record the measurement<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
We measured each motion in three trials and recorded the average.</p><p>The Graston group performed IASTM using the DR. YOUSTM during 4 weeks: posterior fascia,
sacrum, hip lateral rotators, and hamstring bilaterally and general exercise. In the first,
subjects were asked to kneel directly on the bed. The posterior fascia IASTM was microtrauma
to stimulation lumbar posterior muscle erector spinae (iliocostalis, longissimus), and
multifidus. The sacrum IASTM, subjects were asked to kneel directly on the bed. The hip
lateral rotators IASTM was applied to kneeling prone position with knee and hip flexion
sidelying position at gluteus maximus and gluteus medius. The hamstring bilaterally IASTM
was applieded to prone position at biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. The
IASTM treatment was applied for approximately 20-seconds in a direction parallel to the
muscle fibers being treated with the instrument at a 45&#x000b0; angle. Followed immediately by
treating the muscles in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers with the instrument
at a 45&#x000b0; angle for an additional 20-seconds, resulting in a total treatment time of
approximately 40 seconds.</p><p>The control group was applied general exercise. General exercise were applied with
stretching exercises and stationary bicycling for 10&#x02013;15 minutes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three sets of
fifteen repetitions were performed, with rest times of 1 minute between sets during 4
weeks.</p><p>We expressed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the VAS scores and ROM. Statistical
analyses were performed with the SPSS software (ver. 22.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA). A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the
main effect and any interaction between the VAS score and ROM. The within-group factor was
time (pre-intervention vs. post-intervention) and the between-group factor was group
(Graston vs. Control). A p-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. If a
significant main effect or time-by-group interaction effect was detected, a post hoc
independent and paired t-test was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Significant main effects of time were observed in pain. VAS scores significantly decreased

However, few studies have investigated the effect of soft tissue mobilization on ROM, pain
in patients with CLBP. We investigated the effects of the Graston technique compare with
general exercise in patients with CLBP. Our results show that the Graston technique
decreased pain and increased ROM in patients with CLBP. These results confirm that both
methods lead to pain relief and increased ROM. These findings indicate that the Graston
technique could be recommended in the rehabilitation of patients with CLBP.</p><p>The Graston group showed improvements decreased pain and increased ROM. In this study, pain
significantly decreased in Graston group. Our results are consistent with other reports<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies explained that pain decreases could be affected
erector spinae activity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and back
muscle activity was decrease<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results demonstrated that after performing the
Graston technique pain significantly decreased. Thus, Graston technique may help to decrease
lumbar pain in patients with CLBP. Graston technique more than general exercise under these
conditions may drcrease muscle activities, leading to decreased back pain. A VAS score of
17&#x02005;mm is the minimal clinically important difference<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mean differences in VAS score reduced pre- and post-intervention
were 25.1&#x02005;mm in the Graston group and 4.3&#x02005;mm in the control group. We propose that both the
Graston technique compare with general exercise contributed to decrease pain in patients
with CLBP.</p><p>Active lumbar flexion, extension, lateral bending and hip flexion were increased both in
the Graston technique and control group. Graston technique and general exercises are used to
increase ROM and may do nothing more; a meta-analysis indicated that pain modality did not
significantly increase ROM<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This was
because the Graston technique helped to prevent muscle atrophy and restored muscle balance
and general exercise included stretching for improving ROM. Thus, the hypothesis of the
present study was confirmed, as Graston technique increased lumbar and hip ROM more
significantly than the general exercise. However, both the Graston and control groups showed
significantly increased lumbar and hip ROM after the interventions. Consequently, the
Graston technique may be a useful intervention for ROM of lumbar and hip.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, it only investigated changes in pain, ROM
after the Graston technique, and did not measure the muscles activity. Thus, further studies
are required to investigate changes in back muscle activity after the Graston technique.
Second, the duration of intervention was short. Usually, a 6&#x02013;8 week or longer intervention
period has been used because the most significant progress may be made after at least 6
weeks<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, what is the optimal exercise period remains unclear<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results showed that after 4 weeks,
the Graston technique significantly increased ROM and decreased pain. Further research is
needed to investigate the long-term effects of the Graston technique on pain muscle activity
and ROM in patients with CLBP.</p><p>We investigated the effects of the Graston technique on pain and ROM in patients with
chronic low back pain. Both the Graston technique and general exercise induced increased
ROM. However, only the Graston group showed more pain relief and increased ROM. These
findings suggest that the Graston technique can be useful as a pain relief and ROM
increasing program for patients with CLBP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
