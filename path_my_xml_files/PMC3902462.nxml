Diffusion is frequently measured using R, the reproductive rate, which is determined by the duration of use (t), the &#x02018;contagiousness&#x02019; of an intervention (&#x003b2;) and a participant's total contacts (z). We have developed a Facebook &#x02018;app&#x02019; that allows us to enable or disable various components designed to impact the duration of use (expanded content, proactive contact), contagiousness (active and passive sharing) and number of contacts (use by non-smoker supporters). We hypothesised that these elements would be synergistic in their impact on R, while including non-smokers would induce a &#x02018;carrier&#x02019; state allowing the app to bridge clusters of smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is a fractional factorial, randomised control trial of the diffusion of a Facebook application for smoking cessation. Participants recruited through online advertising are randomised to 1 of 12 cells and serve as &#x02018;seed&#x02019; users. All user interactions are tracked, including social interactions with friends. Individuals installing the application that can be traced back to a seed participant are deemed &#x02018;descendants&#x02019; and form the outcome of interest. Analysis will be conducted using Poisson regression, with event count as the outcome and the number of seeds in the cell as the exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results will be reported as a baseline R0 for the reference group, and incidence rate ratio for the remainder of predictors.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and Dissemination</title><p>This study uses an abbreviated consent process designed to minimise barriers to adoption and was deemed to be minimal risk by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Yet, evidence-based interventions recommended by the Clinical Practice Guideline for Tobacco Dependence Treatment (&#x02018;2008 Guideline&#x02019;)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> do not reach the vast majority of the 44 million current smokers in the USA.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> A major paradigm shift in how cessation interventions are developed is needed, targeting a large-scale dissemination and diffusion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In theory, the broad reach and effectiveness of evidence-based Internet cessation programmes should yield enormous impact (reach&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;efficacy<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) in reducing the population prevalence of smoking. The majority (85%) of US adults are Internet users, including populations at disproportionate risk for smoking: 85% of African Americans and 76% of those with incomes less than US$30&#x02005;000/year use the Internet.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Between 6% and 9% of all Internet users (&#x0003e;10 million adults) search for quitting smoking annually.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Studies and multiple meta-analyses<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref> show that Internet interventions are effective with a relative risk of abstinence of 1.44<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and quit rates of 7&#x02013;26%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> Despite this promise, however, only one-third of smokers searching the Internet actually reach the limited number of websites that provide cessation treatment consistent with the 2008 Guideline.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> Most existing Internet cessation interventions that involve social support&#x02014;a key element of tobacco dependence treatment&#x02014;introduce participants into &#x02018;artificial&#x02019; networks in which individuals have no initial connections and often create none. In such networks, participation is limited by affiliation with a particular behaviour (eg, quitting smoking). As a result, potential network effects on individual behaviour and the potential for dissemination are sharply limited by high levels of attrition,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the fact that most registrants never form a single connection,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and those that are formed may be weak and transitory.</p><p>Online social networks may represent a more powerful dissemination channel for evidence-based tobacco dependence treatments. In contrast to the &#x02018;build it and they will come&#x02019; model inherent in smoking-specific online cessation interventions, more general online social networks can be used to deliver proven cessation intervention elements to smokers &#x02018;where they are&#x02019;. Two-thirds (67%) of the US adult Internet users use at least one social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter; importantly, nearly 80% of adults aged 18&#x02013;49 do so,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and 41% of those do so multiple times a day.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This increasing penetration of online social networks into the fabric of the typical American's life provides fascinating, if challenging, opportunities for intervention design. Interventions delivered in the context of an online social network can leverage the availability of an individuals&#x02019; self-identified social ties not only to optimise support for cessation, but also for active and passive distribution of the intervention through an individual's network to other smokers and beyond.</p><p>The importance of social networks on smoking behaviour and &#x02018;viral diffusion&#x02019; has been seen in real-world networks. Data from the Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that smokers tend to cluster within their social networks and are significantly less integrated, that these patterns persist over time, and that clusters of smokers tend to quit together.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These findings suggest that interventions should target not just individual smokers but also their surrounding social network. This proposition is supported by robust evidence that social networks strongly affect social norms, and that within a network, norms may be altered by a single individual and perpetuated by other network members.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, non-smokers may serve as &#x02018;weak ties&#x02019; spanning clusters of smokers, analogous to a disease carrier who transports the disease between remote villages. Recruiting non-smokers to a cessation intervention may augment available social support for cessation, and increase social pressure (complex contagion effects) on other smokers to participate, thereby facilitating viral spread.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>This study aims to identify the variables that drive adoption and dissemination of an intervention throughout a network. The study examines this question within Facebook, the single largest and fastest growing online social network. As of 2013, approximately 143 million Americans use Facebook daily, with users globally sharing an average of 4.7 billion items of content daily.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Facebook enables individuals to create a profile, identify other members who are friends, exchange messages through multiple channels and&#x02014;most relevant to this study&#x02014;install small applications (&#x02018;apps&#x02019;) created by third parties. These apps rely on &#x02018;viral&#x02019; diffusion to grow their user base, and achieve this by inducing users to &#x02018;invite&#x02019; their friends and enabling them to postinformation about the app to their personal &#x02018;Timeline&#x02019; (essentially synonymous with the terms &#x02018;wall&#x02019; or &#x02018;page&#x02019;) where it can be seen by others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004089F1">figure 1</xref>). Data from Facebook suggest that individuals actively communicate with only 5% of their average 120 friends, but are passively exposed to information about 2&#x02013;2.5 times as many.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> By exposing a smoker's entire social network to a stream of &#x02018;pushed&#x02019; information in real-time about their cessation progress (eg, &#x02018;Mary set a quit date&#x02019;), it may be possible to significantly enhance social support for cessation (generating the response &#x02018;way to go Mary!&#x02019; by network ties) and facilitate active and passive diffusion of the intervention.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004089F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Facebook Timeline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004089f01"/></fig><p>The primary outcome metric of this study is the efficiency of this diffusion process, defined as the reproductive rate (R). Online social networks depend on viral spread for dissemination of applications, a concept similar to snowball recruitment where investigators recruit only the &#x02018;seed&#x02019; individual, and successive generations are recruited by the seed and their descendants. Within epidemiology, R is quantified as the mean number of secondary cases (&#x02018;infections&#x02019;) that occur for a given &#x02018;infected&#x02019; individual.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For online interventions, we can quantify the number of contacts of an individual and the duration that they are &#x02018;infectious&#x02019; (ie, actively using an application). In this context, R can be expressed as:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004089ueq1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>t indicates the duration of being contagious (ie, the duration an individual uses an application), &#x003b2; is a constant of probability that determines the likelihood of spread from one individual to another for a given unit of time (referred to as &#x02018;contagiousness&#x02019; hereafter), and Z is the number of contacts within the network. For an application with no diffusion, R will equal 0. For applications with R greater than 1, exponential growth will occur as each participant recruits/infects at least one other person; applications with R&#x0003c;1 will require ongoing seeding to maintain population growth. Increasing the amount of time (t) that an application is used will increase the likelihood that it spreads to new hosts. The goal of app developers is to reach an epidemic threshold where R exceeds 1 (ie, the app &#x02018;goes viral&#x02019;) and the application propagates autonomously, thus no longer requiring expenditures to recruit seed users.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While exceeding an R value of 1 is highly desirable, those cases where an epidemic threshold is not crossed can still serve as a multiplier for recruitment efforts. For example, 1000 individuals recruited to an intervention with R=0.2 will yield 1250 participants over five generations of viral diffusion.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of the study is to identify and characterise the intervention characteristics that catalyse its diffusion through an online social network. We have tied our exploration to the concept of the R and the three independent variables that are its determinants&#x02014;duration of use (t), contagiousness (&#x003b2;) and number of contacts (Z). We empirically constructed domains of online intervention elements that we believed could impact each variable with minimal overlap: information content and proactive contact (t, duration of use), social communications (&#x003b2;, contagiousness) and non-smoker integration (z, number of contacts). We hypothesise that intervention variants containing greater information content, ongoing proactive contact and active communication strategies will outperform control application variants and have higher Rs, and that their combination will be synergistic and will display positive interaction effects. We also hypothesise that the involvement of non-smokers as epidemiological &#x02018;carriers&#x02019; will allow the application to spread more efficiently by bridging clusters of smokers.</p><p>The secondary aim is to identify and characterise the local (ego) networks of participants that effect diffusion and quitting behaviour. The characteristics of interest include smoking status, nicotine dependence, age, gender and local network characteristics (number of friends, network density and social position) as well as their number of friends already using the application. We hypothesise that local social network characteristics will predict the adoption behaviour of friends after invitation (active communication) or exposure (passive communication) from the participant. In addition, we hypothesise that invitation, adoption, utilisation and early cessation behaviour will display a complex contagion pattern, where increasing levels of network penetration (more friends that are pre-existing users of the application) will be associated with higher rates of diffusion, use of the application (duration and content exposure) and cessation behaviours (eg, setting of quit dates).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study involves two phases. Phase I was conducted from May 2012 to December 2012, and consisted of formative research designed to develop, test and optimise multiple features of a Facebook application titled &#x02018;UbiQUITous&#x02019;. Each feature is hypothesised to have a differential effect on the R of the application. Phase II is an ongoing randomised controlled trial that uses a fractional factorial design to determine the primary components of an online intervention for smoking cessation that determine its diffusion through a social network. The trial in phase II uses the UbiQUITous app as the study environment.</p><p>The generalised diffusion model guiding this study is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004089F2">figure 2</xref>. Initial seed users are recruited (A) using purchased advertising within Facebook and earned media (unpaid publicity, such as a newspaper article or word of mouth). Data on resulting adoption (ie, app install) and utilisation (B and D, respectively)&#x02014;including frequency and duration of use and content exposure&#x02014;are automatically recorded for analysis. To evaluate diffusion (C and E), we use metrics of viral spread including the number of contacts (&#x02018;friends&#x02019;) per user, the period of active use of the component (&#x02018;infectious period&#x02019;) and the number of transmissions to determine the basic R of each studied component. Our software records all data in real-time to a relational database for later reconstruction of network maps and diffusion pathways. Detailed data collection methods are presented below. Based on the basic design patterns within Facebook, we divided &#x003b2; (the metric of contagiousness) into two forms: &#x003b2;<italic>&#x02013;passive</italic> which results from observed behaviour and &#x003b2;<italic>&#x02013;active</italic> which results from direct invitations or proactive, intentional contact from one user to another.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004089F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Viral diffusion model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004089f02"/></fig><sec id="s2a1"><title>Phase I: initial development and optimisation of the cessation application</title><p>In phase I of this trial, Collins'<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> MOST design method guided our efforts to break the proposed intervention into individual features and prototype each feature prior to evaluating the full intervention in a large-scale randomised trial.

A final simplification eliminated the four cells that had no theoretical potential for diffusion, where &#x003b2;-active (invites) and &#x003b2;-passive (sharing) were disabled, resulting in a fractional factorial model with 12 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013004089TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013004089TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Cell manipulations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">t</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Z</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;-Active</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;-Passive</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diffusion three-level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Highlighted cells have &#x003b2;-active and &#x003b2;-passive disabled and are suppressed to create a 12-cell fractional factorial model.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The randomised trial is conducted entirely within Facebook with all recruitment, screening, enrolment and randomisation automated by our clinical trials management software. Participants are registered users of Facebook, a free social networking website. To be eligible, individuals must be current smokers, age 18&#x02005;years or older and have an existing Facebook account. While seed enrolment targets English-speaking US residents, there are no language or residency restrictions. A 10% subsample is randomly selected from the initial seeds for additional data collection and follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Initial adopters (&#x02018;seeds&#x02019;) are recruited primarily via online advertisements within Facebook that feature the app name, an app-related image and a short snippet of text advertising our free quit smoking app. Individuals clicking through to the app are shown a Facebook dialogue box asking for permission to install the application. Following app install, users provide informed consent for the study. Additional waves of participants are recruited via snowball methodology (ie, viral spread) as they are informed or invited to participate by friends within the network. Individuals who have a friend already using the application (&#x02018;descendants&#x02019;) are enrolled in the study and represent the outcome of interest (ie, diffusion).</p><p>Inclusion criteria for <italic>seed participants</italic> are: US residency, current smoking, age 18 or older, have an English-language Facebook account and an email address, acceptance of Facebook permissions for app installation and provide study-informed consent. The only exclusion criterion is having one or more Facebook friends who have already installed the application. Age, existing friends who are already app users and location-related eligibility are assessed in real-time immediately upon installation. Informed consent is required in order to proceed into the app. Smoking status is assessed immediately after informed consent. Ineligible users who provide informed consent may still use the app, but are excluded from the study.</p><p>Subsample participants are randomly selected at a variable rate which is manually adjusted based on completion rates of the subsample survey to yield a final proportion of 10% of seed users.

Descendants who have more than one friend in the study and for whom the diffusion channel (eg, active invite, Facebook ad) is unclear are assigned to the same cell as the friend who installed the app most recently.

Content is designed to motivate smokers to quit, provide support around a quit date, inform users of the benefits of quitting and build self-efficacy. On installation, users are greeted by the application's central character, Dr Youkwitz, who <italic>Asks</italic> participants if they smoke and <italic>Advises</italic> smokers to quit. He then <italic>Assesses</italic> their readiness to make a quit attempt and <italic>Assists</italic> them by providing a tool (&#x02018;Quit Date Wizard&#x02019;) for planning a quit attempt and setting a quit date (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004089F3">figure 3</xref>). Quit dates are stored for analysis and are used for tailoring and targeting in other intervention components. If a user sets a quit date, the app displays a countdown to that date or an estimate of savings since that date (money saved, estimate of life saved). Users who do not set a quit date in their first visit may set one at any time. The application also <italic>Arranges</italic> follow-up in the form of daily check-ins with Dr Youkwitz who provide tailored and personalised information and support, and gather self-reported smoking status. Users randomised to cells that have the variable t turned on receive proactive Facebook app requests alerting them that a check-in is ready for them in the app. Participants who set a quit date are prompted at each check-in to confirm their quit date or update their smoking status. Smokers who have not set a quit date receive a variety of daily check-ins that include prompts to set a quit date, as well as evidence-based content incorporating the &#x02018;5 Rs&#x02019; (Relevance, Risk, Rewards, Roadblocks and Repetition) derived from the PHS guidelines. Users can receive check-ins for a year after their quit date.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004089F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Application Quit Date Wizard.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004089f03"/></fig><p>The app employs simple game mechanics (points and badges) and a cartoon representation of Dr Youkwitz's lab, where the participant is exposed to smoking cessation information and tools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004089F4">figure 4</xref>).

Results from this study will add to the knowledge base about constructing interventions capable of self-propagation and distribution and how they may influence behaviour in local networks. Interventions delivered through online social networks offer potential not only to enhance social support but also to enrich social influence. In an existing network, an individual who quits smoking exerts an effect on network ties, causing collateral or even cascading smoking cessation across multiple degrees of separation and potentially producing a cumulative impact greater than that would be predicted by efficacy rates alone.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This cascade has the potential to serve as a profound multiplier for public health spending.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> We anticipate that a new generation of research protocols leveraging complexity science will explore not just viral diffusion, but the interdependent impact of diffusion and uptake on social and behavioural processes.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study that stem from the nature of Facebook itself. The most significant is the trade-off between maximising dissemination and the collection of personal information. Additional data collection would have been &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; relative to consumer expectations within online social network and would potentially suppress the primary outcome of the trial (ie, viral spread). We deliberately chose not to evaluate cessation outcomes in this trial since doing so would have added a significant burden to participants and dampened our outcome of interest. Future research should address the question of efficacy. At the time of writing the initial proposal for this project, we acknowledged a risk that prior to, or during this study, the social network landscape might change or Facebook could change its internal mechanisms. We based this proposal (and the pilot work) on what appear to be the basic and common elements of the platform that seemed unlikely to change. Not surprisingly, a number of minor Facebook platform changes occurred prior to the phase II recruitment, requiring protocol changes that are reflected in this document. We have found having an active, in-house engineering team invaluable in keeping up with changes in the Facebook environment.</p><p>Ultimately, if this intervention approach succeeds in demonstrating viral spread, the project will have the potential to substantially shift how tobacco treatment, or any other health behaviour, services are marketed and delivered. Viral distribution of a behavioral intervention through existing social networks could be applied to multiple health conditions, including smoking, obesity, nutrition and alcohol. Our hope is that this study informs a near-term, future generation of effective health interventions to be disseminated to large populations in a low-cost, efficient manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e226" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004089.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e227" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004089.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NKC and ALG participated in study concept.
