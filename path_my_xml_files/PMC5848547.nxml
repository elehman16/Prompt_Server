Intervention strategies included flagging of high-risk patients by pathologists, clinical leadership, education, and audit and feedback of individuals&#x02019; and study Sites&#x02019; practices. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred to radiation oncology within 4&#x000a0;months after prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients discussed at a MDT meeting within 4&#x000a0;months after surgery; proportion of patients who consulted a radiation oncologist within 6&#x000a0;months; and the proportion who commenced radiotherapy within 6&#x000a0;months. Urologists&#x02019; attitudes towards adjuvant radiotherapy were surveyed pre- and post-intervention. A process evaluation measured intervention fidelity, response to intervention components and contextual factors that impacted on implementation and sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Records for 1071 high-risk post-RP patients operated on by 37 urologists were reviewed: 505 control-phase; and 407 intervention-phase. The proportion of patients discussed at a MDT meeting increased from 17% in the control-phase to 59% in the intervention-phase (adjusted RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.32; 95% CI [2.40 to 7.75]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0&#x000b7;001). After adjustment, there was no significant difference in referral to radiation oncology (intervention 32% vs control 30%; adjusted RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.06; 95% CI [0.74 to 1.51]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.879). Sites with the largest relative increases in the percentage of patients discussed also tended to have greater increases in referral (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000b7;001). In the intervention phase, urologists failed to provide referrals to more than half of patients whom the MDT had recommended for referral (78 of 140; 56%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The intervention resulted in significantly more patients being discussed by a MDT. However, the recommendations from MDTs were not uniformly recorded or followed. Although practice varied markedly between MDTs, the intervention did not result in a significant overall change in referral rates, probably reflecting a lack of change in urologists&#x02019; attitudes. Our results suggest that interventions focused on structures and processes that enable health system-level change, rather than those focused on individual-level change, are likely to have the greatest effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=347715">ACTRN12611001251910</ext-link>).

Clinical practice guidelines aim to inform clinical decision-making by providing summaries of recent, credible research evidence with recommendations for clinical practice. However, timely and effective implementation of guidelines into practice is inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hence, there is a need to evaluate interventions to determine how to most effectively make changes across the health system and promote timely implementation of guidelines.</p><p id="Par7">Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the most frequently used treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer. Following RP, however, it is estimated that between 20% and 50% of men are at &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; of experiencing progression or recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Three randomised controlled trials have demonstrated benefits in survival, recurrence and disease progression in RP patients with high-risk disease characteristics who receive adjuvant radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. On the basis of this evidence, international clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] recommend that after RP, men with one or more high-risk features (namely, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion or positive surgical margin) should be referred for consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy. Historically, data consistently show only approximately 10&#x02013;20% of eligible men receive adjuvant radiotherapy in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and other regions such as the USA and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The Clinician-Led Improvement in Cancer Care (CLICC) implementation trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] evaluated a multi-faceted intervention designed to increase urologists&#x02019; referrals to radiation oncology in line with guideline recommended care. Implemented in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the trial was embedded in clinical practice through the NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation Urology Clinical Network. Described fully in the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and outlined below, the CLICC intervention was informed by a conceptual program logic model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) based on the PRECEDE-PROCEED model of behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition to objective measurement of primary and secondary outcomes, this trial included a multi-stage evaluation of knowledge and attitudinal factors. Furthermore, a theory-informed process evaluation was used to explore how the intervention was implemented and sustained across different settings to help understand issues of program implementation, explain discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes in relation to context, and provide insights into possible causal mechanisms and effect modifiers.

Post-intervention semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore participants&#x02019; experiences of, and responses to, the intervention (predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors) and the contextual characteristics of the nine Sites (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par30">Patients whose RP was performed: (i) after CLICC commenced at their Site were in the intervention-phase; (ii) prior to 4&#x000a0;months before CLICC commenced were in the control-phase; and (iii) between CLICC commencing and 4&#x000a0;months prior were in the transition-phase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Generalised linear regression models with Poisson distribution, log link and generalised estimating equation (GEE) adjustment for the clustering of patients within urologists were used to estimate adjusted relative proportions (RR) for patient groups (e.g. intervention, transition, control) who experienced the dichotomous study outcomes referred, discussed and consultation (radiation was not analysed in regression analyses because of referrals to the RAVES trial). RRs were obtained by exponentiation of the linear coefficients estimated by the regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. RRs were adjusted for factors listed below the relevant tables and figures. Potential modifiers of the effects of the intervention were assessed by adding terms for interaction with study phase. Whether increasing patient discussion at the MDT-level was associated with changes in patient referral was tested by creating a continuous independent variable containing the (ln) RRs corresponding to estimates of the MDT-specific intervention effects on discussion. Terms for this variable and its interaction with study phase were then added to a model with referral as the dependent variable. Exchangeable working correlation structures and robust standard errors were used in all GEE analyses.</p><p id="Par31">Estimates of mean differences in pre- and post-intervention scores from Likert scale survey responses were calculated using linear regression analyses with GEE adjustment for multiple responses from the same urologists across both surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim to produce transcripts of narrative text for thematic analysis.

Two iterations of comparative coding were undertaken to ensure consistency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Participation</title><p id="Par33">Eleven hospitals met the inclusion criteria.

At Sites 3 and 8 discussion of patients was delayed until after receipt of the first post-operative PSA test result.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Integration of the MDT flagging process into routine care (ranked by percent of patients discussed among those flagged)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2"/><th colspan="2">Flagged</th><th/><th colspan="2">Discussed<sup>1</sup> among those flagged</th></tr><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>N1^</th><th>n1 (% of N1)</th><th>Adjusted # RR (95% CI)</th><th>N2^^</th><th>n2 (% of N2)</th><th>Adjusted # RR (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All patients:</td><td>407</td><td>318 (78%)</td><td/><td>318</td><td>220 (69%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Hospital</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 6</td><td>36</td><td>34 (94%)</td><td>1.13 (1.03, 1.25)</td><td>34</td><td>34 (100%)</td><td>3.30 (2.70, 4.03)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 5</td><td>19</td><td>6 (32%)</td><td>0.46 (0.16, 1.32)</td><td>6</td><td>6 (100%)</td><td>3.14 (2.50, 3.95)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 1</td><td>48</td><td>32 (67%)</td><td>0.94 (0.81, 1.09)</td><td>32</td><td>30 (94%)</td><td>2.94 (2.29, 3.78)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 4</td><td>54</td><td>40 (74%)</td><td>0.96 (0.78, 1.17)</td><td>40</td><td>36 (90%)</td><td>2.92 (2.29, 3.72)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 8</td><td>52</td><td>48 (92%)</td><td>1.13 (1.07, 1.21)</td><td>48</td><td>40 (83%)</td><td>2.74 (2.23, 3.37)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 2</td><td>12</td><td>8 (67%)</td><td>0.79 (0.75, 0.84)</td><td>8</td><td>6 (75%)</td><td>2.47 (2.03, 3.02)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 7</td><td>34</td><td>25 (74%)</td><td>0.94 (0.67, 1.33)</td><td>25</td><td>18 (72%)</td><td>2.37 (1.59, 3.54)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 9</td><td>32</td><td>29 (91%)</td><td>1.42 (1.24, 1.63)</td><td>29</td><td>20 (69%)</td><td>2.09 (1.29, 3.37)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Site 3</td><td>120</td><td>96 (80%)</td><td>ref.</td><td>96</td><td>30 (31%)</td><td>ref.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;<italic>p</italic> value</td><td/><td/><td>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001</td><td/><td/><td>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Insurance</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Private</td><td>329</td><td>280 (85%)</td><td>ref.</td><td>280</td><td>190 (68%)</td><td>ref.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Public</td><td>78</td><td>38 (49%)</td><td>0.56 (0.42, 0.75)</td><td>38</td><td>30 (79%)</td><td>1.15 (0.89, 1.49)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;<italic>p</italic> value</td><td/><td/><td>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001</td><td/><td/><td>0.282</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>^Intervention group patients</p><p>^^Intervention group patients who were flagged</p><p><sup>1</sup>Patient discussed at MDT meeting within 4&#x000a0;months after prostatectomy</p><p>#Adjusted for site and insurance with urologist as the GEE clustering variable</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Response</title><p id="Par45">Identification of eligible cases by the pathologist to the MDT coordinator, through the flagging process, was considered by the majority of interviewees to be the most essential and sustainable element in achieving practice change (21 of 29; 72%). The automatic nature of the process, requiring no action on the part of the urologist, was noted as a key facilitator in uptake. &#x0201c;[Flagging of high-risk cases was] most important especially for high volume cancer centres where it is easy to provide excellent care but patients still fall through the cracks due to sheer numbers. The MDT list was manageable because the patients flagged are the right ones that should be given priority over others.&#x0201d; [Clinical Leader&#x02014;Site 6] Some, however, did not find the flagging helpful because of the timing: &#x0201c;two weeks after the operation there is no progress, no six-week PSA and continence status is not known so you don&#x02019;t have a feel if radiotherapy is appropriate, necessary or a hindrance.&#x0201d; [PU&#x02014;Site 8].</p><p id="Par46">Feedback reports were noted to be helpful by nearly half (14 of 29; 48%), and more than a third (37%) considered the provision of feedback to be the main benefit of participation in the trial allowing comparisons between Sites to see how practice and surgical outcomes varied. &#x0201c;Individual reporting to the urologists enables them to see their own results &#x02013; some were surprised by their low referral rates. I&#x02019;m not sure the overall pattern data made much difference because there were only one or two funny outliers. Personal information is more useful.&#x0201d; [Clinical Leader&#x02014;Site 7].</p><p id="Par47">There was a mixed response to other intervention components, namely, printed educational materials and the role of the Clinical Leader.</p><p id="Par48">Seven interviewees (24%) found the printed educational materials useful with four of these highlighting them as the most helpful element of the trial. &#x0201c;[Printed materials] were very clear about the way forward for the management of these patients.&#x0201d; [PU&#x02014;Site 5] However, one participant noted: &#x0201c;This information has been around for a while but there are problems with the results so I guess that&#x02019;s why we need to think about it.&#x0201d; [PU&#x02014;Site &#x000a0;3].</p><p id="Par49">While 5 of the 29 interviewees (17%) found the CLICC introductory video helpful: &#x0201c;Flagging followed by the video &#x02013; it was concise, pitched at the right level and did all the things a good educational video should.&#x0201d; [CL&#x02014;Site 4], others considered it impersonal and the content too lay: &#x0201c;Clinical content was too simple. If you are attending conferences and up to date with Continuing Professional Development then you would know about adjuvant radiotherapy.&#x0201d; [PU&#x02014;Site 4].</p><p id="Par50">Of the 20 urologist participant interviewees, four (20%) (Sites 4, 5, 7 and 8) noted the influence of the Clinical Leader as important in achieving desired outcomes but none articulated a reason for this. Of note, only three of the nine Clinical Leaders (from Sites 5, 6 and 7) viewed their role as one of an opinion leader to actively influence and promote behaviour change, and two (from Sites 1 and 4) expressed that they did not perceive it as their role to influence colleagues or offer support to change practice: &#x0201c;Didn&#x02019;t see my role was to tell my colleagues to follow the guideline and I didn&#x02019;t do it.&#x0201d; [CL&#x02014;Site 1].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Context</title><p id="Par51">RP caseload varied (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), as did the frequency, organisation and record-keeping of MDT meetings, all of which impacted upon implementation of the flagging process and the proportion of flagged patients that were discussed. All Sites had a designated MDT coordinator (administrator or nurse) responsible for scheduling and agendas, with the exception of Site 3 where organisation was delegated to the incumbent urology registrars. This Site had the highest RP caseload (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and also discussed the lowest proportion of patients amongst those flagged (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). High-patient volume, insufficient logistical planning for implementation of the flagging process and lack of support from the Clinical Leader were all identified as issues at this Site. Across all four Sites where the Clinical Leaders noted issues with implementation of the MDT flagging process these related to resourcing for public pathology services (Sites 1, 5, 6 and 7). Only two Sites were able to achieve similar rates of public patients flagged as private patients. Both of these Sites had higher public patient volume and had a lead pathologist that took responsibility for flagging and reporting on public patients at the MDT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par52">Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to a variety of different assumptions and/or statistical methods (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S2 and S3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par53">The CLICC trial used mixed methods to assess clinicians&#x02019; knowledge and attitudinal outcomes alongside behavioural outcomes measured through independent medical record review. A process evaluation, underpinned by behavioural constructs hypothesised a priori, was conducted in parallel to identify mechanisms of provider and organisational change, aid interpretation of outcomes, and increase the utility of findings for broader implementation science theory and practice.</p><p id="Par54">The trial did not result in a significant increase in the primary outcome of referral. This is consistent with the results of the corresponding participant surveys indicating a lack of change in self-reported knowledge and attitudes including treatment preference, and continued challenges to underpinning evidence for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy, by some, in post-intervention interviews. Nevertheless, there was evidence that the CLICC intervention was more effective in changing referral in some Sites than others. Following implementation of a new &#x02018;flagging&#x02019; process, there was a greater than threefold proportional increase in the secondary outcome of patient discussion at a MDT meeting with 59% being discussed during the intervention-phase compared with 17% during the control-phase. Sites with the largest increases in discussion also tended to have greater increases in referral. Of note, the four Sites that had the highest proportional increases in referral (Sites 1, 4, 7 and 8) were amongst the five Sites with the highest proportional increases in patients discussed at a MDT meeting. This is consistent with the hypothesis that introducing new systems or processes, tailored to prospectively identified barriers, can enable desired behaviour change if they are integrated and adopted into routine clinical practice as designed. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel trial of such a &#x02018;flagging&#x02019; process to standardise selection criteria for presentation of cases to MDTs across multiple clinical sites.</p><p id="Par55">The CLICC intervention was implemented with fidelity. There was a high level of clinician participation with more than three quarters of eligible invitees participating. The non-participation of two eligible sites was a potential limitation to the generalisability of the intervention. While there was 100% participation at five of nine Sites, not all eligible urologists participated at all Sites which may have resulted in volunteer bias. Patients who were identified as potentially eligible for inclusion (2378 low-risk and high-risk patients) represented nearly half (47%) of the 5017 Medicare reimbursed RPs claimed in NSW during the study period 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This implies the results are likely to be representative of wider clinical practice. It is acknowledged, however, that the intervention effect on the primary and two of the three secondary outcomes, varied significantly by Site so variation in effectiveness is likely to be evident more widely.</p><p id="Par56">Within the CLICC conceptual program logic model, flagging of eligible cases by the pathologist to the MDT coordinator for discussion at a MDT meeting was hypothesised to enable referral by overcoming clinician level barriers associated with variable engagement with, and selective presentation of cases to, the MDT. Following discussion by the MDT, however, overall less than half of intervention-phase patients with a MDT recommendation for referral were actually referred within the recommended timeframe. The lack of actual referral for patients with a MDT recommendation for referral demonstrates that altered practice to discuss more patients did not inevitably lead to referral behaviour in line with the MDT recommendation. This is likely due, at least in part, to the persisting attitudes of urologists challenging the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. However, it may also be due to urologists&#x02019; perceptions of the role of MDTs. The establishment of MDTs in cancer care has been advocated widely internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and nationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] including the introduction in 2006 of two Australian Commonwealth Government Medicare Benefit Scheme (MBS) payment items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to support clinicians participating in cancer case conferences. Our data show that fewer than 20% of patients with high-risk prostate cancer were discussed by a MDT prior to the implementation of the flagging process. While the rate of discussion significantly increased as a direct result of the intervention, our findings raise questions about the function and utility of MDT discussion in cancer care. Lack of referral may have been due to irregularities in MDT record-keeping, which resulted in inconsistent communication of recommendations to the consulting clinician. Whether recommendations were known or not, follow-up care remained at the discretion of the consulting clinician. This trial demonstrates that implementation of new enabling systems or processes may be necessary but not sufficient to bring about change in clinical practice that is reliant on an individual clinician&#x02019;s behaviour. It has been noted by others that interventions focused on systemic or structural changes are generally more successful than interventions focused on individual factors (e.g. attitudes). Possible solutions in the current context could be the introduction of standardised recording of MDT recommendations in patients&#x02019; medical records to ensure they are accessible at the point of care, or the implementation of a direct care pathway, for example, through a letter sent to the patient&#x02019;s general practitioner. There is arguably a need to review how MDTs operate more generally.</p><p id="Par57">The proportion of patients who attended an initial consultation with a radiation oncologist did not significantly change. The overall probability of commencing radiotherapy in our sample was 15%&#x02014;marginally higher than another recent estimate from 37 hospitals in Victoria, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In part, low rates of adjuvant radiotherapy are due to low rates of referral. However, among the 122 intervention- and control-phase (non-RAVES) patients who attended an initial consultation, only a little over half commenced radiotherapy. Further, the probability of commencing radiotherapy decreased slightly between the control and intervention phases. This is consistent with retrospective analyses of data from nearly 100,000 patients in the US National Cancer Data Base showing a significant <italic>decline</italic> in the use of post-RP radiotherapy from 9.1 to 7.3% between 2005 and 2011. Locally, the results of surveys of members of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand (USANZ) conducted in 2012 and 2015, demonstrate urologists not participating in the CLICC trial were significantly less favourable towards adjuvant radiotherapy in 2015 than in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is, perhaps, due to the development of biomarkers and the recent availability of genomic classifier tests which, if applied routinely, may offer a more individualised approach to the post-prostatectomy management of men with high-risk features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These findings highlight the intricacy of implementing behaviour change interventions within the context of a shifting external landscape.</p><p id="Par58">The lack of significant change in our primary outcome is consistent with other &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; implementation trials, which have noted the complexities and challenges associated with the translation of evidence into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further research is necessary to explore the reasons for heterogeneity of CLICC intervention effectiveness between Sites. It should be noted that the CLICC trial was primarily conceptualised as a clinician-focused intervention with the specific aim of changing provider referral behaviours. Consequently, ethical approvals did not permit direct patient interaction. Future research could examine whether a patient-oriented intervention can effect change in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">Overall, this trial provokes the conclusion that whilst guidelines can make recommendations about best care, changing practice routinely across the health system remains a seemingly intractable challenge and supports the view that interventions that enable and reinforce system-level change are likely to have greater effect than interventions that seek to predispose individual-level change. In conjunction, interventions focused on system-level changes need to be complemented by processes to ensure treatment recommendations are acted upon at the point of care. Finally, the results support the ongoing focus on how cancer care can become more multidisciplinary and enable informed choice for patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
