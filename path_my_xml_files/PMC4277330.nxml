Women aged 18&#x02013;25 years from Jiangsu province were randomized (1:1) to receive HPV vaccine (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,026) or Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,025) at months 0, 1 and 6. The primary objective was vaccine efficacy (VE) against HPV-16/18 associated 6-month persistent infection (PI) and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1+. Secondary objectives were VE against virological and clinical endpoints associated with HPV-16/18 and with high-risk HPV types, immunogenicity and safety. Mean follow-up for the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (ATP-E) was &#x0223c;15 months after the third dose. In the ATP-E (vaccine&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,889; control&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,894), for initially HPV DNA negative and seronegative subjects, HPV-16/18 related VE (95% CI) was 94.2% (62.7, 99.9) against 6-month PI and/or CIN1+ and 93.8% (60.2, 99.9) against cytological abnormalities. VE against HPV-16/18 associated CIN1+ and CIN2+ was 100% (&#x02212;50.4, 100) and 100% (&#x02212;140.2, 100), respectively (no cases in the vaccine group and 4 CIN1+ and 3 CIN2+ cases in the control group). At Month 7, at least 99.7% of initially seronegative vaccine recipients had seroconverted for HPV-16/18; geometric mean antibody titres (95% CI) were 6,996 (6,212 to 7,880) EU/mL for anti-HPV-16 and 3,309 (2,942 to 3,723) EU/mL for anti-HPV-18. Safety outcomes between groups were generally similar. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is effective, immunogenic and has a clinically acceptable safety profile in young Chinese women. Prophylactic HPV vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer in China.</p><p>What's New?</p><p>With an estimated 75,000 new cases and 34,000 women dying from the disease annually, cervical cancer is a major public-health concern in China. This is the first large scale randomised clinical trial of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in China. The vaccine was found to be effective, immunogenic, and to have a clinically acceptable safety profile in young Chinese women.

Pregnancies and outcomes, serious adverse events (SAEs) and medically significant conditions were reported throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was based on the number of events needed to demonstrate VE for key efficacy endpoints in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (ATP-E), for those women who were seronegative by ELISA at month 0 and DNA negative by PCR at months 0 and 6 for the HPV type considered in the analysis. Assuming VE of 85%,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> it was calculated that 17 cases of the primary endpoint (6-month PI and/or CIN1+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18) were needed to provide at least 90% power to obtain a significant result (defined as lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for VE above 0%). Thus, final analysis was to be triggered when at least 17 cases of the primary endpoint had accrued. Based on an estimated yearly event rate of 1% for 6-month PI and/or CIN1+ in the control group,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> it was estimated that &#x0223c;3,000 evaluable subjects (1,500 per group) would be needed to accumulate 17 events before all subjects had completed their month 24 visit. The target enrolment of 6,000 women was estimated to provide &#x0223c;4,800 evaluable subjects (2,400 per group) at month 24 assuming that 20% of enrolled subjects would be nonevaluable because of drop-out or baseline seropositivity or DNA positivity for HPV-16 or HPV-18.</p><p>Assuming VE of 90% for the secondary endpoint of CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> it was calculated that 12 cases of CIN2+ would be needed in the ATP-E to have at least 80% power to obtain a significant result.

Analysis was also performed on the total vaccinated cohort for efficacy (TVC-E), which included all vaccinated women for whom efficacy data were available and who had normal or low-grade cytology at baseline. The principal analysis was conducted in women who were HPV DNA negative at month 0 (ATP-E and TVC-E) and month 6 (ATP-E) and were seronegative at month 0 for the HPV type considered in the analysis.</p><p>For virological endpoints, a subject was defined as having a persistent cervical infection for a specified HPV type if there was a sequence of positive HPV DNA samples for that HPV type, not interrupted by negative samples, such that the total range was more than 5 months (&#x0003e;150 days) apart for 6-month PI and more than 10 months (&#x0003e;300 days) apart for 12-month PI. The start of the persistent cervical infection was defined as the date of the first positive sample in the sequence. Subjects had to have at least 5 months of follow-up after Month 12 to be included in analyses of 6-month PI and at least 10 months of follow-up after Month 12 to be included in analyses of 12-month PI.</p><p>VE was calculated using a conditional exact method,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which computes an exact CI around the ratio of event rates in vaccine versus control groups and takes into account the follow-up time of participants within each group. VE was defined as 1 minus the rate ratio. The follow-up for each woman started the day after third vaccination for the ATP-E and the day after first vaccination for the TVC-E. Follow-up ended either at the time of an event or the last date when data were available for the considered endpoint.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) of all vaccinated women for whom safety data were available and data are summarised using descriptive statistics. To prevent unblinding, the treatment assignment is not disclosed for events reported in one group only.</p><p>Immunogenicity analyses were performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (subjects who received three doses, met eligibility criteria, complied with protocol procedures and had results for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen). Subjects who acquired either HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection during the trial were excluded from this cohort. Seropositivity rates and geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) for each antigen with 95% CI were calculated. To maintain blinding, all analyses were carried out by an external statistician.

In previous global studies with HPV vaccines, a relatively small proportion of subjects were of Chinese ethnicity.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This trial of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is the first large, controlled clinical study of an HPV vaccine in mainland China. The current prospectively defined, event-triggered analysis showed that the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and good immunogenicity in Chinese women and provides preliminary evidence regarding VE in this population. This timely information will be useful to policy makers in China and other Asian countries to support decisions regarding HPV vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer in addition to cervical screening programs. Moreover, our data add to the body of evidence on HPV vaccines across different regions and ethnicities.</p><p>Our trial had a largely similar design to other large trials evaluating the efficacy of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine, including the global PATRICIA (PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults) trial<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the community-based trial in Guanacaste, Costa Rica,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with regard to age of study subjects, vaccination schedule, clinical management for abnormal cytology and colposcopy referral and HPV DNA testing. A major difference between the current trial and these other studies is that the primary endpoint was prospectively defined as prevention of 6-month PI and/or histopathologically confirmed CIN1+ associated with HPV-16/18, with CIN2+ as a secondary endpoint, whereas the PATRICIA and Guanacaste trials defined CIN2+ as the primary endpoint.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Although CIN2+ is the traditional surrogate to cervical cancer for evaluation of VE,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> it is limited by the large sample size and/or extensive follow-up required to obtain enough cases for assessment. PI is a reliably determined and objective clinical marker, independent of HPV type multiplicity, which shows good predictive value to CIN3 and cervical cancer.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Global bodies such as the World Health Organization have recognized the utility of virological endpoints for the evaluation of HPV vaccines,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> although there is some debate on how persistent HPV infection should be defined when used as a surrogate. A meta-analysis conducted by Koshiol et al. suggested that association between HPV persistence and high-grade disease appeared strongest for longer duration of HPV infection (&#x0003e;12 months) and wider HPV testing intervals (&#x0003e;6 months or &#x0003e;12 months), but even the shortest HPV duration and testing intervals (&#x02264;6 months) were associated with an increased relative risk for development of high-grade disease.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Thus, to gain an early insight into VE in the Chinese setting over the first 2 years of our study, in addition to immunogenicity and safety, the current event-triggered analysis used a composite of virological and clinical endpoints, incorporating a 6-month definition of PI. The trial is ongoing and efficacy data from a 4-year end-of-study analysis will allow further evaluation of efficacy, including longer term persistence and CIN2+, when more endpoints have accrued.</p><p>This event-triggered final analysis demonstrated high prophylactic efficacy of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine against the composite primary endpoint of 6-month PI and/or CIN1+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. High VE against incident infection, 6-month PI and cytological abnormalities associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 was also shown. Due to the relatively short duration of follow-up at the time of this event-triggered analysis, the effect size for the primary composite endpoint was principally driven by cases of 6-month PI. The number of cases of CIN was limited, although all observed cases in the ATP-E were in the control group. There was also an insufficient number of HPV-18 infections to robustly assess VE against 6-month PI and/or CIN1+ associated with HPV-18 alone. It is expected that by the time of the end-of-study analysis, more data will be available for these endpoints.</p><p>Our results are in line with observations from the global PATRICIA trial, which evaluated the efficacy of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in women aged 15&#x02013;25 years from a broad range of nationalities and ethnicities.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In PATRICIA, high VE was shown against 6-month and 12-month PI and CIN2+, associated with HPV-16/18.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In a 4-year end-of-study analysis of PATRICIA high VE was also shown against CIN2+ and CIN3+ irrespective of HPV type in the lesion<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and consistent cross-protective efficacy was shown against HPV-31, -33, -45 and -51.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Results from the current trial are also consistent with a Phase II trial of the HPV-16/18-AS04 adjuvanted vaccine conducted in Japan, in which statistically significant VE was shown against 6-month and 12-month PI and cytological abnormalities associated with HPV-16/18.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The follow-up time for our analysis is closer to that of the interim analysis of the global PATRICIA trial (&#x0223c;15 months after the first vaccine dose)<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> than that of the event-triggered final analysis,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> or the end-of-study analysis.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This is an important consideration when comparing results across studies, because the observed efficacy estimates appeared to increase with longer duration of follow-up in PATRICIA. The planned 4-year follow-up of more than 6,000 subjects in the current trial should contribute to a better understanding of VE in the Chinese population, including cross-protection against non-vaccine HPV types.</p><p>Strong antibody responses were elicited by the vaccine against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the population of young Chinese women. Antibody levels one month after the last vaccine dose were in the same range as those observed in women of a similar age participating in global studies.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It has previously been shown that total and neutralising antibody titres elicited by the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine are sustained at levels several-fold above those observed for natural infection for up to 9.4 years after vaccination.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> We are continuing to evaluate immunogenicity in the current study and the kinetics of the immune response in Chinese women will be reported more fully in due course.</p><p>Safety outcomes between groups were generally similar, except injection site symptoms were more common following administration of vaccine than control, in line with global findings.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Symptoms did not affect overall compliance with the vaccination schedule. Incidence of solicited symptoms was generally lower than in a previous pooled analysis evaluating the safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in a multiethnic and geographically diverse cohort of almost 30,000 girls and women aged &#x02265;10 years, which showed that the vaccine had an acceptable safety profile in women of all ages.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The only notable difference compared with the established reactogenicity profile is that the incidence of fever was higher in the current study than reported previously (&#x0223c;10% <italic>vs</italic>. 5%).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This is due to the threshold for fever, which was defined as oral or axillary temperature of &#x0003e;37.0&#x000b0;C in the current study (as per Chinese clinical trial regulation) and &#x0003e;37.5&#x000b0;C in global studies. The incidence of fever was &#x0223c;2% in this study using the definition of 37.5&#x000b0;C. The incidence of grade 3 fever, defined using a universal threshold of &#x0003e;39.0&#x000b0;C, was similarly low in this study and the previous pooled analysis (&#x0003c;0.5%).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Since the current HPV vaccines are prophylactic and do not alter the course of prevalent HPV infection or pre-existing lesions,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> vaccination of women before sexual debut is a cost-effective and pragmatic strategy to prevent cervical cancer, especially in the absence of effective screening programs. In a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey across urban and rural areas of China, there was a trend towards earlier sexual debut (median age of 17 years) and riskier sexual behaviours in younger cohorts of Chinese women.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, 15% of women in this study were DNA positive for high-risk HPV at baseline.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These findings suggest that HPV vaccination of girls at an early age, before they leave compulsory education, is likely to contribute to the prevention of HPV infection and cervical cancer in China.</p><p>In conclusion, the study results show that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is effective, immunogenic and has a clinically acceptable safety profile in young Chinese women. Prophylactic HPV vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancers and precancers in China.</p><p><italic>Cervarix</italic> is a registered trade mark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies. <italic>SAS</italic> is a registered trade mark of SAS Institute Inc. <italic>StatXact</italic> is a registered trade mark of Cytel Inc.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants and the staff members of the different sites for their contribution to the study.
