In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the possible role of silodosin in facilitating the passage of DUS in paediatric patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The present study was a prospective placebo-controlled randomised study, conducted after obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee in our centre and written informed consent from all patients and/or their guardians. A clear statement was made about silodosin, as a selective &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist, and its off-label use in the treatment of children with DUS, emphasising its possible effects and adverse reactions. In all, 40 paediatric patients (27 boys and 13 girls) who presented with single, radiopaque DUS were included in the present study between September 2014 and October 2015. Inclusion criteria were: age &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years, single unilateral radiopaque DUS, and largest stone diameter of &#x02264;10&#x000a0;mm.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: multiple, bilateral or recurrent stones, radiolucent stone, largest stone diameter &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;mm, UTI or urosepsis, anomalies of the ureter or the kidney, previous urinary tract endoscopy or surgery, marked hydronephrosis, and abnormal renal function. All patients were evaluated by complete history taking and a thorough physical examination. Laboratory investigations included urine analysis and serum creatinine. Radiological assessment with plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB) and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was done.</p><p>This single-blinded study included 40 patients with mean (SD, range) age of 8.1 (2.7, 5&#x02013;17)&#x000a0;years. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the study flow chart. Treatment was assigned on a randomised basis using the closed envelope randomisation method into two equal groups, i.e. 20 patients in each group. As there were no known published data on the role of silodosin in the treatment of DUS in children, we performed a pilot study prior to the present study, in children who were not included in the present study. The results of the pilot study were used to calculate the sample size by assuming that the mean (SD) stone expulsion time in Group A was 7.2 (2)&#x000a0;days and in Group B was 8.6 (0.9)&#x000a0;days (pilot data). Using Open Epi 2.3, to detect a 15% difference between the two groups with 80% power and a threshold of significance of 0.05, the sample size was estimated to be 40 patients (20 in each group).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p>In Group A, children received silodosin 4&#x000a0;mg at bedtime, whilst those in Group B received placebo. Medications (placebo or silodosin) were supplied according to the randomisation list by a registered outpatients-clinic nurse that had a registry for these patients. A pill counter was given to every patient to confirm adequate compliance to the given medication. For those who could not swallow the capsule, the capsule contents were emptied into a small amount of water or juice. Ibuprofen (20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day) was divided into two doses for pain episodes. Children were encouraged to take plenty of fluids. Follow-up included two assessments at 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks from starting the treatment. At the follow-up assessments history, physical examination (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature), urine analysis, KUB and ultrasonography were undertaken (to confirm stone passage). The stone expulsion time and rate, number of pain episodes, need of analgesia, and any adverse effects were recorded in both groups. The primary outcomes were time to stone passage and the secondary outcomes were stone-free rate (SFR), pain, and incidence of adverse effects. For time to stone passage (stone-expulsion time): children were advised to urinate in a potty under parent or guardian observation to ensure the exact time of stone passage by visual confirmation of the stone or a part of it which was subsequently confirmed radiologically. The stone-expulsion time was calculated from the day of starting the treatment until the visual confirmation of stone passage in days. The SFR was calculated at two time points (2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks of starting the treatment), regardless of the time to stone passage and it was defined by visual confirmation of a stone passage, which was confirmed radiologically or absence of the stone on radiological assessment at the 2- or 4-week follow-up. A pain episode was defined as any form of abdominal pain (either typical renal colic or atypical abdominal pain) occurring in our patients during the study period that required treatment with ibuprofen. Failure of treatment was defined as failure to achieve a stone-free status at the 4-week follow up. Patients were referred either for shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) or ureteroscopy (URS).</p><p>The statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for Science (SPSS&#x000ae; version 16, SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). For quantitative variables the means and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated, for categorical variables numbers and percentages were calculated. The Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for quantitative data of normal distribution, for data that were not normally distributed we used the Wilcoxon Mann&#x02013;Whitney test; for qualitative variables the chi-squared test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used. All tests were used at a level of significance of &#x0003c;5%.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Results</title><p>Our study included 40 patients with radiopaque single DUS randomised into groups A and B.

Children who have urinary stones are more likely to have recurrent stones, so they may need multiple interventions for stone removal during their lives <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Different treatment methods are used for managing urinary stones in children including: open surgery, SWL, URS (rigid or flexible), percutaneous nephrolithotomy, laparoscopic or robot-assessed ureteropyelolithotomy, and MET <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Interventional treatment has been reported to be successful in 98&#x02013;100% of cases; however, they are not complication free. The reported incidence of complications for URS is 10&#x02013;20% (including 3&#x02013;5% major complications, such as ureteric perforation, avulsion, and stricture). Complications related to SWL range between 15% and 32%, e.g. subcapsular haematoma, perirenal fluid collection, and retreatment sessions in up to 50% <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to adults, the natural history of paediatric urolithiasis in not well-defined; however, the management of paediatric stones has changed dramatically in the last two decades, with the increasing use of less invasive treatment methods <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The main aim of any conservative treatment is to reduce pain, decrease ureteric smooth muscles spasm and mucosal oedema, speed stone passage, and increase rate of stone passage <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently, several studies have evaluated the possible role of different drugs in accelerating the passage of DUS. Analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, and &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor blockers represent the most commonly used agents <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>As shown in many studies, the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors are located mainly in the distal ureteric smooth muscles, with blockade of these receptors the intraureteric constrictions decrease and thus stones passage increases <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. With the introduction of silodosin, as a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor blocker, ureteric smooth muscle relaxation can be achieved with a lesser influence on &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-adrenoceptors and thus a lesser effect on blood pressure. Therefore, selective &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonism should prevent uncoordinated smooth muscle contractions, without prohibiting ureteric peristalsis, hence facilitating stone passage in a short time and decrease the need for analgesics <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>A large multicentre randomised prospective trial to examine silodosin vs placebo for MET in adults with ureteric stones showed that silodosin significantly improves SFR in patients with DUS. In that study, they recommended further studies on different stone sizes and locations <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the present study, the stone expulsion rate was higher in the silodosin group (Group A) than in the placebo group (Group B), at 88.8% vs 73.6%, respectively; however, this was not statistically significantly different. Mokhless et al. <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> studied tamsulosin in the treatment of DUS in children and reported a SFR of 88% vs 64% in the tamsulosin group and placebo group, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). Aydogdu et al. <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> studied doxazosin in the treatment of DUS in children and reported a SFR of 84% and 70% in the doxazosin and ibuprofen groups, respectively (statistically non-significant).</p><p>Erturhan et al. <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> studied doxazocin in the management of DUS in paediatric patients, their study included 45 patients with single lower ureteric stones that were randomly divided into two groups, Group 1 received ibuprofen and Group 2 received doxazocin in addition to ibuprofen, and reported stone-expulsion rates of 28.5% and 70.8%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001).

Whilst, Aydogdu et al. <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, reported no statistically significant difference between doxazocin and ibuprofen alone, with a mean (SD) stone expulsion time of 6.1 (2.3) vs 5.9 (2.1) days. In the present study, for the number of pain episodes and analgesic use, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of silodosin in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and analgesic use. Mokhless et al. <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, Aydogdu et al. <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Erturhan et al. <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> reported fewer pain episodes and less analgesic use with tamsulosin and doxazosin than placebo or ibuprofen alone, respectively. In contrast, a study performed by Pickard et al. <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> showed no statistically significant benefit between active treatment [&#x003b1;-blockers or nifedipine] vs placebo for pain reduction during episodes of ureteric colic. In the present study, adverse effects occurred in only three patients in the silodosin group, these were mild (headache or dizziness) and none of them discontinued treatment, whilst there were no adverse effects reported in the placebo group.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study is the relatively few participants limiting the generalisability of our results for DUS in children. Another limitation is the use of KUB and ultrasonography during follow-up, which may have limited sensitivity and specificity. Also fluid intake among children was difficult to calculate. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the possible role of silodosin as a selective &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist in facilitating the passage of DUS in
