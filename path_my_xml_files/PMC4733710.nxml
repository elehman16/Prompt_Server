As a result, the trigger point of blood transfusion may be different in the emergency use of the existing transfusion guidelines. The present study was designed to evaluate whether the scheme can be safely and effectively used for emergency patients, so as to be supported by multicenter and large sample data in the future.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>From June 2013 to June 2014, patients were randomly divided into the experimental group (Peri-operative Transfusion Trigger Score of Emergency [POTTS-E] group) and the control group (control group). The between-group differences in the patients&#x02019; demography and baseline information, mortality and blood transfusion-related complications, heart rate, resting arterial pressure, body temperature, and Hb values were compared. The consistency of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion standards of the two groups of patients with the current blood transfusion guideline, namely the compliance of the guidelines, utilization rate, and per-capita consumption of autologous RBC were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, a total of 72 patients were recorded, and 65 of them met the inclusion criteria, which included 33 males and 32 females with a mean age of (34.8 &#x000b1; 14.6) years. 50 underwent abdomen surgery, 4 underwent chest surgery, 11 underwent arms and legs surgery. There was no statistical difference between the two groups for demography and baseline information. There was also no statistical differences between the two groups in anesthesia time, intraoperative rehydration, staying time in postanesthetic care unit, emergency hospitalization, postoperative 72 h Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, blood transfusion-related complications and mortality. Only the POTTS-E group on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day Hb was lower than group control, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. POTTS-E group was totally (100%) conformed to the requirements of the transfusion guideline to RBC infusion, which was higher than that of the control group (81.25%), <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01. There were no statistical differences in utilization rates of autologous blood of the two groups; the utilization rates of allogeneic RBC, total allogeneic RBC and total RBC were 48.48%, 51.5%, and 75.7% in POTTS-E group, which were lower than those of the control group (84.3%, 84.3%, and 96.8%) <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 or <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.

There are no differences in the recent prognosis of patients with the traditional transfusion guidelines. This scheme is safe; Compared with doctor experience-based subjective assessment, the scoring scheme was closer to patient physiological needs for transfusion and more reasonable; Utilization rate and the per capita consumption of RBC are obviously declined, which has clinical significance and is feasible. Based on the abovementioned three points, POTTS-E scores scheme is safe, reasonable, and practicable and has the value for carrying out multicenter and large sample clinical researches.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Emergency Operations</kwd><kwd>Transfusion Guideline</kwd><kwd>Transfusion Trigger Score</kwd><kwd>Red Blood Cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Clinical transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) can be implemented through relatively standardized guidelines, namely blood transfusion guidelines. However, now, there exists no emergency versions of blood transfusion guidelines according to patients&#x02019; instant hospitalization state, that is to say, current blood transfusion in emergency still need to be operated based on the ordinary blood transfusion guidelines. Because the above transfusion guidelines are mostly used for critically ill patients or patients with elective surgical procedures, it has not been determined whether the emergency patients should be transfused according to the minimum restrictive blood transfusion (6 or 7 g/dl). As the use of blood and blood components in China can be largely by the supply or shortage of blood, due to the floating of the guideline, there is no bevidence-based evaluation index on when to start the blood transfusion for patients with hemoglobin (Hb) between 7 and 10 g/dl.</p><p>Patients of elective operation have preoperative preparation for a certain period of time. Except the primary diseases, the patients are close to healthy people, vital signs, and physiological status; Second, surgical process is destructive, namely there are the possibilities of blood loss during the whole operation process until the end of surgery. Compared with elective surgery, damage exists prior to most of the emergency operation, even shock and internal environment disorder caused by preoperative blood loss.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The patients&#x02019; operation is a process of repairing, controlling damage, and saving lives. But patients of emergency surgery are most healthy in advance without previous medical history, so along with the advancement of surgery, the patients&#x02019; bleeding is reduced until the end of the surgery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>As a result, the trigger point of blood transfusion may be different in the emergency use of the existing transfusion guidelines, for the same patient facing different doctors or different patients facing the same doctor. With marking scheme to guide the RBC transfusion at the right time and right amount, this study was designed to evaluate whether the scheme can be safely and effectively used for emergency patients, so as to be supported by multicenter and large sample data in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>This study has been registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Register, and the Registration No. was ChiCTR-TRC-14004135.

Circulation condition, blood oxygenation situations, oxygen consumption, and compensatory state were respectively evaluated by whether the patients needed adrenaline to maintain normal BP, whether higher oxygen concentration was needed to maintain the oxygenation, whether there was high metabolism as a result of high body temperature, and whether there was high shock index.

Perioperative blood transfusion and adjuvant treatment guidelines in 2006 of ASA suggest that: Patients with Hb &#x0003c;6 g/dl should be given RBC infusion, and should not be transfused with Hb &#x0003e;10 g/dl; if the patients&#x02019; Hb lies in the range of 6&#x02013;10 g/dl, the RBC transfusion should be determined according to the speed and levels of ischemia, and the risks such as the subsequent complications due to insufficient blood oxygenation capacity, low cardiopulmonary reserves and high oxygen consumption, etc.;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] British Society of Hematology defines that blood transfusion starts at Hb &#x0003c;8 g/dl;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Scottish perioperative blood transfusion guidelines was defined at Hb &#x0003c;7 g/dl;[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Spanish Society of blood transfusion defines that blood transfusion starts at Hb &#x0003c;7 g/dl and at Hb &#x0003c;5 g/dl in patients with chronic anemia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Though there are differences in the concrete values in the above blood transfusions guidelines, the general direction is roughly the same-the restrictive transfusion strategy. This is because that the most important reference for such guidelines is a comparative research on open blood transfusion and restrictive blood transfusion (H&#x000e9;bert <italic>et al</italic>., 1999). The results showed that the critically ill patients whose blood transfusion was started at Hb &#x0003c;7 g/dl with Hb was maintained in 7&#x02013;9 g/dl had obviously fewer amount of blood transfusion and lower incidence of related complications; And the most important thing was that mortality within 30 days of hospitalization was declined.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In a follow-up study, Carson <italic>et al</italic>. also supported that restrictive blood transfusion can decrease the amount of transfusion but not increase the incidence of complications and mortality of the patients with experiment results.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Determination on the requirement of RBC transfusion needs the quick analysis results of patients&#x02019; pulmonary function, oxygen partial pressure, oxygenation index, oxygen uptake rate;[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Heart rate, cardiac output and vascular resistance;[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial lactic acid concentration, base defect, pH (pHi) and CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in gastric mucosa;[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] capacity state, etc. Under the emergency state, the above evaluation indexes would deviate from the normal physiological condition because of the stress response, and body compensatory changes. In clinical work, in the face of emergency patients, it is very difficult to require all medical institutions to judge whether patients need RBC infusion according to the evaluation on patients&#x02019; cardiopulmonary compensatory ability, metabolism, and oxygen consumption.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we referenced to the &#x0201c;POTTS&#x0201d; which was put forward by Professor Liu Jin (Anesthesia Department, Western China Hospital of Sichuan University), to replace the required subjective judgment in the original blood transfusion indications when patients&#x02019; Hb in 7 ~ 10 g/dl. The evaluation scheme is composed of four parts: Circulation condition, blood oxygenation situations, oxygen consumption, and compensatory state namely whether the patients need adrenaline to maintain normal BP, whether higher oxygen concentration is needed to maintain the oxygenation, whether there is high metabolism with high body temperature and whether there is high shock index.</p><p>The two groups of actually included patients are consistent at preoperative baseline, and the data are comparable. In the hospital follow-up, surgical operation time, staying time of PACU, and emergency hospitalization time of POTTS-E group did not increase; And there are no differences between the two groups in intraoperative rehydration, APACHE II scores on the 3<sup>rd</sup> days after operation, and postoperative vital signs; except the 1<sup>st</sup> day after operation, there are no differences between the POTTS-E group and the control group in Hb on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after operation and at the end of emergency hospitalization. Compared with posthospitalization follow-up, there are no differences between the two groups in mortality and blood transfusion-related complications till 6 months after the operation.</p><p>Due to the own reason of the research center, this study does not involve nerve surgery and obstetrics patients; affected by the local medical policy, the hospitalization condition of ICU is not counted. Since it is the first time to introduce marking scheme into the blood transfusion research of emergency patients; risk control is carried out on the included patients, and some critically ill patients are excluded to ensure safety.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The lower limit is 7 points, and the upper limit is 10 points, which are consistent with the currently executed blood transfusion guidelines in China. This study does not appear deaths; due to the differences of the case range, the results do not tally with the study of Heeney <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] But the results still hint that according to the blood transfusion scheme guided by POTTS-E, complications and death risk are not increased, and there are no significant differences in the postoperative vital signs, suggesting the safety of POTTS-E scheme. But limited by the number of cases and the research time, this study fails to complete the comparison in the postoperative quality of life and longer follow-up.</p><p>In the comparison of transfusion in all included patients, we found that the traditional doctor experience-based transfusion strategy subject to blood transfusion guidelines appeared to be not completely consistent with the requirements of &#x0201c;guidelines&#x0201d; in the perioperative RBC transfusion. The results of the study showed that in the control group, 5 patients did not undergo intraoperative RBC transfusion when the Hb value was less than 7 g/dl, while one patient still underwent allogeneic RBC transfusion when the Hb value was higher than 10 g/dl. Only 81.25% of the patients met the requirements of &#x0201c;guidelines,&#x0201d; and this ratio was lower than the 100% in the ETS scoring group. According to the reason analysis, as the experimental group was in strict accordance with the experiment plan and the scoring rules of the experimental group were established within the framework of blood transfusion guidelines, the patients had to undergo transfusion when the Hb value was less than 7 g/dl. Throughout the experiment stages, the number of patients with extra points in the ETS group was small, and no patient achieved 3 points regarding ETS scores, that is, no patient was reported to undergo blood transfusion with an Hb value up to 10 g/dl. Meanwhile, the experiment in the ETS group required its patients to undergo transfusion when Hb value was less than 7 g/dl. As a result, the Hb values of all patients in the ETS group were maintained between 7 and 10 g/dl in the operation stage. In contrast, in the control group, the blood transfusion guidelines allowed doctors to decide the maintained Hb value range only when they had evaluated patient conditions including cardiopulmonary compensatory ability, body metabolism, and oxygen consumption. Although the recommended maintained range of the guidelines was also 7&#x02013;10 g/dl, the subjective assessment of doctors may be insufficient considering the emergency conditions, resulting in insufficient transfusion for patients with such need while excessive transfusion for patients without such need. Consequently, 6 patients in the control group were out of the requirements of &#x0201c;guidelines&#x0201d;. At the same time, we speculated that the rest patients in the control group, whose Hb values ranged from 7 to 10 g/dl might still have these shortcomings above.</p><p>In the results of this group, we conducted an analysis on the linear correlation of the patient intraoperative total amount of RBCs with shock index, APACHE II scoring, and Hb value when entering the operation room. The results suggested that there was a linear correlation between the blood amount of patients in two groups and above three indicators. However, in the POTTS-E group, the correlation coefficient of blood amount with shock index and APACHE II scores was higher than that in the control group; the correlation coefficient with Hb values in the control group was higher than that in the POTTS-E group. According to the reason analysis, the transfusion need of emergency patients could be estimated preoperatively via their signs, inspection, and testing results, but theoretically, the more objective indicators included by an assessment standard, the greater its correlation with body hypoxia. Therefore, for the transfusion assessment of emergency patients especially patients with hemorrhagic shock, the accuracy of APACHE II scores would be higher than shock index, which appeared to be higher than Hb values. It can be seen that the control group was most closely related to Hb values at the time of entering into the operation room, suggesting that the assessment mixed with experience was easy to be misled by some key indicators, while the POTTS-E group was more closely associated with shock index and APACHE II, suggesting that POTTS-E scheme was closer to patient physiological status and more consistent with their transfusion need. Consequently, it is more reasonable to guide blood transfusion using the POTTS-E scores-based transfusion strategy.</p><p>Compared with the POTTS-E group, more RBC is infused in the control group; thus, Hb of the POTTS-E group is lower in the control group on the follow-up of the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day. But the mean value is not greater than 1 g/dl. At the same time, as the patients&#x02019; recovery, there are no differences of Hb on the third postoperative day and at the end of hospitalization. Reason analysis: The control group was given RBC transfusion not completely according to the regulation of blood transfusion guidelines. Some patients needing RBC transfusion fail to strictly perform certain rule. And the average level of Hb after blood transfusion is pulled down. We have reason to believe that, if the control group can complete reference to the guideline, the difference of Hb at follow-up point should be even greater or may be affected for a longer time.</p><p>Only a minority of patients with POTTS-E &#x0003e;0 during the entire study period, namely most of the patients are given allogeneic RBC transfusion according to the lower limit of Hb &#x0003c;7 g/dl in most of the scoring, so it is not difficult to understand the intraoperative and perioperative utilization rate and per capita consumption of allogeneic RBC in POTTS-E group are lower than those of the control group; autologous blood utilization rate in POTTS-E group is the same as the control group, but the per capita consumption is lower than the control group, and the difference is from the small sample size. But there is reason to believe that if the sample size is enlarged, but the utilization rates of autologous blood in the two groups are not changed, per capita consumption of autologous blood in the control group is the same as the POTTS-E group, and more allogeneic RBC infusion is needed in the control group. Therefore, the intraoperative and perioperative utilization rate and the per capita consumption of total RBC in POTTS-E group should be lower than those of the control group. The results suggest that with the evidence-based method of classification to guide transfusion for emergency patients, utilization rate and the per capita consumption of RBC can effectively be reduced.</p><p>In summary, POTTS-E scores scheme is safe, reasonable, and practicable and has the value for carrying out multicenter and large sample clinical researches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>The authors would like to thank Zhang Yi-Nan, Li Juan, Zhu Yu-Hang, Zhou Jun, Ma Huan-Huan, Liang Xiao-Li and Zhang Chao of the Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College for their assistance in patients collection and therapy;
