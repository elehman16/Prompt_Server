The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a brief counseling intervention delivered in Swedish dental clinics on tobacco use cessation, taking non-adherence into account. We conducted three secondary analyses. In a per-protocol analysis the experimental counseling delivered as intended was contrasted to usual care (control). In an as-treated analysis individuals were compared according to the counseling components actually received, disregarding randomization. In an instrumental variable analysis the effect of the intervention among those who would always be treated as assigned was estimated. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between tobacco cessation outcomes (seven-day abstinence, three-month abstinence, half-reduction, quit attempts) and the defined exposure to the intervention. Protocol adherence in the intervention group was 73.4%. The per-protocol analysis closely replicated the results of the intention-to-treat analysis, showing a statistically significant effect of the brief counseling on the reduction in tobacco consumption <italic>OR</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.81, 95% CI [1.06, 3.07], but no significant effect for other outcomes. In the as-treated analysis, receiving more counseling components compared with no tobacco counseling increased the likelihood of half-reduction. The instrumental variable yielded biased results. We conclude that despite application problems, conducting per-protocol, as-treated and instrumental variable analyses in randomized trials where experimental conditions are not strictly standardized strengthens and puts in context the inference based on intention-to-treat analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tobacco use cessation</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Per-protocol</kwd><kwd>As-treated</kwd><kwd>Instrumental variable</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Brief counseling complemented by oral examination in dental settings is effective in assisting patients to achieve tobacco use cessation <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In Sweden, the effectiveness of a brief structured counseling for tobacco use cessation delivered in dental clinics to unselected tobacco users was evaluated in the cluster randomized controlled trial FRITT (Swedish acronym for &#x0201c;Free from Tobacco in Dentistry&#x0201d;). The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of this trial showed a statistically significant effect on reduction by half of tobacco consumption from baseline to follow-up, but not on complete abstinence <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">The &#x0201c;intention-to-treat&#x0201d; (ITT) analysis preserves the benefits of randomization in the comparison of alternative interventions. Therefore, it is the primary analytic approach in randomized clinical trials <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This approach estimates the effect of being assigned to a specific treatment, irrespective of whether or not the individual received, took or completed the assigned treatment. In case of non-adherence, the assigned intervention is a misclassified measure of the received intervention and the results could be a biased estimate of the treatment's effect <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Adherence patterns are important for an appraisal of the extent to which the ITT analysis yields a valid measure of the effect of the intervention. A review of randomly selected trials published in high-impact medical journals showed that protocol non-adherence was reported in 98% of the studies, whereas methods to address non-adherence in only 51% of them <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In many of the studies, &#x0201c;as-treated&#x0201d; (AT) or per-protocol (PP) analyses were the methods usually applied to account for non-adherence, but there was no discussion on the potential biases introduced by these methods <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The PP and AT analyses do not capture the causal effects if the sources of systematic error (i.e confounding) are not dealt with <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Instrumental variable (IV) analysis has been proposed as a method yielding an unbiased estimate of the effect of receiving the alternative treatment even in the presence of unmeasured confounders, if some central assumptions are met <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Analyses following the PP, AT or IV approaches are often overlooked in RCTs of non-pharmacological interventions. Several studies have underlined the benefits of reporting additional analysis besides ITT <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For instance, estimating the effect of interventions taking non-adherence into account may help to extrapolate the results to settings where the adherence pattern is different from that in the trial <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Also, results may be more informative for patients and clinicians, who are interested in the true effect of the intervention rather than in the effect of the assigned intervention <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct secondary analyses in order to estimate the effect corrected for non-adherence of the brief counseling intervention evaluated in the FRITT study on cessation of tobacco use. We analyzed the effect of (a) receiving the intervention as-intended among patients randomized to the intervention group (per-protocol analysis), (b) receiving different components of the intervention (as-treated analysis), (c) receiving always the intervention assigned among patients of dental practitioners with similar propensity to adherence (instrumental variable analysis).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0035">Details on the study design are provided elsewhere <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Twenty-seven dental clinics in two Swedish regions willing to be included in the study constituted the unit of randomization. Simple randomization was performed using a computer-generated random sequence with 1:1 ratio to either deliver the novel intervention (structured brief advice) or to continue with the usual practice of tobacco prevention, if any (control condition). The intervention was delivered by dentists or dental hygienists individually to patients who were tobacco users. Given the nature of the control condition, there was no standardization of intervention in this group. The follow-up time was six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Intervention</title><p id="p0040">The intervention was developed by the Swedish National Institute of Public Health in line with the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare guidelines on brief standardized advice in dental care for disease prevention and health promotion.

It consisted of a 5&#x000a0;min, single-session counseling delivered during a dental visit. According to the written instructions given to the dental professional the following components had to be delivered to all patients: (a) <italic>Ask</italic> about tobacco use, (b) <italic>Advise</italic> to quit relating tobacco use with the patient's oral health (c) <italic>Assess</italic> willingness to quit (&#x0201c;Have you thought about quitting?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Are you interested in quitting?&#x0201d;) and (d) <italic>Assist</italic> by offering information about available support for tobacco use cessation and/or a leaflet about the quitting process (minimal <italic>Assist</italic>). For patients considering quitting, <italic>Assist</italic> included more specific components (setting a quit date, discussion about abstinence problems, suggestion or prescription of pharmacological treatment) and should have been followed by (e) <italic>Arrange</italic>, i.e. referral to Smoking Quit Line, or to other available smoking cessation resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Sample and data collection</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0045">A total of 467 patients participated in the FRITT study.

Concerning tobacco use, 43.6% used snus (Swedish moist smokeless tobacco product), 47.5% smoked cigarettes while only 8.9% were dual users. The average duration of use was 24.4 (<italic>SD</italic> 14.0) years, being highly correlated with patients' age. The majority of the participants were light or moderate tobacco users (51.2% used less than 10 cigarettes/snus pouches daily), used tobacco within 30&#x000a0;min after awakening (58.4%), had a history of at least one previous quit attempt (86.7%), were not considering quitting tobacco at all or in the next six months (81.1%) and never received a diagnosis of chronic disease (69.9%) <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p id="p0050">The analytical sample for this study included the 452 patients (97%) who participated in the six-month follow-up.

In accordance with the Stages of Change framework <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and the timeline of the study, the patients were classified as being in pre-contemplation stage (&#x0201c;I want to quit completely, but later than six months&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Have not yet decided, if and when I will quit completely&#x0201d;) or in contemplation/preparation stage (&#x0201c;I have decided to quit completely within six months&#x0201d;).

In this study, we considered potential confounders patients' characteristics that may have influenced dental practitioners' conduct, i.e. age, sex, occupation, education, disease status and tobacco-related characteristics, i.e. readiness to quit, length of tobacco use, time to tobacco use after awakening, amount of tobacco used daily, previous quit attempts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Analytical methods</title><p id="p0075">In the PP analysis, we compared the study outcomes of individuals randomized to the intervention arm and receiving the counseling &#x0201c;as-intended&#x0201d; with all those randomized to control group. The selection of the entire control group as the reference group was done because there was no univocal definition of &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d;, therefore, no manualized protocol for the control group. The PP comparison could be affected by confounding if common prognostic factors for the receipt of the assigned intervention and the occurrence of the outcomes are not adjusted for (e.g. motivation to quit). Additionally, the restriction to the &#x0201c;per-protocol&#x0201d; subgroup introduces selection bias <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0080">In the AT analysis, we compared the effect of being exposed to different number of counseling components with no tobacco counseling. The different exposure levels were (a) five components - all the 5 A's (b) four components &#x02013; any combination of 4 A's (c) less than 4 components - any type of tobacco cessation counseling not described in (a) or (b). Therefore, we ignored the random assignment to intervention or control group as well as the protocol requirement to adapt the counseling to the patient's readiness to quit. Similarly to the PP, the AT could be affected by confounding.</p><p id="p0085">To address the observed heterogeneity in terms of counseling received and outcomes achieved in the PP analysis, we additionally compared patients randomized to the intervention but non-receiving it &#x0201c;as-intended&#x0201d; with the &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; group. This analysis would inform on the &#x0201c;additional effect of being randomized to intervention&#x0201d;, i.e. effects in the intervention group not attributable to the intervention. In fact, non-receivers of the &#x0201c;intended&#x0201d; intervention would not differ from the control condition under the alternative hypothesis.</p><p id="p0090">All the prognostic factors described previously, except readiness to quit were considered as potential confounders in the PP, AT analyses and the additional analysis described above. Readiness to quit was considered as potential confounder only in the AT analysis, as in the PP analysis it was included in the definition of the &#x0201c;as-intended&#x0201d; treatment.</p><p id="p0095">The Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis is an approach proposed to estimate the intervention effect in the sub-sample for which the received treatment was fully determined by the instrumental variable (i.e. the random assignment). By contrast to PP and AT, this method would implicitly control for confounding introduced by factors related to non-adherence because it compares groups for which the assignment will always have the same (positive) effect on delivery.

Each prognostic factor at baseline was used in adjusted models one at the time. In no case the crude estimates of association changed with more than 10%, therefore we retained for adjustments only time to tobacco use after awakening as indicator of dependence. In the AT analysis we adjusted also for readiness to quit. Sensitivity analyses were performed for missing data for the outcomes (assuming unchanged tobacco use from baseline). The average success ratios for the tobacco use cessation outcomes in IV analysis were calculated with hand calculator. All statistical analyses using ordinary logistic regression were performed using the statistical software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. To account for the clustering effect, the association between the exposure and outcomes was also estimated using multilevel logistic regression with random intercept (SAS v. 9.4). We conducted a formal test of the model with random effects by Likelihood Ratio Test. In no case the test indicated a significantly better fit of the multilevel model compared to ordinary logistic regression. The Intra-Cluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for each model was close to 0 for all the associations when including relevant covariates. Accordingly, the results from the multilevel logistic regression produced results very close to the ordinary logistic regression, but these latter models were more stable, as indicated by the&#x000a0;&#x02212;2 log likelihood.

In essence, the proportions of patients reporting successful outcomes were higher among the receivers of the intervention &#x0201c;as-intended&#x0201d; than among the patients treated as usual, but significantly so only for the reduction of consumption. In the as-treat (AT) analysis, the effect of being exposed to different components of the intervention was evaluated. The AT results were in line with those of the other analyses, indicating that structured counseling consisting of 4 A's or 5 A's had an effect on facilitating a substantial reduction of tobacco consumption when compared with no tobacco counseling. The success ratios calculated through the instrumental variable (IV) analysis were similar to the odds ratios estimated by ITT for two of the outcomes (seven-day abstinence and quit-attempts), but were higher for continuous three-month abstinence and for half-reduction. However, it should be kept in mind that one central assumption underlying this analysis (exclusion restriction assumption) was most likely violated in this study.</p><p id="p0170">ITT is the standard method of analysis in RCTs yielding the least biased estimate in placebo RCTs <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Also, it is the reference method to estimate effectiveness in pragmatic trials, as it simulates a real life situation, allowing for a certain degree of protocol deviation <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, in randomized controlled trials when the comparator is usual care or an active treatment, the ITT analysis may bias the effect of the alternative intervention in any direction <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The least biased results of alternative intervention's true effect may be obtained using any of the four approaches (ITT, PP, AT, IV) depending on the expected size of the effect, the magnitude of and the reasons for non-adherence <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As these methods have both common and individual sources of bias, conducting supplementary analyses of the kind presented in this article increases the understanding of the true effect of the intervention.</p><p id="p0180">In this study, the good agreement between the results from ITT and PP methods can be explained by several factors. First, adherence was high both in the intervention group and in the usual care group, the latter delivering just minimal components compared with the experimental counseling. Secondly, the prognostic factors for tobacco cessation outcomes were evenly distributed between receivers of the intervention and patients assigned to usual care. Therefore, the comparison was not confounded by these baseline characteristics as it was also confirmed after discounting their possible effect through adjustment in multiple logistic regression models. Thirdly, selection bias which could severely affect the results of the PP seemed not to be an issue at least regarding the measured baseline characteristics associated with prognosis. However, selective delivery of the intervention may be caused by unmeasured prognostic factors at the patient level, such as self-efficacy <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This may lead to under-estimation of the effect of the manualized intervention if patients with low self-efficacy would be targeted with the complete intervention to a higher extent than those with high self-efficacy.</p><p id="p0185">In a classical approach of AT analysis the comparison is done between the adherent group (the same as in the PP analysis) and the rest of the sample (including the non-adherent group excluded from the PP analysis) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We used an adaptation of this format, contrasting patients reached by different qualitative and quantitative levels of the counseling, irrespective of the experimental group they were assigned to. The decision to use an adaptation of the classical AT approach was determined by two factors. Firstly, using the formal AT definition, we would have had a very heterogeneous comparison group, merging individuals receiving counseling components approximating the intended protocol and individuals receiving no or just minimal counseling (those initially randomized to the control condition). Secondly, in a pragmatic trial with a multi-component experimental intervention, some components could be offered spontaneously in &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d;, therefore the difference between &#x0201c;treated&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-treated&#x0201d; according to the protocol is likely to constitute an artifact in the AT analysis <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In fact, some of the components of the manualized intervention are likely to be delivered in &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d; in Sweden, a country in which dental clinics have a strong mandate on prevention and health promotion (i.e. guidelines for tobacco control) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we considered that an analysis contrasting individuals receiving specific intervention components with those who did not receive any tobacco counseling, would be more informative, conditionally on baseline characteristics representing indications to those components (i.e. patient readiness to quit).</p><p id="p0190">In behavioral interventions, the IV assumption that the only pathway between the assignment to the intervention and the projected outcome goes through full-delivery of the intervention itself is usually violated, because patients targeted with a high level of care may be prompted to change their behavior in other domains, thus increasing the success of favorable outcomes <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, even the patients randomly assigned to the treatment, but not receiving it as intended presented more favorable outcomes than the control group. A possible reason could be that the counseling offered by dental practitioners in the intervention group differed in intensity and quality from the &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d;, even when not delivered as intended.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="p0195">The careful monitoring of the implementation process was a major strength in the FRITT trial, making it possible to carry PP and AT analyses and to provide the empirical base for the assumptions underlying the IV analysis. The balanced distribution between experimental groups of baseline characteristics representing important prognostic factors for tobacco use cessation was also a notable feature of the study.</p><p id="p0200">We acknowledge some major limitations, first and foremost that adherence was not defined a priori as part of the protocol <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the definition used in this study was driven by theory and previous empirical evidence, not by the study results. Furthermore, adherence had different definitions in the intervention and control group. As adherence to &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; was not manualized and could not be univocally defined, this condition was considered to have virtually full adherence. The level of support offered in &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; followed a pattern recognizable in other studies where a majority of health practitioners actually declare no action beyond asking about tobacco use and advising about its negative consequences <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p id="p0205">Further, in assessing adherence we used reports by dental practitioners and by the patients' themselves (readiness to quit in&#x000a0;the baseline survey). However, practitioners may have instantaneously adjusted the intervention delivery to additional information gathered during the visit. This would result in a misclassification of the stage-appropriate counseling which could distort the results of the PP and IV analysis. Both dental practitioners' and patients' reports could be affected by social desirability, leading to a misclassification of the readiness to quit and/or to an inflated estimation of the delivered counseling.</p><p id="p0210">Finally, since blindness could not be assured, we cannot exclude the possibility of biased reports, if the individuals in the intervention group underreported their tobacco use at follow up. It is reasonable to assume that the patients report bias would influence in the same way the several outcomes we used. Therefore, the different effect of the intervention on the various outcomes along the continuum of smoking cessation (i.e. effective for half-reduction, but not abstinence) suggest that the results are genuine (i.e. not distorted by patient's report bias). Moreover, in a previous study <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> it was observed that favorable outcomes mostly concerned snus users, who would be less sensitive to social desirability arguments compared to cigarette smokers, at least in a country such Sweden where snus is widely accepted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0215">Defining non-adherence at the intervention provider and at the intervention recipient level and conducting secondary analyses of randomized trials are useful strategies to strengthen and to put in context the inference based on the intention-to-treat analysis.
