Women in the Canadian province of Newfoundland &#x00026; Labrador have relatively low rates of cervical cancer screening, with rates of around 40&#x000a0;% between 2007 and 2009. Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause for the development of cervical cancer, and HPV testing, including self-sampling, has been suggested as an alternative method of cervical cancer screening that may alleviate some barriers to screening. Our objective was to determine whether offering self-collected HPV testing screening increased cervical cancer screening rates in rural communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>During the 2-year study, three community-based cohorts were assigned to receive either i) a cervical cancer education campaign with the option of HPV testing; ii) an educational campaign alone; iii) or no intervention. Self-collection kits were offered to eligible women at family medicine clinics and community centres, and participants were surveyed to determine their acceptance of the HPV self-collection kit. Paired proportions testing for before-after studies was used to determine differences in screening rates from baseline, and Chi Square analysis of three dimensional 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 tables compared the change between communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cervical cancer screening increased by 15.2&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) to 67.4&#x000a0;% in the community where self-collection was available, versus a 2.9&#x000a0;% increase (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) in the community that received educational campaigns and 8.5&#x000a0;% in the community with no intervention (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.193). The difference in change in rates was statistically significant between communities A and B (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) but not between communities A and C (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.193). The response rate was low, with only 9.5&#x000a0;% (168/1760) of eligible women opting to self-collect for HPV testing. Of the women who completed self-collection, 15.5&#x000a0;% (26) had not had a Pap smear in the last 3 years, and 88.7&#x000a0;% reported that they were somewhat or very satisfied with self-collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Offering self-collected HPV testing increased the cervical cancer screening rate in a rural NL community. Women who completed self-collection had generally positive feelings about the experience. Offering HPV self-collection may increase screening compliance, particularly among women who do not present for routine Pap smears.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cervical cancer screening</kwd><kwd>Women&#x02019;s health</kwd><kwd>Community medicine</kwd><kwd>Health promotion</kwd><kwd>Patient education</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Cervical cancer is preventable and treatable if detected early. Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While most HPV infections are transient and clear in 12 to 18&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], women who have persistent infection with oncogenic HPV are at increased risk of pre-cancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Asymptomatic cervical HPV infection can be detected in 5&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of women of reproductive age with the prevalence declining with advancing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The relative risk for the association between HPV infection and cervical neoplasia is of high magnitude, typically in the 20&#x02013;70 range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This range is greater than that for the association between smoking and lung cancer and is comparable only to that of the association between chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In countries where Pap smear screening is widely available, studies have shown that more than half of all invasive cervical cancers are diagnosed in women who are under- or un-screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These studies have also suggested that up to 30&#x000a0;% of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer were considered adequately screened by Pap smear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Self-collected HPV testing has been suggested as an effective cervical cancer screening tool that is acceptable to women and may encourage better adherence to regular screening, particularly among women who are under-screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that detecting early cell changes earlier using HPV does prevent some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and women report satisfaction with self-sampling and a willingness to screen in this manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Self-sampled HPV testing alleviates some of the discomfort and embarrassment that some women feel with a Pap smear, which may be a barrier to screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool is still the subject of debate in the literature. The Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care felt there was insufficient evidence to endorse HPV testing as a method of primary cervical cancer screening in its 2013 recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but a self-sampled HPV test has been approved as a primary screening tool in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and many studies continue to evaluate the potential of this technology in low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>It has long been known that individuals living in rural communities have poorer prognosis for a variety of health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including an adjusted cancer survival rate that is 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;% lower than their urban-dwelling peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Referral delays, lack of providers, providers&#x02019; attitudes toward screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and limited access to screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are cited as potential reasons for this disparity. Self-sampled HPV testing has been studied as a way to screen women for cervical cancer in rural parts of developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but its efficacy and effectiveness in rural and remote regions of developed nations is less understood.</p><p>Taking this into consideration, we devised a community-based study in rural areas of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada, to determine whether offering self-collected HPV testing might be an effective tool to increase cervical cancer screening participation. Despite comprehensive education programs and promotional campaigns, only 43&#x000a0;% of women in NL participated in Pap smear screening from 2007&#x02013;2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our objective was to determine if the introduction of a self-collection strategy for HPV screening would increase primary cervical cancer screening in a community-based setting in rural NL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study used a community-based cohort design targeting women aged 30&#x02013;69 years, excluding pregnant women.

<sup>b</sup>For years 2010 and 2011 for Community A the screening rate was determined by adding the number of women who had a Pap smear to the women who did self-collection but did not have a Pap smear to avoid counting in duplicate those women who self-collected and had a Pap smear</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Screening rates</title><p>In Community A the cervical cancer screening rate (Pap smear or HPV testing as screen) increased by 15.2&#x000a0;% during the 2 years of the study. This is statistically and, we believe, clinically significant. In Community B the rate increased by only 2.9&#x000a0;% during the study period. This suggests that the availability of self-collection in Community A did improve cervical cancer screening rates beyond the effect of simply having an intense educational and media campaign.</p><p>Despite a comparable screening rate of 45&#x000a0;% in 2006, Community C had a screening rate of 72&#x000a0;% in the two years prior to the study, and the screening rate increased by 8.5&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) during the study period. Our study was conducted during a period of time when awareness of the low cervical cancer screening rate was increasing. The overall proportion of women considered adequately&#x000a0; screened in the province rose from 68.2&#x000a0;% during 2006&#x02013;2008 to 74.4&#x000a0;% during 2009&#x02013;2011, changing NL from a province with one of the lowest participation rates in the country to among the highest in just 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The provincial Cervical Screening Initiatives educational and promotional campaigns continued in all three communities. Through personal communications with a senior physician in the area, we also learned of a nurse practitioner and a young family physician in Community C who both began practicing in the community immediately prior to and during the study period, both of whom were proactive with cervical cancer screening. These confounding factors may be responsible for the unexpected increase in screening rates in our control community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Response rate</title><p>Our uptake rate was relatively low compared to other studies of HPV self-collection programs. Of the 837 kits that were picked up, only 168 (20.1&#x000a0;%) were returned, and only 9.5&#x000a0;% of the eligible population of women participated in HPV self-collection. Researchers in Mexico completed a trial of women from low socioeconomic status and obtained a response rate of 74.6&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study in rural Mississippi offered under-screened women the opportunity to self-collect for HPV in their homes or to have a pap smear and 64.7&#x000a0;% chose to self-collect for HPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In both these studies, however, nurses went directly to participants&#x02019; homes and helped them with their sample and paperwork. This type of specialized care would no doubt increase participation rates; however in the general population such intervention is not feasible for each and every woman.</p><p>Our objective was to evaluate whether the introduction of self-collected HPV kits alongside traditional Pap smears would increase overall screening in the community. This makes our study more comparable to other screening programs in the country where people are responsible for initiating or completing their own testing. For example, colorectal cancer screening initiatives have participation rates of 23&#x000a0;% in Manitoba (2009/10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and 27&#x000a0;% in Ontario (2009/10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In Newfoundland and Labrador the participation in breast cancer screening was 25.5&#x000a0;% in 2003&#x02013;04 after 8&#x000a0;years of the program being in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These numbers are more comparable with our results.</p><p>One also wonders why 669 of the 837 kits that were picked up were not returned. Self-collected HPV testing is thought to overcome many of the barriers to participation in Pap smear screening, including pain and discomfort with pelvic exams, difficulty scheduling appointments, transportation issues, and lack of access to primary care providers, and many studies in the literature report much higher response rates than we observed. In the questionnaires, many of our participants stated that the reason they were under-screened was that they simply, &#x0201c;had not gotten around to [having a Pap smear]&#x0201d; (31.3&#x000a0;%). Perhaps the self-collection kit alleviates the barriers of time and scheduling for some women, but clearly there are still some impediments to wider use of the kits. Another potential barrier was the amount of paperwork involved in the study, which may have deterred some women with lower educational levels to take but not return kits, when they realized the amount of paperwork involved. The kit contained instructions (3 pages), consent forms (6 pages) and questionnaires (3 pages), for a total of 12 pages of documents, which may have been overwhelming or too time-consuming for participants.</p><p>The literature suggests that the method by which women are provided with the HPV self-collection kits may affect participation. An Italian study comparing different self-sampling distribution methods found that when kits were mailed directly to women, rather than providing women the option to request a kit, the response rate more than doubled from 8.7&#x000a0;% to 19.6&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It seems that direct mailing, rather than &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; screening may increase participation. As the bulk of the cost of HPV testing is incurred at the laboratory phase, distributing the relatively inexpensive kits widely may, indeed, be cost efficient. The kits used for our study cost $3 CAD each, with an additional cost of $35 CAD plus technician time for the HPV DNA assay at the time of our study, although costs will vary by jurisdiction and are likely to decrease over time. Distributing self-collected HPV kits directly to women identified as under-screened through cervical screening registries may be an efficient method to utilize this technology, and the results from the study mentioned previously indicate a willingness of these women to participate in this way.</p><p>Of the women who completed self-collection, 88.8&#x000a0;% found the process somewhat or very satisfactory. Furthermore, 15.5&#x000a0;% (26) of the women who performed the self-collection were under-screened or unscreened. These women did not attend regular screening in the past, and the self-collection kit provided a method that they were more willing to use.</p><p>A discussion of cervical cancer screening would be incomplete without the acknowledgement of the importance of organized cervical screening programs. A systematic review of methods to improve cervical cancer screening has found standard recall letters to be effective at increasing compliance with cervical cancer screening via Pap smear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Self-collection has been shown in our study and others to be an effective method of increasing screening rates, but we suggest that it would be most effective if used as part of an organized screening program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Implications for rural communities</title><p>Self-collection seems to alleviate some barriers to screening in rural communities, but our study indicates that the rate of uptake may hinder its utility. Self-sampling is fast, women are overwhelmingly able to collect adequate samples, and it can be implemented in communities that have no or very few regular primary care providers. However, our study makes clear the fact that simply providing kits may not sufficiently encourage women to self-collect, and further study of more targeted or direct distribution methods is warranted prior to wider use of this self-collected HPV testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Availability of a self-collection option increased the cervical screening rate by 15.2&#x000a0;%. Twenty-six (15.5&#x000a0;%) women who used self-collection in Community A had been unscreened or under-screened prior to the study. Twenty percent of the self-collection kits that were taken from distribution sites were returned with samples. Participants found the self-collection test acceptable. We feel self-collection should be considered as an option for cervical cancer screening as part of an organized cervical screening program.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PD, MG, SR, LD, DF, AL, MT-Y, WG, MR, GM, and AP participated in the conception and design of the project.
