A pressure ulcer is defined as &#x0201c;a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Their severity varies from skin erythema to full thickness tissue loss with damage extending into muscle and bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Annually, pressure ulcers affect an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 individuals in Canada with an overall estimated prevalence of 26.0&#x000a0;% in healthcare institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Germany, the prevalence rate is estimated to be 10 to 25&#x000a0;% among ward patients and as high as 30&#x000a0;% in rehabilitation centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In one Austrian public hospital, incidence rates were between 1.39&#x000a0;% and 7.98&#x000a0;% for Stage 1, 0.14&#x000a0;% and 1.52&#x000a0;% for Stage II, and 0&#x000a0;% and 0.88&#x000a0;% for Stage III pressure ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>More severe cases require intensive therapy, have longer healing times and are associated with a higher incidence of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the United States, the average hospital treatment cost associated with stage IV pressure ulcers range from $124,327 to $129,248 USD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], whereas in the UK the estimated cost of treatment varies from &#x000a3;1,214 to &#x000a3;14,108 per case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar costs are seen in Canada, where the estimated average monthly cost of pressure ulcer management among individuals with a spinal cord injury in 2010 was $4,475 CDN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The development of pressure ulcers is multifactorial. General risk factors for their development include limited mobility and activity causing excessive interface pressure between the skin and the supporting surface; compromised tissue perfusion (associated with conditions such as diabetes and anemia); a variety of skin conditions; excessive skin moisture (for example, from urinary incontinence); advanced age; malnutrition; and poor general health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additional predictors of pressure ulceration among adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) include admission duration, norepinephrine administration and, the presence of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Among adults with spinal cord injuries, delayed and/or inappropriate medical management, history of or existing pressure ulceration and limited independence in self-care are predictive of their development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Among at-risk individuals, pressure ulcers develop on body areas exposed to unrelieved high interface pressure over prolonged periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If interface pressure is higher than mean capillary blood pressure, blood flow can be compromised, with the affected areas becoming ischemic and necrotic if the duration of pressure is sufficiently sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Though commonly accepted that an area becomes at-risk when interface pressure exceeds 30 to 32&#x000a0;mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it must be emphasized that the duration of the interface pressure is equally as important as the magnitude of the interface pressure.</p><p>As pressure applied over a prolonged period is a key risk factor in the development of pressure ulcers, frequent and regular repositioning of the patient is a common practice that has been recognized for decades as an integral component of prevention and treatment protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To date, the published literature has established neither repositioning nor the frequency of repositioning to be effective at preventing and managing pressure ulceration. One Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is limited robust evidence on the effectiveness of positioning and frequency of repositioning for pressure ulcer prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, another Cochrane review could not find any randomized trials that assess the effectiveness of repositioning on healing rates of pressure ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus while repositioning is rational and widely recommended, the lack of robust evaluations of how repositioning alters interface pressure has led to uncertainty and a clear need for high-quality, adequately powered trials to assess different approaches to the implementation of repositioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is generally accepted that many pressure ulcers are avoidable though there are also situations where they cannot be prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Due to the complexity of pressure ulcer development, many acute and long-term care facilities adopt multipronged, multidisciplinary interventions to prevent pressure ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Current best practice guidelines recommend a standardized pressure ulcer risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] (herein the &#x0201c;Braden Scale&#x0201d;) is the most validated with good sensitivity/specificity balance and predictive abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, these strategies still do not directly address the relation between repositioning and interface pressure.</p><p>Since inadequate pressure redistribution is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of pressure ulcers, continuous pressure imaging (&#x0201c;CPI&#x0201d;) of the interface pressure between the body and support surface could play a role in an overall preventive strategy for pressure ulcers. A thin mattress cover with embedded interface pressure sensors and continuous monitoring capabilities could provide real-time interface pressure measurements over anatomical pressure points in a format viewable to healthcare providers, patients and their families on a bedside liquid-crystal display (&#x0201c;LCD&#x0201d;) monitor. Caregivers and/or healthcare providers could utilize these data to determine when and how a patient should be repositioned in order to redistribute optimally the interface pressure in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A recent prospective controlled study indicated that CPI could decrease the incidence of pressure ulcers in a medical intensive care unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this study, only 0.9&#x000a0;% of patients with the intervention developed pressure ulcers graded at Stage II, as compared to 4.8&#x000a0;% of the patients in the control group who developed them, also at the Stage II level. In a another study over a 2-month period, only one patient (0.03&#x000a0;%) in the group of patients placed on beds with a continuous bedside pressure mapping (CBPM) system developed a pressure ulcer, whereas 16 patients (5&#x000a0;%) of the historical control group of patients placed on the same beds without CBPM (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Further research is required to assess whether this technology can have similar positive effects in other care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>This study will use XSENSOR Technology Corporation&#x02019;s ForeSite PT&#x02122; Patient Turn System (referred to as the &#x0201c;ForeSite PT&#x02122; system&#x0201d;), a patient repositioning reminder system utilizing CPI technology through a pressure-sensing mattress cover, to test the efficacy of this approach in reducing interface pressure among at-risk hospitalized patients. Our team has previously undertaken an evaluation of the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system, demonstrating a positive effect of the technology on purposeful turning of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the goal of this prior study was not to measure changes in actual interface pressure. This proposed study will build on our previous XSENSOR research to test the efficacy of CPI in reducing interface pressure for at-risk patients. As the most recent Canadian publication on estimates of pressure ulcer occurrence is relatively outdated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], this study will provide updated data as well as help inform the Canadian context.</p><p>The primary study objective is to test the efficacy of a CPI system (ForeSite PT&#x02122; system) in its ability to reduce interface pressure as reflected by a composite interface pressure analysis.</p><p>Secondary objectives include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>to assess whether CPI reduces the incidence of pressure-related tissue changes,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to determine the minimum interface pressure associated with higher risk for pressure ulcer development, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess healthcare provider and patient perceptions of this CPI system.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Specifically, the study will address the following research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Is CPI efficacious in reducing interface pressure by assisting healthcare providers in determining the need and type of patient turning/repositioning that would result in lower interface pressure?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does the application of CPI reduce the incidence of pressure-related skin changes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does interface pressure correlate with clinical outcomes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the perceptions (both positive and negative) of healthcare providers to CPI with regard to the functionality, ease of use and interpretation of pressure data on the monitor?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the perceptions (both positive and negative) of patients (and if appropriate, family members) to CPI (including mattress cover and monitor display of their pressure points)?</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Calgary (REB13-0794).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial will take place in a tertiary acute care center situated in a major urban center. Participants will be recruited from nursing units that care for patients with a high risk of pressure ulcer development, including acute medical, neurology, neurosurgery and intensive care units. A parallel, two-group, randomized controlled design will be utilized to assess the effect of CPI on interface pressure, pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes and the perceptions of healthcare providers and patients. Eligible consenting inpatients will be randomly allocated to either one of two groups in a ratio of 1:1 and then followed for 3&#x000a0;days (72&#x000a0;h) or until discharge. The intervention group will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system and the LCD monitor turned on to provide visual feedback to the healthcare providers while collecting continuous interface pressure data. The control group will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system turned on for collecting continuous interface pressure data, but the LCD monitor will be turned off so as not to provide visual feedback to the healthcare providers. As a safeguard against use of the monitor for visual feedback among the control group, the monitor&#x02019;s brightness controls will be adjusted to limit visibility and a cover will be placed over the monitor. Interface pressure readings will be analyzed using hourly snapshot samples of continuous interface pressure recordings. Clinical outcomes will be obtained at baseline (within 24&#x000a0;h of admission) and on the third day of the trial. The perceptions of patients allocated to the intervention group and the perceptions of healthcare providers each time a patient in their care is allocated to the intervention group will be measured on the third day. A subset of 60 participants from the study (30 intervention, 30 control) will have data collection until their discharge from the hospital in order to allow for a longer duration for clinical outcomes to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The charge nurse, and/or the patient care manager, and/or clinicians on their respective units, will facilitate the identification of eligible inpatients by a daily review of new admissions. After an eligible patient has been identified, the research nurse or the research assistant will ask him or her (or a proxy decision-maker, if not capable of consenting), if he or she would be interested in participating in a study to evaluate a pressure sensing technology that may provide real-time feedback to healthcare providers. If the patient agrees to participate, he or she will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to being enrolled in the study. Once the patient provides written informed consent, the research nurse will set up the CPI system, including placing the sensor mattress cover under the linen and mounting the LCD monitor to the headwall. The research nurse will ensure that the sensor mattress cover and monitor are functioning properly on a daily basis and will instruct housekeeping on sterilization practices of the device components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility</title><p>The selection of patients will be based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>The inclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Adult males or females, with a minimum age of 18&#x000a0;years old.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expected to have a length of stay on the unit of at least 3&#x000a0;days.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Require assistance with bed mobility or completely dependent for bed mobility as determined by the &#x0201c;Bed&#x0201d; components in the de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI).</p><p>Eligible patients would meet the following criteria:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Unable (score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;) to bridge, roll onto their side, and sit from lying supine.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unable (score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;) to bridge and roll onto their side, and requires minimal</p></list-item><list-item><p>Able (score of &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;) to bridge, unable to roll onto their side (score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;), and requires minimal assistance and/or supervision with sitting from lying supine.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Capacity to provide consent, or have a surrogate decision-maker to provide consent on their behalf.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not near the end of life within 3&#x000a0;days of enrollment in the study.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The exclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Have a planned admission to another unit (including those identified as a setting for data collection in the study) within three days of enrollment in the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sleep in a chair at night.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any patients whose clinical care would be negatively impacted if turned or repositioned.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Setting</title><p>This trial will take place in at least five inpatient nursing units at the Foothills Medical Centre, a tertiary care institution, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The five units include, but are not limited to the following: 1) Unit 36 and Unit 37 in the Special Services Building, the internal medicine services that care for vulnerable general medical inpatients with immobility arising from complex multisystem medical illness; 2) the intensive care unit (&#x0201c;ICU&#x0201d;) that cares for sedated and immobilized patients requiring life support for prolonged periods of time; and 3) Unit 101 and Unit 112, acute neurological units that care for patients with mobility impairment resulting from neurological illnesses, spinal cord and/or significant head injuries.

Three days was chosen as the duration for four reasons: 1) it is the average length of stay in the inpatient units where this trial is taking place, and extending the enrollment period beyond 3&#x000a0;days when patients may be transferred to another nursing unit may introduce more variability in the nursing practice and care and would not be feasible if they are discharged to another facility or home; 2) expert consensus of the investigation team deemed that 3&#x000a0;days was sufficient for pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes to develop; 3) there is likely to be change in nursing shifts and personnel beyond 3&#x000a0;days, thereby introducing more variables; and 4) as interface pressure will be continually collected throughout the enrollment period, a longer duration would result in an extremely large volume of data. Thus, 3&#x000a0;days will allow for optimal data collection while maintaining feasibility of participant enrolment.</p><p>Following the 3-day enrollment period, a subset of 60 participants who have not yet been discharged will continue to undergo continuous interface pressure monitoring until they are discharged from the hospital.

This will be achieved by the sampling of pressure readings at hourly intervals regardless of whether there has been turning/repositioning when the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system&#x02019;s LCD monitor is turned on and when it is turned off.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A pressure imaging session processed by XSENSOR Pressure Exposure Analyzer Tool (PEAT)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_949_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Processed pressure imaging session extracted in CSV format</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_949_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Treatment group</title><p>Inpatients assigned to the treatment group will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system&#x02019;s LCD monitor turned on (that is, real-time images of interface pressure will be displayed on the monitor) during their enrollment in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group</title><p>Inpatients assigned to the control group will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system&#x02019;s LCD monitor turned off and hidden so that it cannot be accessed by healthcare providers wanting to see pressure readings (that is, real-time images of interface pressure will not be displayed on the monitor).

Pressure-related blanchable erythema (excluding dermatitis, cellulitis, and trauma)</td><td>Intact skin with redness; skin remains blanchable on compression, potentially reversible change</td></tr><tr><td>2. Stage I pressure ulcer (nonblanchable erythema)</td><td>Intact skin with nonblanchable redness of a localized area, usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. The area may be painful, firm, soft, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Category I may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. May indicate &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; persons.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Stage II pressure ulcer (partial thickness skin loss)</td><td>Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled or sero-sanginous filled blister. Presents as a shiny or dry shallow ulcer without slough or bruising*. This category should not be used to describe skin tears, tape burns, incontinence associated dermatitis, maceration or excoriation. *Bruising indicates deep tissue injury.</td></tr><tr><td>4. Stage III pressure ulcer (full thickness skin loss)</td><td>Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon and muscle are <italic>not</italic> exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. <italic>May</italic> include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a Category/Stage III pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and Category/Stage III ulcers can be shallow. In contrast, areas of significant adiposity can develop extremely deep Category/Stage III pressure ulcers. Bone/tendon is not visible or directly palpable.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Stage IV pressure ulcer (full thickness tissue loss)</td><td>Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present. Often includes undermining and tunneling. The depth of a Category/Stage IV pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Category/Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (for example, fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis or osteitis likely to occur. Exposed bone/muscle is visible or directly palpable.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Unstageable/Unclassified: Full thickness skin or tissue loss - depth unknown</td><td>Full thickness tissue loss in which actual depth of the ulcer is completely obscured by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) in the wound bed. Until enough slough and/or eschar are removed to expose the base of the wound, the true depth cannot be determined; but it will be either a Category/Stage III or IV. Stable (dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) eschar on the heels serves as &#x0201c;the body&#x02019;s natural (biological) cover&#x0201d; and should not be removed.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Suspected deep tissue injury - depth unknown</td><td>Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood-filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Evolution may include a thin blister over a dark wound bed. The wound may further evolve and become covered by thin eschar. Evolution may be rapid exposing additional layers of tissue even with optimal treatment.</td></tr><tr><td>8. Infection - cellulitis around pressure ulcer</td><td>This presents as redness, warmth and swelling in the skin around the pressure ulcers.</td></tr><tr><td>9. Infection - pressure ulcer wound base infection, osteomyelitis</td><td>This presents as drainage (potentially purulent) with strong odor from the base of the pressure ulcer. May have necrotic material as wound base.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Perceptions (both positive and negative) of healthcare providers caring for patients allocated to the treatment group to the CPI system.

This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of CPI for reducing interface pressure and on the development of pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes. This RCT will compare the interface pressure and pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes between the intervention group, which will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system with the LCD monitor turned on to provide visual feedback through CPI to the clinicians, and the control group, which will have the ForeSite PT&#x02122; system with the LCD monitor turned off, therefore not providing visual feedback or CPI to the clinicians. Both groups will undergo continuous interface pressure data collection and clinical assessment. Thus, the present RCT will contribute to a better understanding of the role of CPI in interface pressure management and, subsequently, the prevention and management of pressure ulcers.</p><p>While this RCT in itself is not likely to be sufficient to inform health system decision making on whether to purchase CPI systems en masse, the findings could provide greater understanding of the use of this technology in clinical practice. This study also has the potential to increase our understanding of the relation between interface pressure and skin and tissue changes resulting from the exposure to prolonged pressure. A much larger trial would be required in subsequent stages to determine the impact of CPI on the hard clinical endpoint of overt pressure ulceration, that is, the clinical outcome that we are ultimately trying to prevent. The present RCT described here will build significantly on previous research on interface pressure and pressure ulcer development, and it will clarify the role of CPI in modifying interface pressures, an important intermediate goal in the prevision pressure ulcers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>To date, a total of 117 participants have been recruited; of these, 105 have been included in the trial, and 12 were excluded.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIHS</term><def><p>Alberta Innovates Health Solutions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBC</term><def><p>complete blood count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPI</term><def><p>continuous pressure imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRIO</term><def><p>Collaborative Research and Innovation Opportunities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ForeSite PT&#x02122; system</term><def><p>ForeSite PT&#x02122; Patient Turn System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LCD</term><def><p>liquid crystal display</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p><p>This study has been supported by the Alberta Innovates Health Solutions (AIHS) Collaborative Research and Innovation Opportunities (CRIO) team grant (number 20130152).
