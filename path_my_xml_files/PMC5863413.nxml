It is attributed to the basal layer degeneration and band-like infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages. T helper 1 and T helper 2 are the well-known independent subdivisions of T cells. Recently, a third &#x0201c;T helper&#x0201d; subdivision has been recognized, which plays a principal role in defense against extracellular pathogens. This subdivision of T cells controls immune and inflammatory responses through secretion of cytokines such as Interleukin 17. This family of T cells provides a new route for cooperation between innate and acquired immunity. The major role of IL-17 is to increase the expression of threatening factors for colony chemokines, metalloproteinase, and IL-6. Therefore, IL-17 is a strong stimulator for recalling, activating, and immigration of neutrophils, production of INF-alpha, IL-B from macrophages, and recalling eosinophils.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Zenouz <italic>et al</italic>., it was proven that propolis administration significantly decreased IL-17 serum levels, VAS means, and the maximum lesion sizes in patients with symptomatic OLP.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>A study conducted by Zyada <italic>et al</italic>. also obtained favorable results in the management of OLP using topical propolis.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we hypothesized that propolis could minimize the underlying inflammatory mechanism by lowering the levels of IL-17, thereby preventing the destruction of the basement membrane by the lymphocytes.</p><p>With this background in mind, this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical propolis in the management of OLP and to further strengthen the previously obtained results.</p><p>The demographic pattern and clinical profile of OLP patients were also recorded in our study.

A larger sample size would have allowed for stronger statistical analysis. Another limitation of the study was the dependence on patient's compliance which could not be monitored. Furthermore, since the patients were followed up only till 14 days, the recurrence rate of LP could not be elicited.</p><p>Future studies can be conducted using a larger sample size to further authenticate the effectiveness of propolis. A longer follow-up period will help in demonstrating a difference in the recurrence rate of LP among the study and the control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study comprised of 27 patients diagnosed with OLP, among which 15 patients were in the control group and the rest 12 were in the study group. The patients in the control group received triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% while the patients in the study group received 5% propolis. Both the groups were evaluated for pain and erythema at baseline (1<sup>st</sup> visit), first follow-up (7<sup>th</sup> day), and second follow-up (14<sup>th</sup> day).</p><p>The following conclusions were drawn: the topical propolis was found to be as effective as triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% in the management of OLP. It has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which may significantly contribute to its clinical effects.</p><p>No adverse reactions were noted with the use of topical propolis, and it was also found to be effective at the prescribed dose, i.e., 5% propolis.</p><p>Considering the chronicity of the disease and the need for the long-term treatment modalities, propolis can be proposed as a better treatment modality for OLP.</p><p>Considering the safety, wide availability, and low cost, propolis should be considered as a novel alternative therapeutic modality in the management of OLP. Hence, we conclude that our results provided practical hints for the better management of OLP. However, more research with larger sample size is necessary for a full evaluation of the efficacy of propolis.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
