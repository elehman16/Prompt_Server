Pregnancy is associated with specific anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that can predispose to infection and also alter the response to the disease process. Some of the infections may be serious and life-threatening for the mother, while others may seriously jeopardize the fetus or neonate leaving the mother asymptomatic. Fetal infections may develop early in pregnancy to produce obvious stigmata at birth. Alternatively, organisms may colonize and infect the fetus during labor and delivery. Infection is the most clearly recognized and more widely studied and responsible for about 20%&#x02013;40% of all cases of pre-term birth and other complications such as premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and spontaneous abortion.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As per <italic>Acharya Sushruta</italic>, as fruits detach from tree untimely due to the effect of <italic>Krimis</italic> (parasites), <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Abhigata</italic>, similarly fetus also gets detached due to the influence of all these factors. <italic>Upapluta Yonivyapad</italic> has been described by <italic>Acharya Charaka</italic>, [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] both <italic>Vagbhata</italic>, [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and <italic>Sharangadhara</italic>, [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but only <italic>Acharya Charaka</italic> has clearly mentioned that it is a disease of a pregnant woman, and thus, it can be compared to vulvovaginitis during pregnancy.
