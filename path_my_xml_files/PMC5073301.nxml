Instead, protein from vegetable sources (beans, peas) should be increased. However, little is known about the effect of these vegetable protein sources on appetite regulation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective</title><p>To examine whether meals based on vegetable protein sources (beans/peas) are comparable to meals based on animal protein sources (veal/pork) regarding meal-induced appetite sensations.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Design</title><p>In total, 43 healthy, normal-weight, young men completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, cross-over meal test. The meals (all 3.5 MJ, 28 energy-% (E%) fat) were either high protein based on veal and pork meat, HP-Meat (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 6 g fiber/100 g); high protein based on legumes (beans and peas), HP-Legume (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 25 g fiber/100 g); or low-protein based on legumes, LP-Legume (9 E% protein, 62 E% carbohydrate, 10 g fiber/100 g). Subjective appetite sensations were recorded at baseline and every half hour using visual analog scales until the <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal 3 h after the test meal. Repeated measurements analyses and summary analyses were performed using ANCOVA (SAS).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results</title><p>HP-Legume induced lower composite appetite score, hunger, prospective food consumption, and higher fullness compared to HP-Meat and LP-Legume (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, satiety was higher after HP-Legume than HP-Meat (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). When adjusting for palatability, HP-Legume still resulted in lower composite appetite scores, hunger, prospective consumption, and higher fullness compared to HP-Meat (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, HP-Legume induced higher fullness than LP-Legume (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). A 12% and 13% lower energy intake, respectively, was seen after HP-Legume compared to HP-Meat or LP-Legume (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Vegetable-based meals (beans/peas) influenced appetite sensations favorably compared to animal-based meals (pork/veal) with similar energy and protein content, but lower fiber content. Interestingly, a vegetable-based meal with low protein content was as satiating and palatable as an animal-based meal with high protein content.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>legumes</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>fullness</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd><kwd>dietary fiber</kwd><kwd>ad libitum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Randomized controlled trials and some prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that a high protein intake can induce increased weight loss and improve weight maintenance after weight loss compared to a low protein intake (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This effect appears to be associated with reduced feelings of hunger and increased satiety (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), although increased energy expenditure may also be a contributing factor (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been put on the environmental impact of different foods, and it has become clear that meat products may contribute with more negative effects, for example, production of greenhouse gasses and CO<sub>2</sub> emission, than vegetable products (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, a replacement of protein from animal sources such as beef and pork with protein from vegetable sources, such as legumes, would be an environmental-friendly approach. Such an approach would also lead to an increased intake of dietary fiber.</p><p>Recently, the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations were revised to reflect the issue on environmental impact of food production. Thus, a reduction in consumption of protein from animal sources such as beef and pork and an increase in vegetable sources such as legumes and pulses was recommended (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, focus should be on whole foods rather than single macronutrients.</p><p>When comparing CO<sub>2</sub> emission for legumes with meat, the CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (in kg) is increased with a factor of 30 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Despite this, the consumption of protein-rich legumes is very low among Danes compared to the intake of, for example, red meat. Adults in Denmark consume on average 137 g of red meat and meat products per day (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), whereas the intake of legumes is approximately 7 g per day (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The obstacles that could be accountable for the low intake could be palatability, gastrointestinal discomfort, but probably even more importantly, that legumes are not part of a typical Western dietary culture. A study investigated how chick pea supplementation in an Australian diet affected satiation and bowel health (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). They found that perceived satiation and perceived bowel function were improved. However, inconvenience and gastrointestinal upset were considered to discourage legume consumption.</p><p>Very little is still known about the effect of Nordic-grown vegetable sources of protein on appetite and body weight regulation. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine whether a meal based on vegetable sources (legumes: beans and peas) was comparable to a meal based on natural animal sources (pork and veal) regarding acute meal-induced appetite sensations and <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over intervention. Each meal test was separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. Subjects were instructed to refrain from alcohol consumption and intense physical activity for the 24 h proceeding each test day. In the evening before the test day, the subjects consumed a 4.0 MJ standardized evening meal (50.3 energy-% (E%) carbohydrate, 33 E% fat, 16.7 E% protein), consisting of pork and vegetable stew with rice (prepared by kitchen staff at the department) before 8:00 p.m. After this time subjects fasted (consumption of half a liter of water was allowed).</p><p>On each test day, the subjects met fasting in the morning at the department. After voiding, they were weighed to the nearest 0.05 kg on a decimal scale (Lindeltronic 8000, Copenhagen, Denmark). Before the test meal was served, subjects filled in the first visual analog scales (VASs). The test meal was served and consumed within 15 min. After the meal, subjects filled in VAS at time points 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. VAS for palatability of the test meals were filled in immediately after finishing the meal. Three hours after the test meal, an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal was served, and subjects were instructed to eat until they felt comfortably satiated. The <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch consisted of Pasta Bolognese and was served with 300 ml water. The meal had an energy content of 961 kJ/100 g and a macronutrient composition of 55 E% carbohydrates, 30 E% fat, and 15 E% protein. Food intake was registered and energy intake calculated. The subjects were not allowed to consume any other foods or drinks throughout the test day, but were allowed to read, listen to the radio, or use their computer.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy young men were recruited through university intranet systems and advertisements on websites. Subjects should be normal-weight to moderately overweight (body mass index (BMI) 22&#x02013;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), between 18 and 40 years of age, and free of any chronic health conditions. Subjects who smoked, were athletes (&#x0003e;10 h exercise/week), used regular medication, had food allergies, or used dietary supplements were excluded. In total, 60 subjects were screened; 7 subjects did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 5 withdrew consent before starting the study. Thus, 48 subjects started the study. The subjects were given both verbal and written information, whereupon all gave written consent. Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to the three meals. Meal sequences were generated by hand to make an even number of each sequence and a computer was used to generate a list of these sequences in random order. The list was kept by the investigator and not disclosed to the study coordinator who enrolled the subjects in the study.</p><p>The study was carried out at the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, April&#x02013;July 2011. It was approved by the Municipal Ethical Committee of The Capital Region of Denmark to be in accordance with the Helsinki-II declaration. Subjects received ~300 US$ as compensation on completion of all the test days. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01345487.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Test meals</title><p>The test meals were given as breakfast meals and each provided 3.5 MJ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Three test meals were compared: one with a high protein content from meat, HP-Meat (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 28 E% fat, 6 g fiber/100 g); one with a high protein content from legumes, HP-Legume (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 28 E% fat, 25 g fiber/100 g); and one with a low protein content from legumes, LP-Legume (9 E% protein, 62 E% carbohydrate, 28 E% fat, 10 g fiber/100 g). The meals were all composed of oven-baked patties, made of veal and pork meat (HP-Meat) or of fava beans (HP-Legume and LP-Legume), and a mash of either potato (HP-Meat), split peas (HP-Legume), or a combination of the two (LP-Legume) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Water was added to the recipes of the HP-Legume and LP-Legume meals in order to achieve similar serving weight and energy density of all three meals. The final serving weight was 591 g for the three meals. The test meals were served with 300 ml of drinking water. The meals were prepared by the experienced kitchen staff at the department, but were blinded when served by the study responsible to the subjects. The energy content and nutrient composition of the test meals were calculated using Dankost 3000 dietary assessment software (Danish Catering Center, Herlev, Denmark). The software is based on the food database from the Danish Technical University. The energy factors used are 17 kJ/g for protein, 37 kJ/g for fat, 17 kJ/g for available carbohydrate, and 8 kJ/g for dietary fiber. Fiber content was analyzed by a standard method (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and protein content was measured using the Kjeldahl method (<xref rid="CIT0018"

Discussion</title><p>The current study showed that a high-protein meal based on vegetable sources (legumes: beans and peas), induced higher post-meal satiety ratings and lower energy intake compared with a high-protein meal based on animal sources (veal and pork). Even more interestingly, a low-protein meal based on legumes was both as satiating and as palatable as a high-protein meal based on veal and pork.</p><p>Although the vegetable meal was more favorable with regard to appetite regulation, this does not document that vegetable protein <italic>per se</italic> is more satiating than animal protein. Because of the choice of natural food sources, the HP vegetable meal had a higher fiber content than the HP animal meal, and this may have induced a higher satiety feeling. Also palatability of the HP legume meal was rated lower than the other two meals and this partly affected the results. Still, if choosing such vegetable protein sources, our results indicate that it is possible to obtain similar satiety, but for less protein, than with animal sources such as those chosen here.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the effect on appetite regulation of vegetable meals based on beans and peas with animal meals based on pork and veal. There are several previous studies in this field. However, they have mainly examined soy vs dairy (whey, casein, milk) and used supplements and not real foods as test meals (e.g. soy or whey dissolved in water) (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A few studies have compared pea vs dairy, but also as supplements (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Only a handful of studies have used real foods (solid) foods or meals and can therefore more readily be compared with the current study (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Douglas et al. (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) evaluated the effect of meals with beef or soy protein (34 E%) on appetite and hormonal signals in 21 young, normal-weight adults. Meals were macronutrient and fiber-matched or serving-size-matched. There were no significant differences in postprandial hunger, fullness, peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 responses, or <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake after the beef or soy lunches, whether matched for macronutrients and fiber or for serving size. Another short-term cross-over study investigated iso-energetic, high-protein breakfasts and lunches (30 E% protein) based on meat (lean beef and ham) or soy (soy protein powder mixed in a shake) in 12 normal- or overweight men and women (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). No differences were seen in satiety during an 8 h postprandial period, however, lack of power could perhaps explain the lack of differences here (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were found in a more long-term cross-over study, which compared vegetarian (soy protein or soy-textured vegetable protein) and meat-based (chicken and beef) high-protein diets (30 E% protein) (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Twenty overweight or obese men were included and each diet period lasted for 14 days with three meals per day. No differences in daily rated subjective appetite sensations or motivation to eat were found between the two diets (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Still, differences in rated pleasantness of the diets might have biased the results.</p><p>Bayham et al. (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) compared egg vs cereal in energy- and macronutrient-matched breakfast meals (20 E% protein) using a 7-day cross-over design and 21 overweight men and women. They found that fullness and PYY was higher after egg vs cereal on the first study day, but there were no differences after 7 days&#x02019; exposure.</p><p>The last meal test study using foods compared protein (17 E%) from mycoprotein (plant), tofu (plant), or chicken (meat) served as a pasta dish 4 h after breakfast to 42 overweight women in a cross-over design (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The meals were isocaloric and macronutrient-matched, but the mycoprotein meal contained twice as much fiber (6 g) as the other two meals (3 g). Subjective appetite sensations did not differ, but <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake was significantly higher after intake of the chicken meal vs either of the two plant meals. This finding partly corresponds to our present findings.</p><p>As mentioned above, soy is in general the most studied vegetable protein source, whereas no or few studies have looked at brown beans or green peas, more commonly eaten in the Nordic countries. Furthermore, soy was most often given as a protein powder mixture. It can be assumed that the different vegetable sources matter when comparing studies, as the amino acid composition is not identical. Thus, in contrast to other vegetable protein sources, soy contains all essential amino acids, although in relatively small amounts. One previous study comparing soy with pea (supplements) did not see any differences, though (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Because only 12 subjects were included here, lack of power could, however, also explain this finding (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>One prospective cohort study which investigated the intake of animal and plant protein and subsequent weight changes is worth mentioning. The result was based on 89,432 European men and women who filled in country-specific food frequency questionnaires and were followed for a mean of 6.5 years. A positive association between animal protein and subsequent weight gain was found, but this was not the case with vegetable protein (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This indicates less satiety from eating animal protein than plant protein. However, it is not possible to exclude whether other macronutrients or dietary factors in the food items (i.e. dietary fiber) influenced the results (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>A recent meta-analysis supports that dietary pulses can be a beneficial weight-loss strategy (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, analyses of data from 21 studies showed an overall significant weight reduction of &#x02212;0.34 kg when diets included dietary pulses compared with when diets did not. The analyses also suggested that dietary pulses may reduce body fat mass.</p><p>The relatively large difference in fiber content between our test meals most likely plays an important role with regard to the satiating effects (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The fact that there was no difference between the LP-Legume meal and the HP-Meat meal indicates that a low-protein meal with fiber-rich beans/peas is as satiating as a high-protein meal with pork/veal and suggests that vegetable protein sources can be efficient alternatives for weight regulation with less use of protein than with animal protein sources. Thus, in respect to satiety, a high content of dietary fibers may be as effective as a high content of protein, when using real foods.</p><p>The strengths and weaknesses of the present study should be considered. We consider it a strength that we used real foods in realistic meals. Thus, such meals could be expected to be consumed outside the clinical setting. This is in contrast to many of the previous studies, where more unnatural meals and supplements were used. It could be argued, though, that a weakness in our design was that dietary fiber content was then not matched in the two HP meals. However, this is a consequence of using real foods. If a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design had been used, we might have been able to obtain a clearer picture of the factor of interest (protein) without changing other factors that could influence the primary outcome.</p><p>The current study also highlights that a high protein level is difficult to obtain solely from vegetable sources without compromising palatability. Statistical analyses were therefore done with and without adjustment for palatability of the test meals. This resulted in similar, although less significant results for the appetite parameters. Such a finding is in line with the notion that food not considered palatable is perceived as more satiating than palatable food (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It may be that our study subjects were not familiar with vegetable-based foods and meals and that this influenced their palatability ratings. Energy density and weight or volume are also factors important for energy intake and appetite sensations. We strived to compose meals with similar weight and hence energy density. Therefore, these factors were not likely to be of importance in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a vegetable-based meal (beans/peas) influenced appetite sensations and energy intake favorably compared to an animal-based meal (pork/veal) with similar energy and protein content. Interestingly, a vegetable-based meal with low protein content was as satiating and palatable as an animal-based meal with high protein content. Differences in dietary fiber and palatability are likely important contributing factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study is part of the OPUS project &#x02018;Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet&#x02019;.
