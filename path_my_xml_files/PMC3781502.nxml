Responder rate (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%) and improvements in fasting plasma glucose were comparable. Both agents induced weight loss (from 94.5 to 91.7 kg and from 96.7 to 92.9 kg with lixisenatide and exenatide, respectively). Incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar for lixisenatide and exenatide, as was incidence of serious AEs (2.8 and 2.2%, respectively).

GLP-1 receptor agonists increasingly have become established as effective therapeutic options in type 2 diabetes management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Glucose-lowering effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are mediated by glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin release and inhibition of glucagon secretion, which decreases prandial blood glucose excursion and hepatic glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Notably, GLP-1 receptor agonists achieve physiological blood glucose&#x02013;insulin response with a low risk of hypoglycemia (as a result of their glucose-dependent action) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), delay gastric emptying, and are associated with beneficial effects on weight and appetite reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Currently available GLP-1 receptor agonists include twice-daily and once-weekly formulations of exenatide, a once-daily formulation of liraglutide, and a once-daily formulation of lixisenatide. Both exenatide and liraglutide have been shown to improve glycemic control associated with beneficial effects on weight and a low risk of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, although exenatide and liraglutide share the same basic mechanisms, each has a distinct pharmacokinetic profile and molecular structure, with potential clinical implications in terms of efficacy against fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose, and in terms of regimen burden and safety. This has been demonstrated in a 26-week, randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes who were assigned to receive additional liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily or additional exenatide 10 &#x000b5;g twice daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Liraglutide reduced mean FPG more than did exenatide (&#x02212;29.0 mg/dL vs. &#x02212;10.8 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), whereas exenatide reduced postprandial plasma glucose increment after breakfast and dinner more than did liraglutide (breakfast: estimated treatment difference, 23.9 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; dinner: estimated treatment difference, 18.2 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These findings suggest that liraglutide and exenatide should not be used interchangeably, but instead should be prescribed on an individual basis according to the glycemic requirements of each patient.</p><p>Lixisenatide is a once-daily prandial GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that was approved by the European Medicines Agency in February 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is a 44&#x02013;amino-acid peptide that is amidated at the COOH terminal amino acid and shares some structural elements with the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide; the primary difference is the addition of six lysine residues at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study that evaluated the dose-dependent effects of lixisenatide (5, 10, 20, or 30 &#x000b5;g once daily or twice daily) found that lixisenatide 20 &#x000b5;g administered once daily provided the best efficacy-to-tolerability ratio, with no additional benefits with any of the twice-daily doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Lixisenatide 20 &#x003bc;g once daily subsequently has been shown to significantly improve glycemic control, with low rates of hypoglycemia and beneficial weight effects, when administered as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), as add-on therapy to oral agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and in combination with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we report the results from a head-to-head study (GetGoal-X) that compared the benefit/risk profile of lixisenatide once daily versus exenatide twice daily in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 24-week, phase III, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, multinational, noninferiority study followed by a long-term safety extension of at least 52 weeks (data not reported here).

The primary efficacy end point was the absolute change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week 24. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured at a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program Level 1&#x02013;certified central laboratory using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The secondary efficacy measures included the percentage of participants attaining HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% or &#x02264;6.5% at week 24 and changes in FPG and body weight from baseline to week 24.</p><p>The safety population comprised all randomized participants exposed to at least one dose of the investigational product. Safety and tolerability were assessed by review of adverse events (AEs) and, in particular, treatment-emergent AEs, occurrence of symptomatic hypoglycemia, and clinical laboratory data. Symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, with accompanying blood glucose &#x0003c;3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) and/or prompt recovery with oral carbohydrate, glucagon, or intravenous glucose. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia in which the subject required the assistance of another person and that was associated with either a plasma glucose level &#x0003c;2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) or, if no plasma glucose measurement was available, prompt recovery with intravenous glucose, glucagon, or oral carbohydrate administered by a third party. Laboratory tests were performed for hematology, creatinine, microalbuminuria, and serum chemistry, including amylase, lipase, and calcitonin. The impact of gastrointestinal tolerability on quality of life was evaluated by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders&#x02013;Quality of Life (PAGI-QOL) questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary end point was analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment group, screening strata for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and BMI, and country as fixed effects, and with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as covariate. Differences in the least squares (LS) mean change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between lixisenatide and exenatide and two-sided 95% CIs were estimated within the framework of ANCOVA. Noninferiority between lixisenatide and exenatide was assessed based on a predefined noninferiority criterion (&#x02264;0.4% for the upper limit of the 95% CI). The 0.4% margin was selected in accordance with the Committee for Medicial Products for Human Use (CHMP)/International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)/363/96 and CHMP/ICH/364/96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), as well as in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration 2008 guidelines on statistical principles for clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). It is commonly used and accepted in noninferiority studies of compounds developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>A sample size of 600 (300 participants in each group) was calculated to ensure that the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the adjusted LS mean difference between lixisenatide and exenatide would not exceed 0.4% HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 96% power (assuming that the SD was 1.3 and the true difference between lixisenatide and exenatide was zero). The last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure was used to handle missing assessments or early discontinuation during the study treatment period. No predefined formal statistical tests were performed for any secondary efficacy end points. Exploratory analyses of continuous secondary end points were performed using an approach and ANCOVA model similar to those described for the primary analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s8"><title>Demographics, baseline characteristics, and patient disposition</title><p>A total of 1,243 patients were screened and 639 eligible patients were randomized to study treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2709/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).

Overall, gastrointestinal symptoms led to treatment discontinuation for 20 participants (6.3%) in the lixisenatide group and 24 participants (7.6%) in the exenatide group; specifically, nausea and vomiting led to treatment discontinuation for 16 (5.0%) and 20 (6.3%) participants, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Safety profile during the 24-week, double-blind treatment period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2945tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>Mean total Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders&#x02013;Quality of Life score improved slightly from 0.60 &#x000b1; 0.7 to 0.49 &#x000b1; 0.64 with lixisenatide and from 0.56 &#x000b1; 0.7 to 0.50 &#x000b1; 0.67 with exenatide, with no significant between-group difference (LS mean change: &#x02212;0.09 vs. &#x02212;0.06, respectively; LS mean change difference: &#x02212;0.03%; 95% CI, &#x02212;0.111 to 0.043).</p><p>Significantly fewer participants experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia in the lixisenatide once-daily group compared with the exenatide twice-daily group (2.5 vs. 7.9%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and no severe hypoglycemic events were reported during the 24-week treatment period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

Approximately 50% of participants in each group achieved the HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &#x0003c;7.0%, and both agents provided similar reductions in FPG. There were reductions in body weight in both groups. Overall, the rates of AEs and serious AEs were comparable in the lixisenatide once-daily group and exenatide twice-daily group. However, gastrointestinal events and symptomatic hypoglycemia were reported less frequently with lixisenatide.</p><p>Previous randomized controlled trials with GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy (exenatide twice daily or liraglutide once daily) have investigated glycemic control for subjects in a similar setting (metformin monotherapy failure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In the study by DeFronzo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), exenatide 10 &#x000b5;g twice daily reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.8% (from 8.2 to 7.4%) over 30 weeks. In the study by Nauck et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which also included subjects previously receiving oral combination therapy who were switched to metformin monotherapy at the start of the study, liraglutide at 1.2 mg and at 1.8 mg once daily reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> from &#x0223c;8.4 to &#x0223c;7.4% over 26 weeks. In a second liraglutide study, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg liraglutide once daily reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> from &#x0223c;8.4 to &#x0223c;7.2% and from &#x0223c;8.4 to &#x0223c;7.0%, respectively, over 26 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, in the studies to date in subjects receiving metformin monotherapy, add-on therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist consistently achieves HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in the range of 7.0&#x02013;7.4%. In the current study, final values of 7.0&#x02013;7.2% were observed over a similar time scale, and a similar proportion of patients from both groups with high baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> achieved a goal of &#x0003c;7%. It appears that despite apparent differences in study population, baseline characteristics, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions, the final HbA<sub>1c</sub> values appear fairly similar in most studies with different GLP-1 receptor agonists. Nevertheless, only additional head-to-head studies would allow a robust comparison.</p><p>The noninferiority of lixisenatide versus exenatide was demonstrated for the prespecified CI margin of 0.4% and also was accomplished with the even stricter CI margin of 0.3% indicated in the more recent European Medicines Agency guideline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the current analysis, exenatide twice daily had a slightly better effect on glucose control compared with lixisenatide once daily within the established noninferiority margin. However, the degree of clinical benefit from this small difference is unlikely to be clinically relevant because a similar proportion of patients in each group achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7%. Any potential benefit of a small HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference has to be weighed against the more convenient once-daily injection of lixisenatide, the increased risk of mild hypoglycemia, and the initial increased incidence of gastrointestinal AEs with exenatide.</p><p>Clinical studies to date suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting, represent the main tolerability issue associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Accordingly, in the current study, nausea was the most common AE with lixisenatide once daily, and gastrointestinal symptoms were the main reason for treatment discontinuation. Nausea was experienced by 25% of participants administered lixisenatide once daily compared with 35% receiving therapy with exenatide twice daily, representing &#x0223c;30% lower incidence in favor of lixisenatide. Improved tolerability with lixisenatide was reflected by the fact that more lixisenatide-treated subjects tolerated the target dose of 20 &#x000b5;g/day. The safety profile of lixisenatide in this study also compares favorably with that of the study of exenatide add-on to metformin, which reported nausea in 45% of subjects over 30 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Higher rates have been reported in studies with other background therapies (51% in combination with a sulfonylurea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In studies with liraglutide added to metformin monotherapy, the range of nausea incidence was 16&#x02013;21% for 1.2 mg once daily and was 19&#x02013;27% for 1.8 mg once daily over 26 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). A higher incidence (40%) was reported for the combination with metformin plus rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As in previous studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists, gastrointestinal symptoms with both lixisenatide once daily and exenatide twice daily in the current study occurred predominantly at the start of therapy and subsequently subsided. Consequently, these events had no negative impact on quality of life at week 24.</p><p>The incidence of hypoglycemia in previous studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists added to metformin monotherapy has been in the range of 3&#x02013;5% of subjects over 26 to 30 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These rates are generally of a magnitude similar to those reported in the current study, although we found a higher incidence with exenatide twice daily (7.9%) such that approximately threefold fewer subjects reported hypoglycemic events with lixisenatide once daily (2.5%). To further investigate the difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia between lixisenatide and exenatide, we looked at the timing of the occurrence of the hypoglycemic events during the day. In the exenatide group, most of the hypoglycemic events were observed during the hours after the morning and evening injections; however, with lixisenatide, hypoglycemic events mostly occurred during the hours after the morning injection.</p><p>The results of the current study demonstrated that as add-on therapy in the context of inadequate control with metformin monotherapy, administration of lixisenatide in a convenient once-daily regimen is not inferior to exenatide twice daily in terms of glycemic efficacy. It has marginally lower beneficial effect on weight but may provide some additional advantages in terms of fewer hypoglycemic and gastrointestinal events and has the potential for better adherence because of one less injection per day. These characteristics have the potential to improve compliance and reduce dropouts because of poor gastrointestinal tolerability during the initial phase of treatment initiation. Ultimately, the potential clinical utility of lixisenatide once daily will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the individual patient based on the overall efficacy, tolerability, and dosing frequency profile during the shared decision-making process with a health care professional. This also may involve consideration of the patient&#x02019;s underlying pathophysiology and the need to target postprandial glucose in those with marked postprandial hyperglycemia. In conclusion, these results highlight the efficacy&#x02013;tolerability profile of lixisenatide once daily and its potential as a new option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2709/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2709/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
