Ninety-eight per cent of UK NHS hospitals have AMUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Many patients in AMUs have a very short length of stay (&#x0003c; 1-2 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At least 10% of all attendees will be frail older people, identified by the presence of one or more geriatric syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Frail older people who present with a crisis to an AMU but who are discharged rapidly have poor outcomes: 58% subsequently re-present to the AMU and 29% die over the 12 months from the index presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hospital facilities are expensive and a hospital stay is usually the most costly episode in the patient's experience of care. Managers and clinicians are therefore under pressure to reduce avoidable hospital admissions. Despite a multitude of efforts to reduce hospital attendance and admission, the numbers are increasing year on year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>There is a considerable body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of complex interventions for frail older people in general&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], particularly Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, delivering CGA in the context of an AMU is challenging - time, bed pressures and lack of appropriate expertise are all barriers - and a recent review of the literature was unable to identify any trials of CGA being delivered in AMUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We have clinically piloted a version of CGA suitable for use in older people presenting to AMUs, "interface geriatrics", in which a geriatrician makes a clinical assessment of older patients being discharged from an AMU, and plans any necessary aftercare including further assessment at home and liaison with primary care, intermediate care and specialist community services. This study will evaluate interface geriatrics compared with current management, using a randomised controlled trial with economic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the study is to examine if the intervention increases the number of days spent at home in high risk older patients discharged from an acute medical unit, over current management, and whether it is cost effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>A multicentre randomised controlled trial will be conducted. After informed consent and baseline data have been collected, participants will be randomised to usual care or the intervention arm, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Overall study outline of a comprehensive geriatric assessment intervention randomised controlled trial</bold>.

Patients excluded from the study will be: those not resident in the usual hospital catchment area; those without mental capacity to give informed consent and where there is no consultee available; those in whom an exceptional reason is cited by AMU staff why they should not be recruited (e.g. dangerous); and participants already participating in another intervention research project.

Some patients will be assessed by members of a multidisciplinary team (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, nurse), as deemed appropriate by the AMU team.</p><p>Participants in the control group will receive no additional intervention over and above usual care after randomisation. Usual care is usually directed by the patient's general practitioner, but on some occasions will also include follow up and investigation by the acute medical team.</p><p>Participants in the intervention group will have an assessment by a geriatrician, who will also deliver or involve other agencies in the delivery of whatever aftercare they deem is necessary which may include: a review of diagnoses; a medication review; further assessment at home or in a clinic; advance care planning; and liaison with primary care, intermediate care and specialist community services. The intervention will commence immediately prior to discharge whilst on the AMU, continuing in the community and is largely expected to be complete within one month of randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome will be "days at home".

Pilot data in a similar population demonstrated the mean number of days spent at home at 90 days was 63 with a standard deviation of 23 days. Using these data, a sample size of 200 in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference in the mean number of days at home of 7.5 days between the two groups (control group mean of 63 days and intervention group mean of 70.5 days) using a two-group t-test with a 5% significance level.</p><p>As days at home accounts for loss to follow up from events such as death, we will only need to slightly over-recruit to account for participants who withdraw completely for from the study (&#x0003c; 5% based on recruitment to date). Accordingly we aim to recruit up to 420 individuals overall.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomly allocated using a 1:1 ratio to either the control group or to the intervention group.

Investigators will access the treatment allocation for each subject by means of a remote, internet-based randomisation system developed and maintained by the Nottingham CTSU. The sequence of treatment allocations will be concealed from the researchers collecting the outcome data and the statistician until statistical analyses are complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>It is not possible to blind participants to the intervention in this study, but outcomes will be collected by researchers who are blind to allocation and all analyses will be carried out blind to allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><sec><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>Continuous data that are approximately normally distributed will be summarised in terms of the mean, standard deviation; minimum, maximum and number of observations. Skewed data will be presented in terms of the median, lower and upper quartiles, minimum, maximum and number of observations. Categorical data will be summarised in terms of frequency counts and percentages. There will be no test of statistical differences or confidence intervals for differences between the intervention and control groups on any baseline variable, however analyses will be adjusted for prognostically important variables to improve the precision of the estimates of the intervention effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Univariate and multivariate analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle, and will compare the primary outcome (days at home) between the two groups either using a two-sided t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test if the assumptions for the t-test are not satisfied, stratified by centre. We will use data from our recently completed cohort study (Acute Medicine Outcome Study) to explore the distribution of days at home in this population, constrained to take values between 0 and 90 days, to determine the most appropriate statistical model for the adjusted analysis. We will also use data from the cohort study to identify prognostically important variables for days at home in advance of the analysis of the randomised controlled trial. The intervention effect parameter will be presented as an estimate with 95% confidence interval.</p><p>We will also carry out a per-protocol efficacy analysis, looking at those patients who actually received the intervention.</p><p>All continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models, while logistic regression and Poisson regression models will be used for dichotomous and count data, respectively. Mortality will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. All adjusted analyses will include centre in the model and other baseline variables used in these models will be specified in advance of the analysis based on the results of our prior cohort study. All statistical tests will be two-sided and performed using a 5% significance level with no adjustment for multiplicity.</p><p>We anticipate a greater recognition of the need for palliative care services in this population and will test for interaction between the intervention and terminal care status. If interaction is present, the results will presented as sub-group analyses. Other pre-specified sub-group analyses will be carried out according to the ISAR score, residency at baseline (care home vs. no care home) and cognition (MMSE &#x02264;27), as these are prognostically important baseline indicators of adverse outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic analyses</title><p>Costs will be constructed from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services (PSS). 90 days of resource data will be collected for each patient participant. Costs will be estimated for each patient participant in the study. The costs will be calculated as resource use multiplied by the unit cost of the specific resource.</p><p>Health and social care resource use data will be valued using published unit cost data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing specialist geriatric assessment, intervention and community-based follow-up following on from an acute admission to standard care will be carried out. Benefits to the patient participant will be measured with Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), which will be generated using EQ5D data, assuming homogeneity across treatment groups in any insensitivity of the EQ5D to our patient participants. The time horizon of the economic analysis will incorporate the lifetime of the cohort, through extrapolation of quality-adjusted survival from the end of the intervention period. These will be combined with cost data to generate incremental cost effectiveness ratios and Incremental Net Benefit (INB) statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>No discounting of intervention costs will be necessary as the intervention period is less than 12 months. QALYs will be discounted at 3.5%. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken in the absence of convincing dominance by any treatment alternative. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will used to assess the risks posed by uncertainty in the estimated incremental net benefit statistics. Value of information and value of distributional information analyses will also be undertaken if appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures for missing, unused and spurious data</title><p>If there is less than 5% missing data we will use the complete dataset but where there is more than 5% missing data our preferred method will be multiple imputation. We will use the multiple imputation procedures in Stata to impute missing values, including all baseline variables. We will then combine the results using Rubin's rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for multiply imputed data.</p><p>Additionally we will assess the baseline characteristics of those who have dropped out or with large amounts of missing data in order to see if there is any differential loss to follow up which may result in bias.</p><p>Where extreme outliers are identified during model checking, sensitivity analyses will be carried out including and excluding the extreme outliers in order to test the robustness of the findings.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The protocol was given a favourable opinion by the Nottingham 1 Research Ethics Committee (reference 10/H0403/1).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADL: Activities of Daily Living; AMIGOS: Acute Medical Unit Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Intervention Study; AMU: Acute Medical Unit; CGA: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment; CQLI-R: Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Revised; CTSU: Clinical Trials Support Unit; EQ5D: Euroqol 5-dimension quality of life scale; GHQ-12: General Health Questionnaire 12-item version; GP: General Practitioner (family doctor); INB: Incremental Net Benefit; ICECAP: ICEpop CAPability index; a measure of capability for the adult population; ISAR: Identification of Seniors At Risk; MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination; NHS: (United Kingdom) National Health Service; NIHR: National Institute for Health Research; PSS: Personal Social Services; QALYs: Quality Adjusted Life Years; UK: United Kingdom</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JE participated in the design of the study, and drafted the manuscript.
