But is this belief well founded?</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To test this belief by comparing the effectiveness and prevalence of unwanted sedative effects when treating patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine) vs. levocetirizine 20 mg daily (levocetirizine monotherapy).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 24 patients with difficult-to-treat CSU took levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine or levocetirizine monotherapy for periods of 5 days each.

The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization guideline for management of urticaria<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> recommends second-generation &#x02018;nonsedating&#x02019; H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines as first-line treatment. It also states that if standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to fourfold is recommended. This recommendation is reiterated in other, newer international guidelines.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>These guidelines also recommend against the use of older, sedating first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines in patients with urticaria unless there is a special indication.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is because first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines have pronounced unwanted effects, including anticholinergic effects and sedative actions on the central nervous system. At night, first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines increase the latency to the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduce the duration of REM sleep. Furthermore, residual effects, or hangover, are still present the next morning. Such effects include impairment in divided attention, vigilance, working memory and sensory&#x02013;motor performance.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For commonly used drugs, the incidence of subjectively reported somnolence has been documented to vary from 40% with chlorpheniramine or brompheniramine to 80% with hydroxyzine.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Disturbingly, lack of subjective drowsiness does not mean that an individual is able to drive a vehicle without impairment because subjective somnolence and impairment of the ability to perform tasks are not necessarily correlated.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Despite the potential of first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines to cause unwanted effects, many physicians believe that the most effective treatment for chronic urticaria is a nonsedating second-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine, at night to reduce night-time itch and enhance sleep. The rationale for this is that the sedative component makes people sleep better in spite of the pruritus. This is supported by some guidelines, particularly older ones.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>But is this belief well founded? To date, there are no back-to-back comparisons of therapy of CSU with a nonsedating H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine during the day plus a sedating first-generation sedating H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine at night vs. monotherapy with a nonsedating H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine. Consequently, we have compared the effectiveness of therapy and the prevalence of unwanted effects when treating patients with severe CSU with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine) vs. levocetirizine 20 mg daily (levocetirizine monotherapy).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in patients with CSU in whom the efficacy and adverse effects of treatment with levocetirizine 20 mg daily were compared with those of levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night before sleep.

In contrast, daytime sedation was significantly less with levocetirizine monotherapy in comparison with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine.</p><p>The effectiveness of levocetirizine in relieving the symptoms of CSU and improving QoL confirms previous findings.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is of particular relevance in this study that the subjective element of the UAS, the severity of pruritus, was similarly reduced by both treatment regimens, suggesting that the central effects of hydroxyzine do not contribute to the overall antipruritic effect, which is agreement with the hypothesis that histamine is involved primarily in the peripheral genesis of itch.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Furthermore, both treatment regimens having a similar effect in reducing night-time sleep disturbances again indicates that it is the peripheral antipruritic effect of the nonsedating second-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine that is of prime importance rather than any central sedative effects.</p><p>What is very clear from this study is that patients receiving levocetirizine monotherapy were significantly less sedated during the day than they were before treatment at the beginning of the study, confirming the findings of Staevska <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In contrast, when treated with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine, patients experienced a similar level of sedation to those who were not treated. Furthermore, patients receiving levocetirizine monotherapy experienced less daytime sedation than those receiving levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine. This strongly suggests that the detrimental sedative effects of hydroxyzine were due to its prolonged central nervous system effects. With a terminal half life of 20&#x02013;25 h,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> it is not surprising that hydroxyzine has hangover effects into the next day.</p><p>We believe that this study has two weaknesses. Firstly, we did not perform objective assessments of alertness or productivity. Even so, our study would support the conclusion of Murota <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> that pruritic diseases negatively impact on daily activity and impair productivity, and that this is improved in patients taking second-generation nonsedative, but not first-generation sedative, H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines, and that the improvements correlated with the alleviation of itch and improved QoL. The second weakness is that the length of the study, 10 days, is less than that of many similar studies in urticaria. This was because the study was performed at a tertiary referral clinic with patients from all over Bulgaria and we wanted to ensure a sustainable follow-up of patients, particularly given compliance issues.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study do not support the widely held belief that the most effective treatment for chronic urticaria is a nonsedating second-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine, at night to enhance sleep. In view of the potential detrimental effects of residual daytime sedation on school performance and study, impaired productivity at work and, possibly more importantly, driving motor vehicles,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> it is clear that it is better not to offer a sedating antihistamine at night for the treatment of CSU.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maurer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Weller</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Bindslev-Jensen</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Unmet clinical needs in chronic spontaneous urticaria.
