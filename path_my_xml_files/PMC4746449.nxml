Despite recommendations from the WHO, by 6&#x02005;months of age 40% of Australian infants are receiving no breast milk. Increased early postpartum breastfeeding support may improve breastfeeding maintenance. 2 community-based interventions to increase breastfeeding duration in local government areas (LGAs) in Victoria, Australia, were implemented and evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>3-arm cluster randomised trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>LGAs in Victoria, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>LGAs across Victoria with breastfeeding initiation rates below the state average and &#x0003e; 450 births/year were eligible for inclusion. The LGA was the unit of randomisation, and maternal and child health centres in the LGAs comprised the clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Early home-based breastfeeding support by a maternal and child health nurse (home visit, HV) with or without access to a community-based breastfeeding drop-in centre (HV+drop-in).</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><p>The proportion of infants receiving &#x02018;any&#x02019; breast milk at 3, 4 and 6&#x02005;months (women's self-report).</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>4 LGAs were randomised to the comparison arm and provided usual care (n=41 clusters; n=2414 women); 3 to HV (n=32 clusters; n=2281 women); and 3 to HV+drop-in (n=26 clusters; 2344 women). There was no difference in breastfeeding at 4&#x02005;months in either HV (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29) or HV+drop-in (adjusted OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08) compared with the comparison arm, no difference at 3 or 6&#x02005;months, nor in any LGA in breastfeeding before and after the intervention. Some issues were experienced with intervention protocol fidelity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early home-based and community-based support proved difficult to implement. Interventions to increase breastfeeding in complex community settings require sufficient time and partnership building for successful implementation. We cannot conclude that additional community-based support is ineffective in improving breastfeeding maintenance given the level of adherence to the planned protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12611000898954; Results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NUTRITION &#x00026; DIETETICS</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Supporting breastfeeding In Local Communities (SILC) was an adequately powered trial embedded within a universal state-wide maternal and child health (MCH) service, and focused on the early postpartum period, when many women struggle most with breastfeeding.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The interventions were delivered by specifically funded MCH nurses (SILC-MCHNs) with the skills and education required to support women to breast feed and whose role was to focus solely on breastfeeding.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Substantial attention was given to process evaluation measures enabling thorough assessment of intervention fidelity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The local government areas involved were able to successfully add a new question assessing infant feeding &#x02018;in the past 24&#x02005;h&#x02019; to the 4-month &#x02018;Key Ages and Stages&#x02019; visit which gave better quality cross-sectional data, enhancing the capacity to discern changes due to the intervention.

Ten consultations with MCH nurses (MCHNs; registered nurses with additional midwifery and child and family health qualifications) are offered to parents, known as Key Ages and Stages (KAS) visits, beginning with a home visit (HV) at 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks postpartum, followed by five centre-based visits over the first 8&#x02005;months.</p><p>The Supporting breastfeeding In Local Communities (SILC) trial was designed to investigate whether early breastfeeding support at home, for women most at risk of breastfeeding cessation, with and without access to breastfeeding assistance in drop-in centres, would increase breastfeeding maintenance in Victorian LGAs with low breastfeeding rates.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design was used: a comparison (usual care) arm and two intervention arms.

These included a hospital midwife visit/s 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;days after discharge, with the usual length of stay in hospital after the birth being 48&#x02005;h or less, and with a general focus on the well-being of mother and infant. These visits are for women who have public maternity care; this service is generally not provided for women accessing private maternity care, which is approximately one-third of women in Victoria.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Women also routinely receive an MCHN home visit, usually 10&#x02005;days to 2&#x02005;weeks after birth, with breastfeeding assessment, support and advice a core component of care. Thus, there is often a gap of 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;days between the hospital midwife visit and the time of the MCHN home visit. Women access MCH centre-based care thereafter. Other community supports include a state-wide 24&#x02005;h MCH helpline; a 24&#x02005;h Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) helpline; and support by general practitioners and other health professionals as sought by families. Women receiving care in participating LGAs would have given birth in a wide variety of hospitals; it is therefore not possible to describe the types of breastfeeding supports that may have been offered by different hospitals, nor whether women had public or private care.</p><p>The system by which LGAs are notified of women's births is similar across the state. The hospital where the woman gives birth is required to notify the appropriate LGA of the birth, to trigger the LGA to start the universal care. The system is usually electronic, with an expectation that there would be a more one-to-one hand over (such as a telephone conversation) if that was required, for example, for a woman with complex needs. LGAs each have systems in place to ensure that women's information is communicated to the appropriate MCH local centre and relevant MCHN. The usual process after this is that all women are telephoned and an appointment time made for the MCHN to visit women at home by 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days after birth. In some LGAs, these calls are made by MCH local centre nurses, and in others the process is centralised.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Interventions</title><p>Intervention LGAs provided all usual MCH care, as described above with the addition of HV or HV+drop-in.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>HV (early home-visiting only)</title><p>LGAs allocated to the HV trial arm provided early home-based visiting by a MCHN to women identified at risk of breastfeeding cessation. MCHNs were specifically employed from within the LGAs; prior to the start of intervention they attended 6&#x02005;h of workshops/training regarding intervention implementation (SILC-MCHNs).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The SILC-MCHN HV was arranged during the MCH service's first contact with the woman after hospital discharge, aimed at providing <italic>proactive</italic> breastfeeding assistance as early as possible after birth. The aim was to fill the gap that currently exists between cessation of hospital-based care and start of MCH care (usually 7&#x02005;days or more). LGAs were asked to undertake the &#x02018;routine&#x02019; telephone call as early as possible postpartum in order to assign women an early SILC-MCHN visit if required, and much of the education focus of the trial was on this aspect.</p><p>The focus of the SILC-MCHN HVs was the normalisation of breastfeeding, building women's confidence to breast feed, reassurance, development of an infant feeding plan (where needed), and provision of a list of useful websites and telephone numbers. The topics covered at individual visits were driven by the specific needs of the woman, with no set way of approaching issues. Women were referred to additional services as needed. SILC-MCHNs were MCHNs with additional training in, and a commitment to, supporting breastfeeding. All were required to attend a 1-day workshop prior to the start of the interventions to introduce them to the study and to RCTs generally, as well as to provide guidance on how to provide and document the intervention, and the importance of a woman-centred approach. They also attended three further half days of education, feedback and support throughout the intervention phase.</p><sec id="s2e101"><title>HV+drop-in (early home-visiting plus access to a breastfeeding drop-in centre)</title><p>In addition to SILC-MCHN early home-based breastfeeding support, LGAs allocated to the HV+drop-in trial arm established a local community breastfeeding drop-in centre staffed by a SILC-MCHN, and where possible with a trained peer supporter or community educator or counsellor.</p><p>The drop-in centres were welcoming spaces offering privacy, where women could discuss breastfeeding concerns with the SILC-MCHN, with access to drinks, change tables and toilets, and the opportunity to meet and learn from other mothers. Women were informed about drop-in centres in a range of ways. This included written information provided to women at the hospital where they gave birth, distribution of fliers to new mothers by MCH nurses, and displaying of posters in MCH centres, medical clinics, kindergartens and childcare centres. There was also some advertising in local print media and some broadcasts on local radio. LGAs were given autonomy in terms of where the drop-in centres were located and how women were informed about them. Education and discussion of these processes was undertaken at all trial stages&#x02014;during the call for expressions of interest, in the briefings regarding what trial participation would involve, and extensively during the run-in period and early stages of the interventions. LGAs were allocated funds to cover staffing of the drop-in centres based on their birth numbers, and were able to make their own choices as to the centre hours. The infrastructure cost of the drop-in centres had to be covered at the LGA level. We anticipated that on average drop-in centres would be able to run for two half days per week in small and medium LGAs and three half days in the large LGAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Determining eligibility for SILC-MCHN HV</title><p>It was planned that within each intervention LGA, SILC-MCHNs would conduct an average of two home visits to approximately 30% of women who left hospital breastfeeding. This proportion was chosen pragmatically, both to identify those at risk of early cessation and/or experiencing problems leading to early cessation and to enhance sustainability (ie, by visiting only those at highest risk of early cessation, to conserve resources) if the intervention proved effective. There is strong evidence that infants receiving formula in the early postpartum period are at higher risk of premature cessation of breastfeeding than other infants,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and approximately 14% of Victorian-born infants are being supplemented with infant formula in the early days postpartum.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It is also known that around 30% of women self-identify breastfeeding problems in the first few days postpartum,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> though on its own this is unlikely to be a reliable indicator for risk of early cessation. Therefore, we aimed to identify and conduct visits to the 30% of women who are most at risk of early breastfeeding cessation, using a mix of eligibility criteria.</p><p>An assessment tool was developed and tested in non-trial LGAs to determine eligibility for a SILC-MCHN visit. The aim was to provide proactive support to the women most likely to cease breastfeeding. A visit would be arranged:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>If a woman's infant received any infant formula in addition to breast milk (either at the breast or expressed breast milk (EBM)), in the 24&#x02005;h prior to telephone contact; or</p></list-item><list-item><p>If a woman was distressed about breastfeeding or asked for help with breastfeeding when telephoned, even if she was not supplementing with infant formula.</p></list-item></list></p><p>MCHNs could also identify women for a SILC-MCHN home visit at a later standard MCH visit, if needed. In LGAs where infant formula use was consistently ascertained as less than 25% of women who left hospital breastfeeding, EBM use in the 24&#x02005;h prior to telephone contact (whether or not infant formula had been given) was included in the assessment criteria, as this is also known to be a risk factor for early breastfeeding cessation.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>We did extensive onsite education with the MCHNs in all LGAs, in addition to the specific SILC-MCHN education. We aimed to ensure that all those involved would have a clear understanding of the eligibility assessment process, the referral pathways and the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>This study aimed to detect a difference in any breastfeeding from 48% (the estimated rate of <italic>any</italic> breastfeeding at 4&#x02005;months in those LGAs below the state average breastfeeding rate at hospital discharge) to 58% at 4&#x02005;months. As the tested intervention would only have the ability to affect women who were breastfeeding at discharge (ie, not women who chose to formula feed; and in participating LGAs, the average rate of <italic>any</italic> breastfeeding at hospital discharge was 81%), to gain a 10% increase, the difference in the rate of breastfeeding was estimated at 59% (or 48%/81%&#x000d7;100) to 72% (58%/81%&#x000d7;100).</p><p>For a simple random sample, this required 224 women in each <italic>intervention</italic> arm (with &#x003b1; 0.05 and 80% power), that is, 448 in total. The LGAs were the unit of randomisation, and the multiple MCH centres within formed the clusters for analysis. To take into account the potential effect of clustering, we inflated the sample size assuming an intracluster correlation (ICC; r) of 0.02, thus requiring 400&#x02013;500 women in each intervention arm. Up to four LGAs per trial arm were needed to achieve this. See the study protocol for more detail on sample size calculations and assumptions. <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection</title><p>The interventions ran in the LGAs for a 9-month period from July 2012 to March 2013.

We chose 4&#x02005;months as the primary outcome point because breastfeeding at 4&#x02005;months is a key national indicator of children's health, development and well-being, and thus this is the time the visit is scheduled to occur (noted in trial protocol paper). The feeding data collected for 6&#x02005;months in the LGA context are actually asked at the 8&#x02005;month visit. Given we wanted to ask about infant feeding in the past 24&#x02005;h, we therefore chose 4&#x02005;months. The participation rate is also far higher at that visit (&#x0003e;93%) compared with the later visit (&#x0223c;85%).</p><p>A single data item asking about infant feeding &#x02018;in the past 24&#x02005;h&#x02019; was added to the usual questions asked by MCHNs, to ascertain this outcome at the routine 4-month KAS visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008292F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008292F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Primary outcome data collection question, asked at routine 4-month maternal and child health visit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008292f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Baseline and outcome infant feeding data collection</title><p>Baseline breastfeeding outcomes (3, 4 and 6&#x02005;months) were collected in all participating LGAs for a period of 3&#x02005;months before infants exposed to the interventions had their 4-month MCH appointments.

For baseline differences in potential confounders between intervention and comparison groups that might be associated with breastfeeding outcomes, an online supplementary multivariate analysis was carried out. In all analyses, adjustment was made for clustering at the MCH centre level as well as baseline breastfeeding rates. This was done using the &#x02018;survey set&#x02019; command in Stata prior to all regression.

Like most breastfeeding RCTs conducted in Australia, it had no impact on breastfeeding maintenance. The previous Australian RCTs were mostly inadequately powered; just two had a sufficient sample size to find a 10% difference in breastfeeding if one existed.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Only one found increased breastfeeding initiation, but this was in a specific cultural group.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Another increased breastfeeding at 6&#x02005;weeks,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> a result not replicated in another trial that retested the intervention.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> On the other hand, a Cochrane review of breastfeeding support for new mothers which included 52 trials from 21 countries (including 8 cluster trials and 37 trials from high-income countries) concluded that all types of extra support increased <italic>any</italic> breastfeeding, although the effect was modest.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The quality of included studies was mixed, and most had methodological weaknesses. The review found that the greatest effects were in communities with high levels of breastfeeding initiation (over 80%).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Although our study was based on strategies that appeared to have some promise, including peer/lay and professional support, and used multistrategy interventions, there was little local Australian data to guide potential strategies. We aimed to address the pivotal point where new mothers are no longer under hospital care and are at risk of ceasing breastfeeding,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> as well as providing support in a critical early period where there is a service gap.</p><p>SILC was a complex intervention introduced into a complex real-life community setting, with several &#x02018;active&#x02019; ingredients.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Our process evaluation data demonstrate that a range of factors affected intervention fidelity and thus impacted on the overall dose and reach of the interventions, despite all participating LGAs being very engaged in the intervention concept and processes. Most LGAs were unable to assess all women for eligibility for early breastfeeding support; they provided fewer home visits than planned, and most were later than planned. This was despite numerous visits by the study team to the trial sites, and extensive discussion and education. It is not clear why this was the case, and it is likely to be more than one factor, with influences such as staff workloads, not receiving information on births in a timely manner, and possibly a perception that women did not want or need support in addition to usual care. It may also be that LGAs were more likely to visit those families that were easiest to contact; in some cases only one attempt to telephone women was made, and if there was no contact then the opportunity to intervene early was lost. There were also challenges with drop-in centre establishment, including recruitment of volunteers, and poor attendance. At times staff (both administrative and SILC-MCHNs) were not replaced while on leave, which may have affected home visits and drop-in centre hours. These contextual factors appeared to have an impact on the implementation of SILC. This was also the case in a cluster trial of community-based breastfeeding support programmes in Scotland, which found a decline in breastfeeding rates in three of seven intervention localities.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In that study, breastfeeding was negatively impacted by factors such as poor interprofessional communication, staff shortages, high workload and poor morale, and breastfeeding increased where there was more evidence of leadership, a focus on policy, multidisciplinary partnerships and reflective action cycles.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Similarly, a previous community-based cluster trial to promote the mental and physical health of mothers and babies in Victoria reported a range of contextual factors that may have influenced intervention effectiveness, including major local government change at the time of the trial, length of time available for embedding the intervention prior to outcome evaluation and the challenge of changes in role for the MCH nurses themselves.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The short time available for embedding the SILC intervention, including a run-in period of just 2&#x02005;months, may have limited the likelihood of drop-in centres becoming established and known within the community, and also the time for the broader MCHN workforce to be aware of the new service. The 3-year project timeline was determined by the funding body (Department of Education and Early Childhood Development in Victoria).</p><p>In terms of blinding, this was not possible at the LGA (randomisation) or cluster levels; however, individual women in the LGAs were not aware of the intervention allocation&#x02014;the intention was that any trial arm allocation was &#x02018;standard&#x02019; care within the LGA during the intervention period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Improving breastfeeding rates is a complex and multifaceted endeavour, and in this trial, the complexity was further impacted by the poor compliance with the planned interventions. The additional support we aimed to add to usual care was not provided to the extent envisaged; only 5% of women leaving hospital breastfeeding received the intervention as planned, compared with the target of 30%. Within these parameters, in this carefully conducted cluster RCT, extra &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; breastfeeding support, on its own, made no difference to breastfeeding rates as measured in this study. If WHO breastfeeding targets are to be achieved, SILC demonstrates that strategies to improve breastfeeding need to pay careful attention to system-level factors to ensure implementation is normalised and optimal, giving interventions the best chance of succeeding. The importance of social factors in women's decisions about breastfeeding may mean that health professional interventions alone are insufficient to address context-level factors more effectively, so that interventions can be more successfully normalised and given the best chance of being effective.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, Victoria, Australia for funding SILC.
