Results of cardiovascular outcome trials (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) have triggered a discussion about the association between hypoglycemia and increased mortality (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The American Diabetes Association defines the prevention of hypoglycemia as a critical component of diabetes management (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This study was specifically designed to compare hypoglycemia with exenatide twice daily (BID) versus premixed insulin aspart 70/30 BID (PIA) (70% protamin crystallized, 30% soluble) at a noninferior level of glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients on metformin treatment. An additional smaller patient cohort previously treated with metformin plus sulfonylurea or meglitinides was enrolled into an exploratory arm; data have been published separately (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This 26-week randomized open-label study was conducted at 68 sites in Germany. Metformin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes (A1C 6.5&#x02013;10.0%) received exenatide BID (4 weeks, 5 &#x003bc;g, then 10 &#x003bc;g) or PIA. PIA was titrated to glucose targets of 5.0&#x02013;7.2 mmol/L (fasting) and &#x0003c;10 mmol/L (2 h postprandial) after each main meal (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), without a structured insulin dosing algorithm. Metformin was continued unchanged. Randomization was stratified by baseline A1C (&#x02264;8.0 or &#x0003e;8.0%).</p><p>A1C was measured by a central laboratory (Tosoh HPLC analyzer; Interlab, Munich, Germany), and hypoglycemic episodes were collected from patient diaries. Patients were encouraged to measure blood glucose levels twice daily and immediately in case of hypoglycemic symptoms.</p><p>The primary objective was to test if exenatide BID was noninferior to PIA for A1C control, and superior to PIA regarding hypoglycemia (blood glucose &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L or severe episode). Severe episodes were defined as episodes requiring assistance of another person, with symptoms recovering after treatment (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A hierarchical testing procedure was used. For noninferiority of exenatide BID, the upper limit of the 95% CI of the group difference in A1C change was required to be &#x0003c;0.4% (exenatide BID minus PIA; mixed model repeated measurement [MMRM] adjusting for baseline A1C). Only if noninferiority was shown, the second test on the risk for the first hypoglycemic episode (blood glucose &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L or severe; Kaplan-Meier analysis) was done. The analysis included all randomized patients who received the study drug (full analysis population). Body weight was compared using an MMRM model similar to the primary analysis. Post hoc, the proportion of patients reaching A1C &#x0003c;7.0% without weight gain and hypoglycemic episodes (composite end point) was compared by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Frequencies of adverse events were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 363 randomized patients (exenatide/PIA 182/181), 354 (181/173) received study drug (full analysis population); 272 (135/137) completed the study.

In addition, exenatide patients achieved significant mean weight reduction. With exenatide BID, twice as many patients reached the clinically relevant composite end point of A1C &#x0003c;7.0%, no weight gain, and no hypoglycemia (post hoc analysis). Two previous studies had also compared exenatide BID versus PIA. The 52-week trial by Nauck et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) showed that in a similar patient population, exenatide BID was noninferior to PIA for glycemic control, but without any difference in hypoglycemia. The mean final daily insulin dose was lower than in our trial (24.4 vs. 28.4 IU/day). Patients received concomitant sulfonylurea, and this may explain the lower insulin dose and lack of differences in hypoglycemia.</p><p>In contrast, the 24-week trial by Bergenstal et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) showed superior glycemic control with PIA versus exenatide BID in poorly controlled patients with advanced disease (baseline A1C 10.2%, diabetes duration 10 years). In late-stage diabetes, insulin may improve glycemic control better; GLP-1 therapy may have limited effects because of the impaired &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Hypoglycemia was less frequent with exenatide BID (20.2 vs. 52.1%) in spite of concomitant sulfonylurea, possibly because of aggressive insulin titration (mean final dose 96.1 IU/day).</p><p>In our study, sulfonylurea treatment was excluded, decreasing the risk of hypoglycemia in both arms and enabling us to assess the full benefit of exenatide on the risk of hypoglycemia. The hierarchical testing required noninferior glycemic control before testing for hypoglycemia. Insulin titration might be criticized as not being aggressive enough (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The mean final insulin dose (28.4 IU/day) was higher than in the study by Nauck et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but lower than in two studies using other premixed insulins (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, A1C reductions were similar to previous trials, and a mean end point A1C of 6.8% was among the best results reported (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
