The present study is a post hoc analysis of possible predictors of weight loss among all 218 patients who have over-weight or obesity. A 23-pages questionnaire was completed before and 1&#x000a0;year after randomization. 111 patients had a one-hour preventive health consultation with their general practitioners focused on life coaching and a follow-up consultation within 3&#x000a0;months, and 107 patients had no preventive consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-two patients stated during the preventive consultation that weight loss was a prioritised goal. They had a mean weight loss of 4.7&#x000a0;kgs compared with 1.6&#x000a0;kgs in the group without this goal and 1.6&#x000a0;kgs in the group without preventive consultation. In a logistic regression model, predictors of weight loss or no weight loss were a) pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days, b) having weight loss as a prioritised goal for improved quality of life, c) being female, d) being in the oldest half of participants, and e) having many psychosocial problems. In a linear regression model, the predictors together explained about 11&#x000a0;% of the weight loss. Important predictors were: obesity (explained 4&#x000a0;%), pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days (3&#x000a0;%), and having a preventive health consultation with weight loss as a prioritised goal (2&#x000a0;%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days and having weight loss as a prioritised goal during the health consultation were two important predictors for weight loss. By structured interventions focussing on the patients&#x02019; priorities, self-chosen goals, their resources and barriers for reaching the goals, changes may be obtained; especially in participants with many problems who often do not accept participation in procedures on risks.</p></sec><sec><title>ClinicalTrials gov Registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">NCT 01231256</ext-link>, Aug. 22. 2010.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Life coaching</kwd><kwd>General practitioners</kwd><kwd>Over-weight</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial problems</kwd><kwd>Specific self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>Patient-centred</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>North Jutland qualty development Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Foundation for General Practice</institution></funding-source><award-id>FF-2-01-284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freund</surname><given-names>Kirsten S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Danish Heart Association</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>reg.nr.27989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freund</surname><given-names>Kirsten S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>PLI Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freund</surname><given-names>Kirsten S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institute of Population and Public Health (Odense)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lous</surname><given-names>J&#x000f8;rgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Excess bodyweight is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity, causing nearly 3 million deaths every year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globally, body mass index (BMI) has increased since 1980 with large differences between nations and regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis found that obesity, especially with BMI &#x02265;35&#x000a0;kgs/m<sup>2</sup>, was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality, and slight overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The importance of overweight (BMI 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kgs/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kgs/m<sup>2</sup>) as risk factors for myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease is controversial. A register-based cohort study including all patients from The Western Denmark Heart Registry with coronary atherosclerosis confirmed via coronary angiography (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37 573) found that the death rate was lowest among pre-obese patients (BMI 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kgs/m<sup>2</sup>) during 11&#x000a0;years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A Danish cohort study of 71 527 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with 3.6&#x000a0;years of follow-up reported increased risk of myocardial infarction in overweight (hazard ratio 1.26 (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 1.6)) and obese (hazard ratio 1.88 (1.3 to 2.6)) subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many short-term studies have evaluated the effects of weight loss in patients with chronic diseases and often demonstrated a beneficial effect of even modest weight loss on their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Fewer long-term studies have evaluated the benefits of weight loss, but their findings tend to confirm the findings of short-term studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In Denmark, overweight and obesity are significant problems increasing with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>While some consequences of obesity are well documented, the reasons for over-weight and obesity are very complex and difficult to address. The importance of human gut microbes is under intense investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Imbalance between energy input and energy use is, however, part of the problem and is the focus of many interventions programmes. Intervention with dietary advice, more exercise, and improved health professional management has resulted in effects that are often limited and brief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast, focusing on self-efficacy, which is a person&#x02019;s judgement of his or her ability to cope effectively in a specific difficult situation, seems to result in a better change of life style over 6&#x02013;12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>People with mental health problems often have over-weight problems as well. Several studies have shown positive effects of health promotion coaching resulting in clinical significant weight loss and an increase in the sense of coherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Approximately 90&#x000a0;% of the Danish population, visit their general practitioners (GPs) at least once annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus it is evident that Danish GPs may play a central role in treating over-weight and obesity in their surgeries.</p><p>In 1998&#x02013;9 we did a randomized study on the effect of patient-centred consultations in general practice for 20&#x02013;44&#x000a0;year old patients with multiple psycho-social and lifestyle problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The focus was on resources and barriers for obtaining self-chosen goals within life circumstances and lifestyle. One-year follow-up questionnaire showed significant improvement in Short Form Health-related Quality of Life Mental (MCS-SF12) in the intervention group (7.3 point) compared with the control group (3.0 point). The difference was 4.3 point (ci 1.6 to 7.0, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002). The number of problems were reduced significantly more in the intervention than in the control group (1.8 versus 0.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>This paper is a post hoc analysis of all 218 patients who are over-weight or obese, irrespective of their randomization group. In the previous paper, we found that the intervention group (independent of their weight) had a mean weight loss of 2.9&#x000a0;kgs compared with the control group weight loss of 1.5&#x000a0;kgs, (difference 1.4&#x000a0;kgs (ci: &#x02212;0.8 to 3.7&#x000a0;kgs, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of the present paper is to describe predictive factor for weight loss in participants with a BMI at 25 or higher. Our secondary aim is to describe the participants who are over-weight or obese compared with the participants in the normal weight group.</p><p>Weight loss was the most common chosen goal for a better life next year independent of weight. Other chosen goals were better psychological health, a better relationship to the partner, a change of job situation, smoking cessation, better health, and a better social network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GPs</title><p>All 325 GPs in North Jutland County, Denmark, were invited to participate.

A total of 2 056 people (98&#x000a0;%) accepted the invitation to participate in the preventive study and provided written informed consent about the purpose:&#x0201d;&#x02026; To support your resources in order to prevent larger problems or illness&#x02026;&#x0201d;.

Completing the baseline questionnaire was intended to facilitate insight into circumstances regarding psychosocial life, health, lifestyle, the participant&#x02019;s reaction to stressors, and heath and illness behaviour. This insight made it easier for the GPs to offer patient-centred counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The GPs were recommended to use open questions and to respect the patients&#x02019; agendas by asking the following questions: &#x0201c;What was it like to complete the questionnaire?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;What do you prefer to discuss?&#x0201d; During the health consultation, the patients were asked to choose 1 or 2 goals to improve their quality of life the following year. At the end of the health consultation, the patients&#x02019; resources and barriers for achieving their goal were discussed and described, and their time schedules were written down. This style of intervention is now called life coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Possible predictors of weight loss</title><p>The study is based on the following information: 1) the screening questionnaire and baseline questionnaire completed by all 495 participants before randomisation, 2) the goal chosen during the health consultation, and 3) 1-year follow-up questionnaires including their actual height and weight, returned by post.</p><p>Demographic variables such as age, gender, education, cohabitation status, self-rated economy (bad to fair/good), and social group were included in the baseline questionnaire as were self-rated health, Short Form Health-related Quality-of-Life Mental (MCS-SF12) and Physical (PSC-SF12), and the number of problems on the 33-item screening questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were collected from the questionnaires using the TeleForm<sup>R</sup> reading system (info@cardiff-teleform.com) and analysed in IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, ver. 16 and 22).

One of the important factors was to have weight loss as a top prioritised goal for a better health next year and to have discussed resources and barriers for reaching the goal with their GPs during preventive consultations focusing on specific self-efficacy and life coaching. Those participants experienced an average weight loss of 4.7&#x000a0;kgs compared with 1.6&#x000a0;kgs obtained by the rest of the over-weight or obese patients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Almost the same weight loss was experienced by the 37 who had pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days (4.3&#x000a0;kgs). Other important predictors were having many psychosocial problems, and being 35 to 45&#x000a0;years old and being female. Being obese was less important in the logistic regression model (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>At baseline, over-weight/obese participants were approximately 1&#x000a0;year older, were more often men, and had lower physical health-related quality of life (PCS-SF12) than members of the non-overweight group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title> Limitations</title><p>Our participants were invited to participate in the GPs&#x02019; clinics if they were between 20 and 44&#x000a0;years old and had &#x02265;7 psychosocial and lifestyle problems out of 33 possible. Thus our results cannot be generalised to the average patient population, but only to the 30&#x000a0;% of younger patients with several psychosocial problems coming to the clinic for any reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>This study is a post hoc analysis of a previous study, but with another focus than the RCT, namely predictive factors for weight loss after 1&#x000a0;year in those who are overweight or obese, independent of their group in the RCT.</p><p>Our analysis is also limited by our reliance on self-reported height and weight data. The completed baseline questionnaire with height and weight was delivered to each participant&#x02019;s GP, and therefore a certain degree of credibility could be expected. The intervention group had their height and weight measured with good agreement (mean difference of 0.9&#x000a0;kg) in the Bland-Altman plot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In a web-based treatment program in the United States, self-reported weight correlated significantly with measured weight, with a difference of ~1&#x000a0;kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The study dropout of 56 over-weight patients out of 218 (27&#x000a0;%) is problematic, but it was expected in this group of young adults with several psychosocial problems. This age group moves to other regions of Denmark with a high frequency. A previous systematic review reported a mean dropout rate from lifestyle intervention programs for over-weight and obese infertile women of 24&#x000a0;% in 10 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. That rate is very close to our loss to follow-up.</p><p>The relatively small number of over-weight with weight loss as top prioritised goal in our analysis is a problem, which means, wide confidence intervals and limited precision in the linear regression analyses. Weight loss was the most frequently chosen goal (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33, 16&#x000a0;%) among the 209 patients having a health consultation.</p><p>In the statistical analysis, we dichotomised some variables. We know the problems with dichotomizing variables, primary loss of information, and the problem as to where to place the cut point. We tried to cut in a biological meaningful way that means trying to divide the material in a strait forward way or using the median as cut point. The dichotomizing meant a reduction of cells in regression analyses, and thus a more stable model.</p><p>Another limitation of your design could be our definition of &#x0201c;many&#x0201d; psychosocial problems. It could be problematic just to add up different problems of different character and importance. The reason for using this pragmatic method was that we just wanted to select persons with multiple problems. That meant problems within several of the topics: networking, resources, life style, social life, and child care. Our pilot study showed that a cut point of 7 or more problems out of 33 possible would select the 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% with most problems, and problems within several of the mentioned areas.</p><p>Training of all participating GPs may have affected their normal consultations. Their treatment might have a possible spin-over effect on the GPs&#x02019; patients with no preventive consultation; the mean weight loss of 1.6&#x000a0;kgs may point in that direction, but it might also be an effect of completing the baseline questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths</title><p>This investigation was designed to be patient-centred, with a focus on the patient&#x02019;s own goal for improved quality of life during the coming year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The baseline questionnaire primed the patients to think in very broad terms, encompassing relationships, work problems, psychological problems, economy, social problems, problems with children, lifestyle, and health and illness behaviour. The intervention group discussed resources and barriers for achieving their prioritised goal. Our intervention fulfils the criteria of life coaching as it was based on the patient&#x02019;s agenda and reflected the patient&#x02019;s present wishes and needs. The dialogue was holistic, individualised, without fixed agenda. It was conducted face-to-face by GPs with special training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In that way, we supported the subjects&#x02019; feelings of competence, autonomy and relatedness, increasing their motivation and facilitating their self-determination. The goal and self-efficacy was supported by writing down both resources, barriers and time schedule for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>We collected baseline information on all included patients and dropouts, enabling us to compare the completers and the dropouts in detail without finding any statistical differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another strength of this investigation is that the training program for the participating GPs has been well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We selected two outcomes, 1-year weight loss (yes or no) (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and extent of the weight loss (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) for our analysis of predictive factors for weight loss. Both outcomes are relevant in daily clinical work. The two most important predictors identified here, &#x0201c;considered short term weight loss before the preventive consultation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;having weight loss as a prioritised goal for the next year during the preventive consultation,&#x0201d; seem to be robust because they were significantly related to weight loss in non-adjusted analysis, in logistic regression, and in linear regression models. These findings should be confirmed in other studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Comparisons with other studies</title><p>Many GPs find the over-weight and obesity problem challenging for several reasons. In 2004, Bramlage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported that GPs&#x02019; recognition of over-weight (20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) and obesity (50&#x02013;65&#x000a0;%) was low, that primary-care management of over-weight and obesity was largely deficient, that doctors put forth inefficient efforts to intervene, and that patients had poor acceptance of such interventions and dissatisfaction with existing lifestyle-modification strategies. They found men had higher BMI, and obesity was more prevalent in older age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], as in our study.</p><p>In several randomised studies on lifestyle counselling, weight loss after 1&#x000a0;year was small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In 2011, Wadden et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported a difference of 1.1&#x000a0;kgs after 1&#x000a0;year and 1.2&#x000a0;kgs after 2&#x000a0;years. A meta-analysis of 46 trials found a change of approximately &#x02212;0.1 BMI units per month from 3 to 12&#x000a0;months of active programs and a regain of 0.02&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.03 BMI units per month during subsequent maintenance phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>We identified in our study weight loss both in the group with preventive consultation and in the group without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which may be due to the combined effects of completing the baseline questionnaire, training of the GPs, and regression toward the mean weight. The additional weight loss of 3.1&#x000a0;kgs to a total of 4.7&#x000a0;kgs in the preventive consultation group with weight loss as a prioritised goal (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) is interesting because it illustrates the importance of the focused discussion with GPs on resources and barriers for reaching the patients&#x02019; weight loss goals. Important elements of motivational interviewing were used to focus on supporting specific self-efficacy, which means the confidence in own ability to reach a specific goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There were no specific advice given regarding food and exercise, but general advices focused on possible benefits of weight loss. An observational cohort study on the effect of a commercial weight loss program from Sweden found in an adjusted analysis that a low-calorie diet group lost 2.8&#x000a0;kgs more than the restricted normal-food group, and that the very low-calorie diet group lost 3.8&#x000a0;kgs more; dropout rates were 23&#x000a0;%, 26&#x000a0;%, and 18&#x000a0;%, respectively, in the three groups after 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Shikany et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] compared a portion-controlled, nutritionally balanced, low-fat weight loss plan with a reduced energy, food-based diet. After 1&#x000a0;year, the weight reductions were 4.7 and 1.9&#x000a0;kgs, respectively, in the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A trend to regain the lost weight after the intervention was also observed. A much more intensive intervention with 42 sessions in obese type 2 diabetes patients was compared with three education sessions; the intensive intervention resulted in 8.6&#x000a0;kgs weight loss compared with 0.7&#x000a0;kg after 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Several investigations have focused on the importance of GPs&#x02019; optimism and support with regard to weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] as well as GPs&#x02019; lack of support. Wadden et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported that nearly half of the participants in a university clinic obesity trial said that their physician had not recommended any of 10 common weight loss methods. GPs believed obesity was an important problem and used mostly brief, targeted low-intensity counselling in the face of limited patient motivation and lack of resources to support weight loss. This may reflect clinicians&#x02019; self-assessment of their ineffectiveness in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The GPs in our study had an agenda for counselling, namely listening to the patient and discussing resources and barriers to the expressed goal for the coming year (weight loss was the most commonly chosen goal), and they had scheduled a 1-hour life-coaching consultation for a patient-centred discussion with 20 mins&#x02019; follow-up within 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>We are intrigued by our finding that pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days was an important predictor of weight loss compared with time limits of 6&#x000a0;months or 12&#x000a0;months. This observation may emphasize the importance of respect for the readiness of the patient in health-preventive consultations. A study by Elfhag and R&#x000f6;ssner showed that rapid initial weight loss is a predictor of success in obesity treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A recent systematic review of 45 trials on weight loss found that behavioural interventions focusing on both food intake and physical activity were effective, with an average difference of 1.56&#x000a0;kgs after 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. After 1&#x000a0;year, we detected the same weight loss in our control group who completed a 23-pages baseline questionnaire and had no preventive consultation.</p><p>A study from Norway supported the observation that relatively rapid weight loss (12&#x000a0;weeks) strongly predicts weight loss after 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In linear multiple regression analyses, occupational status, older age, and low mental health-related quality of life were associated with weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our study confirms that the psychosocially disadvantaged participants experienced more weight loss than participants with few problems and a high-school education (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This observation underscores that our participants with many psychosocial problems took advantage of the individual life-coaching method with elements of motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our study design and organisation facilitated the motivational interviewing process. This person-centred structure is supposed to have been critical to revealing the patient&#x02019;s readiness for change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Participants who had a preventive consultation and identified weight loss as a prioritised goal had an average weight loss of 4.7&#x000a0;kgs compared to 1.6&#x000a0;kgs in participants without a weight loss goal or those without a preventive consultation. Consideration of weight loss within 30&#x000a0;days at baseline and having a preventive health consultation with weight loss as a prioritised goal for the coming year were two important predictors of weight loss after 1&#x000a0;year. We suggest that these two factors are important indicators of the patient&#x02019;s readiness or motivation for change, and therefore should be in focus when health-related behavioural change is desired; other predictors of weight loss were having many psychosocial problems, female gender and obesity.</p><p>By structured intervention with focus on the patients self-chosen goal (weight loss), and on resources and barriers for reaching the goal, significant changes can be obtained; especially in participants with many problems, who often do not accept or drop out from screening procedures with focus on risks. In this way, general practice may contribute to bridge the gap in inequality in health.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>ANalysis Of VAriance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ci</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cm</term><def><p>centimetre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Kgs</term><def><p>kilogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M<sup>2</sup></term><def><p>height in meter squared</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS-SF12</term><def><p>mental component score - short form 12 questions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N</term><def><p>number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS-SF12</term><def><p>physical component score&#x02014;short form 12 questions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>relative risk</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JL designed the data-collection tools, monitored data collection for the trial, wrote the statistical analysis plan, cleaned and analysed the data, and drafted and revised the paper.
