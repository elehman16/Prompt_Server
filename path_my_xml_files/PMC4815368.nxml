Students with pain score equal to or greater than 4 were selected and divided into groups based on severity of pain using a randomized block design with the allocation ratio of 1:1. Acupressure was applied in two acupoints including third Liver point (Liv3) and placebo points. Spielberg (STAI) anxiety questionnaire was completed before and after intervention.

It has been approved by the ethics committee of Kashan University of Medical Sciences (KaUMS) with the number /29/5/1/3613 and registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with the number IRCT201201308869N1. The study was performed according to the design without making any changes.</p><p>The study was carried out in parallel in the control and treatment groups. Acupressure was performed on the treatment and placebo points. In the control group (group A), acupressure was given in placebo point that was located 2 cun above the distance between the third and fourth fingers (this point is not located on the path of meridians [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In treatment group (group B), acupressure was given on the liv3 point located 2 cun (width of three fingers)[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] above the distance between the first and second metatarsal bones. The study was performed at dormitory of KaUMS between March and June 2012 for three menstrual cycles. Inclusion criteria were self-reported, including living at dormitory; being single; having regular menstrual periods; pain starting with menstrual bleeding onset; duration of bleeding between 3 and 8 days and menstrual interval between 21 and 35 days; dysmenorrhea with pain intensity equal to or higher than 4 based on visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity; lack of anemia, high blood pressure, or known systemic or genital disease, and severe psychological stress in the past 6 months (students were asked whether or not they have had severe emotional stress such as the death of relatives, surgeries, marriage, or divorce of parents in the past 6 months). Exclusion criteria were self-reported, including use of heat for pain relief; use of oral contraceptives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors from 4 h before to 4 h after acupressure; and not cooperating until the end of the third period of the menstrual cycle. Sample size was estimated as 27 students per group based on a pilot study. Considering 80% power and 95% confidence level, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the possible loss of samples, public invitation was extended to 500 dormitory living students.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Liv3 and placebo points</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-21-142-g001"/></fig><p>Block randomization was done with 1:1 allocation ratio based on pain intensity. This division was performed using a random number determined by the statistician.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Blinding</title><p>Subjects, randomization and analysis were blind to avoid any bias.</p><p>At first, the researcher learned the technique of acupressure from a traditional Chinese medicine professor and applied it on the subjects. The third author of this article who carried out sampling was an undergraduate midwife. She was in constant contact with the students face to face, by telephone, or via post. Students completed a questionnaire including demographic and menstrual cycle questions. Also, Spielberg (STAI) anxiety questionnaire was completed by the students before and after intervention.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the first day of the first cycle, pain intensity was measured without intervention at the start of bleeding and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. Dysmenorrhea was assessed according to VAS for pain intensity. Subjects with pain score equal to or greater than 4 were selected. At this time, 67 remaining students were randomly divided into two groups. Students were taught to find the exact location of acupoints and to apply acupressure technique. At first, acupressure was applied by the researcher in a clockwise rotation. Pressure was continued until the students reported De chi (feeling the symptoms of heat, cold, or tingling). Then the same pressure was applied on the acuhealth device. Students were asked to apply the same pressure and pay attention to their nail color change.</p><p>In the second and third cycles, students applied pressure by themselves at the bleeding onset. It was stopped with feeling De chi; otherwise, it was continued for 2 min and resumed on the other foot after a 2 min rest. Pressure was applied twice on each leg and a total of four times (16 min) in clockwise rotation. Pain was measured at the start of bleeding and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. After the third menstrual cycle, anxiety questionnaire was completed by the participants for the second time.</p><p>Dysmenorrhea, acupressure, and objectives of the study were explained to the participants. Students were informed that they might be placed in control or intervention groups and they could discontinue cooperating in the study at any time they wanted. Informed consent was taken from them.</p><p>We used a digital glass scale (GS46) with 100 g accuracy that was made in Germany for measuring the weight and a single non-elastic tape for measuring the height. Pressure exerted by the fingers of the researcher and the student was determined by a Force Gauge Device. Australian Acuhealth professional 900 was used. This valid and reliable device can specify the accuracy of the found acupoint.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It makes certain alarm at the exact location of the acupoint.</p><p>VAS pain scale is a ruler used by the research units to rate their pain. Distance between the beginning of the ruler to the marked point will be the numerical pain score of the unit.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The validity of this scale has previously been confirmed.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Spielberg anxiety questionnaire has 40 questions in two areas; each area has 20 questions. Each question has four options and a rating between 1 and 4. In apparent anxiety, a score of 4 indicates too high, 3 means high, 2 indicates low, and 1 means very low. In hidden anxiety, a score of 4 means almost always, 3 means often, 2 indicates almost never, and 1 means never. Thus, the total score would be 40-160. Anxiety score from 40 up to 80 is considered as low, 81-120 as moderate, and 121-160 as high. Reliability and validity of this questionnaire have been assessed and confirmed in Iranian society.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Additionally the internal consistency reliability of the measure has been supported in this study achieving an alpha value of .85. In this questionnaire, some phrases indicate absence of distress and are weighted inversely, including 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 for apparent anxiety and 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 36 39 for hidden anxiety.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Confounding variables were matched between groups, including painful menstrual history in first-degree relatives, age at menarche, interval between menarche and onset of dysmenorrhea, menstrual duration, and body mass index (BMI). Results were reported as mean [Standard Deviation (SD)] or frequency (%) for qualitative variables and mean (min.-max.) for quantitative variables. To check the consistency of underlying variables, <italic>t</italic>-test or Chi-square test was used according to the nature of variables. Mann-Whitney was used to compare the pain intensity between groups in the first cycle. To compare the anxiety scores between groups in the first cycle, <italic>t</italic>-test was used. To compare the anxiety scores before and after intervention, paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used. Also, in the third cycle, univariate analysis of variance with adjustment of the baseline values in the first cycle was used to compare the anxiety scores between groups. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>In the liv3 group, 33 students and in the control group, 34 students were enrolled and included in the study.

This is the first report of the relationship between anxiety reduction and acupressure on liv3 acupoint. We did not find any study that evaluated the effect of acupressure at liv3 on anxiety. But our previous report[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Bazarganipour <italic>et al</italic>.'s study[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed decrease in dysmenorrhea after acupressure was performed on this point. There are also some reports of reduction in dysmenorrhea on applying acupressure on SP6 acupoint.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Since pain is associated with anxiety, pain relief can decrease anxiety,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and this issue can confirm our result. Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) studied the effect of acupressure at SP6 point on the level of anxiety. They showed a decrease in anxiety after acupressure; but they used VAS anxiety and studied persons with a pain score of 5 or more according to VAS pain intensity,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] whereas we assessed anxiety with Spielberg questionnaire and studied students with a pain score of 4 or more according to VAS pain intensity.</p><p>Similarity of our study with Chen <italic>et al</italic>.'s study is that the pressure was applied by the research units. In their study, acupressure on SP6 was firstly done by a researcher, which caused decrease in dysmenorrhea and anxiety. But when acupressure was done by the research units, it just caused decrease in dysmenorrhea and not anxiety.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) reported that acupressure on the SP6 point can reduce anxiety during labor without having adverse effects on the mother and baby.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Also, in the study of Charandabi (2011), reduction of menstrual symptoms severity scores after treatment was significantly more in the intervention group (acupressure on SP6 acupoint) as compared with the control group.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In contrast, other studies have not confirmed this effect. The study of Mehling <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) did not show any decrease in anxiety on applying acupressure on the SP6 point.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It may be due to applying pressure on more than one acupoint resulting in decrease in duration of pressure on each point.</p><p>Hidden anxiety did not decrease after applying acupressure on the liv3 acupoint. Generally, hidden anxiety shows ordinary feeling and specific conditions do not affect it. But Mirbagher <italic>et al</italic>. showed decrease in hidden anxiety on applying pressure on p6 point.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In this study, acupressure on the placebo point was not effective on the anxiety level. Although some studies reported the effectiveness of acupressure on the placebo point, this effect was more in the intervention group.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Chen <italic>et al</italic>.'s (2004) study confirms our study. In their study, the intervention group received 20 min of pressure on SP6 point and the control group had 20 min break; reduction of anxiety was not seen in the control group. But the control group in our study received the same acupressure in the placebo point. Another important point to be noted in our study is that the researcher was not present when the pressure was applied, whereas the presence of a researcher along with the patient can reduce the anxiety level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>This is the first report that has shown reduction of anxiety associated with dysmenorrhea after applying acupressure on the liv3 acupoint.
