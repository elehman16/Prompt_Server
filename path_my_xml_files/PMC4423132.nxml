Here we assess the durability of polyethylene nets with a novel combination of permethrin, a pyrethroid, with pyriproxyfen, an insect juvenile mimic (PPF-LLIN), in comparison with a typical permethrin-treated long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial of net durability in Burkina Faso, with clustering at the level of the compound and includes entomological outcome measurements. Half the compounds in each village will be randomly allocated PPF-LLIN and half the LLIN. All sleeping places in a compound will be provided with one type of net. We will distribute the nets at the start of the first transmission season and follow net use at the start and end of each transmission season for 3&#x000a0;years. In one village, bio-efficacy and chemical content will be recorded immediately after net distribution and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months. In the other village net survivorship and fabric integrity will be recorded immediately after distribution, and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months. Routine measurements of indoor temperature and relative humidity will be made in both villages during the study. Residents will be followed for possible side effects of the PPF-LLIN by surveillance of known asthmatic subjects during the first month post-distribution and pregnancy outcomes will be monitored from antenatal clinic records.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The protocol is novel on two accounts. Firstly, it is the first to describe the procedure for measuring net durability following recent World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Meeting the minimum requirements set in the guidelines is essential before a new type of net can be recommended by WHO&#x02019;s Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). Secondly, it describes methods to monitor the persistence of an active ingredient that reduces vector fertility and fecundity. If the PPF-LLIN is both effective and persistent it will provide an alternative vector control strategy where pyrethroid-resistant vectors are present.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN30634670">ISRCTN30634670</ext-link> assigned 13 August 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0700-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Net durability</kwd><kwd>Insecticide resistance management</kwd><kwd>Malaria control</kwd><kwd>Insecticide-treated bed net</kwd><kwd>Pyrethroid</kwd><kwd>Pyriproxyfen</kwd><kwd>Insect juvenile hormone mimic</kwd><kwd>Clinical malaria</kwd><kwd>Entomological inoculation rate</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The massive scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) has contributed to a decline in malaria in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pyrethroids remain, until now, the only class of insecticide used for treating nets since they are highly insecticidal and safe to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the rapid increase in resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in mosquitoes may jeopardise future malaria vector control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Polyethylene nets, containing a novel combination of permethrin, a pyrethroid, and pyriproxyfen (PPF-LLIN), an insect juvenile hormone mimic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], may enhance malaria control, as well as reducing the spread of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes.</p><p>A two-armed cluster-randomised controlled trial (AvecNet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] is being conducted near Banfora, Burkina Faso, to assess whether PPF-LLINs (Olyset Duo nets containing 2% permethrin, 1% pyriproxyfen w/w) provide better protection against clinical malaria in children than 2% permethrin-treated LLINs (Olyset Nets) in an area with high levels of pyrethroid resistance in the main vector, <italic>Anopheles gambiae s.s</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At the start of the study, 33% mortality was obtained after exposure to a discriminating dose of permethrin (0.75% papers for 1&#x000a0;hour exposure) and the time to kill 50% after exposure to the discriminating dose was 91&#x000a0;minutes. In the current study we propose to measure the durability of both PPF-LLINs (Olyset Duo) and LLINs (Olyset), used as a control, under operational conditions for 3&#x000a0;years to complement the efficacy results of the main trial. Since all villages in the main trial will have PPF-LLINs by the end of the 2-year trial, this durability study will take place in villages outside the main trial and adverse events (AE) will be monitored as for the main trial.</p><p>Recently it has become apparent that while the Olyset brand of LLINs has excellent tensile strength and insecticidal properties that last for many years, the netting is prone to develop elongated holes due to the weave unravelling once a small hole develops. Thus, large-scale surveys, supported by the President&#x02019;s Malaria Initiative, of national LLIN distributions in several African countries found that after 2&#x000a0;years of domestic use, Olyset nets sometimes scored badly on fabric integrity in comparison to many other brands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The manufacturer has acted on these findings and changed the knitting pattern of the Olyset Net, which inhibits the development of elongated holes, so that since late 2013 all Olyset Nets manufactured have this new knitting pattern (J Lucas, personal communication). In our durability trial we will use new knitting pattern nets for both the PPF-LLIN and LLIN. Durability of PPF-LLINs and LLINs will be assessed using 3 criteria: (1) net survivorship, (2) fabric integrity and (3) insecticidal activity (bio-efficacy). This protocol follows the recommendations made by WHO in 2013 entitled &#x02018;<italic>Guidelines for monitoring the durability of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets under operational conditions</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], WHO&#x02019;s 2013 &#x02018;<italic>Guidelines for laboratory and field testing of long lasting insecticidal nets</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and WHO&#x02019;s Vector Control Technical Expert Group&#x02019;s guidelines on &#x02018;<italic>Estimating functional survival of long-lasting insecticidal nets from field data</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>This protocol is the first we know of that adheres to these guidelines.

In Dalamba (village A) samples will be cut from nets and the nets will be replaced (Primary objective and Tertiary Objective 2) and Sanako (village B), where nets will be left intact (Secondary objective and Tertiary Objectives 1 and 3). AE will be followed in both villages. The separation of activities in two villages is designed for operational reasons to simplify data collection and analysis since in village A nets will be replaced through the course of the trial, whilst in village B nets will be delivered and hung only at the start of the trial. This arrangement is also less likely to create dissatisfaction amongst those who will not get replacement nets. The study villages have a total population of approximately 2,000 and are situated close to the south-east of Banfora (10&#x000b0; 56&#x02032; 00&#x02033; N, 004&#x000b0; 46&#x02032; 00&#x02033; W) in an area of open Sudanian savannah. These villages are located near those enrolled in the main AvecNet Trial, but are outside the main study area. Most people in the main trial and in this study live in houses made with mud or cement walls and thatched or metal roofs. The climate is tropical with most rain falling from May to October. This defines the highly seasonal malaria transmission with most malarial episodes experienced during or immediately following the major rains. The study&#x02019;s field station is based at Banfora town, which is the main town in the district. This is an area of cotton-growing since 1968 with <italic>An. gambiae</italic> S forms predominating over M forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Net owner enrolment</title><p>As is customary in Burkina Faso, sensitisation will start by discussions with community elders and then representatives of the villages in order to explain the nature of the study and what will be required during the study (information sheet, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The key attendees names and roles will be documented for each village.</p><p>We will explain to individual net owners the purpose of the study and will provide them with an information sheet (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Witnessed written consent (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) will be obtained from each participant, before net donation and exchange of their previous net. We will also seek written consent from net owners before taking netting samples. During these procedures it will be made clear that subjects and households will be able to leave the study at any time without giving a reason but their original net will not be returned. Given the nature of the study we will also encourage participants to keep the nets they are given and not to exchange them. We envisage that most study subjects will be enrolled at the start of the study for 36&#x000a0;months. Occasionally, due to movement of residents into the villages, some subjects join during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Both types of net will be randomly allocated to compounds, with allocation stratified by compound size in both villages. In village A 6 different compounds will be sampled in each study arm at 7 sequential time points: thus, 84 compounds (42 for each study arm) will be selected randomly, without replacement, at the start of the study. The remaining compounds in the village will be randomly assigned equally to the intervention or control and will act as reserve compounds in case of withdrawal of those randomised. At each sampling time point 4 nets will be randomly selected from each of the pre-selected compounds: that is within 1 to 2&#x000a0;weeks of hanging and then 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months later. As holes will be cut in the selected nets to provide netting samples for laboratory testing, the nets will be taken from the recipient and replaced with a new one of the same type: that is LLINs will be replaced with LLINs and PPF-LLINs replaced with PPF-LLINs. A total of 649 nets will be distributed in Dalamba (village A) and 541 in Sanako (village B). In cluster-randomised controlled trials it is particularly important to minimise imbalance for factors likely to be correlated with the outcome; bio-efficacy will probably be affected by net washing and possibly by the ambient temperature and humidity, this will be corrected for in the analysis. Observer bias will be reduced where feasible. Both types of nets will be of a similar shape and colour and will be blinded before distribution, see below. Thus, end-users, field workers conducting the physical integrity/survivorship surveys and technicians conducting the bio-efficacy, fabric integrity and insecticide content tests will be blinded to the type of net. A standard questionnaire will be used to collect data from the net user at each follow-up. The processes of the interventions, both for PPF-LLINS and LLINs, will be closely monitored not only for quality but also to document any bias between the clusters and villages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><p>The LLINs and PPF-LLINs distributed will be manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Company (Japan) and are the same as those being used in the main AvecNet Trial, model &#x02018;Extra Family&#x02019; rectangular (180&#x000a0;cm wide &#x000d7; 190&#x000a0;cm long &#x000d7; 150&#x000a0;cm high), except that these will have been manufactured using the improved (new) knitting pattern. The LLINs are WHO recommended and meet WHO specifications (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/whopes/Long_lasting_insecticidal_nets_Aug09.pdf">http://www.who.int/whopes/Long_lasting_insecticidal_nets_Aug09.pdf</ext-link>) with 2% w/w permethrin incorporated into polyethylene fibres. The PPF-LLINs contain 2% w/w permethrin and 1% w/w pyriproxyfen incorporated into polyethylene fibres. Olyset Duo was submitted to WHOPES in August 2012 and has recently completed Phase I testing. These nets will be distributed at the beginning of the main transmission season, at no cost to the recipients. Government Roll Back Malaria information, education and communication procedures will be followed to encourage correct net use and maintenance. The storage and distribution of the LLIN and PPF-LLIN will follow the same procedures as detailed in the main AvecNet Trial Protocol (submitted June 2014). In addition, as this trial will be blinded for the recipients and survey field assistants and laboratory staff, nets will be given sequential unique identity (ID) numbers in the top right hand corner of the label and all mention of &#x02018;Olyset&#x02019; and &#x02018;Olyset Duo&#x02019; removed before the start of net distribution. This will include blinding or replacing bags in which the nets are supplied from the manufacturers. The ID and net type will be noted on specific forms, which will kept in a sealed envelope and locked under the supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI) until the datasets are finalised and locked.</p><p>The date the nets are given to the householder will be written under the unique identifier at the time of donation so that all nets will be numbered with a unique ID number and the date of issue. The recipient&#x02019;s name, net number, date of donation and identity of the compound and household to which they were distributed will be recorded on the clinical report form (CRF) at the time of delivery. The household identification, name of head of household, and global positioning system (GPS) coordinates will be recorded at the baseline demographic survey. Both types of net will be the same design and colour so that study participants will be blinded to the net allocation. However, each net ID will be coded and the location and recipient recorded as indicated above and this information will be collected at each survey to keep track of the identity of each net.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study procedures and evaluations</title><p>The study villages will be enumerated following normal demographic surveillance procedures and compounds mapped before being randomised to net type. It is intended that LLIN distribution will be completed by July/August 2014. Nets selected for monitoring will be identified by their unique ID, date of donation and located by the village, household number, name of the head of household and user name. Net users who have moved, and taken their nets with them, or withdrawn consent will be recorded on the survey form and on the master list and they will be replaced by another net user from the same compound. If an entire compound refuses to participate another compound will be randomly selected from those remaining.</p><p>Surveys will be conducted in village B at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months post-distribution for all endpoints. A standard questionnaire will be used to collect data at each follow-up from the net user, or parent/carer in the case of children. The following information will be recorded: whether the net is hung over the sleeping place at the time of visit, whether it is in storage, being washed, given away or discarded, the method of hanging, whether it can be tucked securely under the mattress all around, and the fabric integrity and the condition of the net. In village B all available nets will be surveyed each time point, in village A only the compounds randomised for sampling at each time point will be surveyed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Net selection and sampling</title><p>Village A will be used to sample nets for bio-efficacy assay and the measurement of insecticide content, as detailed in &#x02018;randomisation and blinding&#x02019; above. Samples will be cut from the nets while they are hanging in the villages. The bio-efficacy assay requires 3 samples of 25&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> from each net (Positions 2, 3 and 4; see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Following the WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] the measurement of insecticide content will made on 5 pieces of 30&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> from each net immediately after distribution (positions 1 to 5 in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and 4 pieces of 30&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> from each net 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months later (positions 2, 3, 4 and 5). The bio-efficacy samples will be wrapped individually in aluminium foil but all the samples taken to measure insecticide content from a single net will be wrapped together. After wrapping in foil the samples will be labelled with the type of assay, the date of sampling and the net ID plus the position sampled (for example, 092&#x02013;3 is net ID 92, cut from position 3).

The results will estimate the total active ingredient content of permethrin on the LLIN and pyriproxyfen and permethrin on PPF-LLIN. The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine will conduct the chemical assay using analytical methods (Collaborative International Pesticides Analytical Council) recommended by WHO for quality control will be used to determine the total content of the active ingredient (unpublished method).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Net survivorship (Sanako, village B)</title><p>To measure survivorship, all nets distributed to study subjects will be recorded. At each time point study nets will be visited and the physical presence of the net recorded. Those hanging over a bed will be considered as being in use. If the net is still present in the household, the investigator will record whether the net is being used for its intended purpose. Nets that have never been used will be recorded but excluded from the main analysis. If the net is no longer in the house, the investigator will determine how it was lost. This will be categorised as follows: loss by giving away the net to others to use either voluntarily (given to friends and relatives or sold) or involuntarily (stolen), and loss due to destruction, discarding or using it for alternative purposes because it is perceived as &#x02018;useless&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These data will allow an estimation of the &#x02018;hanging rate&#x02019; of bednets and allow us to better understand the reasons for net attrition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Fabric integrity (Sanako, village B)</title><p>Fabric integrity will be assessed from the questionnaire by counting the number of holes, including tears in the netting and split seams, by their location on the net and their size. Holes will be classified using the proportionate Hole Index (pHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] into the following categories: good (pHI range 0 to 64), acceptable (pHI 65 to 642) and torn (&#x02265;643).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Environmental measurements</title><p>The indoor temperature and relative humidity will be recorded continuously in 6 randomly-selected houses in each village from 0 to 36&#x000a0;months after net distribution to establish the environmental conditions present in the study houses. Data loggers (Lascar EL-USB-2-LCD Data Logger 80&#x000b0;C 100%RH) will be positioned at 1 metre above the floor on the wall nearest the foot end of the bed. Measurements will be made once an hour and the data will be downloaded every month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Measurement of adverse events</title><p>We consider that any AE arising from either net are highly unlikely. Nonetheless to document the safety of the use of these tools in a community setting, as in the main AvecNet Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], residents will be followed for possible side effects of the PPF-LLIN by surveillance of known asthmatic subjects during the first month post-distribution and pregnancy outcomes will be monitored from antenatal clinic records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>There are no apparent risks to the safety of individuals or communities in this study. Permethrin-treated long-lasting nets have been fully evaluated by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme and approved for vector control (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/whopes/en/">www.who.int/whopes/en/</ext-link>), and the products will be used in compliance with their recommended use and guidelines. The WHO hazard classification of permethrin is Class II, moderately hazardous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The WHO hazard classification for pyriproxyfen is: U, unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Pyriproxyfen is applied to drinking water sources for vector control because of its high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent WHO document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] illustrates the low toxicity of pyriproxyfen for mammals: &#x02018;<italic>pyriproxyfen was not toxic when administered dermally to rats for 21&#x000a0;days at doses of up to 1,000&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight per day.

In this trial, however, the effects of the PPF-LLIN netting are not just on killing mosquitoes, but also causing sterility and reducing the number of offspring produced by female mosquitoes. A 50% reduction in killing when exposed to LLINs nets is likely to impact malaria vector control, as is a 50% decrease in the proportion of gravid females laying eggs after exposure to PPF-LLINs. In order to detect 50% reduction in killing from 80% to 40% and a coefficient of variation between clusters of 0.25, a conservative estimation, one requires 6 compounds with 4 nets, each with 3 netting samples/net/time, in each cluster to demonstrate a statistically significant impact at the 5% level and with 80% power. These calculations are based on the formula of Hayes and Bennett for clustered data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For the 7 time points, one needs to recruit forty two compounds to each study arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Secondary outcome</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Fabric integrity - measured in Sanako, village B</title><p>Since LLIN and PPF-LLIN are manufactured with the same fibre, the same weave and are manufactured by the same company we would not expect to find a difference in fabric integrity between them. However, a control programme manager might consider replacing all the nets in an area if&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25% were of poor condition. To estimate 25% nets in poor condition with a precision of &#x000b1;10%, with a design effect of 1.0 because of cluster sampling, at the 5% level of significance, assuming there are either 500 LLINs or PPF-LLINs, would require 64 nets in each arm at the last sampling time. To allow for a loss of 10% of nets per year and for operational uniformity it is simplest to maintain the study framework of 100 nets in each group to allow for loss to follow-up if net users move away or stop using their nets; in which case, we would sample four nets in twenty-five compounds in each study arm. In addition, direct comparisons will be made between both nets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Tertiary outcomes</title><sec id="FPar3"><title>Net survival - measured in Sanako, village B</title><p>For simplicity and to maximise precision of this measure, all nets will be sampled at 6-monthly time intervals: that is 374 of LLIN and 167 of PPF-LLIN. Direct comparisons of functional LLIN survival will be made between both net types using Kaplan-Meir analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Chemical analysis measured in Dalamba, village A</title><p>A 75% decline in the total content of either permethrin or PPF would cause concern since this is likely to impact the operational effectiveness of PPF-LLIN. The total concentration of PPF and permethrin in the fibres will be compared to the insecticidal activity overtime to examine their relationship. The manufacturers certify that the PPF-LLIN contain 2.0&#x000a0;g permethrin/g fibre, with range 1.5&#x000a0;g to 2.5&#x000a0;g and 1.0&#x000a0;g PPF g/g fibre, with range 0.75 to 1.25&#x000a0;g. In order to detect a 75% reduction in insecticide from 2.0&#x000a0;g to 0.5&#x000a0;g with a coefficient of variation of 0.25 (considered appropriate for factory-produced products where variation between nets is considered small) at the 5% level of significance and 80% power we will require 4 compounds in each study arm with 5 nets tested in each compound (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 nets in each group). Since nets will be damaged during sampling they will be replaced with a new intact net. For this reason it is important that the date at which the net was put in place is recorded directly on each net.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Data handling and record keeping</title><p>Entomological and environmental data will be recorded by field assistants and the clinical data by study nurses on standardised data forms.

Finding alternative strategies to deal with the problem of insecticide resistance is a priority for malaria control and strategies leading to elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since bednets are effective methods of malaria control and have been used in their millions across SSA, insecticide resistance strategies that focus on bednets have much to recommend them. Here, we test a new net with a combination of two active ingredients: permethrin, a pyrethroid, and pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone mimic. Unlike permethrin, the principal mode of action of pyriproxyfen is not to kill mosquitoes, but to reduce their fecundity and fertility following a blood meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Ideally, the new combination must be effective for several years in order for it to be a useful public health intervention and to be recommended by WHOPES. In this trial we follow the recent recommendations made by WHOPES for assessing the durability of LLINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and describe them in a protocol for others to adapt. Net durability will be assessed using a number of criteria. Specifically, this includes measuring the bio-efficacy and chemical content in the nets over time in one village, as well as the net survivorship and fabric integrity in a separate nearby village. Although we think it unlikely that there will be any adverse reactions to the new net containing pyriproxyfen we will record any AE in asthmatics and pregnant women.</p><p>The chemical measurement with time will give an indication of the longevity of the pyrethroid and pyriproxyfen in polyethylene netting in a typical rural village setting and the bioefficacy measures will give an indication of the activity of these compounds on the surface of the netting. The study is being run for 3&#x000a0;years as this is the current estimation of time between large-scale donation campaigns adopted by WHO and donor agencies, which balances expected net survival time and cost.</p><p>The nets used in the current study are of polyethylene, which was selected as the chemicals are incorporated into the fibres, which increases the duration for which pyrethroid is available and effective on the surface of the fibres. However, the duration of the pyriproxyfen is not known. The bio-efficacy measurements on pyriproxyfen include measurement of survival and fecundity of pyrethroid resistant <italic>An. gambiae s.s.</italic> after exposure to both the pyrethroid only net and that with pyriproxyfen over time. The effect of washing, in a village setting, on insecticide durability will also be examined.</p><p>If we can demonstrate in our main trial that large-scale use of the PPF-LLIN net reduces clinical malaria in children and in this trial that the nets are durable, remaining effective for a number of years in an area with pyrethroid-resistant vectors, then the results of these trials will be of interest to malaria control programmes in Burkina Faso and other parts of SSA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec44"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_700_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
