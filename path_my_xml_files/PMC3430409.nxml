The sample consisted of 85 married patients diagnosed with primary PE according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Each patient underwent diagnostic evaluation by one trained psychiatrist, using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Each patient was evaluated by researchers to exclude the organic sexual dysfunctions. The patients were randomly assigned in to two groups: group 1 consisting of 42 patients receiving placebo, and group 2 consisting of 43 patients receiving 540 mg herbal vigRX for a 4-week treatment course. The effects of the drug on the ejaculatory function in each group were assessed by the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), and the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE) before and at the end of the treatment course. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (15th version).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean IELT increased 22.4 and 32.0 seconds in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively after the treatment course. The mean IELT differences between the two groups was not significant. The mean CIPE score increased 2.40 and 4.37 in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively. The mean CIPE score differences between the two groups was not significant.No side effect was reported by the subjects in neither groups during the treatment course.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the improvement in IELT and CIPE scores in the herbal vigRX group was more than the placebo group, this difference was not statistically significant. The increasing of IELT and CIPE score in the placebo group may be due to the placebo effects. Further studies with higher vigRX doses, greater sample size and longer treatment courses are warranted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ejaculation</kwd><kwd>Herbal medicine</kwd><kwd>Sexual dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The most common male sexual disorder[1-2] is premature ejaculation (PE), also referred to as early ejaculation (EE) or rapid ejaculation (RE), and affects 30%-40% of sexually active men, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>) perhaps as many as 75% of men at some points in their lives.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) PE has been defined as uncontrolled ejaculation with the essential feature of recurrent or persistent orgasm with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or after penetration and before the person desires it.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>)
</p><p>Different treatment approaches have been used for the treatment of PE including local anaesthetic sprays, propranolol and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>).</p><p>Despite the increasing availability of effective conventional medical treatments, plant-derived and herbal remedies continue to provide a popular alternative for men and women seeking to improve their sex life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). The benefits of herbal and other natural products (dietary supplements) are increasingly cited in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) which evolved out of the physiology and health, was a reflection of the processes observed in natural health. Herbal formulas constitute an important aspect of TCM treatment. However, understanding how herbs interact with one another in the context of complex herbal formulation is unclear from the western scientific perspective.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>) Nevertheless, the efficacy of most herbal agents in treating sexual problems remains uncertain. Therapists and consumers alike would benefit from an increased understanding of commonly used herbal agents on the market, their purported or supported effects, and their potential side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). VigRX is a sexual complementary which containing aphrodisiac herbal concentrates from China, Europe and South America that stimulate sexual activity. VigRX ingredients includes: Epimedium Leaf Extract [20:1] 15mg, Cuscuta Seed Extract [4:1] 25mg, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf 100mg, Asian Ginseng Root 100mg, Saw Palmetto Berry-Fructus Serenoae 100mg, Muira Pauma Bark Extract [4:1] 50mg, Catuaba Bark Extract [4:1] 50mg, Hawthorn Berry-Fructus Crataegi 100mg. VigRX is recommended for various sexual dysfunctions including PE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>) We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy and probable side effects of this supplement on PE.</p><sec id="S0005"><title>Materials and Method</title><p>This is a randomized double blind fixed dose study which conducted in Roozbeh Psychiatry Hospital in Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) during July 2007 to March 2009. Ninety nine married male patients were studied. They applied to TUMS Departments of Psychiatry and Urology and were diagnosed with primary PE according to DSM-IV-TR. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). After complete description of the study to the volunteers, the written informed consent including necessary details of the study was obtained from each patient. Each patient underwent a diagnostic evaluation by one trained psychiatrist using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. To exclude organic sexual dysfunctions, each patient was evaluated by researchers. Exclusion criteria were as follows: the presence of erectile dysfunction and inhibited male orgasm, a severe physical or mental illness, the history of alcohol and any substance abuse or dependence. The patients were randomly assigned in two groups: group 1 consisting of 48 patients, and group 2 consisting of 51 patients in a double-blind design. In group 1, the patients received one placebo capsule; and the patients in group 2 received one capsule (540mg) of vigRX for a four week treatment course. The use of concomitant medications was prohibited. The intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was defined as the duration between vaginal intromission and ejaculation.All of the subjects were asked to determine the intravaginal ejaculation latency time before initiating and after the 4-week -treatment period via a chronometer. The patients and their wives were encouraged to engage in coitus at least twice a week and record intravaginal ejaculation latency time. All patients and their partners were individually interviewed at the beginning of the study and at the end of the treatment period.</p><p>All the patients were asked to complete the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>) questionnaire before and after the treatment period. Statistical analysis has done by using SPSS software (15<sup>th</sup> version). Independent sample T-test was performed in order to analyzing our data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0006"><title>Results</title><p>Fourteen patients dropped out of the study during the presence of any endocrinological state or taking any psychotropic medications within the last 2 weeks prior to the study. All the patients were heterosexual. The patients who completed the treatment course, 42 patients were in group 1 (placebo), and 43 in group 2 (vigRX). The mean age, mean IELT and mean CIPE score in both groups were obtained. The baseline data were compared in the two groups and was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).
