Despite common assumptions that young children are naturally active, evidence shows that they are insufficiently active for health and developmental benefits. Exploring strategies to increase physical activity in young children is a public health and research priority.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>
<italic>Jump Start</italic> is a multi-component, multi-setting PA and gross motor skill intervention for young children aged 3&#x02013;5 years in disadvantaged areas of New South Wales, Australia. The intervention will be evaluated using a two-arm, parallel group, randomised cluster trial. The <italic>Jump Start</italic> protocol was based on Social Cognitive Theory and includes five components: a structured gross motor skill lesson (Jump In); unstructured outdoor PA and gross motor skill time (Jump Out); energy breaks (Jump Up); activities connecting movement to learning experiences (Jump Through); and a home-based family component to promote PA and gross motor skill (Jump Home). Early childhood education and care centres will be demographically matched and randomised to <italic>Jump Start</italic> (intervention) or usual practice (comparison) group. The intervention group receive <italic>Jump Start</italic> professional development, program resources, monthly newsletters and ongoing intervention support. Outcomes include change in total PA (accelerometers) within centre hours, gross motor skill development (Test of Gross Motor Development-2), weight status (body mass index), bone strength (Sunlight MiniOmni Ultrasound Bone Sonometer), self-regulation (Heads-Toes-Knees-Shoulders, executive function tasks, and proxy-report Temperament and Approaches to learning scales), and educator and parent self-efficacy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative process evaluation and a cost-effectiveness evaluation will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention is a unique program to address low levels of PA and gross motor skill proficiency, and support healthy lifestyle behaviours among young children in disadvantaged communities. If shown to be efficacious, the <italic>Jump Start</italic> approach can be expected to have implications for early childhood education and care policies and practices, and ultimately a positive effect on the health and development across the life course.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry No: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12614000597695&#x00026;isBasic=True">ACTRN12614000597695</ext-link>, first received: June 5, 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Preschool</kwd><kwd>Early years</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Motor skill</kwd><kwd>Professional development</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council (AU)</institution></funding-source><award-id>APP1062433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okely</surname><given-names>Anthony D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The early years (defined here as the first five years of life) are a critical time for the development of lifetime healthy behaviours, including physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Regular participation in light physical activity (LPA) and moderate- to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the early years has been shown to help young children maintain a healthy body weight, as well as substantially improve motor development, bone health, psychosocial health and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, a number of countries, including Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have developed activity guidelines specifically for children under the age of five years, with most recommending that children should engage in at least 180&#x000a0;min in any activity daily, including both LPA and MVPA, for general health and developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. International studies have reported variations in the percentage of young children meeting these guidelines, with approximately 5&#x000a0;% of Australian young children, 84&#x000a0;% of Canadian young children and 100&#x000a0;% of UK children meeting these guidelines. Variation in the estimates of daily physical activity can partly be attributed to differences in measurement and data processing protocols, and sampling differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite these international variations, there is still a consensus for a need to explore strategies to increase and maintain the number of young children who are sufficiently active for health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence is emerging to show that engagement in physical activity during the early years has critical health and developmental implications that can persist across the life course. It has been shown that engaging in physical activity stimulates neurocognitive processes and promotes children&#x02019;s capacity to regulate their behavioural actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, motor skill development has been shown to be a consistent correlate of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and motor skill proficiency can open up opportunities to be active across a range of settings during the early years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A recent systematic review has also shown the benefits of physical activity on weight status with four out of seven studies showing that children who were more active at age 5, had smaller gains in adiposity over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Engaging in at least 30&#x000a0;min of MVPA a day at age 5 can significantly increase children&#x02019;s bone strength at ages 8 and 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given the small but growing body of current scientific evidence of the health benefits of physical activity for young children, promotion of physical activity during the early years needs to be a research priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recent attention has focused on Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) settings as potential locations for reaching and delivering physical activity interventions for promotion of health and developmental outcomes, particularly those serving families in disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), almost all OECD countries have adopted quality curriculum standards and frameworks for children aged three years and up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These quality standards and frameworks highlight the need to provide physical activity opportunities for children while they are attending ECEC settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite these quality requirements, children accumulate relatively little physical activity in ECEC settings with children spending on average between 6.2 to 15&#x000a0;% of their ECEC day engaged in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which is well below the recommended 25&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that lack of sufficient training in physical activity promotion among early childhood educators, a poor balance between structured and unstructured activity, a lack of equipment and resources and limited or no physical activity practices and policies may be contributing to the low activity levels of children at ECEC centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>To date, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity levels of young children in ECEC settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A recent systematic review conducted by Ward et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] identified 19 studies which reported physical activity interventions in ECEC settings with varied levels of effectiveness. Through the evaluation of these studies, Ward et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] provided recommendations for future ECEC-based interventions, including using a formal curriculum on a regular basis to implement structured physical activity, providing a balance between structured and unstructured physical activity opportunities (such as free or self-directed play), providing sufficient amounts of equipment, and providing regular training for educators in how to provide structured physical activity (particularly around integrating physical activity into the academic curriculum). Due to the infancy of ECEC-based physical activity intervention research, there is a need for additional evidence and evaluation of potential effective strategies in these settings. Therefore, this paper provides a description of the protocols and rationale for the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention, a randomised controlled trial implemented in ECEC settings in Australia.</p><p>The primary hypothesis is that at post-intervention (18-months), children in ECEC centres allocated to the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention will significantly increase total physical activity (i.e. light, moderate, and vigorous intensity physical activity (LMVPA)) while at the ECEC centre compared to children in centres allocated to the usual practice comparison group. The secondary aims are to: (1) examine the relative effects of the intervention on other health and developmental outcomes, including MVPA, sedentary time, self-regulation, weight status, bone strength, and gross motor skills; and (2) explore the potential mediating and moderating variables, cost-effectiveness and implications for public policy decision making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The <italic>Jump Start</italic> study is a two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) using a nested-cohort design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The development of the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention was informed by formative research, involving two ECEC parent organisations and ECEC educators employed by those organisations. The two ECEC parent organisations have collaborated on several of the <italic>Jump Start</italic> pilot studies and provided input into the intervention components and their implementation. Educator professional development and training around physical activity promotion and gross motor development, and focusing on disadvantaged communities were identified by all parties as the highest priorities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3743_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>The <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention has been designed using the recommended framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This design enables the assessment of intervention effects at 6- and 18-month follow-up when the children assessed at baseline will still be attending the ECEC centre (i.e., not transitioned to primary school). Assessments took place at baseline (February-June 2015), 6-months (August-December 2015) and will be repeated at 18-months (August&#x02013;December 2016). The primary outcome is change in total physical activity (LMVPA) while at the ECEC centre over the 18-month study period.</p><p>ECEC centres were randomised to either the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention or usual practice comparison group. The <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention is a multi-component, multi-setting approach that combines evidence-based intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] targeting multiple influences on physical activity among preschoolers (children aged 3&#x02013;5 years) living in disadvantaged areas of New South Wales (NSW). It consists of five main components: a structured gross motor lesson (Jump In); unstructured outdoor physical activity and gross motor time (Jump Out); energy breaks (Jump Up); activities connecting movement to learning experiences (Jump Through); and a home-based family component to promote physical activity and gross motor development (Jump Home). These components have previously been evaluated independently and have shown high feasibility and potential efficacy across a number of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] but have yet to be tested as a comprehensive approach within ECEC settings.</p><p>The trial is being conducted in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. All study procedures have been approved by the University of Wollongong Human Research Ethics Committee (HE14/137) and registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000597695).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participant recruitment and eligibility criteria</title><p>The sampling frame comprised ECEC centres located in areas of disadvantage in NSW, Australia, according to the area location indices for socio-economic disadvantage (SEIFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Centres were eligible if they were located in an area with a SEIFA index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage of less than or equal to 5 (lowest 50&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and had a minimum enrolment of five eligible consenting children. From the 74 eligible ECEC centres, 57 centres were approached and 44 centres were successfully recruited. One centre withdrew from the study due to not having the minimum number of consenting children (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3).</p><p>Children were eligible to participate in the evaluation components of the study if they were 3&#x000a0;years old, or turning 3 before the start of the intervention; attended at least 2&#x000a0;days a week at a participating ECEC centre; and were not likely to be enrolled in primary school the following year. All parents/caregivers of eligible children received a participant information sheet and a URL YouTube link to a recruitment video and were invited to provide written consent to participate. All educators working with 3&#x000a0;year olds in the ECEC centres were also invited to take part in the study and provide written consent to participation. Educators who are employed in centre-based ECEC services across Australia, and who are responsible for a group of children, are required by national regulations to hold at least a 12-month vocational qualification to work with children or be enrolled to complete such a vocational qualification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Recruitment began in January 2015 and was completed in June 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Power and sample size</title><p>Sample size and power estimates were based on the formula proposed by Murray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to adjust for a clustered (nested) cohort design. It is recommended that sample size estimates be based on the <italic>a priori</italic> minimum acceptable difference between groups to be considered meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Based on our experience and the changes observed in our pilot studies for accelerometer-based physical activity, we estimated this minimum acceptable difference to be 45 mins/day of total physical activity, which translates to an effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s d) of 0.4. The 6-month Jump Start pilot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] resulted in a Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4 for counts per min, and the 6-month Jump Start translational pilot resulted in a Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39 for percentage of time spent in LPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We therefore concluded that achieving an effect size&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.4 was realistic and our multi-component intervention strategies, with an increased intervention length and intensity compared to our pilot studies, would be expected to produce an effect size similar to or greater than these studies. For a two-tailed alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.01&#x02013;0.05 our proposed sample size of 608 participants (304 per group) provides approximately 86&#x000a0;% power to detect an intervention effect of 0.4 or greater for the ICC range proposed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following recruitment and baseline testing, centres were pair-matched according to the number of educators and children in attendance, geographical location and Indigenous status of the centre. Centres within each pair were then randomised to the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention or usual practice comparison group by a statistician, not involved in the recruitment or intervention delivery, using a concealed computerised random number generator. The statistician communicated the allocation to the Project Manager, who informed each ECEC centre. Recruitment and baseline assessments were conducted prior to randomisation by trained data collectors blinded to group allocation. The 18-month assessments will also be conducted by trained data collectors blinded to group allocation. To ensure all data collectors remain blinded during the assessment periods, a number of strategies have been put in place to minimise the risk of bias on treatment effect. All data collectors are blinded to study outcomes and hypotheses, and conduct assessments either in the intervention centres only or the usual practice comparison centres only. Educators have been asked not to discuss group allocation with data collectors. In addition, the primary outcome measure and methods, and where possible secondary outcome measurement methods, have been chosen to be as objective as possible in minimising potential for bias. Data collectors are only required to fit a monitor to participants for physical activity assessment, and an external trained assessor, blinded to group allocation, will code videos of the gross motor skills assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Theoretical framework for the intervention</title><p>The <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention is based on Bandura&#x02019;s Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which has been used extensively in behaviour change interventions. Social Cognitive Theory posits that behaviour is learned, modified and sustained through the interplay of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. The intervention focuses on each factor and how they influence participation in physical activity. To address personal factors, the intervention seeks to increase the emphasis and valuing of children&#x02019;s physical activity and motor skill development by ECEC educators and parents. To address behavioural factors, there will be a focus on developmentally appropriate activities that build behavioural and motor skills. Educators and parents will have some choice about how they implement some of the components, giving them ownership (control) over children&#x02019;s learning and the scheduling of intervention sessions at the ECEC centre. The intervention will provide opportunities for educators to set developmentally appropriate mini-goals and provide a sense of achievement. Behavioural skills include goal-setting and self-monitoring of implementation by the educators and parents. Environmental factors will be addressed at both social and physical levels. The social level will incorporate the aforementioned values systems and interaction skills, and will include modifying existing policies and schedules, and using educators to model and reinforce positive attitudes towards physical activity and correct techniques for performing the motor skills. At a physical level, strategies include increasing access and availability to resources that will promote motor development and physical activity in structured and unstructured sessions.</p><p>The intervention focuses on the four processes suggested by Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to enhance behaviour change (attention, retention, production and motivation). All components of the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention have been designed to address all four by: (a) including stimulus material and specific lesson activities that will engage and direct the attention of the educators, parents and children; (b) matching their cognitive and behavioural skill levels in content and pedagogy, and providing opportunities to enhance mastery experiences; (c) including incentives that are relevant, attractive and specified before the learning activities; and (d) emphasising perceived choice and control, as well as challenge, curiosity and mastery through activities that enhance intrinsic motivation, greater persistence, and higher satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The intervention has been designed to target Social Cognitive Theory mediators which have been identified as mechanisms of behaviour change in physical activity interventions among educators and young children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Jump start intervention development</title><p>An intervention mapping exercise was conducted using the &#x0201c;working backwards&#x0201d; process developed by Robinson and reported in previous interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. An example of this process for the Jump Out component of the intervention is found in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Briefly, this involves identifying the ultimate goal, mapping all the potential mediating pathways (referred to as Major and Sub-categories in the Figure), and identifying the individual behaviours at the origin of each causal chain of events. Following this, a theoretical framework is applied to develop the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention (in this case, Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]). Specifically, principles of Social Cognitive Theory were applied to generate potential intervention strategies (see far left-hand column in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) for enhancing a specific aspect of the theory. For example, for increasing the value that educators place on gross motor skills and physical activity in young children in their Centre, a strategy would be to show educators how the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention links to important compliance and curriculum documents such as the Early Years Learning Framework and National Quality Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Included in this step is anticipating potential barriers educators may encounter and strategies they could adopt to overcome these barriers. The next step was to evaluate the completed intervention plan (as per Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) to check if opportunities were provided for the four key learning processes of attention, retention, production and motivation in every element of the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention. We also applied additional principles of intrinsic motivation developed by Lepper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], including competence, challenge, curiosity, control, context, cooperation and competition (referred to as the 7C&#x02019;s by Robinson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]), to ensure the messages and activities promoted intrinsic motivation of the targeted behaviours.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intervention mapping diagram for the Jump Out component of the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention.

Through the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention, we expect to increase total physical activity by a minimum of 45&#x000a0;min/day, 20&#x000a0;min of which will be MVPA. We expect that large and meaningful benefits will flow into other areas of health and development, as evidence shows increases of this magnitude are associated with significant declines in adiposity and significant increases in bone health at ages 8 and 11&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This approach may also improve behavioural self-regulation skills in this age group, which are better predictors of school readiness than IQ or entry-level literacy or numeracy skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Jump Start</italic> will also enhance the quality of early childhood education and care at a crucial time in children&#x02019;s lives when the architecture of the developing brain is most open to the influences of experiences and when health inequality gaps are smallest. Benefits also accrue for parents and educators. <italic>Jump Start</italic> focuses on capacity building and enhancing the knowledge and self-efficacy of all participating ECEC educators in teaching gross motor skills and integrating physical activity into daily routines through targeted professional learning and on-going support.</p><p>In addition, the <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention, if effective in improving physical activity and educational outcomes of disadvantaged children, can reduce social system costs and benefit the economy. While $1 invested in effective education has shown a long term return of $1.50&#x02013;$3 across populations, a benefit ratio for $1 of effective education in disadvantaged children (the target population of this intervention) has been estimated at $17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. If children enter primary school with greater skills or learning in our focus areas (motor development, physical activity, behavioural self-regulation) they are less likely to repeat grades or drop out of school, and more likely to enrol in post-secondary education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Jump Start</italic> intervention is a unique program to address low levels of physical activity and gross motor skill proficiency, and support healthy lifestyle behaviours among young children in disadvantaged communities. If shown to be efficacious, the <italic>Jump Start</italic> approach can be expected to have implications for ECEC policies and practices, and ultimately a positive effect on the health and development across the life course.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ATSI</term><def><p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CALD</term><def><p>Cultural and linguistic diversity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECEC</term><def><p>Early childhood education and care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EYLF</term><def><p>Early years learning framework</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMS</term><def><p>Gross motor skills</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intraclass correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMVPA</term><def><p>Light-moderate-vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate-vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NQS</term><def><p>National quality standards</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OECD</term><def><p>Organisation for economic co-operation and development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised cluster trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEIFA</term><def><p>Socio-economic indexes for areas</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Socioeconomic status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOS</term><def><p>Speed of sound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGMD-2</term><def><p>Test of gross motor development</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the ECEC organisations, staff and families who are participating in the study.</p><sec id="FPar11"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is supported by a National health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant (2014&#x02013;2017; ID1062433).
