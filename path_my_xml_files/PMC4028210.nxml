Unsurprisingly, disease severity is the most reliable predictor of institutionalization and care burden <xref rid="pone.0097577-Perri1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Luppa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is suggested that physical activity is a treatment modality which may have positive effects on dementia patients' cognitive and physical function and therefore could favorably influence the disease progression in institutionalized patients with dementia <xref rid="pone.0097577-Blankevoort1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Heyn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, previous exercise studies with dementia patients focused mainly on aerobic-only training and the results are inconsistent and less convincing compared with studies that included healthy older subjects <xref rid="pone.0097577-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In those studies with healthy older subjects a combination of aerobic and strength training was most effective in improving memory and executive function (e.g. inhibition, planning, impulse control, set-shifting) <xref rid="pone.0097577-Colcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-LiuAmbrose1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, the emerging hypothesis is that a combined aerobic and strength exercise program for dementia patients may also be effective to improve memory and executive function.</p><p>Beneficial effects of a combined aerobic and strength training program on cognitive function may emanate from the complementariness between the neurobiological and physiological mechanisms underlying the individual exercise programs. Aerobic and strength training each can positively affect the levels of insulin like growth factor-1 and brain derived neurotrophine factors <xref rid="pone.0097577-LiuAmbrose1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These proteins mediate neuronal cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, strength training may specifically lower the levels of the neurotoxic homocysteine, which is related to improved cognition <xref rid="pone.0097577-LiuAmbrose1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, strength training improves critical elements of physical function, such as mobility and balance <xref rid="pone.0097577-LaRoche1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Krist1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The strength training effect could in turn allow patients to perform the aerobic exercise component at a higher intensity. Aerobic training at a moderate to high intensity level can improve cerebral blood flow <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nation1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a factor known to mediate effects on cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0097577-Wiesmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Altogether, there is a reasonably strong potential that a combination of aerobic and strength training could improve cognitive and physical function in patients with dementia.</p><p>A combined program of aerobic and strength activities was found feasible and effective to improve global cognitive and motor function in community dwelling patients with mild dementia <xref rid="pone.0097577-Steinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Vreugdenhil1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In contrast to community dwelling patients, institutionalized patients with dementia are older and physically, cognitively, socially, and psychologically more vulnerable <xref rid="pone.0097577-Luppa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, an exercise program may be less feasible for this specific patient group. Although both aerobic and strength training studies with institutionalized dementia patients are available, there is no data available of how feasibility is affected by a complexity of alternating strength training with aerobic training. This complexity is important because dementia patients may perceive variation or change in activities and environment as upsetting or disruptive in daily-life routine, causing stress and leading to not attending to activities, such as exercise <xref rid="pone.0097577-Hinrichsen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Last, the session-frequency in previous studies ranged between 1&#x02013;7 sessions per week <xref rid="pone.0097577-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> but no extensive data on adherence rates was reported in these studies. Therefore, it remains unclear at what frequency institutionalized dementia patients are able and/or willing to exercise, which is important because the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines recommend 3&#x02013;5 times weekly exercise at a moderate to high intensity level, with alternating aerobic and strength training, to improve physical fitness <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. All in all, prior to investigate any potential effects of high frequency combined exercise in a frail institutionalized moderate-severe dementia population, it is required to first study the feasibility of such a training program (e.g. 5 sessions per week, alternating aerobic with strength training). Here we define an intervention feasible when adherence to the program is high (&#x0003e;75%), the number of drop-outs is low (&#x0003c;20%), there are no adverse events, and participants complete the program according to protocol.</p><p>Taken together, the purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility of a combined aerobic and strength training program and to perform an exploratory analysis concerning the effects of such an exercise program on cognitive and physical function in institutionalized patients with dementia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of VU Amsterdam, The Netherlands approved the research protocol according to the principles expressed by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Between March 2010 and October 2010, a geriatrician recruited all of the participants from a psychogeriatric ward in a nursing home in Haren, the Netherlands (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;78). The inclusion criteria were as follows: 70 years or older, a diagnosis of dementia, not wheelchair bound, and able to walk independently ten meters with or without a walking aid. All participants and their relatives were fully informed about the details of the study, including the risks, time commitment, and the possibility to be assigned to a combined aerobic and strength exercise group (EG) or a social visits group (SG). Each patient's legal representative gave written consent.</p><p>Because there are no previous studies on the feasibility of subjecting institutionalized patients with dementia residing in a psychogeriatric ward to a combined aerobic and strength training program, first we had to ascertain the feasibility that such a program can be executed at all in this specific setting with this specific population. Therefore, phase 1 of the study determined feasibility. The aim of phase 2 was to explore the effects of the program on cognitive and physical function and compare these effects to a social visits group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097577-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of patient recruitment.</p><fig id="pone-0097577-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0097577.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the study.</title><p>Phase 1 (left side) determined feasibility by including a combined exercise group.

Then, in phase 2 (August 2010&#x02013;October, 2010), the same geriatrician screened the remaining other four wards (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;43) from the same nursing home, of whom 19 were enrolled and 18 eventually participated in the SG.</p><p>The cognitive and physical assessments for all participants took place at baseline (T0) and after an intervention period of six weeks (T1). A trained research assistant, blinded for the intervention, administrated the cognitive and physical function tests at T0 and T1. The research assistant conducted the measurements at the same time of the day for a given patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Exercise and social visit sessions were provided in an individually supervised format for a period of six weeks. An individually supervised format was chosen because dementia is related to behavioral problems, such as apathy and agitation and this may cause inactivating thoughts and difficulties in initiating movement <xref rid="pone.0097577-Perri1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For safety reasons, institutionalized patients who live in a closed ward are required to have personal guidance for activities outside the ward. Each participant received five, 30-minute-long sessions during each of the six weeks. Four allocated trained research assistants delivered the two intervention programs and kept a log on the indices of feasibility.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Exercise group</title><p>Each week, the EG participated in three walking sessions and two strength training sessions. Walking sessions took place in the corridors of the nursing home or on paved outdoor walking paths near the nursing home. In accordance with ACSM guidelines for aerobic activity, our aim was to offer walking sessions at a moderate to high intensity level <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. If a participant requested rest, an appropriate rest period was included in the 30-minute-long session. As soon as patients recovered, walking was resumed. The trainer monitored the intensity-level of the walks by asking the patients rate of perceived exertion (RPE). RPE was measured at the end of each session. The goal was to reach RPE-scores between 12&#x02013;15 (e.g. &#x02018;somewhat hard&#x02019; - &#x02018;hard&#x02019;, maximum score 20) <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In accordance with ACSM guidelines for strength training, the EG participated in two strength training sessions per week. These sessions were conducted in the patient's personal room on two non-consecutive days with at least 48 h between sessions <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Strength exercises focused on lower-limb strengthening to activate large muscle groups known to contribute to gait speed, balance, and mobility <xref rid="pone.0097577-Krist1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The exercises were as follows: (1) seated knee extension, (2) plantar flexion through toe raises, while holding both hands of the trainer, (3) hip abduction by moving the straight leg sideways, while standing behind and holding on to a chair, and (4) hip extension by moving the straight leg backwards, while standing behind and holding on to a chair. An exercise program targeting the same muscle groups was successful in improving mobility and leg strength in community dwelling older adults, recovering from a hip fracture <xref rid="pone.0097577-Mangione1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Exercise intensity increased gradually by increasing the number of repetitions and by affixing small weights to the ankle. In accordance with ACSM guidelines for strength training, our aim was to offer a moderate to hard intensity strength exercise program at an RPE of 12&#x02013;15 (e.g. &#x02018;somewhat hard&#x02019; - &#x02018;hard&#x02019;) <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To minimize the chance for an injury, overload, and drop-out, all participants started with three sets of 8 repetitions for each leg without weights. When an exercise was performed with ease and according to protocol as judged by the trainer (RPE&#x0003c;12 e.g. fairly light), the number of repetitions was increased to 10 in the next session, and 12 thereafter. When a participant was able to correctly perform 12 repetitions without weights, at an RPE&#x0003c;12, 0.5 kg was attached to the ankle. After the weight was attached, patients performed eight repetitions and progressed as described before. The trainers increased the weights from 0 kg to a maximum of 1.5 kg in 0.5 kg increments to reach RPE 12&#x02013;15. For plantar flexion, the number of repetitions increased in increments of 2 with each session, to a maximum of 30 repetitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Social group</title><p>The SG received individualized social visits for the same duration and frequency as the EG. Social engagement may have a positive effect on cognitive function in patients with dementia <xref rid="pone.0097577-Bassuk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, to control for social engagement, activities during social visits were small talk while sitting in a chair.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Feasibility</title><p>We obtained the recruitment rate at the psychogeriatric ward of one nursing home for participating in the combined exercise program.

Tests used in this study were based on a review <xref rid="pone.0097577-Bossers1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and a study-protocol <xref rid="pone.0097577-Volkers1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) measures the global level of cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0097577-Folstein1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Version A was used. Five cards with faces were shown to the participant, each for five seconds. After ten minutes, ten cards were presented; five cards were shown before and five cards presented new faces. The participant had to recognize if a face was shown before or not. The total score is the number of correct answers minus the number of incorrect answers. Scores ranged between &#x02212;10 and +10. A higher score represented a better performance.</p><p>Pictures Recognition Test, as a subtest of the RBMT, measures visual long term memory/attention <xref rid="pone.0097577-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The versions A + B were combined. Ten cards with objects were presented, each card for five seconds. After ten minutes, twenty cards were presented; ten were shown before and ten cards presented new objects. The participant had to recognize if an object was shown before or not. The total score was the number of correct answers minus the number of incorrect answers. Scores ranged between &#x02212;20 and +20. A higher score represented a better performance.</p><p>Visual Memory Span Forward and Backward, as a subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R), consisted of printed squares on a card <xref rid="pone.0097577-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Participants were instructed to repeat a number of tapping sequences that became longer with each trial. The test consisted of a forward and backward condition. The forward condition measured attention and immediate visual memory. The backward condition measured attention and visual working memory, an executive function. Scores of both sub-tests ranged between 0&#x02013;14. A higher score represented better performance.</p><p>Digit Span Test Forward and Backward are subtests from the WMS-R <xref rid="pone.0097577-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The forward condition consists of increasingly long sequences of orally presented numbers at a rate of one digit per second. Participants were asked to repeat the exact same sequence of numbers immediately. In the backward condition participants were asked to repeat the sequence in reverse order. It is suggested that the forward condition taps more into the short-term memory and the backward condition more into working memory, an executive function. Each condition ends when a participant fails to recall two strings of the same length or repeated an eight-digit sequence correctly. The scores for both conditions range between 0&#x02013;21.</p><p>8-Words Test Direct-Recall and Recognition is a list-learning test for people with memory problems <xref rid="pone.0097577-Lindeboom1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Eight words were orally presented five times in a row. Every time, directly after presenting the words, participants were asked to repeat as many words as possible. The first outcome measure was the total number of correct words over five trials (Direct-Recall score 0&#x02013;40). After 15 minutes the examiner orally presents 16 words among which eight words presented in the direct-recall phase and eight new words. The participant had to recognize if a word was presented before (Recognition score 0&#x02013;16).</p><p>Verbal Fluency Test evaluated executive function <xref rid="pone.0097577-Brucki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

After a few minutes, they were asked to name as many examples of &#x02018;professions&#x02019; in one minute. The outcome measure was the total number of animals and professions.</p><p>Picture Completion Test, as a sub-test of the Groningen Intelligence Test, measures visual perception and alertness to detail (executive function). During the test, incomplete drawn figures were presented <xref rid="pone.0097577-Luteijn1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Participants were instructed to describe the picture as a whole. The pictures increased in difficulty as the test progressed. With five false answers in a row the test was stopped. Scores ranged from 0&#x02013;20, with one point for each correct answer.</p><p>Stroop Task consisted of three subtasks <xref rid="pone.0097577-Hammes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Each task was performed as quickly as possible over a timed period of 45 seconds. Card 1 presented black-printed words &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;green&#x02019;, &#x02018;blue&#x02019;, and &#x02018;yellow&#x02019;. Participants were instructed to read as many words as possible in the right order (left to right, top to bottom). Card 2 presented solid colored patched blocks which were red, green, blue, and yellow. As many of these colors needed to be named in the right order. Finally, Card 3 presented colored words. That is, each word was printed in a different color (i.e. the word &#x02018;blue&#x02019; printed in yellow ink). The ink-color needed to be named and the highly provocative word-reading response needed to be inhibited. The final score was Card 2 minus Card 3.

Possible group differences at baseline between EG and SG were analyzed for personal characteristics as well as cognitive and physical outcomes using Mann-Whitney or Fisher's tests. Difference scores between posttest (T1) and pretest (T0) for the EG and SG were calculated followed by Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the difference scores between EG and SG. The two-sided level of significance for global cognitive function was set at p&#x0003c;.05. To correct for alpha-inflation we used Bonferroni corrected alpha values for the cognitive domains verbal memory (p&#x0003c;.05/3 tests&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.017), visual attention (p&#x0003c;.05/3 tests&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.017), and executive function (p&#x0003c;.05/5 tests&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.010). The level of significance for the physical domain walking endurance was set at p&#x0003c;.05, lower limb strength at p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.025 (p&#x0003c;.05/2 tests), mobility at p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.025 (p&#x0003c;.05/2 tests), and balance at p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.012 (p &#x0003c;0.05/3 tests). To explore the relation between cognitive change and physical change in the total study population, we used Spearman's correlations between the difference scores of the cognitive and physical tests.

Because this was a pilot study using small sample sizes, the results should be considered preliminary and viewed with caution. Still, the current results could serve as a basis for future larger randomized clinical trials.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Feasibility</title><p>The individually supervised format of administering the intervention contributed to feasibility. We defined that an exercise program was feasible if the adherence rate was high (&#x0003e;75%), the number of drop outs low (&#x0003c;20%), no adverse events occurred, and the exercise program was performed according to protocol. We consider the mean adherence rate of 84% high and encouraging for future studies. Our rate was 31% higher than the mean adherence in a 12-month group-walking exercise program using patients with mild cognitive impairment <xref rid="pone.0097577-Tak1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and 9% higher than a one-on-one 12-week home-based combined exercise program in a similar patient group <xref rid="pone.0097577-Steinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The much shorter intervention period compared with the other studies could explain our substantially higher adherence rate. Therefore, a longer duration exercise program is needed to further study the adherence on a longer term.</p><p>All patients were able to perform the aerobic part of the training program according to protocol and 15 out of 17 patients performed the strength part of the training program according to protocol. A factor that contributed to the high program adherence was that all patients started the training program at a generally low-intensity, working their way up to higher intensity levels as the program progressed. The progressive training character, with a low baseline training intensity, may have contributed to higher adherence rates. As a result, no major adverse events other than sore leg muscles, a feeling of exertion, and no program related drop out occurred. Furthermore, progressive training is important because adherence rate in institutionalized patients with dementia is negatively affected by low self-efficacy and low external locus of control <xref rid="pone.0097577-Rhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Schutzer1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Progressive, individually supervised training in the current study may have resulted in a more personalized approach and one-on-one feedback may have led to better participation during the exercise programs and higher adherence rates compared to group interventions. While an individually supervised format of treating institutionalized patients with dementia can be effective in keeping adherence rates high as in the present study, it is also time intensive and potentially costly. However, we experienced that perhaps the most effective way to deliver exercise programs in dementia patients is in an individually supervised format. This is supported by knowledge that patients with dementia suffer from behavioral problems, such as apathy and agitation, which may cause inactivating thoughts and problems in the initiation of movement <xref rid="pone.0097577-Perri1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A possible practical solution to offer a personal individualized training regime is to involve volunteers and family members to offer such programs in a structured and frequent way.</p><p>In total, 46% of the patients with dementia who lived in an institutionalized setting met the inclusion criteria and were willing to participate. Therefore, the generalizability of this study is limited to patients who are able to walk independently, with or without a walking aid and were willing to exercise. The main reason why walking and leg-strength training was not possible was that 37% of the residents was wheelchair bound. Different training strategies are needed for this group, which should focus at both aerobic training and upper-extremity training to maintain or improve handgrip and arm strength because these are key contributors to functional ability and independency in activities of daily life <xref rid="pone.0097577-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. A possible exercise program could consist of an arm-bike exercise combined with upper body strength training.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cognitive function</title><p>A six-week exercise program did not significantly improve cognitive function. However, there was a medium effect size only for the Visual Memory Span Forward, a visuospatial attention and memory test. This finding is in line with other studies, demonstrating positive effects of exercise on visuospatial but not on verbal processes <xref rid="pone.0097577-Yaguez1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This selective effect on visuospatial memory was also found in a meta-analysis of Colcombe &#x00026; Kramer <xref rid="pone.0097577-Colcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and suggested a mediating role for a specific part of the hippocampus. The involvement of the hippocampal area was shown by an aerobic exercise program, which led to increased anterior hippocampal volume, and had little effect on the posterior hippocampal part in healthy older adults <xref rid="pone.0097577-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Neurons found in the anterior part of the hippocampus were selectively associated with visuospatial memory <xref rid="pone.0097577-Broadbent1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and are more prone to age related atrophy than the neurons in the posterior hippocampus <xref rid="pone.0097577-Raji1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. So, the current study provides some evidence that these selective effects of exercise on visuospatial memory are also present in older adults with dementia who participated in our combined aerobic and strength training program. Again, these results need to be interpreted with caution and studied further in larger randomized clinical trials over a longer intervention period.</p><p>The present data failed to confirm previously reported improvements in executive function after an exercise intervention in frail sedentary cognitively-impaired older adults <xref rid="pone.0097577-Heyn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A possibility to achieve more change over time is to perform an exercise program over a longer intervention period (e.g. 12 weeks) <xref rid="pone.0097577-Blankevoort1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Heyn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, measurements in cognitively impaired older adults may be less sensitive to change compared with measurements in cognitively non-impaired older adults due to large score variation <xref rid="pone.0097577-Blankevoort2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We attempted to control for possible intraday variation by performing the measurements at the same time of the day (e.g. morning or afternoon). However, a small sample size, and therefore the use of non-parametric tests, led to the use of difference scores, resulting in lower test reliability. Therefore, future studies should replicate this study with a larger sample size to eliminate this problem.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Physical function</title><p>A combination of aerobic and strength exercise sessions led to improvements in tests that measured walking endurance, leg strength, and mobility. The current improvements of leg strength and functional mobility are also in line with results of a six-week, twice to three times per week strength exercise training program <xref rid="pone.0097577-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, emphasizing that a short-term six-week exercise program may already result in beneficial change of physical functions. These improvements should conceptually increase the ability to walk <xref rid="pone.0097577-LaRoche1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and achieve higher VO<sub>2</sub>-peak levels during aerobic activities <xref rid="pone.0097577-Fiser1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In turn, this may promote cerebral blood flow, which is associated with higher level of cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0097577-Nation1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097577-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, we found no association between physical function change scores and cognitive function change scores. We suggest this may relate to different rates of change over time between physical and cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0097577-Etnier1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It remains to be seen if the motor improvements eventually result in correlated improvements in cognitive function in proportion to intervention duration or if the beneficial effects of exercise intervention reach a saturation point. Therefore, long-term intervention studies are needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present pilot study showed that it is feasible to conduct a high-frequency combined aerobic and strength training program in institutionalized patients with dementia. The data also show selective visual attention improvements in cognitive function and more robust changes in motor function in favor of the exercise compared with the social visit intervention. These initial positive results are encouraging and warrant the execution of randomized clinical trials involving higher patient numbers and longer duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097577.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
