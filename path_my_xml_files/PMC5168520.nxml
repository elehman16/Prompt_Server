However, only observational studies are available to inform decision-making in this area, and they are at high risk of selection bias. While a clinical trial comparing the effects of the 2 most frequently chosen strategies for haemodialysis access (fistulas and catheters) on patient important and &#x02018;hard&#x02019; clinical end points is needed, the feasibility of such a trial is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This open-label pilot randomised controlled trial will test the feasibility and safety of randomising elderly people (&#x02265;65&#x02005;years) who start haemodialysis with a central venous catheter (the most common initial type of haemodialysis access), and are eligible to receive a fistula, to a catheter-based strategy (comparator) or to a fistula-based strategy (intervention). We will enrol 100 patients at 10 centres across Canada. Participants assigned to the catheter-strategy arm will continue to use catheters; participants assigned to the fistula-strategy arm will receive a surgical attempt at fistula creation. The inclusion criteria are designed to minimise the risk of protocol violation and attrition. The primary outcome is feasibility, which we will assess by measuring: (1) the proportion of participants deemed eligible for the trial who consent to randomisation; and (2) the proportion of participants randomised to the intervention who receive the fistula surgery within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include safety outcomes, the reasons people and healthcare providers may not accept randomisation, and the reasons sites may not adhere to the trial protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary approved the study protocol.

Guidelines recommend a fistula for haemodialysis access based on evidence from large observational studies showing that fistula use is associated with better clinical outcomes (including mortality) and lower costs than catheter use.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, there has never been a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing fistulas with catheters, and existing studies addressing this question are at high risk of bias, especially selection bias.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref> The choice of haemodialysis access is a common intervention question in clinical practice and is very relevant for patients and health policymakers because it impacts morbidity, mortality, quality of life and health costs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>In Canada, more than 80% of people with kidney failure who start haemodialysis use a catheter for vascular access, and are faced with the decision to either continue with a catheter or attempt fistula creation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although fistula creation is recommended regardless of age,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> promoting fistulas in the elderly may be ineffective as in this patient population fistulas are less likely to become suitable for haemodialysis than in younger people.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, even when fistula attempts are successful, elderly people may not receive the same benefit as younger people due to their shorter life expectancy. Finally, recent data suggest that the risks associated with catheters (eg, catheter-related bacteraemia) may be lower in the elderly<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and that a person's preference for the type of vascular access varies by age, with the elderly being more likely to prefer catheters to fistulas.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For these reasons, the expected benefits of fistula creation are even more uncertain in the elderly.</p><p>A large RCT to determine the benefits and harms of one form of vascular over the other may not be feasible for several reasons. First, people may develop strong preferences for a particular form of vascular access based on the information presented during education about their options. Fistulas require a surgical intervention that can disfigure the arm and require the insertion of needles for dialysis at each treatment (ie, three times per week). Catheters impose lifestyle restrictions (eg, avoidance of swimming) and are visible over the chest. As a consequence, patients may develop strong preferences and be less willing to consent to randomisation. Second, physicians may not be willing to enrol people into a trial due to guideline recommendations and/or existing incentives to increase the number of people treated with fistulas. Third, programmes may not be able to arrange for a fistula creation within a reasonable time (eg, 90&#x02005;days from randomisation), thereby increasing the risk that consent is withdrawn before the fistula is created or longer exposure to catheters may outdo potential benefits of fistulas. These considerations motivated the design of the present pilot RCT to test the feasibility of a larger, hard outcome trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objective and outcomes</title><p>This pilot RCT will test the feasibility and safety of randomising elderly people who start haemodialysis with a catheter to continued use of a catheter or attempt at fistula creation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>This feasibility RCT will be multicentre, parallel-arm and open-label in design.

We will randomise 100 elderly people (age &#x02265;65) with end-stage kidney failure starting haemodialysis with a catheter in 10 Canadian haemodialysis programmes (1:1) to continued use of catheters (comparator) or receive an attempt at fistula creation (intervention).

Of these people, &#x0223c;80% start on haemodialysis (N=400) and 80% of those people use a catheter for haemodialysis access (N=320). According to the same data, at least 50% (N=160) meet the inclusion criteria and if we conservatively assume that 25% of them will consent to randomisation, at least 80 participants will be recruited over 2&#x02005;years across these four sites. An additional 20 participants will be recruited among the other six participating Canadian centres. The 100-person sample size is reasonable to address the feasibility question of the pilot RCT (ie, whether randomising people to different access strategies is possible). However, identifying barriers to enrolment and thereby, understanding how to maximise enrolment rate at all participating centres will be critical to maximise recruitment rate in the hard outcome RCT. We will continue to monitor these feasibility indicators as the pilot ACCESS HD transitions into the hard outcome ACCESS HD trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><p>We plan to enrol 100 people in total across 10 centres in Canada. This will be possible within 2&#x02005;years if we enrol 25% of eligible people. We will screen all people who start haemodialysis with a catheter for inclusion in our trial, including people who start haemodialysis in hospital and those who start haemodialysis urgently. We will assess eligibility of these people once they are sufficiently stable to provide informed consent (see the Eligibility criteria section). We will also include people who start as outpatients and those previously treated with haemodialysis therapy before they changed modality to peritoneal dialysis or transplantation. However, only participants with one previous unsuccessful fistula attempt (randomisation will be stratified on this variable) will be eligible. In each centre, we have implemented strategies to identify all new haemodialysis starts within the programme and ensure adequate enrolment to reach the target sample size. We will assess eligibility of all people starting haemodialysis with a catheter and track the time of this assessment relative to the dialysis start date.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Adherence and attrition</title><p>One of the objectives of this feasibility RCT is to measure adherence (ie, arranging for a fistula creation within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation in those assigned to the fistula arm) to demonstrate that centres will adhere to the trial protocol. We will monitor compliance with follow-up visits and the completion of trial questionnaires. We currently track all incident haemodialysis patients at several Canadian sites using a high-quality, web-based platform for the purpose of quality improvement (Dialysis Measurement, Analysis and Reporting (DMAR) System).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Analysis of two representative programmes suggests that 5% of people starting dialysis transfer out of a dialysis programme or are lost to follow-up over the first year of dialysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013081TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarises inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The team will be free to order any additional investigations required to determine eligibility (eg, vascular mapping), as per local practice. We will collect detailed data around the assessment process at each site during assessment of site feasibility. The determination of eligibility will be the consensus opinion of the primary nephrologist, access surgeon and access nurse (more often based on a series of independent assessments).

After written informed consent is obtained, the trial coordinator will confirm trial eligibility.

Stratification by these variables will protect randomisation in case the eligibility criteria change for the hard outcome RCT. An independent statistician at the coordinating centre will generate the allocation sequences and keep them concealed from the clinical investigators. Each randomisation list will be generated using randomly permuted blocks of varying sizes. Since this is an open-label trial, knowledge of block sizes could, under certain situations, permit determination of future allocations. For this reason, block size will remain concealed throughout the trial. Randomisation will be operationalised using a web-based, central system (Medidata RAVE). After confirming participant eligibility and obtaining signed consent, the local trial coordinator will obtain the participant's assignment electronically via Medidata RAVE. We will not blind participants or providers because the creation of fistulas requires a surgical procedure in the arm, results in clearly visible changes to the appearance of the arm and requires needling of the access for dialysis (as opposed to hub connections). However, outcome adjudicators will be blinded for all outcomes of the larger RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Trial treatments and cointerventions</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Intervention arm</title><p>Participants will undergo an attempt at fistula creation by an experienced surgeon. Preoperative studies (angiography and/or ultrasound mapping) will be allowed as dictated by indications, local practice and physician preferences. We will collect information about policies and practices, including, for example, the approach to selection of the location of the anastomosis from distal locations (radio-cephalic fistula first) to more proximal locations (brachio-cephalic fistula next and brachio-basilic anastomosis as last choice). Variants on these types of fistulas as well as other options for fistula creation will be at the discretion of the local vascular access team, as per usual practice. The protocol requires that the first fistula attempt occurs within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation and this pilot RCT will measure adherence to this requirement as a measure of feasibility. In the event that the fistula attempt fails or a functioning fistula experiences a complication that renders it unusable for haemodialysis, further fistula attempts will be at the discretion of the vascular access team and participant; the participant will remain in the intervention arm and &#x02018;analysed as randomised&#x02019; in the definite trial (intention-to-treat).</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Comparator arm</title><p>Participants randomised to the comparator arm will continue to use a tunnelled, central venous haemodialysis catheter for vascular access.

This number is based on an estimated 25% acceptance rate and a total of 1000 people expected to start haemodialysis in the participating centres over 2&#x02005;years. Of these, 80% will start with a catheter and 50% are expected to meet the inclusion criteria (conservative number of potentially eligible people N=400). The primary indicators of feasibility will be the proportion of people who are randomised among those who are eligible, and the proportion of fistula attempts that occur within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation. The pilot RCT will support feasibility if these proportions are at least 25% (100/400 total people) and 80% (40/50 participants assigned to the intervention arm), respectively. Considering the small size of the feasibility RCT and the resulting uncertainty around each estimate (eg, for the second estimate 95% confidence limits range from 9% to 97%), we will continue to monitor feasibility end points after the completion of the pilot RCT and until 100 participants are assigned to the fistula arm in the hard outcome RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2n2"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>The primary analysis will be descriptive. The proportion of people meeting each of the feasibility end points (proportion of people meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria who consent to randomisation; proportion of participants randomised to fistula arm who attempt a fistula creation within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation) with accompanying 95% CIs will be calculated. We will describe participant characteristics and evaluate reasons for protocol violations. We will calculate rates of drop-ins and other events, although we expect low numbers. We will not conduct any interim or subgroup analyses in this pilot RCT.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Safety data</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Expected procedure-related events and other outcomes</title><p>As catheter and fistula treatment strategies are standard of care in this patient population, the procedure-related outcomes are well known. We will collect only expected procedure-related events (ie, events that have a potentially causal relationship to the strategy) that occur within 7&#x02005;days of the execution of any access-related intervention, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013081TB2">table 2</xref>. In addition, trial coordinators will track causes for hospitalisation to identify outcomes (eg, new-onset peripheral neuropathy or severe sepsis) that may have resulted from the trial procedures (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx2"/>box 2). Cause of death will be determined by trial site investigators, based on a trial-specific list of classifications, and will be adjudicated for accuracy by appropriate members of the trial steering committee, who will be blind to treatment arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>An RCT comparing the effects of catheters and fistulas (the most common types of haemodialysis access being used by &#x0003e;90% of patients) on clinical outcomes has never been performed. As a result, clinical decision-making in this area is only informed by observational studies, which are not suitable to address intervention questions due to the potential for bias. For example, data from these observational studies indicate that fistulas are superior to catheters in terms of morbidity and mortality outcomes, and healthcare costs. However, these studies compared outcomes of fistula users (typically including only people who could attain a functioning fistula) versus catheter users, including those who were not eligible to receive a fistula, those in whom a fistula was attempted but did not become usable and those who needed an access immediately available for urgent haemodialysis (fistulas require time to mature), and therefore had poorer prognosis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> As a result, observational evidence indicates superior outcomes in fistula users, but does not demonstrate superiority of an access strategy based on fistulas over an access strategy based on catheters.</p><p>The questions addressed in this pilot and the hard outcome trial have been ranked among the top research priorities in dialysis by patients and healthcare providers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The nephrology community is increasingly aware of the limitations of available evidence.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Nevertheless, clinical practice guidelines recommend the fistula as the ideal haemodialysis access, patient advocacy groups strongly promote fistulas over catheters and the proportion of prevalent patients using a fistula is used as a quality of care measure in some jurisdictions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Given the uncertainty regarding the willingness of patients and physicians to participate in an RCT in this area, a pilot RCT is necessary to prove the feasibility of a larger study.</p><p>Strengths in the design of our feasibility trial include: carefully defined feasibility objectives, clinically grounded, pragmatic approaches to enrolment (eligibility for a fistula) and to delivery of the assigned treatment (access strategy), methods to reduce bias (allocation concealment, objective outcomes, steps to ensure complete follow-up and blinding of outcome adjudicators to treatment assignment), identification of large centres with expertise in vascular access research and care and a coordinating centre with expertise in the management of large multicentre RCTs. These steps will reliably inform the design of the hard outcome trial. In addition, we have included protocols for collection of data that will be analysed in the larger study if this pilot supports feasibility (Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, vascular access questionnaire and physical function as measured by grip strength).</p><p>The design of this feasibility RCT has limitations. First, the inclusion criterion of age &#x02265;65 may limit the ability to generalise the findings to younger people who may prefer a fistula to a catheter, and in whom outcomes may differ. However, this criterion is also expected to maximise the chances of success of the pilot RCT by enhancing feasibility, and can be used to inform future studies in younger populations. Second, in the ACCESS HD trial, the question about which access strategy is best for the patient is asked after haemodialysis has started and therefore, focuses on maintaining the strategy in place (the catheter) versus changing strategy (to a fistula). Findings may not be easily generalisable to patients in whom the choice of the access is made prior to the start of haemodialysis (about 20% of people start haemodialysis with a fistula in Canada).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This design has been chosen to enhance study feasibility by limiting the impact of competing events (mortality before end-stage kidney failure or unanticipated availability of a kidney transplant from a living donor), the possibility of changing decision about final dialysis modality or recovery of kidney function with postponement of dialysis initiation and vascular access preparation. Third, it is possible that attending nephrologists and other healthcare providers will have firm beliefs on the potential benefits of fistulas in the haemodialysis population and decline to allow their patients to be enrolled. However, a recent survey including Canadian nephrologists found that the large majority (86%) believed that it would be ethical to randomise elderly patients into such a trial.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The type of vascular access used for haemodialysis may have a tremendous impact on the quality and quantity of life of people receiving haemodialysis therapy. The superiority of fistulas over catheters for haemodialysis access has never been demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial, representing an important knowledge gap and research priority. The ACCESS HD pilot RCT is a vital first step to filling this critical knowledge gap and better informing practice as it will establish protocol feasibility and confirm the safety of randomly assigning patients to a catheter-based or a fistula-based strategy for haemodialysis access.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>TRIAL STATUS</title><p>Registration information NCT02675569, Recruiting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dorothy Myers, research coordinator with the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at St Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Canada), and Sharon Gulewich, study coordinator in Calgary.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborator:</bold> Applied Health Research Centre of St Michael's Hospital.</p></fn><fn><p><italic>The ACCESS HD investigator team include</italic>: RQ: Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, Department of Medicine, and O'Brien Institute of Public Health, Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary; Jennifer MacRae: Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary; Mauricio F Monroy-Cuadros: Division of Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary.
