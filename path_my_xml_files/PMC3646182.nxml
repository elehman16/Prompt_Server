On the other hand, the patients who participate in the decision-making process show greater treatment adherence and have better health outcomes. Different methods to encourage the active participation during oncological consultation have been described; however, similar studies in Italy are lacking. The aims of the present study are to (1) assess the effects of a preconsultation intervention to increase the involvement of breast cancer patients during the consultation, and (2) explore the role of the attending companions in the information exchange during consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>All female patients with breast cancer who attend the Oncology Out-patient Services for the first time will provide an informed consent to participate in the study. They are randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. The intervention consists of the presentation of a list of relevant illness-related questions, called a question prompt sheet. The primary outcome measure of the efficacy of the intervention is the number of questions asked by patients during the consultation. Secondary outcomes are the involvement of the patient by the oncologist; the patient's perceived achievement of her information needs; the patient's satisfaction and ability to cope; the quality of the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship in terms of patient-centeredness; and the number of questions asked by the patient's companions and their involvement during the consultation.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Research evidence suggests that patients have varying preferences for the amount and type of information they desire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Good clinical practice entails oncologists recognising these variations in patient preferences, and physicians and patients working together to accomplish these preferences. In order to accommodate these varying preferences, the physicians need to elicit patient preferences and to adapt their information giving processes to meet these needs. If the expression of such needs is not facilitated or encouraged, these needs tend to remain hidden; consequently, the patients may perceive that they received too much or too little information. The literature suggests that a better quality of patient care and patient outcomes such as coping with illness and treatment adherence are achieved when preferences are met.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> How the physician conducts the interview and gives information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> has a direct effect on the participation of the patient. It has been observed that what the physician says has an immediate effect on what the patients says, and therefore can also influence the degree of patient participation in the consultation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> One proven method to encourage patients to be more active communicators is to provide question prompt sheets (QPS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> QPS are structured lists of prepared questions that prompt patients to consider novel topics before a consultation and decide on the question they would like to ask during the consultation. These tools have been shown to increase patient activation during consultation and aid the recall of information after consultation. Although QPS have been shown to be helpful, there is a need to replicate these studies in different cultural contexts in order to test the feasibility of such aids and to support the findings.</p><p>In Italy, during the medical consultation, the patients are frequently accompanied and assisted by a companion: a close family member or another key person. In this context, the activation and involvement of the patient interact with that of the companion's and contribute to the communication dynamics of the consultation. Ohlen <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> explored the importance of significant others in therapeutic decisions and highlighted the notion of &#x02018;relational autonomy&#x02019;, which acknowledges that people are defined by their relationships and are dependent on others in making decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Future research that analyses patients and their companions as dyadic units would offer further insight into the impact of social relations on the treatment decision-making processes. More evidence on the information needs of the companions regarding the patient and their role in the information and decision-making processes during the consultation is also needed.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial in Europe which assesses the effects of a preconsultation intervention (QPS) on the cancer patients&#x02019; involvement during the consultation, on their satisfaction and confidence in coping with illness and which explores the role of the companion during the consultation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which the patients are attributed randomly to the intervention or to the control group on a 1:1 basis. The patients in the intervention group are given the QPS, a list of 50 specific questions (see below); those in the control group are given a control sheet on which to write the questions they would like to ask. The oncologists are informed about the study protocol, but are blinded to whether the patient is a participant of the control group or the intervention group. The oncologists perform their consultation as usual according to the clinical practice of their centre. After concluding the consultation, they complete two questionnaires (DPRQ-10 and Control Preference Scale (CPS), see the Measures section for details) regarding the patient and the consultation.</p><p>This protocol follows the CONSORT guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Standardised questionnaires are administered at baseline (before the randomisation) and immediately after the consultation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002266F1">figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002266TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012002266TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Questionnaires and tools used in the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tool</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evaluation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Explored area</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Items (n)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#x02014;X1 (STAI-X1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">State anxiety level</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before the consultation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient Health Questionnaire&#x02014;9 (PHQ-9)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depression</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">General Health Questionnaire&#x02014;12 (GHQ-12)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Psychological distress</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Decision Self Efficacy Scale (DSES*)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Confidence with decision</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control Preference Scale (CPS)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Role in the decision making process</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 vignettes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant chooses the one preferred</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire&#x02014;Reduced form (EPQ-R)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and companion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Personality traits</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Doctor-Patient Scale (DP)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oncologists</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oncologists&#x02019;

The willing patients provide written informed consent to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002266F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Once consented, the patients and their companions receive an envelope containing six questionnaires to answer before the consultation (baseline assessment, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002266TB1">table 1</xref>). The project staff member (MAM) then randomly allocates consenting patients and their companions to the intervention or control group (see also paragraph &#x02018;Randomisation&#x02019;). Another project staff member (AB, CB, IB or FC) hands out the envelopes with either the intervention QPS or the control sheet and collect the sheets after their completion. In order to keep the oncologists blind to the intervention or control status, patients do not take the QPS into the consultation.</p><p>The subsequent consultation is audio-recorded.
