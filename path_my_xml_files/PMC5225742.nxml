The major contributory factors leading to the development of CKD are diabetes and hypertension.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In Canada, 1.9&#x02013;2.3 million people have CKD.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that CKD affected an estimated 16.8% of the U.S adults aged 20 years and older, during 1999&#x02013;2004.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The UK estimates suggest that 6% of men and 7% of women have sympatomatic CKD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In Indian scenario, the prevalence is increasing although the exact figures vary among different studies. In a study by Singh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] the prevalence of CKD taking both decreased GFR and proteinuria into consideration was found to be 4.2% by modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) criteria and 13.3% by Cockcroft-Gault equation corrected to the body surface area (CG-BSA) while it was found to be 6.3% by MDRD criteria and 16.69% by CG-BSA in results from kidney disease screening project.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Management of CKD includes management of its complications such as fluid retention, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis, bone disease, anemia, and cardiovascular abnormalities. In end-stage renal disease, kidney function can only be replaced by dialysis or by a kidney transplant. Dialysis is not a permanent cure as the patient requires it regularly. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes and quality of life (QOL). However, not every candidate is suited for kidney transplantation. Patients with immunocompromised state and those having HIV or active hepatitis were not considered for transplantation because of increased risk of opportunistic infections. The presence of potentially harmful antibody against the donor's kidney is another absolute contraindication to transplant. These include natural antibodies against ABO blood group antigens and antibodies against human leukocyte antigen.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>All these therapeutic modalities are expensive and beyond the reach of majority of patients in India. Besides, such procedures are focused on treating the manifestation of disease and not the underlying cause of disease. Researches in the past have shown that yoga does play an important role in controlling hypertension and diabetes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In one study, it was found that the Corpse pose (<italic>shavasana</italic>) reduces blood pressure and the need for antihypertensive medication.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another study showed that yoga is effective in reducing blood pressure, blood glucose level, serum cholesterol, and body weight.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Kashinath <italic>et al</italic>. in their hypothetical review article described how yoga can work in CKD.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] As diabetes and hypertension are major causes of CKD and yoga has a definitive role in controlling them, it is logical to think that it would be beneficial in CKD also. With this background, we undertook this study to find out whether the old Indian science of yoga could emerge as a viable and safe tool in the management of CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut, India, during 2009&#x02013;2010.

WHOQOL-BREF consists of questionnaire for four domains, i.e., physical, psychological, social, and environmental. Score for each domain was calculated separately. Total score for each domain is 20. Baseline investigations including complete blood count, blood urea, serum creatinine, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum calcium and phosphate, screening for HIV, hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C, and renal ultrasound were done in every patient. Other investigations which may be considered appropriate for individual patients such as Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, 24 h urinary protein, renal Doppler, and renal biopsy were carried out in selected patients.</p><p>The patients were selected using simple random sampling by coin test and written informed consent was taken as per Helsinki Declaration after offering sufficient explanation about the study and its aim.

The anatomical overview of postural exercises in yoga suggests that these exercises are centered toward stretching and strengthening of muscles and increasing blood supply.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] <italic>Pranayama</italic> practices stretch the lung tissue producing inhibitory signals from action of slowly adapting receptors and hyperpolarizing currents. These inhibitory signals coming from cardiorespiratory region involving vagi are believed to synchronize neural elements in the brain leading to changes in the autonomic nervous system, and a resultant condition characterized by reduced metabolism and parasympathetic dominance. <italic>Pranayama</italic> modifies various inflatory and deflatory lung reflexes and interact with the central neural element to bring new homeostasis in the body.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a study, it was found that 30 min of hath yoga practice daily for 4 months showed a significant reduction in oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, protein oxidation, and phospholipase A2 activity) and increase in antioxidant activity (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) in patients with CKD who were on hemodialysis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Researches had shown that higher sympathetic tone is potentially involved in the progression of CKD, promoting hypertension, and causing target organ damage.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] There is evidence that suggests yoga reduces sympathetic tone and improves parasympathetic tone thereby reducing pulse rate, SBP, DBP, and metabolic rate.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The present study supports previous studies that yoga plays a statistically significant role in stabilizing both the systolic as well as the DBP levels. The present study also unfolds the significant role played by yoga in controlling renal dysfunction as assessed by blood urea and serum creatinine values. The patients undergoing the yogic exercise regime along with conventional treatment showed a significant reduction in blood urea and serum creatinine values over a period of 6 months, whereas there was rising trend in patients kept in the control group. This can be attributed to the significantly beneficial impact of yoga on renal functions.</p><p>Dysnatremia is common in CKD. Normal renal function guarantees that the tubular reabsorption of filtered sodium and water is adjusted so that urinary excretion matches intake. In CKD, this balance is disrupted such that dietary intake of sodium exceeds its urinary excretion resulting in sodium and water retention. This causes extracellular fluid volume expansion which in turn contributes to hypertension that itself can accelerate the nephron injury. Similarly, in CKD, there is disruption of potassium secretory mechanism in distal nephron that can result in hyperkalemia. Here, we found that poststudy serum sodium (<italic>P</italic> = 0.38) and serum potassium (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) were lower in yoga group as compared to control group. This effect might be due to improved renal function and increased excretion which in turn normalizes blood pressure and prevents further nephron injury. There is another view that an important cause of the defect in renal excretory function in hypertension is an increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Yoga by improving sympathetic tone reduces blood pressure. This in turn improves excretory mechanism and results in normalization of water and electrolyte balance.</p><p>In another randomized controlled study on hemodialysis patients, 12 weeks yoga intervention has proven to be safe and significantly effective in managing the pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance along with significant improvement in hand grip, significant reduction in creatinine, blood urea, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol along with significant improvement in erythrocyte and hematocrit count.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The present study shows that in addition to improving renal function, the need for dialysis is reduced in patients undergoing yoga therapy over a period of 6 months. Yoga thus helps in decreasing economic burden on the patient which is especially desirable in a country like India where the socioeconomic condition of the majority of the population is below average.</p><p>Many CKD patients experience psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, distress, and mood disturbances as a consequence of long-standing disease. Previous studies suggest the role of yoga in improving QOL in various disorders such as lupus nephritis patients with CKD, cancer, Parkinson's disease, chronic low back pain, and depression.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Our study also substantiates the profound effect of yoga on the QOL of patients with CKD. In the present study, we used WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire developed by the WHO to assess the QOL. It was observed in the study that there is a significant improvement in physical (independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and psychological aspect of QOL (independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) of patients in the yoga group at the end of 6 months vis-a-vis the control group. However, there was no significant change in social and environmental aspects of QOL at 6 months with yoga therapy. Further studies are required over a longer period of time to study the impact of yoga on these aspects of life.</p><p>Barring a few limitations like small sample size and inability of some patients to do complex yogic exercises the study otherwise proves fruitful in establishing the positive role played by yoga in combating the physical, social, and financial aspects of CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Six months yoga program is safe and effective measure as adjuvant therapy to conventional treatment modalities in reducing blood pressure, improving renal function, decreasing the need for dialysis, and improving QOL in patients with CKD. As CKD had a chronic course whether the results of our short-term study can be extrapolated to long-term benefits is yet to be explored.
