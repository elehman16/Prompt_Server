Resective and regenerative are the two approaches which can be used to eliminate the anatomic defect caused as a result of periodontitis. The regenerative approach seeks to eliminate periodontal defects by creating new bone and periodontal ligament and coronally displacing gingival attachment and margin. Invasion of bifurcation and/or trifurcation of multirooted teeth are the most serious complications of periodontitis, resulting in early and frequent loss of molars than any other teeth type. Various treatment modalities involve either maintaining existing furcation (scaling and root planing) or increasing access to furcation (gingivectomy/ apically positioned flap, odontoplasty, osteoplasty/ostectomy), or it leads to the elimination of furcation (root amputation/tooth resection, bicuspidization). The newer aspect involves the utilization of regenerative procedures for the treatment of furcation defects which includes placement of bone grafts or bone substrate implants, use of certain cements in grade II and III furcation, and the use of organic or synthetic barrier membranes based on the principles of guided tissue regeneration (GTR). Xenografts have proven efficacy for bone fill, attachment gain, and pocket reduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] PepGen P-15 (Ceramed Dental LLC) is a new tissue-engineered bone material and provides both the inorganic and organic component. Anorganic bovine material (ABM) provides the same anatomic scaffold, composition, and structure as autogenous bone necessary for cellular invasion. It is of type I collagen, a 15-amino acid sequence. It provides a tissue-engineered hospitable biomimetic habitat for cells like osteoblasts and fibroblasts and serves as a bone-like substitute for autogenous bone grafts.</p><p>PepGen P-15 demonstrates an increased expression of growth factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and provides an appropriate environment for bone. It has also shown a significantly higher reduction in probing depth and gain in attachment level as compared to another xenograft, BioOss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The use of GTR to treat human class II furcation defects was first reported by Gottlow <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Atrisorb barrier is a synthetic liquid polymer of Lactic acid poly (DL lactide) (PLA) dissolved N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). It is a nontoxic, bioabsorbable, and efficacious material. A pilot study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and a multicenter study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] with Atrisorb used in class II furcation in humans have indicated favorable regenerative outcomes.</p><p>Hence, the present study has been undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of peptide-enhanced bone graft (PepGen P-15) and resorbable GTR (Atrisorb) barrier in the treatment of human mandibular class II furcation both clinically and radiographically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The review committee of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences approved the protocol for human subjects.

The ABM/P-15 combination bone replacement graft material (using only 200 ng of P-15 with 1 g of ABM) has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to enhance the attachment of cells, and to promote attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. The peptide component of the test material, P-15, is a synthetic clone of the 15-amino acid sequences of type I collagen. It is a highly conserved linear polypeptide with a 15-amino acid sequence identical to the sequence contained in residues 766-780 of the &#x003b1;l chain of type I collagen; therefore, P15 is essentially a very small synthetic fragment of the &#x003b1;l chain of type I collagen. The type 1 molecule is made up of 3&#x003b1; chains (2&#x003b1;l, l &#x003b1;2 chains). Each of the &#x003b1; chains consists of approximately 1000 amino acid residues; P-15 represents approximately 1.5% (15 / 1000 amino acid residues) of the size of the &#x003b1;l chain of 0.5% (15 / 3000 amino acid residues) of a type I collagen molecule.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Presurgical procedure</title><p>All the patients were given detailed instructions in self-monitored plaque control measures and were subjected to phase I therapy.

The operating site was anesthetized with 2% xylocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline using inferior alveolar nerve block and lingual nerve block. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised, taking care to preserve interdental papilla. After thorough surgical debridement, the surgical site was irrigated copiously.</p><p>In the control site, PepGen P-15 was loosely packed taking care to avoid overfilling [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>]. On the experimental site, PepGen P-15 was placed followed by the barrier membrane in such a way so as to overlap the walls of defect by at least 2-3 mm on all sides to allow complete bone contact and to prevent connective tissue surface invasion below the material [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>]. The canula tip was held 1-2 mm away from the graft and the applicator was squeezed. The expressed polymer was uniformly spread over the graft. The polymer was then mixed with sterile water or saliva for about 10-20 seconds to set the barrier. After the barrier was set, it was not touched and the flaps were gently approximated and sutured. The surgical site was protected with a non-eugenol dressing (Voco pac). The patients were prescribed systemic doxycycline Hcl 200 mg for the first day followed by 100 mg/day for another four days along with nimesulide 100 mg tablets twice daily for three days. Postoperative instructions were given to all. After 10 days, dressings and sutures were removed and the surgical sites were irrigated with normal saline. Inquiry regarding postsurgical problems was made and the area was checked for any membrane exposure. Recall appointments were made at one month, three months, six months, and nine months. At each visit, clinical parameters were recorded and radiographs were taken. Oral hygiene instructions were reinforced.

The results of the study are discussed as follows:</p><p>In this study, mean reduction in horizontal probing depth of the furcation defect without a stent was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) for the control site nine months postoperatively similar to the findings of Yukna <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and the mean reduction in the experimental site nine months postoperatively was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) similar to the findings of Rosen and Reynolds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] On comparison of the control and experimental groups at nine months post surgery, the mean reduction in horizontal probing depth of the furcation defects without the use of a stent was statistically not significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Stent used for measuring the horizontal depth of furcation</title><p>In this study, a new stent was designed to measure the horizontal furcation depth clinically without re-entry in a reliable manner at a given interval of time. A variety of stents have been used for vertical measurement including pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and GM position.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Moreover, furcation probing with the help of stents using different methods has been done either probing during re-entry or at the time of surgical exposure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Dr. Devraj and Dr. Vandana (2003)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] did a comparative evaluation of BioOss and PepGen P-15 using a similar customized stent for horizontal furcation probing and found out a highly significant reduction in probing depth in the PepGen P-15 group as compared to BioOss.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Horizontal probing depth of the furcation defects using a newly designed stent</title><p>In the experimental group, mean reduction in horizontal probing depth of furcation defects using a stent from baseline to 9 months was 1.56&#x000b1;0.88 which was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In the control group, mean reduction in horizontal probing depth of furcation defects using stents from baseline to nine months was 2.00&#x000b1;2.45 which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>].</p><p>On comparison of the two groups at nine months post surgery, mean reduction in horizontal probing depths of the furcation defects using a stent was statistically not significant. The results suggest that the newly designed stent for horizontal measurements of the furcation depth would be a useful device clinically for standardization and reproducibility of probing measurements of the furcation defect.</p><p>On comparison of the two groups at nine months post surgery, the mean reduction in pocket depth was statistically not significant. Mean gain in clinical attachment level was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) for control sites nine months post surgery and also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) for the experimental sites nine months post surgery. On comparison of the groups at nine months post surgery, mean change in GM position and recession were both statistically not significant. The changes in the vertical pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and GM position that occurred in both the experimental and control sites are due to the open debridement performed at the site of the surgery.</p><p>Radiographically, in this study, a trial was made to compare IOPA radiographs for the furcation assessment from baseline to nine months postoperatively. A total of 30 radiographs (15 baseline and 15 nine months postoperatively) were obtained which were categorized under two groups.</p><p>Group 1: Radiographs where furcation involvement was evident and the changes in the furcation area were detected post surgery [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>].</p><p>Group 2: Radiographs where furcation was evident but changes in the furcation area were not detected post surgery [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>].</p><p>Of the total 30 radiographs taken, 75% fell into group 2 and as majority of the radiographs fell into group 2, it was not possible to interpret the bony changes which had occurred after nine months of treatment.</p><p>In this study, we decided not to use a Naber's probe because the calibrations on a UNC-15 probe are in millimeters, whereas the Naber's probe has four calibrations of 3 mm each. For our study, the changes had to be recorded in millimeters so that even a change of a single millimeter could be recorded either as it is or by rounding off to the nearest millimeter, which would not have been feasible in a Naber's probe. Moreover, it was realized that the readings of the horizontal measurement from the edge of the stent may not represent accurate millimeters due to the geometry involved when using a double-plane curved probe such as the Naber's probe. Therefore a curved Naber's probe is more useful as a diagnostic tool rather than a prognostic one, which is why it was not considered for this study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Pubmed search did not reveal any studies to compare results obtained from furcation defect treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It can be concluded from this study that the reduction in furcation defect using PepGen P-15 alone and a combination of PepGen P-15 and Atrisorb were equivocal. It can be suggested that the combined use of GTR barrier and bone graft did not prove beneficial for the clinical outcome of the mandibular grade II furcation defect treatment. Hence, the cost effective and economical treatment of choice for grade II furcation defects may be bone graft alone.</p><p>Further long-term studies using larger sample sizes should be directed toward comparison of bone grafts and the combination of GTR and bone graft, and histologic evaluation would provide better insight into periodontal healing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge and thank Dr. K.T Chandrashekhar, MDS, Professor, Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, Davangere and Dr. Rajat Mangi, Lecturer, Department of Periodontics, Sudha Rustagi College of Dental Sciences and Research, Faridabad, for their help in editing of the manuscript and valuable suggestions.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vandana</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Khatri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical and radiographic evaluation of human mandibular grade II furcation defects treated with bovine derived xenograft(Bio-Oss) and a bioresorbable membrane</article-title><source>J Indian Soc Periodontal</source><year>2003</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>125</fpage><lpage>33</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Mellonig</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Brunsvold</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonell</surname><given-names>HT</given-names></name><name><surname>Cochran</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical evaluation of Bio-Oss: A bovine derived xenograft for the treatment of Periodontal osseous defect in Humans</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1999</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>421</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10412845</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yukna</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Callan</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Krauser</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name><name><surname>Aichelmann-Reidy</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Multicentre clinical evaluation of combination anorganic bovine derived Hydroxyapatite matrix(ABM)/Cell binding peptide(P-15) as a bone replacement graft material in human periodontal osseous defects &#x02013;
