During the procedure of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedure, water irrigation is a very useful for imaging but very dangerous if the patient receive the procedure under anesthesia without intubation. In this study, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (&#x02264;70%) for EUS.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 4230 patients who underwent EUS from December 2012 to December 2013, 347 out patients who need irrigation during the procedure were enrolled and divided into Group A. Group A (N<sub>2</sub>O sedation group, <italic>n</italic> = 162) and Group B (no sedative group, <italic>n</italic> = 185). For Group A, patients received N<sub>2</sub>O by inhalation during the procedure. The mixture rate of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> was 45-65% and controlled by nurses according to individual effect. The cardiorespiratory functions, procedure duration, complications, and visual analog scale (VAS) of the patient and examiner satisfaction were compared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p> Both group had comparable diagnostic accuracy, but VAS of the patients who received N<sub>2</sub>O sedation was higher than that in Group B (7.5 <italic>vs</italic>. 4.5, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and the examiner procedural satisfaction ratings of Group A was also better than that of Group B (8.1 <italic>vs</italic>. 5.1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); Most patients in Group A reported willingness to reconsider N<sub>2</sub>O for a future EUS. No pulmonary aspiration occurred in this study.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>N<sub>2</sub>O for EUS is comfortable, safe and feasible, especially for the procedures that need irrigation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Status of the presenting author:</bold> Chief resident</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>The authors declare:</bold> No significant relationship.</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
