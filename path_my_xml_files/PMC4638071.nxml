Nevertheless, it has some known systemic effects on blood cells and the immune system that possibly results in their susceptibility to infection. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that provide a health advantage to the consumer. Honey has prebiotic properties. The aim of this clinical trial was to investigate probable effects of probiotic or probiotics plus honey on blood cell counts and serum IgA levels in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either: (1) Probiotic capsules (including: <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus thermophiles</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 22), (2) probiotic capsules plus honey (n = 21) or (3) placebo capsules (<italic>n</italic> = 24) all for 6 weeks. Blood and serum samples were collected for one week before radiotherapy and 24-72 h after the end of radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>White blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), platelet counts, and serum IgA level were not significantly changed in patients taking probiotic (alone or plus honey) during pelvic radiotherapy. The mean decrease in RBC count was 0.52, 0.18, and 0.23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/&#x003bc;L, WBC count was 2.3, 1.21, and 1.34 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells/&#x003bc;L and platelet count was, 57.6, 53.3, and 66.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells/&#x003bc;L for the probiotic, probiotic plus honey, and placebo groups, respectively. The mean decrease of serum IgA was 22.53, 29.94, and 40.73 mg/dL for the probiotic, probiotic plus honey, and placebo groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The observed nonsignificant effect of probiotics may be in favor of local effects of this product in the gut rather than systemic effects, however, as a trend toward a benefit was indicated, further studies are necessary in order to extract effects of probiotics or probiotic plus honey on hematologic and immunologic parameters in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood cell counts</kwd><kwd>probiotic</kwd><kwd>prebiotic</kwd><kwd>honey</kwd><kwd>radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>pelvic cancer</kwd><kwd>serum IgA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Radiotherapy is a treatment for many types of pelvis malignancies, which uses high-energy beams of radiation to kill the cancer cells. It may be done alone or in combination with other treatments such as surgery or chemotherapy. The lethal effect of radiation is not restricted to the cancer cells. A minority of normal human cells such as the undifferentiated progenitors of the hematopoietic system and mucosa cells are sensitive to radiation. Mature lymphocytes are among the most radiosensitive human cells.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Radiotherapy has systemic effects on immunity using different mechanisms. Experiences from humoral immunity effects of radiation on patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma have shown a reduction of immunoglobulin values of IgM, IgA, and IgG with radiotherapy. A study showed values remained mostly within the lower normal range and a mean period of 2, 8, and 12 months were needed until IgM, IgA, and IgG recover, respectively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Moreover, radiation of the gastrointestinal tract may compromise the physical barrier of the mucosa. In certain circumstances, disruption of antimicrobial secretions of the gut resulted in an invasion by local flora and lead to bacteremia and candidemia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Studies suggest a healthy diet such as ingestion of probiotics can be advantageous. These are live microorganisms that include bacteria (e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species) or yeasts (e.g., <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>). Probiotics usage can restore the healthy flora of the gut, improve intestinal function,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and reduce the incidence of diarrhea during pelvic radiotherapy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The immune properties of probiotics have been related to signaling the immune system through innate cell surface pattern recognition receptors or directly by lymphoid cell activation. In some cases, this action has shown to modulate local and systemic immune responses.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Positive effects of probiotics on IgA secretion of respiratory[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and gastrointestinal[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] tract have been reported. Noticeably, no significant side effects have been reported for intake of recommended doses of probiotics except for mild abdominal pain or bloating that are usually self-limited.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>&#x0201c;Prebiotics&#x0201d; are food ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or activity of probiotics in ways claimed to be beneficial to health.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Honey has been valued in Scriptures and mentioned in ancient medical literature such as in The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna (980-1037 AC). It has acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and effective &#x0201c;prebiotic&#x0201d; properties.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Therefore, it may be used as a new remedy that is almost free from side effects.</p><p>As described above the benefits of probiotics on gut mucosa is well-known. However, whether patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy benefit from the probiotics and prebiotics by systemic humoral alterations have not been investigated in pelvic radiotherapy. The present study was conducted to assess the possible positive effects of probiotics alone or using concurrently with honey on blood cell counts and serum IgA level in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized clinical trial was performed on 67 patients diagnosed with pelvic cancers (colorectal, prostate, endometrial, bladder, ovary, cervical, and bone) that were referred to Radiation Oncology Clinic at Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, from October 2012 to May 2013. The treatment protocol was explained to patients, and they were given informed consent to participate.

The upper edge of the AP field varied from the third lumbar vertebra to the first sacral bone and extended to the lower edge of the pubic bones and laterally, covering a 1.5-2 cm of pelvic inlet rim but this also varied according to the abdominopelvic disease. Thirty-five percent of patients were irradiated with local parallel opposed boost fields (35.7%). Boost dose ranged from 260 to 2000 centiGrays (mean = 1210.0, SD = 662.3).

This study did not show a statistical significance effect of probiotic intake during treatment time on WBC counts and serum IgA levels. This was compatible with some other studies that failed to show a significant immunologic boost translated to a possible protective effect of these agents. A double-blind study was performed on 45 elderly patients fed by enteral tube who were divided into a probiotic group and placebo group and a tendency toward an increase of serum IgA was seen by probiotic intake (<italic>P</italic> = 0.085 at week 4 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.070 at week 16).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Another clinical trial on children with allergic rhinitis also showed no significant statistical differences of immunological or blood cell variables from the baseline and 12 weeks later when using <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Similarly in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study on pre-school children that the total serum IgA and total salivary IgA were measured. The total serum IgA was not significantly increase in the probiotic group, but the salivary IgA level significantly increased in this group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Conversely, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial that was conducted in an intensive care unit on 28 critically ill patients showed that the patients who received probiotics had a statistically significant larger increase in systemic IgA and IgG concentrations compared with the patients who received placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Since, the present study is among the first clinical studies that investigated the effect of probiotics and probiotic plus honey on cells blood and serum IgA in the patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy, data for making a practical assumption is scarce.</p><p>The fact that commensal bacteria and probiotics interact with host immunity is well-established but the molecular pathways of this &#x0201c;bacteria-host crosstalk&#x0201d; are not precisely known.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Thus, whether an interaction between acute radiation damage of mucosal lineage and the cross-talk exists or not cannot be concluded evidently.</p><p>Considering the high incidence of cancer in the pelvic area and radiation therapy done for a significant number of these patients, reducing complications and improvement of the quality of life is of importance. Patients treated with usual volumes of conventional two-dimensional pelvic fields are not supposed to induce opportunistic susceptibility pancytopenia and routine check of complete blood cell is not always necessary.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In addition, based on the research findings, the usage of probiotics in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy is safe and has well-established benefits such as control and prevention of radiation-induced diarrhea.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Main limitations of this study were the small sample size that made subgroup analysis inconclusive especially in patients receiving chemotherapy and patients with different types of cancers. Also, the limitations about study duration and difficulties about patients&#x02019; cooperation could be regarded.</p><p>Finally, the nonsignificant results of the study may contribute to localized effects of probiotics and the lack of clinically evident systemic effects of these products on blood cells and serum IgA. Other immunological factors, as well as WBCs differentiation on a quantitative time plot, is suggested to be analyzed in future well-designed studies that may enlighten the radiobiological and immunological aspects of this entity and drive to practical implications.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This research was supported by a grant from University of Isfahan and Cancer Prevention Research Center at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Project No: 291196).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>HMT; contributed in the conception and design of the work, conducting the study, drafting and revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
