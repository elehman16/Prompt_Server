to identify the main sources of stress in the nurses' practice in the different
hospital areas, assessing whether the professional work performed in the sectors
influences stress and anxiety levels. Nationally there is a consensus that this
profession is stressful and research is mostly concentrated on the professional
nurse<sup>(<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>In the hospital context, the nursing staff constitute the largest work force and the
activities carried out by its professionals are characterized by several negative
determinant factors, among them, the fragmented division of tasks, the rigid
hierarchical structure for the implementation of routines, rules and regulations,
and insufficient qualitative and quantitative human resources, which result in high
indices of absenteeism and sick leave<sup>(<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup>. In fact, nursing staff are exposed to unhealthy work
environments and often subjected to poor working conditions, leading to a low
quality of life<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>From this perspective, there is a need to investigate the importance of developing
coping strategies, from the participation of the professional in the work process,
fostering motivation and providing better quality of life<sup>(<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>. The importance is also emphasized of the
prevention of health problems, with measures to help cope with the many challenges
that are often outside the control of the workers yet impact excessively in their
psychological and physiological conditions. To obtain a more balanced and stable
energy condition, which is needed so that diseases do not manifest, auriculotherapy
can be an unconventional practice of high acceptability, safety and efficacy, due to
the recognition of its positive effects on physical, psychic and mental
disorders<sup>(<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>Over the last decade some studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
auriculotherapy to reduce stress and anxiety<sup>(<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> and the
preliminary trial that provided the basis for this research was entitled
"Applicability of auriculotherapy with needles or seeds to decrease stress in
nursing professionals", held in 2010, with nursing staff at the University Hospital
(UH) of S&#x000e3;o Paulo. In the present trial, one of the intervention groups was based on
previously tested points and the other intervention group was characterized by the
choice of these points individually, similar to the usual clinical practice in
Chinese medicine<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup>. This study
design emerged from a question regarding the difficult adequation of the Western
scientific research approach in the analysis of the results of a medical rationality
distinct from the West, originating from the Eastern Chinese culture. It is known
that the protocol constitutes an important step in the performance of scientific
research and is fundamental in the analysis of the efficacy of a given technique,
medication or procedure. However, the transfer of the Western research concept does
not always seem to be in line with the principles that underlie the alternative and
complementary therapies<sup>(<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup>. In
1997, an important reflection on the "Westernization" of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) was introduced, originating from a tendency to reduce the art of
acupuncture to rigid formulas. Research work may prove, in part, the efficacy of the
points, however, there is the opinion that this work does not represent true
acupuncture, due to neglecting the holistic perspective of this practice<sup>(<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup>. In view of the previous
statements, this study sought to evaluate whether the results achieved with
individualized auriculotherapy are able to expand the scope of the technique, since
the previous protocol results were positive for stress reduction in the nursing
staff of the UH.</p><p>Regarding the ethical and legal aspects related to the practice of acupuncture by the
nurse, it is noteworthy that this practice obtained legal support through Resolution
197/97 of the Federal Council of Nursing (COFEN) for the practice of acupuncture and
auriculotherapy. Currently Resolution 326/2008, which replaced other previously
issued resolutions (No.283/2002 and No. 287/2003), regulates the activity and
provides for the registration of the specialty, giving support and legitimacy to the
practice of acupuncture by nurses<sup>(<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup>. </p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of auriculotherapy, with and
without a protocol, in reducing the stress levels of nursing professionals; to
evaluate the responses to the treatment according to the prior presence or absence
of morbidity and different stress levels; and to evaluate the effect size of the
treatments through the Cohen's d Index.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a single-blind, Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial, with 3 groups: Control
group (no intervention) Protocol group and No protocol group. It was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, under protocol
number 1042/2011 and by the CEP of a private hospital. The study also fulfilled the
requirements of Resolution 196/1996 of the National Health Council, regarding
research involving humans, with the Terms of Free Prior Informed Consent having been
delivered to the study subjects. The trial obtained the Clinical Trials registration
number (NCT01420835).</p><p>Vasconcelos' Stress Symptoms List (SSL)<sup>(<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup> was used to define the sample of subjects participating.
The instrument was administered to all those who expressed an interest in
participating in the study (484), however, only those individuals who achieved
scores between 37 and 119 points were invited to participate; using numbers randomly
generated by the site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.randomizer.org">www.randomizer.org</ext-link> 213 people were allocated into three groups; 175
professionals were able to complete the study. There were 58 subjects in the Control
group, 58 in the Auriculotherapy with protocol group and 59 in the Auriculotherapy
with no protocol group. The sample calculation was performed using as a base the
previous study of stress, and it was affirmed that the sample had a test power of
80% for a significance level of 5%, or confidence level of 95%. </p><p>The inclusion criteria were: voluntary participation in the study with the
availability of time to attend the sessions, and obtaining a score in the SSL
indicating a medium or high level of stress. The exclusion criteria were:
nephrolithiasis with surgical indication (the Kidney point can stimulate the
expulsion of stones), performing another energy therapy, taking anxiolytic or
anti-depressant medication, or being pregnant. After the exclusions were made, a
sample of 213 nursing professionals was obtained, conforming to the flow diagram of
the subjects' participation. After the study began, 38 people were excluded for the
reasons that are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study subjects.

and a questionnaire covering sociodemographic data and the presence of prior
comorbidities. The data collection was carried out between January and July 2012, in
the hospital, and the sessions were conducted by a group consisting of six
acupuncturists nurses and a acupuncturist psychologist, trained in the same school,
experienced in the use of the same technique of Chinese auriculotherapy. The SSL
instrument was administered before the start (baseline), after 12 sessions, and at
30 days after the end (follow-up). The Control group received no type of
intervention and was asked to only answer the questionnaires. The two intervention
groups received 12 sessions (twice a week), with each session lasting 5 to 10
minutes. In the Protocol group the Shen Men, Brainstem, Kidney, Liver, Liver Yang 1
and 2 points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) were used. The Shen
Men and Brainstem points have calming properties, the Kidney point has an energy
function, and the Liver Yang 1 and 2 points have the function of containing the rise
of Liver yang<sup>(<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup>. </p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Auricular points of the Protocol group.

however, the points were chosen dependent on the reported symptoms at each
consultation, according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnoses found. For
placement of the semi-permanent needles, after the localization of the reactive
points, cleaning of the pinna was performed, using cotton and 70% ethyl alcohol, and
the needles applied and affixed with hypoallergenic tape.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the group of 175 individuals was 33.98 years (SD=7.85), with a

the differences were only between the Control group and the No protocol group
(p=0.033). Percentage-wise, there was a reduction of stress levels in the SSL2 of
44% for the No protocol group and 37% for the Protocol group. In the SSL3 at
follow-up the reduced stress levels were maintained, with a 37% reduction for the No
protocol group and 29% for the Protocol group. Cohen's index showed that the No
protocol group obtained the strongest effect, with d of 1.95 for the SSL2,
equivalent to "enormous effect" and in the follow-up, the d of 2.59, also
corresponding to the same classification. Regarding the Protocol group, stress was
reduced by 37%, with an index of 1.36 in the SSL2. </p><p>In the analysis of the subjects with self-reported prior morbidities (52), the No
protocol group (21) obtained better results than the Protocol group (17) in the

(F=3.24/p=0.048), according to the repeated measures ANOVA. In Tukey's test it was
found that this difference was between the Control group and the No protocol group
(p=0.045). Percentage-wise the No protocol group achieved a large stress reduction
(37%) equivalent to Cohen's d index of 1.21 (very large effect). </p><p>The points most used in the No protocol group were the same points (Kidney, Brain
Stem, Shen Men, Liver Yang 1 and 2) with the addition of points for local pain
(Cervical, Lumbar), points to balance the meridians (Stomach, Spleen, Liver, Lung),

maintenance of the results at the 15 day follow up<sup>(<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>. To compare the effect sizes between the two
studies, only data from subjects with high levels of stress were used. The
percentages of stress reduction in the present study were higher for the No protocol
group (44%) with maintenance of the reduction at the follow-up of 37%. The effect
size for the No protocol group was 1.95 (very large effect) and was even higher at
the follow-up, with d index of 2.59. </p><p>As there was a higher prevalence of people with comorbidities in the No protocol
group, it was asked, among other things, whether only six weeks of treatment was
sufficient to determine differences between the results of the two Intervention
groups. To be able to comprehend the complexity of the issue, a survey was made of
recent studies on auriculotherapy for the treatment of psychological conditions such
as anxiety and stress and some references were found. </p><p>Auriculotherapy studies were conducted to evaluate preoperative anxiety reduction
with just a single session. The Relaxation point group was compared to the Shen Men
group and one Sham group<sup>(<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup>.
Another study evaluated the same relaxation point with acupressure, in a single
session, to decrease anxiety and stress in patients with gastrointestinal problems
in prehospital transportation<sup>(<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>.
Auricular acupuncture has also been used to control acute anxiety in dental
extraction. A single session was performed comparing auriculotherapy with the
intranasal medication midazolam, placebo acupuncture and a control group without
treatment<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Some trials were found for stress, in which the number of sessions ranged from seven
to eight, with one per week. A clinical trial was performed to decrease anxiety and
stress levels in university students using two auricular points (Shen Men and
Brainstem), with one per week, for seven weeks, using mustard seeds<sup>(<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup>. Another study demonstrated the
efficacy of auriculotherapy in eight sessions with the same points as the previous
protocol (Shen Men and Brainstem) using semi-permanent needle in 41 subjects
belonging to the nursing staff of the Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in
S&#x000e3;o Paulo<sup>(<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>. A single-blind
randomized clinical trial was conducted with 71 nursing students to evaluate the
efficacy of auricular points (Brainstem and Shen Men) to reduce stress and anxiety.
Eight sessions, one per week, with semi-permanent needles were performed<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>According to the studies presented, the number of sessions may vary according to the
proposal of the clinical trial, and in the present study 12 sessions of
auriculotherapy over six weeks were proposed. It is not possible to affirm, however,
whether the higher percentage of improvement in the No protocol group could achieve
a statistical difference with the Protocol group, if the treatment time had been
longer.</p><p>In the analysis by subgroup it was observed that the stress levels of people with
prior self-reported morbidities were not reduced in the Protocol group, with this
achieved only in the No protocol group. The Protocol group could not cover another
condition that was not stress or some disharmonies associated with some points of
the protocol, being very effective especially in healthy people. Regarding the
follow-up at 30 days, in the analysis of the positive residual effect of
auriculotherapy, the subjects who did not have chronic morbidities were those who
were best able to maintain this improvement. Patients presenting morbidities could
not sustain the improvement in the post-treatment. </p><p>Related to this, there is no consensus in the literature about how many sessions
would be required to obtain the best result from therapies such as acupuncture and
auriculotherapy in relation to chronic diseases<sup>(<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup>. Auriculotherapy may be a supporting technique for the
treatment of chronic diseases and treatments considered to be of longer duration,
such as four to six weeks<sup>(<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup>. In
this sense, it is suggested that longitudinal studies be conducted in the future,
with treatment and follow-up of longer duration, so that the more lasting residual
effects of individualized auriculotherapy can be carefully evaluated, especially in
stressed subjects that present some prior morbidity.</p><p>Other therapies have been used for the control of stress, such as cognitive
behavioral therapy, meditation programs, guidance for changing lifestyle, such as
smoking cessation, attention to nutrition, physical exercise and blood pressure
control. Coping with stress may involve a variety of techniques and procedures the
purpose of which would be to help workers to deal better with their symptoms.
Guidance on relaxation, such as biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, and
cognitive-behavioral skills training<sup>(<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup> are recommended. </p><p>The meditation practices for stress reduction have been researched in depth and a
meta-analysis of the clinical trials has been carried out which covered a broad
spectrum of subjects with comorbidities (cancer, cardiopathy, depression, anxiety,
etc.) and stress. The proposed intervention was a collective meditation program that
sought to alleviate the suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and
psychiatric disorders. The technique achieved an effect size for the reduction of
physical symptoms of d=0.42 in 566 subjects in nine different studies (p&#x0003c;0.0001).
An effect size of d=0.50 was also found for 18 studies with 894 subjects
(p&#x0003c;0.0001) regarding psychological symptoms<sup>(<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>Another study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of acupuncture
to treat Post Traumatic Stress disorder. The subjects were divided into three
randomized groups (Acupuncture, Cognitive behavioral therapy and Control/waiting
list). Both Intervention groups achieved statistical differences between the pre-
and post-treatment, with the Acupuncture group achieving an effect size of d=1.29,
similar to the Cognitive-behavioral therapy group (d=1.42). The reduction in
symptoms was maintained at the follow-up of 3 months for both
interventions<sup>(<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup>. </p><p>In terms of effect size and percentage of improvement, the result obtained by the
Auriculotherapy group was similar or even better in relation to decreasing stress
levels compared to other techniques. The opportunity to encounter some of the
benefits of the technique for minimizing stress symptoms and improve well-being was
provided to those who agreed to participate in the trial. Interventions such as
auriculotherapy, which has the potential to be easily learned by nurses and
healthcare professionals, are interesting proposals as they reduce costs and provide
effective health promotion alternatives. Further studies aimed at the economic
evaluation of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit are essential so that
auriculotherapy may become more widespread, recognized and included in the various
healthcare sectors, since there is already legislation that regulates the use of
multi-professional acupuncture by the Brazilian National Health System
(SUS)<sup>(<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The answers found in this study demonstrated that auriculotherapy with and without a
protocol was effective in reducing levels of stress according to Vasconcelos' Stress
Symptoms List. Better results were found in the No protocol group compared to the
Protocol group, regarding the effect size and the percentage of change,
demonstrating that individualized auriculotherapy expands the scope of the
technique, especially among those who presented higher stress and prior morbidities.
The protocol of auricular points proposed for reducing stress levels was effective
and the Kidney, Shen Men, Brainstem points in toning and the Liver Yang 1 and 2 in
sedation were sufficient to produce positive results in 12 sessions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gatti</surname><given-names>MFZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Le&#x000e3;o</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>MJP</given-names></name><name><surname>Puggina</surname><given-names>ACG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison between anxiety and stress levels displayed by and
