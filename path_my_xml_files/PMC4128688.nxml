However, few exercise programs specifically tailored to enhance limits of stability exist. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether a therapeutically designed intervention, Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB), could improve limits of stability in older adults. A secondary purpose was to examine concomitant change in limits of stability and physical performance as a result of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A single-group design was used in which 145 community-dwelling older adults (average age: 75 years) were enrolled in TJQMBB classes, participating twice weekly for 48 weeks. Primary outcome measures were three indicators of limits of stability (LOS) (endpoint excursion, movement velocity, and directional control), with secondary measures of physical performance being Timed Up and Go and 50-foot speed walk (in seconds), which were assessed at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks.

Eligible participants participated in a full 60-minute TJQMBB class session taught by a trained instructor twice per week for 48 consecutive weeks. In terms of the training protocol, each session began with Tai Ji Quan-based movement warm-up exercises (5&#x02013;10 minutes), followed by teaching and practicing the core components (described in the following section) (40&#x02013;45 minutes), and ending with a simple set of breathing exercises (3&#x02013;5 minutes).</p><p>The training protocol involves a core set of adapted &#x0201c;Yang Style&#x0201d;<xref rid="b22-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Tai Ji Quan-based forms with built-in practice variations and a subset of mini therapeutic movements aimed at stimulating and integrating musculoskeletal and sensory systems via performance of self-initiated Tai Ji Quan movements. Exercise sessions were structured from an easy-to-difficult learning-and-practice progression with an emphasis on within-session practice integration of forms, variations of the forms, and mini movements. Both seated and standing exercises were implemented, with seated exercises emphasizing weight shift, trunk rotation, transitioning from sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, and standing exercises focusing on the features described in the following section.</p><p>During each session, participants practiced choreographed Tai Ji Quan forms/movements (eg, Part Wild Horse&#x02019;s Mane) while engaging in controlled circular ankle sways (ie, lateral, anterior&#x02013;posterior, medial&#x02013;lateral together) that moved the center of gravity progressively toward and near the edge of the base of support with planted feet; trunk-driven rotational (laterally and posteriorly) weight shift; plantar/dorsiflexion during transitioning between moves; reactive and proactive (anticipatory) postural adjustments in response to self-induced perturbed actions on either &#x0201c;fixed support&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;change-in-support&#x0201d;;<xref rid="b25-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and active and coordinated eye&#x02013;head&#x02013;hand movements.</p><p>Throughout the training and practice, emphasis was placed on (1) an interplay between stability (static movements) and instability (self-induced movement perturbations) in performing each form/move; (2) functional ankle-based training by mimicking reaching, tilting, stepping, and turning tasks; and (3) a variable approach that stressed practice variations in movement speeds, range of joint motion, movement directions and patterns, and base of foot support.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was limits of stability, which consisted of three indicators: (1) endpoint excursion; (2) movement velocity; and (3) directional control, assessed by computerized dynamic posturography (Balance Master<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System; NeuroCom<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Clackamas, OR, USA). Endpoint excursion assesses the limits of self-initiated movements as participants shift or lean their center of gravity toward the theoretical limit (100%) in eight prespecified target directions without loss of balance (scores expressed as a percentage; % LOS). Movement velocity assesses the average speed of the center of gravity movement from the center to the eight targets (scores expressed as degrees/second). Directional control provides a measure of movement accuracy by comparing the amount of movement toward the target to the amount of extraneous movement (scores expressed as % of 100). Higher values in all three indicators indicate better limits of stability. Reliability of limits of stability has been established<xref rid="b26-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> or shown in previous studies.<xref rid="b21-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b27-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In this study, 24-week test&#x02013;retest reliability (correlation) ranged from 0.52&#x02013;0.64 (0.57 for endpoint excursion, 0.52 for movement velocity, and 0.64 for directional control).</p><p>Secondary measures included physical performance measures of the: (1) Timed Up and Go test<xref rid="b28-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and (2) 50-foot speed walk, adopted from the Physical Performance Test.<xref rid="b29-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Timed Up and Go measured the time (in seconds) taken to rise from a chair, walk 10 feet (3 m), return, and sit down, with a lower time indicating better mobility. The 50-foot speed walk measured the time (in seconds) it took participants to walk as quickly as possible 25 feet out and 25 feet back. The 6-month test&#x02013;retest reliability was 0.82 for Timed Up and Go and 0.91 for the 50-foot walk test, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Intervention outcomes were analyzed on a sample size of 145 participants who provided at least two data points (baseline, 24-week, and/or 48-week follow-up). Incomplete data were handled through the last observation carried forward method. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) were performed to describe the study sample characteristics. Coefficient of variation was calculated for each variable across time as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean, multiplied by 100. Minimal detectable change (MDC) scores were calculated for each of the limits of stability indicators to determine whether the change score was at or above the minimal level of detectible change. MDC is based on the standard error of measurement and calculated at a 95% confidence interval (MDC<sub>95</sub>) using the formula of:

In the latent curve analysis, the primary interest was on the following estimates: (1) slope means on each of three limits of stability indicators and (2) a slope-to-slope correlation between each of the limits of stability indicators and the two physical performance measures. Given the single-group intervention design, change at 48 weeks from baseline was estimated for the indicators of endpoint excursion and directional control using the pooled estimates from prior studies.<xref rid="b21-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b27-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Assuming an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power to detect 7% LOS points difference in endpoint excursion and 8% of 100 points in directional control with an anticipated dropout rate of 30% for the 48-week intervention, a minimal sample size of 70 participants for the TJQMBB was planned.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The results showed that 48 weeks of TJQMBB training significantly improved older adult limits of stability as reflected in increases in the indicators of movement excursion, velocity, and control, and that increased limits of stability were concomitantly associated with improved physical performance. Thus, with no significant adverse events during the study period, it appears that the intervention is an appropriate one for this at-risk population.</p><p>While cross-sectional studies that showed that older adult practitioners of Tai Ji Quan tended to exhibit better stability limits compared to nonpractitioners<xref rid="b31-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> provided early nonintervention data on the potential of Tai Ji Quan to enhance limits of stability, more recent intervention studies from the author&#x02019;s group that integrated limits of sway training demonstrated the benefit of this focused Tai Ji Quan program for improving limits of stability in older adults and patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.<xref rid="b21-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b27-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In contrast, other Tai Ji Quan-based studies, ranging from 4 to 12 months of intervention,<xref rid="b33-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have not shown significant improvements in postural stability measures in older adults. The TJQMBB program differs from the programs in these other studies in a clinically important way in that this approach transforms traditional martial arts-based training into a therapeutically oriented training paradigm that specifically emphasizes the practice of deliberate, voluntarily controlled Tai Ji Quan postural actions. These actions include manipulation of the center of gravity movements, variations in the base of support, and adaptation training with reactive and proactive actions to self-induced perturbations, with the purpose of increasing the sway envelope and thereby expanding the limits of stability, with the ultimate goal of reducing the risk of falling.</p><p>Although there are currently no guidelines for gauging clinically meaningful change in the measures of limits of stability, this 48-week, twice-per-week training schedule intervention appears to have provided a substantive change over time in the measures used in this study: 32% on endpoint excursion, 68% on movement velocity, and 19% on directional control. In addition, MDC was demonstrated in all three outcomes after the intervention. Improvements in these limits of stability indicators support the potential for the TJQMBB program to address problems of improper weight shifts that are observed in elderly people residing in long-term care.<xref rid="b35-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Consistent with findings from a cross-sectional study,<xref rid="b5-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the results demonstrate that improved measures on limits of stability through this Tai Ji Quan training in older adults was sufficiently sensitive to elicit change in clinical measures of balance and mobility, suggesting that training with TJQMBB offers the potential to improve functional activities and activities of daily living, including sit-to-stand, walking, turning, and stand-to-sit tasks.</p><p>The author&#x02019;s intervention approach linking martial-arts-based Tai Ji Quan to clinical and functional training of balance in older adults offers some practical implications. From an applied perspective, the training approach used in this study can be readily introduced in various settings. For example, as an effective balance training modality, TJQMBB can be readily adopted in diverse communities for the purpose of preventing falls<xref rid="b36-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and in health care settings to assist patients with balance disorders and fall risk problems.<xref rid="b21-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Uniquely different from all other existing Tai Ji Quan-based programs, TJQMBB also has a specific, tailored clinical focus in that training incorporates therapeutic approaches such as closed and open kinetic chain movements;<xref rid="b38-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> motor control mechanisms through manipulation of movement magnitude, speed, direction, and base of support; and training of functional activities that take into account interactions between individuals, tasks at hand, and environmental constraints imposed on the tasks.<xref rid="b23-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These specific training features thus make the program amenable and applicable to clinical training and rehabilitation that address neuromuscular and movement disorders in patients with balance and gait problems and who are at high risk of falls. The clinical relevance of the program, therefore, is apparent.</p><p>The mechanism by which the training protocol improves the limits of stability indicators in this study was not explored and therefore remains unclear. Limits of stability is known to be influenced by a number of physiological and biomechanical factors,<xref rid="b4-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> including lower extremity strength, range of ankle motion, and cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the feet,<xref rid="b2-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> acting either alone or in combination. Through integration of Tai Ji Quan and physical therapy, the protocol in this study puts great emphasis on controlled weight shifting and ankle movement sway, alternation between a narrow stance and a wide stance to continually change the base of support, rotational trunk-driven movements, and dorsiflexion and plantar flexion during movement transitioning. These therapeutically tailored training features may have made an impact on important sensorimotor elements that contribute to enhanced limits of stability. Therefore, it is plausible that improvement in the limits of stability performance may be attributed to unmeasured improvements in flexion/extension ankle torques, the range of ankle motion, movement recovery strategies, or sensory integration &#x02013; features that are inherent in TJQMBB training. Some of these mechanisms of action may be revealed by evaluating the kinematics of body movement or conducting kinetic analysis of these ankle swing-based static and dynamic movement exercises, thus offering a better understanding of the movement strategies and forces contributing to the intervention-induced change in limits of stability.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Its design does not include a control condition, making it difficult to draw a firm conclusion regarding the true intervention effect of TJQMBB on limits of stability. Therefore, the results should be corroborated by future clinical randomized controlled trials. Given the importance of plantarflexor muscle strength in limits of stability,<xref rid="b10-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> another limitation is the lack of a measure of ankle muscle strength, which precludes the opportunity to examine the role of ankle strength in the observed improved limits of stability outcomes. Finally, the study used theoretical limits of stability values derived from computerized dynamic posturography that correspond to the maximum range in which center of gravity can be moved safely without changing the base of support.<xref rid="b26-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, the capacity of stability limits may vary depending on the task performed;<xref rid="b23-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> therefore, consideration of performance-based or functional limits of stability resembling real-world situations may be needed in future assessments.<xref rid="b39-cia-9-1261" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TJQMBB program, a transformed protocol of traditional Tai Ji Quan training approaches, was found to improve limits of stability in older adults, and the improved limits of stability were associated with improved functional performance. Within the limitations of the current study, the combined results provide promising preliminary data that suggest the potential utility of TJQMBB for increasing limits of stability in older adults, thereby enhancing functional performance of habitual daily activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work presented in this paper is supported by a research grant
