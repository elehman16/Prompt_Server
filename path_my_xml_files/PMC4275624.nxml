This is a disease that requires lifelong self-care because self-care and improved quality of life is cost effective. This study is aimed to determine the impact of self-care education program on reducing HbA1c, type 2 diabetic patients and was conducted in Zahedan.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This is an experimental study done on 138 diabetic female patients in Zahedan city, in 2011 (1390). This sampling method of patients was based on inclusion and exclusion criteria of the Diabetes Center, at Hazrat Ali Asghar Hospital (AS) in Zahedan. Samples were divided randomly in to two groups: 69 cases and 69 controls. Data collected included validity and reliability confirmed questionnaire. Checklist was based on patients &#x02018;performance of reporting and (HbA1c) testing. Before the educational intervention, the checklist of questions for recording the (HbA1c) test for both the groups were completed, and study samples received 5 sessions of education (with the group discussion and film show) for a month. However, the control group received only routine training. Three months after the educational intervention, both groups completed the questionnaire and the check list and data using SPSS software and the appropriate tests were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Findings showed that the mean domain scores of area of knowledge, attitude and practice educational groups, were recorded as (46.6 &#x000b1; 8.57, 46.5 &#x000b1; 0.86 and 29.06 &#x000b1; 10.02), respectively. And after education scores of knowledge, attitude and practice were recorded as (52.80 &#x000b1; 2.20, 12.98 &#x000b1; 1.02 and 39.69 &#x000b1; 4.74), respectively, and in study group significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0/001) was seen.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Self-care training in striation leads to improve knowledge, attitude and self-care performance of the study samples and also improves the average (HbA1c).

One of the reasons why patients do not take action to control their disease is because of lack of awareness.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Several studies have concluded that the lack of knowledge about self care skills, and correct information or lack of understanding of the treatment program. One of the important aspects is non-compliance and adherence to the treatment plan.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, there should not be too much emphasis on knowledge.

As was mentioned that sports play an important role in reducing hemoglobinA1c, therefore, exercises appropriate to the age and physical condition of patients with diabetes and encouraging them to do the exercises regularly are recommended.

The results of this study showed that training based on participation and learner's interaction, using a CD includes learners&#x02019; attitudes and beliefs. In order to promote diabetes self care behaviors can be useful. Perhaps it could be based on needs assessment, learning content with collaborative and educational CDs used in the training process. So, it is suggested, offering training programs can be designed in accordance with the characteristics of the social and cultural center of the region, effective educational intervention using behavior patterns to reduce complication slate morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients is suggested. Future studies should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>I have thanked all participants in this project respected hospital management of Hazrat Ali Asghar (AS) and diabetes clinic personnel who have contributed their sincere cooperation during execution of this project.</p><p>This project is part of the first author's PhD thesis at Terabit Modares University and also the Research Project of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences Research fund of this project has been paid by these two centers.</p><p>There is no conflict of interest in connection with the submitted manuscripts.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Media Backgrounder Diabetes in the developing world</article-title><year>2010</year><date-in-citation>Last accessed 2011 May 02</date-in-citation><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.worlddiabetesfoundation.org">http://www.world diabetes foundation.org</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Farshchi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Esteghamati</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sari</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kebriaeezadeh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdollahi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorkoosh</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Khamseh</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Aghili</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Keshtkar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ebadi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The cost of diabetes chronic complications among Iranian people with type 2 diabetes mellitus</article-title><source>J Diabetes Metab Disord</source><year>2014</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>42</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24593991</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Show</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sicree</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmer</surname><given-names>PZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030</article-title><source>Diabetes Res Clin Pract</source><year>2010</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19896746</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moradi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerman</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Rohani</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Salari</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Association between diabetes complications and leukocyte counts in Iranian patients</article-title><source>J Inflamm Res</source><year>2012</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22334791</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marshal</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Flybjerg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevention and early detection of vascular complications of diabetes</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2006</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>475</fpage><lpage>80</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation</collab><article-title>Diabetes action now: An initiative of World Health Organization International Diabetes Federation</article-title><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2012 May 02</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
