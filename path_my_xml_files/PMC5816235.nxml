injection on the possibility of pregnancy in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles was first
noticed in 1991 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many researchers analyzed its
effect on the pregnancy rate in IVF cycles but contradictory results were achieved (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). One of its
contradiction reasons is attributed to the selection of different thresholds for
progesterone (0.9-3 ng/dl) in different studies. Another reason is the fact that most
studies have been done retrospectively (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Also, the
effect of elevated progesterone level on the day of HCG injection on the pregnancy rate and
the mechanism of this effect is unclear, but a premature rise in progesterone level seems to
have a negative impact on implantation and pregnancy by desynchronizing the endometrium
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Despite pituitary suppression by gonadotropin
releasing hormones (GnRH) analogs, the prevalence of premature luteinizing hormone surge in
assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles is less than 2%; however, delayed progesterone
elevation in the follicular phase that is caused by premature luteinizing hormone secretion,
still occurs in 38% of IVF cycles. </p><p>Although the primary role of progesterone is to support the luteal phase, fundamental
research have shown a modest rise in the level of progesterone at the end of the follicular
phase is due to physiological reasons and is associated with ovulation time and may even be
essential for follicular maturation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the latest
meta-analysis conducted in 2013, several clinical questions remain unanswered in this
context, these questions include the following: 1) what is the incidence of elevated
progesterone level? 2) Does the progesterone elevation depend on ovarian response (low,
moderate, high)? 3) Does the progesterone elevation on the day of HCG injection in the fresh
cycles reduce the pregnancy rate as compared to frozen cycles (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)?</p><p>Considering the contradictory results obtained from published literature and the importance
of pregnancy rates of IVF cycles, we decided to compare pregnancy rates in fresh and frozen
cycles in women with elevated progesterone level in a prospective randomized study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Infertile women, who were candidated for ART referring to Omid Fertility Center and
Shariati Hospital from January to April 2016 enrolled in this double-blind, randomized
clinical trial. A demographic form of medical records was filled for each participant.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: uterine anomaly or previous uterine surgery, oocyte donation,
azoospermia, severe endometriosis, previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, conditions
affecting the reproductive status. </p><p>After an ultrasound examination in order to ensure a thin endometrium, lack of ovarian
cysts, and antral follicle count analysis, gonadotropin administration on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
or 3<sup>rd</sup> day of menstrual cycle was started. When the follicular size reached to 14
mm, GnRH antagonist, Cetrorelix (Cetrotide, MERCK, Germany) 250 &#x000b5;g/ day was prescribed.</p><p>After detection of three or more follicles measuring 17 mm, 10,000 units HCG (Pregnyl,
MERCK, Germany) was injected intramuscularly and ultrasound guided oocyte retrieval was
performed 36 hr later. In all participants blood progesterone level was measured using Vidas
method (Automated Immunoanalyser BIOMERIEUX, France) before HCG injection. </p><p>Women with a progesterone level &#x02265;1.8 ng/dl were randomly divided into two groups according
to the random allocation software. The transfer was conducted in the fresh and frozen cycles
in group A and B, respectively. In group A, a total of 1 or 2 blastocysts (grade A) were
transferred at 5<sup>th</sup> day by two infertility clinicians. Luteal phase support was
carried out for all participants by 100 mg Endometrin vaginal suppositories (FERRING,
Switzerland) twice a day plus daily intramuscular injection of 50 mg of progesterone
(Aboreihan, Iran). In group B, all embryos were cryopreserved by vitrification and after two
menstrual cycles, endometrial preparation was performed. Estradiol valerate 6 mg/ day was
begun from day three of menstrual cycle till the endometrial line of 8 mm. Then, 100 mg
Endometrin vaginal suppositories was prescribed twice a day. A total of 1 or 2 grade A
thawed blastocysts were transferred by two infertility clinicians after 5 days of progestin
administration. Progestrone injection was the same as group A. </p><p>Chemical pregnancy was defined as a positive &#x003b2;hCG 16 days after the embryo transfer,
clinical pregnancy was described a gestational sac with a live fetus on ultrasound 5 wk
after transfer and pregnancies with a gestational age greater than 24 wk was considered as a
live birth. </p><p>
<bold>Ethical consideration</bold>
</p><p>The protocol was approved by the Tehran University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee
(IR.TUMS.MEDICINE.REC.1395. 1251). Informed consent has been achieved from all participants. </p><p>
<bold>Statistical analysis</bold>
</p><p>The main outcome of the study was the clinical pregnancy based on the reference that
pregnancy rate in fresh and frozen groups were 10% and 47%, respectively (9).According to
that, the sample size was estimated 36 individuals in each group, after taking into account
a=0.05 and power of 95%. Chi-Square or Fisher Test, Independent <italic>t</italic>-test and
one-way ANOVA were used to show independence of grouped variables, to compare the mean
between the two independent groups and to compare between several independent groups,
respectively. The relationship between the pregnancy outcome and effective variables was
calculated using multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for confounding variables.
All the analyses were carried out using STATA software v.13 and p&#x02264;0.05 was considered as
statistically significant level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 982 patients with ART cycles were assessed for the eligibility criteria. In
these cycles, the progesterone level was measured on the HCG day and 89 cycles had a
progesterone level of &#x02265;1.8 ng/ dl with the incidence rate of 9%. A total of 17 women decided
to withdraw from the treatment process and finally, 72 women were enrolled in the study
(n=36/group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics
(age, BMI, and AMH) of both study groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table
I</xref>).</p><p>The number of chemical pregnancy like clinical pregnancies in B and A was 15 (41.66%) and
17 cases (47.22%), respectively. The number of live birth in both groups was 15 cases
(41.66%). Univariate analysis with the use of chi-square test demonstrates that there is no
statistically significant difference between pregnancies and live birth rate in both B and A
group (p=0.4, p=0.54) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table II</xref>)., although 2
abortions occurred in fresh cycles, it was not statistically significant (p=0.3). All
pregnancies were a singleton.</p><p>The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the age was the only
variable affecting the occurrence of live birth pregnancy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table III</xref>), so with 1 yr increase in age, the chance of pregnancy is significantly
reduced by 16% from age 30 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).
Chi-square analysis showed that there was no a significant relationship between these two
variables in terms of the relationship between ovarian response and progesterone level&#x02265;1.8
and live birth pregnancy (p=0.54). According to the results, 2 cases (2.78%) had less than 4
eggs, 28 cases (38.89%) had 4-15 eggs, and 42 cases (58.33%) had more than 15 eggs. They
were defined as poor, normal, and high ovarian response, respectively</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of participants (n=36/group)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

live birth in patients with high progesterone level in both fresh and frozen cycles.
Mechanism of action of elevated progesterone level on pregnancy outcomes in ART cycles is
still controversial (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A recent systematic meta-analysis conducted on 60,000 ART cycles in 2016,
suggested the probability of the significant decrease in the pregnancy outcome in patients
with elevated progesterone level in ART cycles by taking GnRH agonists and gonadotropins on
the day of HCG injection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Various studies referred
to very different threshold levels of 0.9-3 ng/ml as the negative effects of elevated
progesterone level in assisted reproductive cycles (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). </p><p>Park <italic>and co-workers</italic> in 2015 examined the factors contributing to the
increase in progesterone level on the day of HCG injection. These factors were as the
following: level of estradiol on the day of HCG injection, number of follicles &#x02264;14 mm,
number of oocytes obtained by a puncture and the ovary sensitivity. They stated that level
of basic follicle-stimulating hormone; estradiol, age, body mass index and type of treatment
protocol are ineffective (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In our study, there
was no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy and live birth in patients with high
progesterone level (&#x02264;1.8) between fresh and frozen cycles. Most studies that support the
negative effects of progesterone in ART cycles were retrospective studies. In a study by
Martinez Francisca <italic>and </italic>colleagues (2009-2014) on 1896 ART cycles, no
relationship has been found between elevated progesterone levels on the day of HCG injection
and the clinical pregnancy. This study was also conducted prospectively (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). </p><p>Another prospective study that examined the effects of progesterone and progesterone to
estradiol ratio (P/E2) on the pregnancy rate was conducted by Shalom-Paz <italic>et
al</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In this study, P/E2 of less than
0.45 was associated with an increase in the chance of live birth pregnancy and elevated
progesterone level alone had no effect on the pregnancy rate. They stated that successful
implantation depends on estradiol level, endometrial thickness and synchronization of the
embryonic stage, decidualization and endometrial receptivity and also expressed that in
patients with excessive ovarian response, elevated progesterone level is associated with
elevated estradiol level that prevents the negative effects of elevated progesterone level
on implantation, thus it has no negative effect on live birth pregnancy. Perhaps the
negative effects of high levels of progesterone and P/E2 ratio are somewhat modified 5 days
after the transfer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Highly variable thresholds that have been defined for high levels of progesterone and its
negative effects could indicate that the negative effects of this hormone surge may depend
on other factors and measuring progesterone alone is not a good predictive factor. In our
study, most of the cycles had normal and above normal ovarian response (only two cycles had
the poor ovarian response), which supports the hypothesis that elevated progesterone level
in patients with poor ovarian response may be raised as a bad predictive factor and not in
all patients. </p><p>However, considering the low number of poor ovarian response, the results of our study are
not generalizable to this group of patients. In our study, the pregnancy rate was equal in
both groups. Although, frozen cycles were not affected by the progesterone levels. The only
difference was observed in the abortion rate, which was zero in the frozen group, although
this value was not significant statistically. </p><p>There was a significant difference between the number of oocytes and mature oocytes between
two groups, but they could not confound the final results. Because of similar basic
characteristics like age, body mass index, AMH level in two comparison groups and
computerized random allocation the results can be considered valuable for interpretation.
Even similar pregnancy rates can support this evidence. </p><p>In line with the results of our study, Ghasemi-Nejad and co-workers who conducted a study
on high levels of progesterone and the pregnancy rate among Iranian patients with tubal
infertility and PCO showed that elevated progesterone level also had no effect on pregnancy
rate, which can be indicative of other factors involved in the interpretation of the
elevated progesterone level (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to our study, it seems that in patients with appropriate pregnancy conditions
(good prognosis), it's better not to cancel the cycle simply because of the elevated
progesterone level. The physician should decide for each patient considering overall
conditions, because the frozen cycle may impose a more financial burden, increased stress
and psychological pressure among couples</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the patients as well as the staff of Infertility department
