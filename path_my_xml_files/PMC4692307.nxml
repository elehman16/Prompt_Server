However, 40%&#x02013;50% of individuals have positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fungal cultures at completion of 2 weeks of amphotericin induction therapy. Residual CSF culture positivity has historically been associated with poor clinical outcomes. We investigated whether persistent CSF fungemia was associated with detrimental clinical outcomes in a contemporary African cohort.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold>&#x02003;Human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningitis in Uganda and South Africa received amphotericin (0.7&#x02013;1.0 mg/kg per day) plus fluconazole (800 mg/day) for 2 weeks, followed by &#x0201c;enhanced consolidation&#x0201d; therapy with fluconazole 800 mg/day for at least 3 weeks or until cultures were sterile, and then 400 mg/day for 8 weeks. Participants were randomized to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) either 1&#x02013;2 or 5 weeks after diagnosis and observed for 6 months. Survivors were classified as having sterile or nonsterile CSF based on 2-week CSF cultures.

With amphotericin-based combination antifungal therapy, 10-week mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcosis can be as low as 20%&#x02013;30% [<xref rid="OFV157C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV157C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, at the end of amphotericin treatment, 40%&#x02013;50% of individuals continue to have viable <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has historically been associated with 2- to 3-fold excess risk of detrimental clinical outcomes, including, death, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), or relapse [<xref rid="OFV157C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV157C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>After amphotericin induction therapy, consolidation therapy of fluconazole 400 mg/day is recommended to further suppress infection and support long-term recovery [<xref rid="OFV157C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, 400 mg/day fluconazole is primarily fungistatic, which may allow persistence of the fungus through consolidation therapy [<xref rid="OFV157C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Persistent culture positivity and failure to clear the organism is thought to be detrimental in HIV, setting the stage for paradoxical IRIS upon ART initiation and ultimately increasing the risk of neurologic deterioration and death [<xref rid="OFV157C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However low-grade culture positivity might not be detrimental if fungicidal therapy is continued and sterilizes the CSF as the immune responses are restored with ART.</p><p>Few contemporary studies have investigated the detriments of residual cryptococcal infection after induction therapy. One recent study of 106 South Africans reported that residual fungemia was associated with a 3-fold higher hazard of paradoxical IRIS and an 8-fold higher hazard of culture-positive cryptococcal relapse when using traditionally recommended fluconazole 400 mg/day consolidation therapy [<xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. During a recent clinical trial, we evaluated the association between persistent CSF culture positivity and detrimental clinical outcomes among participants treated with fluconazole 800 mg/day &#x0201c;enhanced consolidation&#x0201d; therapy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population and Cryptococcal Treatment</title><p>The study population included individuals enrolled in the Cryptococcal Optimal Antiretroviral Therapy Timing (COAT) trial (<uri xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</uri>: NCT01075152); a randomized clinical strategy trial of early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (1&#x02013;2 weeks after cryptococcal diagnosis; before hospital discharge) compared with deferred ART initiation (5 weeks after diagnosis; as an outpatient) among HIV-infected, ART-naive individuals with a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis [<xref rid="OFV157C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The COAT trial enrollment began in November 2010 and ended in April 2012, during which time 177 individuals were randomized from 3 sites: (1) Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda; (2) Mbarara National Referral Hospital in Mbarara, Uganda; and (3) GF Jooste Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Ethical approval for the trial was granted from the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, South African Medicines Control Council, and the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Minnesota, Makerere University, University of Cape Town, and Mbarara University of Science and Technology.</p><p>All participants underwent a lumbar puncture for cryptococcal diagnosis, confirmed by a positive CSF cryptococcal culture and/or cryptococcal antigen test. Induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis consisted of amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7&#x02013;1.0 mg/kg) in combination with fluconazole 800 mg daily for 2 weeks, additional intravenous fluids, and electrolyte supplementation. Therapeutic lumbar punctures to manage intracranial pressure were recommended according to treatment guidelines [<xref rid="OFV157C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; in addition, lumbar punctures were conducted after approximately 7 and 14 days of amphotericin to monitor clearance of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Because the day 14 CSF culture result was not known at time of collection, all individuals received an enhanced consolidation regimen consisting of at least 3 weeks of fluconazole 800 mg/day. If individuals were found to have a positive culture at the end of amphotericin, the study protocol recommended 800 mg/day fluconazole be continued until the CSF was known to be sterile, at which time the fluconazole dose was reduced to 400 mg/day. Fluconazole was continued for an additional 8 weeks at 400 mg/day for consolidation therapy, and then fluconazole 200 mg/day for secondary prophylaxis for at least 1 year. Individuals initiated ART with efavirenz and lamivudine plus either zidovudine or stavudine. Stavudine was systematically switched to tenofovir 8 weeks after the cryptococcal diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Fungal Burden and Sterility</title><p>All CSF samples had quantitative fungal cultures performed, as previously described [<xref rid="OFV157C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In brief, CSF was plated onto Sabouraud Dextrose Agar and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C. Quantification of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> fungal burden was conducted using serial 10-fold dilutions of CSF, up to 1:10<sup>5</sup> dilution, and counting colony-forming units (CFUs) of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> seen at the most diluted plate with growth [<xref rid="OFV157C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nonsterility was defined as no sterile cultures observed throughout induction therapy and with at least 1 CSF culture obtained after 12 days of amphotericin. Final culture positivity was unknown for 22 participants who survived induction therapy but who did not have a CSF culture after the 12th day of amphotericin. These 22 participants were excluded from the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with the full cohort using multiple imputation for those 22 persons, including the previous CSF culture values and the rate of early fungicidal activity. Cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen titers were measured using a lateral flow assay (Immy, Inc., Norman, OK) and log<sub>2</sub> transformed for analysis.</p><p>The rate of cryptococcal clearance from the CSF, termed the early fungicidal activity [<xref rid="OFV157C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], was calculated from the first quantitative culture to either a sterile culture or culture taken at the end of induction therapy, whichever occurred first. Subject-specific linear regression analysis was conducted using log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL as the dependent variable and days of amphotericin as the independent variable, as previously described [<xref rid="OFV157C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The early fungicidal activity was estimated as the slope of the subject-specific regression equation multiplied by &#x02212;1, such that a higher positive value denoted a faster rate of clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Clinical Events</title><p>For IRIS events, a panel of 3 clinicians externally adjudicated possible IRIS cases, per the published case definition [<xref rid="OFV157C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with majority consensus. Cryptococcal relapse was defined as any increasing quantitative count on CSF cultures after the end of induction therapy or any positive CSF culture 1 month after the end of induction therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For clinical and demographic characteristics, median values were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and categorical characteristics were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Two mortality endpoints were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards regression: (1) mortality between 2 and 5 weeks and (2) mortality between 2 weeks and 6 months. Differences in all-cause mortality by CSF sterility was assessed, and the proportional hazards assumption was suitable. Culture positivity were assessed for all endpoints, as a binary indicator (sterile vs nonsterile) and as a categorical variable (sterile, 10&#x02013;99 CFU/mL, 100&#x02013;999 CFU/mL, and &#x02265;1000 CFU/mL). Univariate analyses are presented as are models adjusted for COAT trial arm and baseline cryptococcal quantitative culture count. Subgroup analysis was done by COAT randomization arm. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the exclusion of participants with missing 2-week culture sterility using multiple imputation; imputing 40 datasets from a model including age, sex, weight, CSF white cell counts, ART timing, cryptococcal counts during amphotericin therapy, and days on amphotericin. The effect of fluconazole dosing after amphotericin was assessed using a Cox model with a time-varying covariate for fluconazole dose.</p><p>The cumulative incidences of cryptococcal-related IRIS, from the start of ART through 6 months of follow-up, and cryptococcal relapse, from the end of induction therapy through 6 months of follow-up, were compared by 2-week culture positivity. Comparisons of cryptococcal-related IRIS were stratified by timing of ART initiation, and the incidences of cryptococcal-related IRIS and relapse were formally evaluated using Gray's test for competing risks [<xref rid="OFV157C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Among 177 COAT trial participants, 154 survived to the end of 2 weeks of amphotericin-based induction therapy and 132 had observed CSF cultures available for analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV157F1">1</xref>). The family of 1 participant withdrew consent, and vital status through 6 months was known for the remaining participants. A sterile CSF culture occurred in 57% (75 of 132) of participants by the end of amphotericin therapy, and 43% (57 of 132) had continued <italic>C. neoformans</italic> growth (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="OFV157TB1">1</xref>). Individuals achieving 2-week CSF sterility had lower initial CSF quantitative cultures at diagnosis, lower cryptococcal antigen titers, greater CSF white cell counts, and more rapid early fungicidal activity compared with individuals who did not achieve CSF sterility by 2 weeks.

Unlike prior studies, showing markedly worse clinical outcomes with persistent CSF culture positivity, we did not find evidence of increased risk of mortality, paradoxical IRIS, or culture-positive relapse historically associated with positive CSF cultures, when using enhanced consolidation therapy.</p><p>Several studies have reported the association between 2-week CSF culture positivity and worse survival, all when using 400 mg/day fluconazole for consolidation therapy after amphotericin monotherapy or combination therapy [<xref rid="OFV157C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Larsen and colleagues [<xref rid="OFV157C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported, during the pre-ART era, that participants with nonsterile 2-week cultures had 25% 10-week mortality or lost-to-follow-up compared with 13% among participants with sterile cultures. In Thailand, a 3.6-fold greater relative risk of death was observed in individuals with nonsterile CSF (95% CI, 1.9&#x02013;6.4) [<xref rid="OFV157C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a South African cohort, a nonstatistical almost 2-fold higher hazard in 6-month mortality was observed when CSF was found to be nonsterile at a median of 18 days (14% mortality with sterile CSF vs 26% without sterility, <italic>P</italic> = .13) [<xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, prior studies have reported positive cultures being associated with nearly 2-fold higher odds of treatment failure or relapse later during consolidation therapy [<xref rid="OFV157C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 3-fold increased risk of cryptococcal-related IRIS [<xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Unlike prior studies, our data did not demonstrate significantly more detrimental outcomes after incomplete clearance of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> in CSF. Using enhanced consolidation therapy with high-dose fluconazole (800 mg/day) for 3 additional weeks following the end of amphotericin for all patients and until the CSF culture was known to be sterile could be one reason we did not observe significant association. This dosage is modestly fungicidal, compared with 400 mg/day fluconazole used in previous studies, which is fungistatic [<xref rid="OFV157C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The higher dose fluconazole might have slowly eliminated the majority of any remaining fungus in the brain and CSF. Indeed, a phase II clinical trial conducted in Thailand and the United States demonstrated a trend toward lower 6-month mortality when 800 mg/day fluconazole was continued for 8 weeks after induction therapy compared with 400 mg/day fluconazole [<xref rid="OFV157C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This study was not designed to test whether enhanced consolidation therapy led to better clinical outcomes than traditional consolidation therapy, thus future clinical trials are needed to understand which dosing of fluconazole is more favorable.</p><p>Alternative explanations and limitations exist for why we did not observe a significant association between CSF culture positivity and clinical outcomes after cryptococcal meningitis. First, although this study was larger than many prior studies reporting the risk of culture positivity, the relatively modest size of our cohort results in wide 95% CIs for the estimate of risk. Second, some prior studies were conducted before the combination ART era [<xref rid="OFV157C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One hypothesis is that detrimental effects of culture positivity may only be seen in individuals who do not initiate ART promptly. However, in this cohort, the group who deferred ART initiation to 5 weeks had very little difference in mortality by culture positivity until later in follow-up. We did observe, in the group starting ART early, that mortality was non-significantly greater during 2 to 5 weeks of follow-up when the CSF was culture positive. This may be suggestive of increased risk of IRIS when <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> remains at ART initiation [<xref rid="OFV157C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding from our study was that the early fungicidal activity index was not found to be associated with mortality among those who survived amphotericin therapy. The early fungicidal activity has previously been associated with 2-week and 10-week mortality [<xref rid="OFV157C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and, as such, has been used a surrogate marker in many contemporary clinical treatment trials for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [<xref rid="OFV157C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="OFV157C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV157C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most studies evaluating early fungicidal activity have included all participants, whereas we restricted analysis to those who survived 2 weeks of amphotericin induction therapy. This difference could account for the lack association between early fungicidal activity and morality in our cohort, but it should be explored further.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, among individuals with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa, we did not find that residual <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> in the CSF contributed to increased detrimental clinical outcomes when using higher dose fluconazole and initiating ART.
