In this study, we tested the relation between resting-state functional connectivity of brain areas activated during a divergent thinking task (i.e., supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus) and the effect of practice in 32 adolescents aged 15&#x02013;16. Over a period of two weeks, an experimental group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) conducted an 8-session Alternative Uses Task (AUT) training and an active control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) conducted an 8-session rule switching training. Resting-state functional connectivity was measured before (pre-test) and after (post-test) training. Across groups at pre-test, stronger connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and bilateral postcentral gyrus was associated with better divergent thinking performance. The AUT-training, however, did not significantly change functional connectivity. Post hoc analyses showed that change in divergent thinking performance over time was predicted by connectivity between left supramarginal gyrus and right occipital cortex. These results provide evidence for a relation between divergent thinking and resting-state functional connectivity in a task-positive network, taking an important step towards understanding creative cognition and functional brain connectivity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from NWO (open competition program; grant nr. 400-08-023) awarded to E.

The emergence and sophistication of the skills which support flexibility have been interpreted in terms of reorganization of brain networks which aid cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0105780-Luna1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, explorative learning <xref rid="pone.0105780-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and social competence <xref rid="pone.0105780-Blakemore1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, little is known about the relations between flexibility in finding solutions for day-to-day challenges that adolescents face when growing up, and connectivity between brain regions supporting this ability. We therefore examined the relation between flexibility in thinking and functional connectivity at rest, and how this network is sensitive to adaption due to training of flexibility in thinking in adolescents.</p><p>Creativity, which involves the ability to provide solutions that are novel and useful, is a key component of flexible thinking (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0105780-Arden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). Creativity is often operationalized by asking participants to perform tasks relying on divergent thinking, such as the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) in which participants are asked to come up with as many possible alternative uses for daily objects <xref rid="pone.0105780-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Using an adapted version of the alternative uses task (AUT-scanner) Fink et al. <xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> showed involvement of the angular gyrus (AG) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG) during generation of alternative uses of everyday objects. Involvement of (predominately left) parietal-temporal areas like the AG extending into the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the SMG in verbal divergent thinking is a relatively consistent finding across studies with similar paradigms <xref rid="pone.0105780-Arden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Dietrich1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In a recent study, we showed that adolescents and adults engaged the same neural network when thinking of alternative uses of common objects, involving the left AG and bilateral MTG, and left SMG <xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) was more engaged depending on task performance. Adults were more successful in generating alternative uses compared to adolescents, which was reflected by higher levels of PFC activation in adults. These findings are consistent with other studies that pointed towards PFC involvement in divergent thinking, however, the location of activity within the PFC varied between studies (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0105780-Carlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>).</p><p>Prior studies mainly examined the neural correlates of skills that adolescents employ when performing cognitive control tasks (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0105780-Luna2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Somerville1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) but few studies have examined the adaptation of brain networks as an effect of practice or training. Studies that did examine changes in brain functionality as a result of training showed that especially prefrontal and parietal brain regions changed as a result of several days of math training <xref rid="pone.0105780-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or five or six weeks of working memory training <xref rid="pone.0105780-Jolles1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Also, intensive inductive reasoning training altered patterns of functional connectivity between frontal and parietal cortex during rest <xref rid="pone.0105780-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Mackey et al. <xref rid="pone.0105780-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> asked Law School students to participate in a resting state (RS) connectivity study before and after a 3 month Law School Admission Training program. They showed that connectivity between brain regions involved in inductive reasoning, specifically frontal-parietal network areas, were dependent on experience such that they were modified by intensive training. Here we used this approach to examine experience dependent modification of connectivity during rest in adolescents using a creative cognition training paradigm.</p><p>The goal of the current study was twofold: investigate (1) the cross-sectional relation between divergent thinking performance and RS connectivity, and (2) the effects of a divergent thinking training on RS connectivity in adolescents. A prior study investigating divergent thinking and RS connectivity <xref rid="pone.0105780-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> found that divergent thinking was positively related to connectivity within the default mode network, that is to say, larger sum scores on a divergent thinking test (partly similar to the AUT) were related to stronger connectivity between the medial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex. However, this study did not examine connectivity in a task-related network (MTG/AG, SMG, and PFC). In addition, prior research suggested that improvement in task performance as a result of training could be associated with more brain plasticity in adolescence <xref rid="pone.0105780-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, but it is currently unknown how this relates to functional brain connectivity measures. We therefore tested the hypothesis that core regions involved in divergent thinking (MTG [extending into AG], SMG, and MeFG [Medial Frontal Gyrus] as part of the PFC) would show stronger connectivity at rest after a divergent thinking training, relative to a control group.</p><p>We randomly divided 32 adolescents into an experimental or active control group <xref rid="pone.0105780-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Over a period of two weeks, the experimental group conducted an 8-session AUT-training, whereas the active control group conducted an 8-session control training (rule switching), which was similar in time demands and effort but did not put demands on divergent thinking <xref rid="pone.0105780-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. RS connectivity and measures of divergent thinking were assessed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) training. As previous research showed involvement of the MTG (including the AG), SMG, and PFC in divergent thinking, a seed based approach was used to specifically investigate RS connectivity of areas activated during a divergent thinking task in the same participants (i.e., left MTG including the AG, right MTG, left SMG, and bilateral MeFG). Second, an explorative whole-brain approach was used to more generally investigate RS connectivity within brain networks with a strong temporo-parietal or PFC component. We expected divergent thinking to be positively related to RS connectivity of the MTG, SMG, and MeFG at pre-test. Moreover, divergent thinking was expected to improve in adolescents following the AUT-training. In post hoc analyses we tested whether the behavioral training outcomes were related to RS connectivity of the MTG, SMG, and MeFG at the pre-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 32 adolescents (18 male) aged 15 to 16 participated in this study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105780-t001">Table 1</xref> for sample characteristics).

This task measures divergent thinking in the verbal domain. The task consisted of an Alternative Uses (AU) condition and an Object Characteristics (OC) condition. During AU trials participants had to think of as many appropriate alternative and original uses of common objects as possible (e.g., use a shoe as a baseball bat). During OC trials participants had to think of as many ordinary characteristics of common objects as possible (e.g., a shoe fits on a foot). Each trial started with a 3 seconds instruction screen, followed by the target screen that lasted for 15 seconds. Immediately after the target screen, the participants had 3 seconds to indicate the number of generated solutions by pressing a response box button corresponding to &#x02018;0&#x02013;1&#x02032;, &#x02018;2&#x02032;, &#x02018;3&#x02032; or &#x02018;4+&#x02019;. Each trial was preceded by a fixation cross with a jittered duration (0&#x02013;6 seconds). In the context of this study, the behavioral results of the AUT condition were used as an index of verbal divergent thinking. The AUT-scanner consisted of 60 trials divided over three blocks, during which 30 unique words were used (once presented in the AU and once in the OC condition). Two sets of 30 words were created, matched on word length, number of syllabi, and word frequency. A different word set was used during the pre-test and post-test and order of the two word sets was counterbalanced across participants. Each block lasted &#x0223c;7 minutes with a short break in between resulting in a total task time of &#x0223c;30 minutes. The task was programmed in E-Prime (version 2.0).

To this end, divergent thinking scores were related to functional RS connectivity patterns in task-relevant brain regions (bilateral MTG and MeFG, and left SMG) before and after divergent thinking training using a seed-based analyses approach. Moreover, a whole-brain ICA RS analyses was performed to further explore the relationship between divergent thinking and RS connectivity in brain networks with a strong frontal-parietal component. The study resulted in several important findings; (1) stronger connectivity between MTG and bilateral postcentral gyrus was associated with better divergent thinking performance, (2) training did not improve divergent thinking or change RS functional connectivity in the training group, and (3) even though there was no main effect of training on connectivity, the change in divergent thinking performance over time was predicted by connectivity between left SMG and right occipital cortex. The discussion is organized along the lines of these three main findings.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Connectivity patterns and relation with performance at pre-test</title><p>The first question which was addressed was whether brain regions which have previously been implicated in divergent thinking <xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> showed connectivity with each other at rest. For this purpose, we specifically looked at functional connectivity patterns at rest of brain areas activated during the performance of the AUT-scanner in the same participants: the MTG (including the AG), MeFG, and SMG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105780-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). As predicted, the time course of activity within these regions showed significant correlations with each other, across hemispheres (see also <xref rid="pone.0105780-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). These patterns of functional connectivity were further confirmed in a whole-brain resting state analysis, which mirrored previously reported RS networks <xref rid="pone.0105780-Beckmann2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-vandenHeuvel1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>A test for relations between functional connectivity patterns and performance revealed that higher AUT-scanner fluency scores were related to stronger connectivity between the right MTG and the postcentral gyrus. In addition to the seed-based analysis, the whole brain RS ICA analyses did not reveal any additional association between AUT-scanner performance and functional connectivity outside the seed areas. The connection between MTG, a region previously implicated in divergent thinking <xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and postcentral gyrus may aid in simulating possible ways in which objects can be used across cognitive and somatosensory domains, and as such may be helpful in thinking of more alternative uses. A prior study which investigated divergent thinking and RS connectivity already showed that divergent thinking performance moderated connectivity patterns in adults <xref rid="pone.0105780-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, however, this study specifically investigated functional connectivity of the default mode network, not the MTG. Takeuchi et al. <xref rid="pone.0105780-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> found that higher divergent thinking scores were related to stronger connectivity between the MeFG and posterior cingulate cortex. Here, we were able to make use of task-relevant seed areas derived from the same participants when performing the AUT while fMRI data were collected. Extending the prior findings of Takeuchi et al. <xref rid="pone.0105780-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, divergent thinking performance is also associated with stronger connectivity within a task-relevant network, specifically between MTG and the postcentral gyrus.</p><p>An important issue to take into consideration is that the generated alternative uses during the AUT-scanner were not recorded due to methodological difficulty. Hence, only a self-reported fluency estimate was available as a measure of AUT-scanner behavioral performance, not a measure of flexibility, feasibility and originality. Moreover, the observed relation between pre-test RS connectivity of the right MTG and AUT-scanner fluency at pre-test relies on the assumption that the participants correctly and honestly indicated the number of generated alternative uses. Similarly as reported by Kleibeuker et al. <xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, a post-hoc analysis indicated that AUT-scanner fluency correlated with AUT-brick fluency (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.39, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03) and flexibility <italic>(r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005), increasing the confidence in the AUT-scanner as a measure of verbal divergent thinking. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude potential confounding effects of the self-report measure of the number of generated alternative uses in the scanner. Future studies should replicate these findings using verbal creativity measures which can be scored on different creativity dimensions (e.g., flexibility, originality).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Evaluating training outcomes behaviorally</title><p>The second question we addressed was whether a two week training program of divergent thinking would be sufficient to change divergent thinking performance in adolescents, similar to what previously has been shown for adults <xref rid="pone.0105780-Huizinga2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The pre-test to post-test comparison of fluency scores in the scanner resulted in the expected training group x time interaction, however, the findings were in a different direction than anticipated. That is, the experimental group outperformed the active control group at the post test, but this was due to a decrease in performance in the active control group at post-test compared to pre-test. A closer inspection of the training data showed that when evaluating performance across the home training sessions, the AUT-training did not improve in divergent thinking fluency scores. Thus, consistent with the AUT-scanner performance, AUT-training performance stayed the same across sessions, with a slight dip in fluency performance during session four and five. Notably, the active control group outperformed the experimental group at post-test on the task switching task, showing that this group improved in their trained domain (for similar findings see also <xref rid="pone.0105780-Karbach1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>).</p><p>A tentative explanation is that divergent thinking generally decreases over time without training. However, this contrasts behavioral results of prior divergent thinking training studies: effectiveness of a broad range of divergent thinking training programs has been established in a broad range of populations (e.g., children, adolescents, adults), including training programs similar in length and content to the current AUT-training (see meta-analysis <xref rid="pone.0105780-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>). A potential explanation for the lack of a training effect in the expected direction may lie in the invariant repetitive design without external guidance and motivation. Although motivation scores did not change during the training, they were average. It has previously been argued that training programs with less active guidance are negatively related to the training effect size <xref rid="pone.0105780-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Providing active guidance during the training, including information about the creativity construct and the goal of the training may therefore be an essential component of a successful divergent thinking training. Hence, including active guidance and an incentive to maintain high motivation are recommended in future studies.</p><p>We also tested the effects of divergent thinking training on a near transfer task (AUT-brick) and a far transfer task (CAT), but the results showed that performance did not differ between the experimental and control group at post-test. This is not uncommon in training studies <xref rid="pone.0105780-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Thorell1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. That is to say, even though performance on trained tasks is generally well established, transfer to other domains is not consistently found <xref rid="pone.0105780-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. One possibility is that the current task should be seen as a &#x02018;practice&#x02019; task rather than a &#x02018;training&#x02019; task where task difficulty is adapted based on performance. It was previously argued that transfer is only found when task difficulty increases over training <xref rid="pone.0105780-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Karbach1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Connectivity patterns in relation to training</title><p>The final question that we addressed was whether connectivity between brain areas implicated in divergent thinking is dependent on experience and may therefore be modified by training. Contrary to our predictions, the divergent thinking training as compared to the rule-switching (LGT) training was not significantly related to changes in seed-based or whole-brain RS functional connectivity over time. Thus, in comparison to the control group, we did not observe a significant change in seed-based and whole-brain RS functional connectivity patterns after the 8-session AUT-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between RS connectivity and a divergent thinking training. However, prior studies using different cognitive training programs did report RS connectivity changes in adults after 5&#x02013;6 weeks working memory training <xref rid="pone.0105780-Jolles1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or 3 months reasoning training <xref rid="pone.0105780-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A limitation of the current study is that the groups were relatively small, however, training effects on brain activity have previously been observed using similar sample sizes <xref rid="pone.0105780-McNab1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Alternatively, it is possible that training effects on RS connectivity are observed in adults but not in adolescents (see also <xref rid="pone.0105780-Jolles1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>), yet this interpretation is unlikely given the high level of brain plasticity associated with adolescent brain development <xref rid="pone.0105780-Luna2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Future studies should include participant groups of different ages to test this hypothesis.</p><p>When we tested whether behavioral improvement could be predicted by pre-test RS functional connectivity, we found that changes in AUT-scanner fluency were negatively related to connectivity between the left SMG and occipital cortex, suggesting that an anti-correlation between the SMG and occipital cortex may be a predictor of the trainability of divergent thinking. That is to say, we found that a weaker anti-correlation between SMG and occipital cortex was associated with less performance improvement. Anti-correlations between brain areas, also referred to as functional segregation, have previously been associated with better cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0105780-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Koyama1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. While not predicted in advance, this finding may indicate that a stronger functional segregation between the SMG and occipital cortex may benefit the possibility to think of more alternative ways to use objects for a similar interpretation of stronger connectivity predicting negative training outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions and considerations for future studies</title><p>Taken together, the current study showed that divergent thinking performance can be linked to connectivity strength in a task-relevant network in adolescents. Prior studies investigating the neural mechanisms underlying divergent thinking generally show inconsistent findings that are, at least in part, attributed to differences in the operationalization of divergent thinking <xref rid="pone.0105780-Arden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Dietrich1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105780-Sawyer1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, using a nearly similar version of the AUT-scanner, the role of the MTG (including the AG) and the SMG during the AUT has now been established in four separate studies <xref rid="pone.0105780-Fink2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105780-Kleibeuker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We showed that the MTG and the SMG have connectivity patterns which are predictive for divergent thinking performance and changes in divergent thinking performance. This study should be followed up by studies with larger sample sizes, different age selections, and more diverse training programs. Nevertheless, the current study provides the first evidence for the relation between RS functional connectivity and divergent thinking in adolescence and thereby takes an important step in unraveling the relationship between creative cognition and functional brain connectivity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Anna van Duijvenvoorde, Barbara Braams, Claire Stevenson, Laura van Aar, Margot Schel, Rosa Meuwese, Sandy Overgaauw, Sabine Peters, Tim de Wilde, Max van den Boom, Willemijn Plomp and Wouter Weeda for their assistance during the data collection and analyses.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0105780-Luna1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
