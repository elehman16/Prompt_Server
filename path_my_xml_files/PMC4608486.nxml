The study patients were enrolled between January 2012 and January 2013. The mean age was 64&#x000b1;9 years and 88 (58%) were men. All patients were referred for an interventional treatment of paroxysmal AF. A detailed diagnostic work-up was performed in our outpatient department before admission. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board and the ethics committee of the Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz (837.456.13 (9141-F)). All antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of amiodarone, were ceased at least 5 half-lives before the procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Protocol</title><p>Paroxysmal AF was defined according to the current guidelines.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, patients with AF episodes lasting &#x0003e;48 hours that required electric cardioversion were excluded from the study.

The presence of left atrial thrombi was excluded by transesophageal echocardiography in the electrophysiological laboratory directly before the procedure. All patients underwent a standardized PVI procedure. The following catheters were introduced via a right femoral vein access: (1) A steerable decapolar catheter (Inquiry; IBI, Irvine Biomedical, Inc, Irvine, CA) was positioned within the coronary sinus; (2) a circumferential decapolar diagnostic catheter (Lasso; Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) for mapping of the pulmonary veins; and (3) a 3.5 mm externally irrigated-tip ablation catheter (Thermocool; Biosense-Webster). Access to left atrium was achieved by a single transseptal puncture with the 2 catheters placed into the left atrium via the same puncture. A single bolus of 50 IU/kg body weight heparin was administered after transseptal puncture. The activated clotting time was assessed every 30 minutes and maintained within a range of 250 to 350 seconds. A temperature probe was positioned in the esophagus, and the endoluminal temperature was monitored throughout the procedure. For anatomic guidance, a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the left atrium and the PVs was created using the NavX system (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, MN). A circumferential lesion was created around the ipsilateral PVs to achieve simultaneous isolation. PVI was defined by elimination or dissociation of PV potentials recorded on the circumferential PV catheter.</p><p>Ablation was performed with a maximum power output of 30 W using an irrigation rate of 10 to 30 mL/min (0.9% saline infused with the CoolFlow Pump; Biosense-Webster) At the posterior wall, the power was reduced to 25 W. In the coronary sinus, the radiofrequency energy was limited to a maximum of 25 W with a manually adjusted irrigation rate to keep the tip-temperature below 42&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Adenosine Testing</title><p>After demonstration of PVI, all PVs were tested for the presence of dormant conduction by intravenous administration of &#x02265;10-mg adenosine and incremental values increased by 5-mg steps were used until complete AV block was achieved. The induction of &#x02265;3 blocked P waves or a sinus pause of &#x02265;3 seconds was considered to demonstrate an appropriate adenosine dosage. Dormant PV conduction was defined as the transient reappearance of PV activity as recorded in the circumferential PV catheter for at least 2 consecutive beats. In case of the occurrence of dormant conduction, the sites of earliest PV activity were targeted by additional radiofrequency applications with a duration of 90 seconds per application. Afterward, adenosine was readministered with the previous dose that induced dormant conduction. Adenosine testing was performed until the demonstration of persistent PVI in all veins.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedural Termination of AF</title><p>In patients of group B, AF was induced by atrial burst pacing before PVI when the patient did not present in spontaneous AF to the procedure. Burst pacing was started from the midcoronary sinus with a cycle length of 300 ms and gradually shortened until local refractoriness was achieved (loss of local 1:1 capture). If sustained AF was not inducible by at least 3 attempts, the same induction maneuver was performed from the left atrial appendage. After induction, duration of 10 minutes was defined as inducible sustained AF before any ablation was performed. If PVI did not convert the patient to SR, the ablation was continued with the desired procedural target of procedural AF termination was achieved. In this regard, electrogram-guided ablation was performed by targeting areas of short AF cycle length, complex fractionated atrial electrograms, centrifugal activation, and electrogram activation gradients between the distal and the proximal electrodes. Evaluation of electrogram behavior was performed by visual inspection, and no automated software was used to define these areas. After AF termination, no attempts at AF reinduction were performed in any of the patients. If AF termination could not be achieved by ablation, an electric cardioversion was used to restore SR.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-Up</title><p>All patients were seen regularly every 3 months in our outpatient clinic. Before visits, the patients received at least 2 separate 48-hour Holter-ECGs. A detailed history of the patients&#x02019; symptoms suggestive for potential arrhythmia recurrences was taken. In case of undocumented symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia recurrences, documentation by additional external ECG event recordings was performed. A documented symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia episode lasting &#x0003e;30 seconds was defined as recurrence.</p><p>An initial blanking period of 3 months was accepted. The antiarrhythmic drug treatment was not reinitiated after ablation. If patients experienced an early recurrence within the initial 3 months after the procedure, antiarrhythmic drugs were reinitiated for the remaining time in the blanking period. However, all antiarrhythmic drugs were ceased after the end of the blanking period. Patients with an arrhythmia recurrence after the blanking period were considered procedural failure.</p><p>The primary study end point was freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia occurring after the blanking period during a follow-up of 12 months. Secondary end points were procedural complications, PV recovery during redo procedures, and overall arrhythmia-free survival,respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All continuous variables are reported as mean&#x000b1;SD or medians with ranges, whereas categorical variables were summarized as proportions. Categorical variables were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Comparison between groups was performed with either Student <italic>t</italic> test or the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Statistical significance was established at <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05. We assumed a 12-month arrhythmia-free survival of 75% in the adenosine group and 55% in patients assigned to the AF termination group. To observe this difference with a power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;) of 0.8 and an &#x003b1;-level (&#x003b1;) of 0.05, the inclusion of 88 patients in each group was estimated. The study protocol predefined a substantially unexpected finding which is not in accordance with the study hypothesis as a stopping criterion. After the inclusion of 152 patients, we observed a markedly different outcome when compared with what has been expected by the study hypothesis. Therefore, the Institutional Scientific Review Board decided to terminate the study early after a subsequent interim analysis revealed a significantly better outcome of patients randomized to group B. Time-to-arrhythmia recurrence was estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was performed with a statistical software package (SPSS, version 22; IBM, Armonk, NY).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Randomization into both groups was performed in a 1:1 fashion.

In this attempt, several different strategies were investigated, such as elimination of dormant conduction induced by adenosine,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> the implementation of a waiting period after PVI,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> contact force-guided ablation,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and PVI with the target of unexcitable circumferential lesions around the PVs,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> respectively.</p><p>After the initial description of adenosine-mediated transient resumption of PV conduction after isolation,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> several single-center studies have investigated the impact of dormant conduction elimination on the clinical outcome.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, these studies have shown that neither the elimination nor the absence of dormant conduction provides prognostic evidence of persistent durability of PV isolation. Recently, the incidence of dormant conduction after PVI facilitated by nonexcitable circumferential lesions was significantly reduced when compared with that of a conventional approach.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, the lower incidence of dormant conduction was not translated into a higher clinical success rate.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> On the contrary, the same group demonstrated that contact force-guided PVI was not only associated with a reduced prevalence of dormant conduction but also resulted in a significantly improved long-term freedom from recurrent arrhythmias. Therefore, a durable PVI with a single procedure seems to be based on an optimal initial radiofrequency application with the creation of transmural homogenous lesion unsusceptible for adenosine-mediated dormant conduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of Non-PV Triggers</title><p>The incidence of paroxysmal AF triggered and maintained by non-PV sources has been observed in 20% of patients during index ablation and up to 30% of patients at repeat procedures.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These sources can be located throughout both atria and the great thoracic veins. However, the predominant anatomic sites are the superior vena cava, left atrial free wall, the crista terminalis, and the coronary sinus with its endocardial interface, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Because spontaneous activation of AF-initiating triggers is infrequently observed during electrophysiological procedures, provocative maneuvers are required in the vast majority of patients presenting in SR to the procedure. Two fundamentally different strategies are used to evaluate the potential existence of non-PV AF sources after PVI: pharmacological provocation with &#x003b2;-adrenergic agents (eg, isoproterenol) to provoke ectopic arrhythmogenic atrial activity, on the one hand, and AF induction by electric atrial burst stimulation, on the other.</p><p>Theoretically, both approaches to reveal extra-PV sources may have mechanistic disadvantages. Pharmacological provocation with &#x003b2;-adrenergic agents will not only provoke a pathological substrate relevant to AF initiation and perpetuation, but also indubitably influence healthy atrial tissue with the potential to transform physiological cell activity into an arrhythmogenic electric behavior with increased automaticity or enhanced susceptibility to AF persistence. Particularly, the latter one will prevent further evaluation of AF-initiating triggers. In contrast, the evaluation of AF inducibility by atrial burst pacing aims to test a potential capability of the atrial substrate to maintain AF with isolated PVs. Moreover, this approach is also based on the concept that the presence of AF will activate extra-PV sources that become apparent with spontaneous ectopic activity or reinitiations after AF termination. Artificial induction of AF, however, also has inherent limitations by the potential to provoke a clinically nonrelevant arrhythmia activity, particularly with repeated AF induction attempts (with AF begets AF).</p><p>Irrespective to these hypothetical considerations, the application of both techniques has been shown to result in increased success rates.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Thus, successful elimination of arrhythmogenic sources acting as reinitiators or perpetuators after PVI is beneficial for a favorable outcome in patients with paroxysmal AF. However, there are also data demonstrating no different outcomes in patients with and without arrhythmia indicubility testing after PVI.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Potential reasons for this divergent observation are as follows: (1) AF inducibility after PVI rather identify patients with an enhanced substrate susceptibility because of a progressed electric disease and, therefore, patients at a higher risk for AF progression. (2) Identification and ablation of non-PV triggers are challenging, particularly with the presence of multiple foci, and thus inconsistent data may result from different success rates in the elimination of these triggers.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Elimination of Dormant Conduction Versus AF Inducibility Testing</title><p>This study revealed a superior benefit of AF inducibility testing versus evaluation and elimination of adenosine-induced dormant conduction. Although we initially hypothesized the opposite, the following reasons may explain the study findings: (1) in the present study, the elimination of dormant conduction did not result in long-term freedom from electric PV recovery. Thus, the number of recovered PVs identified during the redo procedure did not differ significantly between the adenosine and the inducibility group. Therefore, a theoretically beneficial effect of a higher number of persistent isolated PVs in the adenosine group was not achieved. (2) In the inducibility group, AF persisted after PVI in one third of cases. In these patients, extra-PV sources were mapped and ablated with AF termination in more than three fourths. The extended ablation with the elimination of extra-PV sources and a potential debulking of the substrate may have translated into a higher clinical success rate, particularly during the first year after ablation.</p><p>Additional studies with ablation strategies that provide a high single-procedure PVI persistence rate will more accurately reveal the true incidence of non-PV sources because the number of patients with persistent isolation of all PVs during the first redo procedure will certainly increase.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The presented study has some limitations that may have affected the study findings. First, in the presented study, we used a conventional irrigated-tip catheter without contact-force measurement. However, the use of contact-force catheter may have led to a lower number of adenosine-induced dormant PV reconduction, and thereby to a potentially lower number of PV conduction recurrences during follow-up. Second, in patients who were not inducible for AF before ablation, we did not use isoprenaline or other adrenergic drugs to facilitate AF induction. Thus, extra-PV triggers of AF may have been missed in noninducible patients.</p><p>Because the trial was terminated early for efficacy in the absence of prespecified statistical stopping criteria, the nominal <italic>P</italic> values presented should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Evaluation of AF inducibility and elimination of extra-PV AF sources is superior to sole PV isolation with the adjunct of abolishing potential dormant conduction. The elimination of adenosine-provoked dormant conduction is not associated with a durable electric PV isolation in a substantial number of cases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-at" id="fn01"><p>Presented in part at the 35th Annual Scientific Sessions of the
