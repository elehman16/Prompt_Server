Such cramps, which affect 25%&#x02013;50% of patients, may occur during hemodialysis treatment or at home following dialysis.<sup>(<xref rid="b2-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> Cramps that occur during hemodialysis can lead to shortening of treatment or to reduction of fluid removal which may result in inadequate clearance of waste products, fluid overload, and hypertension.<sup>(<xref rid="b2-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Shortening of as little as one dialysis treatment per week is associated with a statistically significantly increased mortality risk.<sup>(<xref rid="b5-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> Cramps also adversely affect sleep and health-related quality of life and are associated with depression and anxiety.<sup>(<xref rid="b7-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup></p><p>The etiology of cramping in dialysis patients is not well known, but several common triggers have been identified including electrolyte abnormalities, hypovolemia, hypotension, dialysis prescription (blood flow rate and ultrafiltration), and dialysate composition.<sup>(<xref rid="b8-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> Therapeutic maneuvers to manage muscle cramps include intravenous fluids, oral medications, adjustments in dialysis settings, warm moisture compresses, and stretching.<sup>(<xref rid="b8-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> One pilot study by Ahsan et al.<sup>(<xref rid="b10-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> evaluated the feasibility of intradialytic sequential compression devices (SCD) use for the prevention of hemodialysis-related lower extremity cramping. This study found that the application of SCD to lower extremities prevented the generation of hemodialysis related cramping in four cases. Additionally, no adverse side effects were reported. In another study, acupressure with massage in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who were undergoing dialysis, showed improvement with symptoms of fatigue and depression over 12 weeks.<sup>(<xref rid="b11-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> Again, no adverse side effects were noted.</p><p>There are no known published research studies on massage for cramping during dialysis, however other manual techniques have had promising results. <sup>(<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup> Massage has increasingly been used in health care over the past 10 years. Research studies using massage in cancer patients have shown a decrease in pain, increase in energy, decreased inflammation and decreased feelings of anxiety when done appropriately.<sup>(<xref rid="b11-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> Physiological effects of massage techniques include increasing peripheral circulation, mechanically moving fluid in the veins and lymph, and stimulating the nerves, blood vessels and cell exchange of the tissue being manipulated.<sup>(<xref rid="b16-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> With the limited evidence available about massage in dialysis patients, it appears that this may be an effective treatment modality for hemodialysis-related lower extremity cramping in carefully selected patients. This pilot research is designed to determine if massage can be utilized as a preventive measure to decrease the frequency of cramping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The massage therapy protocol was developed by the lead massage therapist based on documented physiological effects of massage.<sup>(<xref rid="b16-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> Five LMTs were trained using the protocol. They then administered massages as specified in the protocol to three sample participants to help develop intertherapist consistency. Pretesting was done at Centers for Dialysis Care (CDC) West, in Cleveland, Ohio. To assess cramps, we used questionnaires of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity adapted from the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF).<sup>(<xref rid="b18-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup> These questions ask patients to report on cramp frequency, location, duration, and severity separately for cramps during dialysis treatment and for cramps that occur at home following dialysis.<sup>(<xref rid="b19-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> We further tested our instruments on a group of three dialysis patients who met all study eligibility criteria. The pretest subjects completed all study tasks as outlined below for the full trial, with the exception of receiving only one massage.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted utilizing three long-term hemodialysis facilities with approximately 500 total dialysis patients within the Centers for Dialysis Care Network in Cleveland, OH. To determine study eligibility, study coordinators used a chart abstraction to identify patients who had one or more episode of lower extremity cramping during or after dialysis in the previous two weeks. Additional eligibility criteria were age 18&#x02013;90 years, having received hemodialysis for at least six months, having a stable dry weight for the previous month (less than 2 kg change), and having the ability to give informed consent. We excluded new patients as the first several months of dialysis treatment is often a time of hemodynamic instability, and excluded patients with a fluctuating dry weight as this fluctuation may cause cramping. We also excluded patients with sores, wounds, amputation, dermatitis, or edema of the lower extremities, with a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD), or with a vascular access in a lower extremity.</p><p>A research assistant invited eligible hemodialysis patients to participate in the study, informed patients about study procedures, and obtained informed consent at the dialysis facilities while patients were receiving hemodialysis treatment. Consenting patients were randomized into intervention and control groups using a random number generator. All enrolled patients received a $25 gift card for participating in the study, and intervention patients receive the massage free of charge. The study was approved by the institutional review board of MetroHealth Medical Center Cleveland, OH.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention Group</title><p>The intervention group received a 20-minute massage by trained licensed massage therapists during each hemodialysis treatment attended for two weeks, as well as usual care. Most patients receive dialysis three times per week, resulting in six massage sessions. Prior to performing a massage, the therapist checked with each patient&#x02019;s dialysis nurse or technician to determine if there were clinical or hemodynamic abnormalities to preclude treatment. These abnormalities included: acute shortness of breath determined by nurse or technician observation or poor oxygen saturation, fever, hypotension, or volume overload (&#x0003e; 5 kg above recorded dry weight). In order to avoid postprandial blood flow redistribution, dialysis patients receiving massage treatment for cramping were asked to refrain from eating during the massage session.</p><p>The massage included both feet and legs up to and including the knee. Massage included general light centripetal friction, kneading and point compression to bellies, and myotendinous junction of muscles of the foot and calf not to exceed a perceived pain of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most severe and 1 being no pain. The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale was provided to patients while perceived pain was being explained (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijtmb-9-3">Table 1</xref> for intervention protocol). The massage therapist performed a short evaluation to verify the patient was free from new skin problems on the legs or feet including redness, heat, rashes and sores, blood clots in legs, vascular access in lower extremity, and no hospitalizations since last treatment to be eligible for treatment that day. Post-treatment notes were completed to identify any concerns with the massage. Massage therapists were compensated $25 for each massage scheduled.</p><table-wrap id="t1-ijtmb-9-3" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Massage Protocol</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protocol starts with left leg and is completed on the right leg.

All study massage therapists were trained about the study protocol including data collection, safety assessments, and completed all Institutional Review Board required training. This entailed certification in protection of human subjects, including proper procedures for recruiting and consenting subjects and the need to maintain confidentiality. Cultural competency training, dialysis treatment, and facility etiquette were also covered.</p></sec><sec><title>Control Group</title><p>The control group received usual care by dialysis center staff. Cramps that occur during hemodialysis treatment are generally addressed by correcting any hypotension, stopping further fluid removal, stretching the affected muscle, and, if cramps continue, acutely raising plasma osmolality with hypertonic saline or dextrose. Cramps that occur at home following dialysis treatment have not been well studied. Nephrologists typically recommend that patients try one or more of the following for cramps at home: stretching, rubbing the cramp, walking or jiggling the lower extremity, or taking a warm bath. We are reporting according to the CONSORT extension for nonpharmaceutical interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Research assistants examined the charts from the dialysis facility. Chart abstractions were used to assess eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and to obtain demographic and medical characteristics of participants.

results detected a very strong effect (<italic>p</italic> = .005) for massage to decrease cramps at home following dialysis. Decrease in cramps during dialysis did not reach statistical significance. Cramps at home decreased by about 80% and during dialysis by about 40% among patients who received massage. Strengths of our study include well-defined subject selection criteria, a randomized controlled trial design, high compliance of subjects to assigned massage treatments, and use of validated outcome measures.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have not been any previous studies of massage for dialysis cramps. However, an uncontrolled study of four hemodialysis patients with frequent muscle cramps found that applying a mechanical compression device to the legs reduced the frequency of cramps.<sup>(<xref rid="b10-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> A study with 80 participants utilizing reflexology to decrease fatigue, pain, and cramps in hemodialysis patients showed promising results.<sup>(<xref rid="b13-ijtmb-9-3" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup> While promising, our findings must be considered preliminary because of several limitations. The number of participants was small, there was a small difference between the two groups in number of cramps at home, only six massages were provided to each patient, there was no long-term follow-up, the study was conducted in a single geographic area, and outcomes were self-reported.</p><p>Further work in several areas is needed to confirm and expand on our study findings for generalizability.
