Dysfunction of the neuroimmune system is often comorbid with such conditions and affects similar areas of the brain. The goal of this study was to use positron emission tomography with the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> antagonist tracer, <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride, to explore the effect of acute immune activation on striatal DA levels. DA transmission was modulated by an oral methylphenidate (MP) challenge in order to reliably elicit DA elevation. Elevation in DA concentration due to MP was estimated via change in <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride binding potential from the baseline scan. Prior to the post-MP scan, subjects were pre-treated with either the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or placebo (PBO) in a cross-over design. Immune activation was confirmed by measuring tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentration in plasma. Eight healthy subjects were scanned four times each to determine the MP-induced DA elevation under both LPS and PBO pre-treatment conditions. MP-induced DA elevation in the striatum was significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) after LPS pre-treatment compared to PBO pre-treatment. Seven of eight subjects responded similarly. This effect was observed in the caudate and putamen (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02), but was not present in ventral striatum. DA elevation induced by MP was significantly greater when subjects were pre-treated with LPS compared to PBO. The amplification of stimulant-induced DA signaling in the presence of systemic inflammation may have important implications for our understanding of addiction and other diseases of DA dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Interaction between the immune and nervous systems in health and disease is an area of growing research focus.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving induced neuroinflammation have demonstrated increased neural activity in areas implicated in social pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and a blunted behavioral response to reward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Using the same methods to induce neuroinflammation, Hannestad <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> observed an increase in glucose metabolism in the insula and a decrease of glucose metabolism in the cingulate using <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Systemic inflammation is known to produce behavioral effects such as change in sleep and appetite, fatigue, anhedonia and depression that are consistent with the roles of these brain regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Elevated plasma concentration of inflammatory mediators is associated with these symptoms as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Depressed patients with higher levels of inflammatory markers have been found to have less functional connectivity in reward areas such as the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> It has also been shown that systemic inflammation can cause widespread activation of microglia in the human brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The regions affected by experimental systemic inflammation in imaging studies overlap substantially with regions that are involved in neurologic (basal ganglia, insula and temporal cortex) or psychiatric disorders (cingulate, medial frontal cortex and superior frontal cortex),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and regions that show reduced gray matter in psychiatric diseases (anterior insula/dorsal cingulate network).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>Immune activation can be reliably elicited with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).

Eight healthy subjects (four women and four men, mean age 31.3&#x000b1;11.2 years) without significant medical issues, current or recent smoking or other nicotine use, and personal or family history of psychiatric disorders (including substance misuse) were recruited for this study. Eligibility was confirmed by a detailed clinical interview, medical history, a physical exam, screening labs, urine cotinine and various assessments, including the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Informed consent was obtained prior to the performance of any study procedures. Each subject underwent a structural MRI scan on a Trio 3T MR scanner (Siemen's/CTI, Knoxville, TN, USA). Subjects then participated in two PET scan sessions on two separate days. Each scan session consisted of a pair of PET scans: a baseline scan and a post-MP scan. Sessions began with a baseline 120&#x02009;min <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride scan. Subjects then rested for ~90&#x02013;120&#x02009;min. Following the break, a pre-treatment of either LPS (0.8&#x02009;ng&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>1</sup>) or saline placebo (PBO) was administered intravenously. After 30&#x02009;min, subjects received oral MP (40&#x02009;mg). The post-MP <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride scan was then performed 60&#x02009;min after MP administration (90&#x02009;min after LPS/PBO pre-treatment) for 120&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subjects returned at least 1 week later for a second scan session that followed the same sequence (baseline scan, break, pre-treatment, MP administration, post-MP scan) but with the opposite pre-treatment condition (LPS/PBO). The order of pre-treatment was randomized and both subjects and experimenters were blinded to the condition until after data processing was completed. The dose of LPS was selected based on previous studies that produced changes in brain activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and induced fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> The dose of MP was determined using previous studies that reported a robust change in raclopride signal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup></p><p>Two additional subjects participated in a single scan session with only LPS pre-treatment without MP to assess the effect of LPS alone on DA levels. This session consisted of a baseline scan, break, pre-treatment with LPS and a post-LPS scan.</p></sec><sec><title>PET scans</title><p>Subjects were permitted a light breakfast (without caffeine) prior to scanning. An intravenous catheter was placed for <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride injection and periodic blood sampling.

Neither injected activity nor mass was significantly different between baseline, MP&#x0002b;PBO, and MP&#x0002b;LPS scans (<italic>P</italic>=0.83 and <italic>P</italic>=0.68, respectively) as characterized by a single factor analysis of variance. Subjects were placed on the scanner bed with their head centered at the field of view; a 9&#x02009;min transmission scan (<sup>68</sup>Ge rods, 511&#x02009;keV source) was obtained for attenuation correction. PET scans were acquired for 120&#x02009;min on an ECAT HR&#x0002b; PET scanner (Siemen's/CTI) that has a spatial resolution of 4.3&#x02013;8.3&#x02009;mm FWHM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Blood and behavior analyses</title><p>Samples of venous blood (10&#x02009;ml) were drawn at 30, 90 and 150&#x02009;min post-MP administration to assess MP concentration.

Blood samples were centrifuged for 10&#x02009;min and the plasma stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

POMS is a Likert scale containing various mood states that are each rated from 0 to 4. For this analysis, we examined the &#x02018;fatigued' mood state because, based on previous studies by our group, this symptom was reliably induced by LPS alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis</title><p>PET emission data were collected in 3D. Two-dimensional sinograms were created with Fourier rebinning. Data were binned into time frames of 6 &#x000d7; 0.5, 3 &#x000d7; 1, 2 &#x000d7; 2 and 22 &#x000d7; 5&#x02009;min. Data were corrected for attenuation, scatter, dead time, detector sensitivity and randoms. Images were reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization using 4 iterations and 16 subsets (in-house software) at a voxel size of 2.1&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 2.1&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 2.4&#x02009;mm and image volume of 128 &#x000d7; 128 &#x000d7; 63 voxels. PET images were co-registered to the subject's respective MR scan (FMRIB's Software Library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>) and then non-linearly registered to a MR template in a common space (Bioimage Suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup>). ROIs were extracted using automated anatomic labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> (AAL) in order to generate regional time activity curves.

We speculate that MP partially counteracts LPS-induced behavioral effects through a central (brain) mechanism, rather than a peripheral mechanism, as MP had no effect on circulating levels of cytokines (<italic>r</italic>&#x0003c;0.4; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.3). This decoupling of LPS-induced behavioral effects (fatigue and other sickness symptoms) and immune effects (blood cytokine levels) in the presence of MP is a novel result which indicates that blood cytokine concentrations may not be reliable indicators of the effects of systemic inflammation on brain-related symptoms. The potential effect of elevated cytokines in blood on the brain will depend on the susceptibility of the brain to these influences. In this study, it appears that MP had an effect on the brain that prevented the typical feeling of fatigue induced by LPS. Since both LPS alone and MP alone produce similar increases in DA, our data suggest that striatal DA levels do not have a direct relationship with fatigue. It is possible that DA in other brain regions is implicated in fatigue, or that other effects of MP counteracted fatigue (for example, the inhibition of norepinephrine uptake).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup></p><p>Prior studies have suggested a cross sensitization between stressors and DA changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> But, there appear to be differences between the effects of short- and long-term neuroimmune activation. In rodents, LPS induced an increase in DA concentration, an effect which peaked 2&#x02009;h after LPS administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Mice acutely pre-treated with LPS and cocaine displayed greater locomotion in a behavioral task compared to pre-treatment with cocaine alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> In nonhuman primates, 2 weeks of IFN&#x003b1; (a cytokine involved in inflammatory signaling) caused an increase in amphetamine-stimulated DA release over amphetamine alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Our findings are consistent with prior studies, namely, stimulated DA elevation was enhanced with an acute dose of LPS compared to placebo. Studies of chronic inflammation have not found a synergistic effect of inflammation on DA activity. Capuron <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> found reduced <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in humans after chronic IFN&#x003b1; administration. Chronic treatment with IFN&#x003b1; was also observed to reduce striatal dopamine release in primates as measured by microdialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> In fact, the same monkeys studied by Felger <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> that experienced cytokine-enhanced DA release after 2 weeks showed a reversal of this effect when IFN&#x003b1; administration was extended to 4 weeks.</p><p>Imaging studies in humans have demonstrated a link between neuroinflammation and activity in the striatum. However, there appear to be differences in the effects on the ventral versus dorsal striatum. Using fMRI, Felger <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> showed a decrease in ventral striatal connectivity (during resting state) in depressed individuals with neuroinflammation. In non-depressed populations, ventral striatal BOLD activity in response to reward was blunted by both an acute dose of LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> and chronic IFN&#x003b1; administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> The findings of these fMRI studies were localized to ventral striatum and indicate a reduction in reward reactivity during immune activation. In contrast, the present study found a synergistic effect of immune activity on DA elevation only in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen). DA in the dorsal (as opposed to ventral) striatum has been linked to response inhibition, another important behavioral characteristic of substance abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Low DA receptor availability in the dorsal striatum (as measured by PET imaging in humans) has been associated with impaired response inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> The results of the present study are consistent with this body of work and represent a novel contribution to it, namely, that DA activity in response to a stressor is enhanced in the dorsal striatum.</p><p>The interaction between an immune response and DA signaling may carry unappreciated risks. If in the presence of inflammation, a dopaminergic medication or other stimulus with addiction potential produces higher DA elevation in the dorsal striatum than without, then it is reasonable to expect that the addiction liability of the stimulus may be increased through impaired response inhibition. Consider an individual experimenting with illicit stimulants or an adolescent prescribed Ritalin (MP), either of whom are experiencing short-term neuroinflammation. Both could be at increased risk for addiction due to reduced inhibitory control caused by a supraphysiologic DA elevation. We believe our findings call for further investigation of patient populations who may be suffering from neuroinflammation and are using or abusing stimulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MP-induced DA elevation in the striatum was increased in the presence of LPS versus placebo (seven of eight subjects, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Co-administration of MP and LPS elevated subjects' inflammatory cytokine concentrations but did not elicit negative behavioral effects typically observed during systemic inflammation. The synergistic effect between immune activation and DA stimulants could have important implications in the treatment of neuroimmune compromised and DA dysfunctional populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Lesley Devine and the staff of the Yale PET Center.
