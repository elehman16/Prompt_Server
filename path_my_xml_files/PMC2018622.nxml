The Cre recombinase has been shown to act on DNA sequences that vary considerably from that of its bacteriophage recognition sequence, <italic>loxP</italic>. However, little is known about the sequence requirements for functional <italic>lox</italic>-like sequences. In this study, we have implemented a randomized library approach to identify the sequence characteristics of functional <italic>lox</italic> site domains. We created a randomized spacer library and a randomized arm library, and then tested them for recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Results from the spacer library show that, while there is great plasticity, identity between spacer pairs is the most important factor influencing function, especially in <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions. The presence of one completely randomized arm in a functional <italic>loxP</italic> recombination reaction revealed that only three wild-type <italic>loxP</italic> arms are necessary for successful recombination in Cre-expressing bacteria, and that there are nucleotide preferences at the first three and last three positions of the randomized arm for the most efficiently recombined sequences. Finally, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> Cre recombination reactions are much more stringent for evaluating which sequences can support efficient recombination compared to the 294-CRE system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The bacteriophage P1 Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> site-specific recombination system is widely used as a genetic engineering tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) due to its well-defined recognition sequence, lack of any necessary co-factors and efficacy in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Since its discovery, Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> has been applied to temporal and spatial gene activation/deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>), site-specific genomic integration and deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">6&#x02013;10</xref>) as well as the construction of libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and cloning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Interest in expanding and improving the types of reactions that the Cre recombinase can facilitate has led to the discovery of numerous functional recognition sequences for Cre; however, no sequence characteristics have been defined to evaluate what constitutes a functional site other than its need to bind the recombinase and the role spacer compatibility plays in efficient recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The Cre recombinase acts on a 34-bp sequence known as <italic>loxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This recognition sequence consists of two 13-bp palindromic arms separated by an 8 bp spacer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In a site-specific recombination reaction two <italic>loxP</italic> sites are brought together, each arm binding one recombinase monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), while strand exchange takes place within the spacer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <italic>LoxP</italic> sequences are maintained following recombination events. This characteristic is responsible for the reversible nature Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> reactions.</p><p>Successful site-specific recombination has been shown to occur between sites with sequences having varying degrees of similarity to <italic>loxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). Beginning with the description of the <italic>Escherichia coli loxB</italic> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), several endogenous genomic sequences from different organisms have been discovered that can serve as substrates for Cre-mediated site-specific recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Sauer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) first identified endogenous cryptic <italic>lox</italic> sites in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> These cryptic sites contained as few as 14 out of 34 bases in common with <italic>loxP</italic>, and illustrated the apparent importance of the TATA sequence adjacent to the spacer region in functional sites. Later, other functional genomic <italic>lox</italic> sites were reported for yeast, human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Together, the description of these functional sites demonstrates flexibility in sequence recognition by the Cre recombinase.</p><p>The search for endogenous <italic>lox</italic> sequences within genomes for use in genomic engineering and gene therapy has been a driving force in the discovery of alternative functional <italic>lox</italic> sites. However, diversification and manipulation of <italic>lox</italic> site behavior has also identified many alternative substrates for Cre. Albert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) were the first to screen for arm mutations that could facilitate stable Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> integration reactions; while mutation studies of the spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) documented the effects of single and double base mutations on recombination efficiency. Recently, two different surveys of partially randomized spacer libraries (NNNTANNN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) added to the growing list of spacer sequences that are proficient in recombination.</p><p>Previous studies have expanded the list of <italic>lox</italic> sites with which the Cre recombinase is able to recombine without pursuing a full-scale randomized approach to the 34bp sequence. Here, we report on the first randomized sequence studies aimed at defining functional <italic>lox</italic> sequences. We have created a randomized spacer library and a randomized arm library, both of which have been tested for functionality <italic>in vivo</italic> in Cre-expressing bacteria and in <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions. The results of these studies indicate that Cre is very flexible in the sequences it can recombine. We show that <italic>lox</italic> sites with matching spacers recombine more effectively than sites with non-matching spacers and that the central &#x02018;TA&#x02019; is not required for efficient recombination. Our results also indicate that there is a sequence bias in functional arms and that the mode of recombination (<italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>) is important when evaluating site function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructing a randomized spacer library</title><p>The spacer library plasmid backbone (pLK) was engineered from the previously described pPG3-<italic>loxR/loxP</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) modified to replace its <italic>loxP</italic> site with a HindIII&#x02013;NotI&#x02013;BglII linker at its XbaI site.</p><p>Two separate syntheses of the library template (5&#x02032; GCGCGAATTCTGCGCATAACTTCGTATANNNNNNNN TATACGAAGTTATAGATAGGACGGATCCAGTTGG 3&#x02032;) were done in order to compensate for non-random base frequencies in the oligonucleotide manufacturing process.

Instead of each nucleotide having a frequency of 25% at each of the 8 positions of the spacer, positions 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 in the first library all had significantly unequal base distribution (Supplementary Figure 1). The second library contained only one position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which had statistically unequal nucleotide distribution. This means that these libraries do not represent statistically random sequence populations. The non-random base distributions could be a result of the oligonucleotide manufacturing process and/or the manipulations (PCR, cloning and propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic>) necessary to clone the library oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> recombination of a randomized spacer library</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the spacer library did not demonstrate any differences in recombination based on nucleotide composition at specific positions within the spacer.

All spacer library clones were tested for function <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified Cre recombinase. Standard reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Recombination was detected by PCR followed by SYBR Green I staining of the PCR product and quantitation of band intensities on an agarose gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> contains the averaged results of three separate <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination experiments.</p><p>The amount of Cre used in these reactions was titrated to give maximum recombination for the <italic>loxP</italic> control (pLK + <italic>LoxP</italic><sup>2</sup>).

For example, whereas the range of average recombination <italic>in vitro</italic> for the set of matching spacer clones was 56.7&#x02013;1.7%, these clones were indistinguishable from one another <italic>in vivo</italic>. Non-matching spacer clones that had functioned <italic>in vivo</italic> did not necessarily function well <italic>in vitro</italic>; 7 of 12 clones that showed full recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> had &#x0003c;3.0% recombination under our <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.</p><p>Therefore, not all clones that appeared to be as functional as the wild-type <italic>loxP</italic> control <italic>in vivo</italic> were equivalent when compared <italic>in vitro.</italic> The <italic>loxP</italic> control averaged 70.4% <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination while the best library clone averaged 56.7%.

Further analysis of these sequences is hampered by the small number of clones sampled.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> recombination of an arm library</title><p>Our second basic question addressed what arm sequences the Cre recombinase can use to facilitate site-specific recombination events. Cre is known to bind cooperatively to its recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and its contact positions within the arms have been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). By randomizing only one arm out of the four that make-up the Cre/<italic>lox</italic> recombination complex, we could study what minimal functional sequences Cre can co-operatively bind and recombine.</p><p>In order to easily screen large numbers of randomized arm library sites, we constructed a plasmid in which color selection could be used to visualize recombination events in a bacterial system. A template oligonucleotide containing one <italic>loxP</italic> arm plus the <italic>loxP</italic> spacer followed by a 13 N randomized region was used to create the arm library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Once the template was made double stranded through PCR, it was cloned into the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter construct pSV-&#x003b2;-Gal + <italic>LoxP</italic>. This reporter construct had been modified with a <italic>loxP</italic> site at the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>lac</italic>Z coding region.

Plasmids from these DH5&#x003b1; colonies were the expected sizes (blue colonies &#x0223c;6 kb, white &#x0223c;2.7 kb, data not shown).

It was concluded that each original 294-CRE blue clone contained a single arm library construct.</p><p>Sequencing was also used to identify clones, which might have multiple library constructs present. Background sequence seen on the sequence chromatograms only at the 13 base randomized arm region could be a result of more than one sequence present within a clone. Only 2 blue clones (#16 and #18) out of 37, along with 2 white with blue center clones (#5 and #12) out of 15, had strong evidence from their sequence chromatograms to suggest there might be multiple arm library constructs present in each clone.

Following 5 days of continuous growth culture, colonies no longer stained positive for &#x003b2;-galactosidase when plated on LB agar containing X-gal (data not shown).

Comparison of the nucleotide frequencies at these 6 positions shows a trend towards the sequence &#x02018;ATA&#x02019; at both ends of the library arm for white colony clones (Supplementary Figure 4). This &#x02018;ATA&#x02019; sequence is also present in the wild-type <italic>loxP</italic> site. While 5 of the 6 biased positions are known contacts for the recombinase, position 3 has not been previously identified as an important position for functional arm sequences.

This, along with the simple calculation of the average number of conserved bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) for each colony type group, points to a continuum for the number of conserved bases in an arm relative to its probable function.

Supporting the idea that clones from white colonies with blue centers have characteristics that are part of a continuum between blue and white clones, their average number of conserved bases (4.9) falls between that of the blue and white clones.

Although this study did not test a large sampling of all sequences possible in each library (spacer = 4<sup>8</sup> = 65 536 and arm = 4<sup>13</sup> = 67 108 864), its results are significant. By electing to randomize whole sections of the <italic>lox</italic> site, we have observed a great range of functional sequences, function tied to recombination environment and the first unbiased, systematic evaluation of <italic>lox</italic> arm sequences.</p><p>Two previous studies have concentrated on the sequence of the spacer region and its role in recombination efficiency. Lee and Saito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) undertook the task of creating single and double-base mutations of the spacer and noted variability in the recombination efficiency across mutants. Several of their observations are supported by our work such as low or undetectable recombination <italic>in vitro</italic> between unmatched spacers, variable recombination between like mutant spacers, and no mutant spacer with equal or greater recombination efficiency than the wild-type <italic>loxP</italic> spacer.</p><p>Our study is, however, in conflict with a published report from Missirlis <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). While we agree that mutant spacers and sites with mismatched spacers do recombine, our observations do not substantiate Missirlis <italic>et al.</italic>'s conclusion that a G-rich spacer is the most favored for recombination or that self-recombination is not significantly greater than recombination with other spacers. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of base preferences within the spacer for efficiently recombined sites, G-rich spacers were not the most effective in our data set.</p><p>We observed frequency imbalances in our libraries that were the result of the oligonucleotide manufacturing process and/or the cloning of the library. These biases were not from clonal selection since all clones in our study were chosen at random for further manipulation. By sequencing only successful recombination products, Missirlis <italic>et al.</italic> leave their study open to the possibility that their analyzed pool of products did not originate from a truly random population. Without published analysis of the pool of clones created from the PCR and ligation of the input oligonucleotides, it is unclear whether their observations are the result of nucleotide frequency biases present in the library clones or true base preferences of the Cre recombinase.</p><p>Second, we believe our observations support the general conclusion that recombination between matching spacers is more efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> and more likely to proceed to completion <italic>in vivo</italic> than recombination between mismatched spacer pairs. Based on our observations, we believe that Missirlis <italic>et al.</italic>'s conclusions based on equating efficiency of recombination with the number of times a recombination event appears in a shotgun library <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment could be misleading. This could easily be determined by testing Missirlis <italic>et al.</italic>'s spacer sequences in traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays.</p><p>In our data set, the non-matching spacer clone (#42) with the highest percent recombination <italic>in vitro</italic> (22.0%) contained sites with homologous spacers with the exception of one position. The remaining unmatched spacer clones all had &#x0003c;20% recombination <italic>in vitro</italic>, compared to 21 of 33 matching spacer clones with &#x0003e;20% recombination. All matched spacer pairs recombined to completion <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to 12 of 21 unmatched.</p><p>This is the first study to report on a fully randomized (8N) spacer library. Results from this study show there to be great sequence plasticity for successfully recombined spacers. In past work, importance was given to the role of the central &#x02018;TA&#x02019; dinucleotide as critical for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our work demonstrates that a central &#x02018;TA&#x02019; is not necessary to achieve &#x0003e;45% recombination <italic>in vitro</italic> or complete recombination in 294-CRE. Also, complete identity through the central six bases is not required for recombination as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Unfortunately, our sample set was too small to statistically evaluate for base preferences in efficiently recombined spacers.</p><p>Results from both spacer and arm libraries suggest that recombination in the 294-CRE strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> is robust compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> recombinase reactions. Whether recombination is aided by replication and/or endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> factors is unclear. This is an important issue to consider when testing for the function of new <italic>lox</italic> sites or libraries, as recombination in 294-CRE may not transfer well to the <italic>in vitro</italic> environment. It should also be noted that recombination efficiency in other <italic>in vivo</italic> systems might differ significantly from both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems tested here.</p><p>Though our results from the spacer library study were not unexpected, the fact that our arm library demonstrated effective recombination with the presence of one randomized arm was surprising. It appears that an arm sequence with as few as one conserved <italic>loxP</italic> base can comprise 1 of the 4 <italic>lox</italic> arm sequences necessary for recombination in 294-CRE, and as few as 4 of 13 conserved bases were sufficient for recombination <italic>in vitro</italic>. This could be explained by Cre's cooperative binding properties, where three bound recombinase monomers might be able to recruit the final subunit to the complex leading to recombination in the absence of a fourth arm sequence that has any resemblance to <italic>loxP</italic>.</p><p>Our arm library testing system proved useful in the screening of hundreds of clones at once and in identifying the minimal arm sequences required for recombination. Despite not working with a truly random library, statistics reveal nucleotide preferences at 6 out of 13 arm positions for efficiently recombined clones. The &#x02018;ATA&#x02019; motif at both ends of the arm was overrepresented in sequences from efficiently recombined clones. Though other studies have looked at the effects of base mutations on the arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), Sauer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) was the first to speculate on the importance the &#x02018;TATA&#x02019; sequence flanking the spacer region. Ours is the first study to find evidence of base preferences for functional arm sequences and disproves the notion that bases at the outer end of the arm are not important for efficient recombination.</p><p>Clearly, the results from both libraries must be interpreted with the fact that they were tested in the context of the wild-type <italic>loxP</italic> sequence. The arm library in particular identifies the weakest arm sequences that can be tolerated in an otherwise wild-type reaction. Mutations in the <italic>loxP</italic> arm or spacer coupled to the fully randomized arm might exert greater selective pressure to conserve <italic>loxP</italic> bases in the library arm.</p><p>In the future, we plan to continue to test the function of various <italic>lox</italic> site libraries. How mutations in the spacer and in both arms combine to affect function has not been explored.
