Undertaking these surgeries on day-care basis will hasten patient disposal and by early surgery, it will prevent disease progression, cater to more patients and reduce overall expenditure. This can be achieved by meticulous evaluation of patients suitable for day-care anaesthesia.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;agonist; having sedative, analgesic, sympatholytic, narcotic and volatile agent sparing properties and acceptable side effects. This makes it a potent anaesthetic adjuvant. Although studies have been carried out successfully using dexmedetomidine in the minor day-care procedures under general anaesthesia (GA), availability of literature using dexmedetomidine in major day-care surgery, particularly breast cancer surgery is limited. On the other hand, studies have shown that regional anaesthetic techniques for breast surgery are a feasible option for ambulatory set up,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with the added advantage of ameliorating persistent post-operative pain (POP).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hence, this study was carried out to evaluate the role of dexmedetomidine in facilitating early discharge of patients in breast cancer surgery carried out on day care basis under GA. We hypothesised that dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to GA facilitates early discharge of patients undergoing day-care breast cancer surgery. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the incidence of discharge in each group six hours after surgery. The secondary endpoint was to determine the average dose of analgesic consumed by each group, the number of patients requiring analgesia postoperatively and within 2 h of the expected time of discharge, side effects, intra-operative haemodynamic stability, post-operative sedation and satisfaction scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomised, double-blind controlled study was conducted at our referral cancer hospital after approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee before pilot study (001-IEC-AHRCC dated 14, July, 2016). All patients planned for breast surgery such as breast conservative surgery or modified radical mastectomy, for carcinoma breast between age group 30&#x02013;60 years and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II were explained and counselled about the day-care procedure. Patients excluded from the study were those of ASA &#x02265;III, obese with body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, history of nausea and vomiting, delayed recovery from anaesthesia, those with pregnancy, lactation, pre-existing hypotension, any degree of heart block, cardiac disorder, allergies to dexmedetomidine, receiving &#x003b2;-blockers, benzodiazepines or monoaminooxidase inhibitors. Patients refusing for consent, psychologically unstable, or residing far away from the hospital (travelling time more than 1 h) and not having a competent companion to provide domiciliary care and to bring back to the hospital in case of emergency were also excluded from the study. Patients who gave written informed consent underwent a pre-anaesthetic check-up at least 1 day to 1 week before surgery on an outpatient basis. Routine investigations including chest X-ray and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were also evaluated. Patients were explained about the use of visual analogue scale (VAS) score.</p><p>One hundred eligible patients were allocated into two groups of 50 each as per computer generated randomisation and were denoted as either Group NS or Group D. Group NS patients were administered GA as per the hospital protocol, whereas Group D received dexmedetomidine followed by GA. All patients reported between 7 and 8 am on the day of surgery after overnight fasting for 6 h. The entire procedure was performed under GA by a team of surgeons according to standardised hospital protocol. The injectable solution of the study drug dexmedetomidine and normal saline (ns) was prepared by a staff unaware of the study, and the principal investigator was also unaware of the contents of the solutions administered during the study. The injectable solution of dexmedetomidine was prepared by dissolving 1 ml (100 &#x003bc;g) of the drug in ns to make final volume up to 50 ml to make a concentration of dexmedetomidine 2 &#x003bc;g/ml and used in Group D patients. For Group NS patients 50 ml of ns was taken in a syringe. Intravenous (IV) access was established with a 20G cannula, and ringer lactate was infused at 10&#x02013;12 ml/kg/h. All patients received ceftriaxone 1 g, ondansetron 4 mg, and pantoprazole 40 mg IV 30 min before surgery. Their baseline blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. Ten minutes before induction of GA, glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg IV was administered following which the infusion of ns or dexmedetomidine by a syringe infusion pump (Top Medical System, Model&#x02013;Top-5300, Tokyo, Japan) was started in respective groups at a rate of 0.3 ml/kg/h (0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for dexmedetomidine) via a separate infusion line, piggyback into the main line and continued until skin closure. Following pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen, and administration of analgesia with IV fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg in both groups, anaesthesia was induced with IV propofol until there was loss of response to verbal commands. Vecuronium 0.08 mg/kg were administered, and the lungs were ventilated for 3 min after which a supraglottic airway device (i-gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was inserted. Maintenance of anaesthesia was done with isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration 0.5&#x02013;1 to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60 and vecuronium 0.02 mg/kg was used as a maintenance muscle relaxant. Ventilation was carried out with oxygen and nitrous oxide (33:67) using the tidal volume of 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg, and the respiration rate was adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) of about 35&#x02013;40 mmHg. Fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was planned to be administered if intra-operative mean arterial pressure (MAP) was &#x0003e;20% of baseline. Hypotension below 20% of baseline MAP was managed with 250 ml IV boluses of fluid and ephedrine 6 mg. Bradycardia &#x0003c;50 bpm was treated with atropine 0.6 mg IV. Intra-operative recording of BP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, BIS were noted at various time intervals, i.e., 10 min after drug infusion, after induction, after i-gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> insertion, at 20 min intervals thereafter until completion of the procedure. Ten minutes before completion of the procedure, infusion diclofenac sodium was given at 1.5 mg/kg until the end of the procedure, and the inhalational agent was discontinued. Neuromuscular reversal was done with IV neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. When patients showed adequate tidal ventilation with pressure support, i-gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was removed; oxygen was given through face mask and they were transferred to post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU).</p><p>After recovery, all patients were administered acetaminophen 1000 mg IV. Fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV bolus was given as rescue analgesia to those who further complained of pain of VAS &#x02265;4 in first 6 h post-operative period. Immediately following neuromuscular reversal, post-operative sedation score was recorded using observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) score and was reassessed 1 h after and at discharge.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Patients were kept under observation for 6 h in PACU and monitored for the need of rescue analgesia and other post-operative complications such as nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. At the end of 6 h, patient satisfaction was assessed using satisfaction score (1-poor, 2-fair, 3-good, and 4-excellent). Patients who met the discharge criteria (modified Aldrete score &#x02265;9) and did not complain of pain within 2 h of expected discharge time and other side effects were allowed to go home with proper post-operative advice.</p><p>Sample size calculation was based on an initial pilot study involving thirty patients in each group. The incidence of discharge in NS group was 53% while in D group was 86%. So taking &#x003b1; error as 0.05, the power of study (1-&#x003b2;) at 95% sample size was calculated approximately 48 in each group. We have included fifty patients in each group for possible dropouts. All patients' data and characteristics were categorised and analysed appropriately using Student's paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for comparing variables with normal distribution and Chi-square test to analyse categorical data. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Analysis of result was performed using MS office excel 2010 software, SPSS for windows version 24 (IBM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Statistics 24. USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the consort diagram for the flow of participants through each stage of the study.

Group D experienced a lower MAP compared to the baseline which was significant at all point of time. Intergroup MAP was found to be significantly lower in Group D at post-drug infusion, pre-induction, and at 60, 80 and 100 min [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>], but no patient required ephedrine.</p><p>Overall patient satisfaction was better in Group D as compared to Group NS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this randomised, controlled trial, we found that significantly more patients receiving dexmedetomidine (88%) could be discharged on the same day after surgery compared to patients who did not receive dexmedetomidine (88% vs. 60%). This was most likely due to the higher numbers of patients in the NS group who required rescue analgesia within 2 h of expected discharge and who experienced PONV.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine a known analgesic and anaesthetic sparing agent is used perioperatively for postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has been successfully employed as a total anaesthetic agent in minor surgical procedures and in day-care minimally invasive procedures and other minor procedures facilitating early discharge.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been seen to improve post-operative analgesia following radical mastectomy, but there is a paucity of literature regarding its influence on early discharge of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Lower POP, decrease rate of nausea and vomiting and early mobilization are factors that foster such surgeries on daycare basis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We carried out our study to assess if addition of dexmedetomidine to GA facilitated early discharge of such patients and observed a higher incidence of discharge in our study group.</p><p>Wei Fan demonstrated that intra-operative use of dexmedetomidine reduced the post-operative consumption of patient-controlled analgesia with morphine in breast cancer surgery patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Manne <italic>et al</italic>. in their study observed that a significant number of patients did not require rescue analgesia with dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, only four patients of Group D required rescue analgesia. Thus, a satisfactory and prolonged post-operative analgesia can be achieved with intra-operative use of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>PONV in breast surgery is as high as 56% and 41%, respectively, as reported by Jaffe <italic>et al</italic>. in their study on 101 women.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] IV pre-treatment with a single dose of ondansetron also does not substantially prevent this.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Bakri <italic>et al</italic>. reported that reduction in the incidence and severity of PONV due to use of dexmedetomidine was almost similar to dexamethasone with analgesic superiority.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, post-operative incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly less in Group D in comparison to NS group.</p><p>The study showed that patients in Group D had a lower sedation score than patients in group NS immediately after i-gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> removal but had a better sedation score at discharge.
