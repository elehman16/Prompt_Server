However, it is still unclear whether these 2 complications are related to or affect each other or whether both of them progress simultaneously after their onset, although many epidemiological studies have shown the coexistence of DR and DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In fact, we sometimes see proteinuric diabetic patients without DR or normoalbuminuric patients with proliferative DR, which is the most advanced stage of DR. For example, it was shown that only 36% had no DR, while 53% had nonproliferative, 9% moderate to severe, and 2% severe DR in 285 normoalbuminuric Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, there was marked discordance between DR and DN, especially in normoalbuminuria or low-level microalbuminuria, while advanced renal histological severity has been related to advanced DR severity in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). On the other hand, diabetic patients treated by diabetologists sometime miss their visits to ophthalmologists; therefore, the relationships or detailed clinical courses of DR and DN can hardly be analyzed in most clinical sites.</p><p>All over the world, DN is a major cause of end-stage renal disease, which requires renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis or renal transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In Japan, the number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy has increased threefold in the last 15 years. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to stop the progression of DN and to find biomarkers or easily available factors that represent the exact clinical course or prognosis of DN. However, it is not exactly known what factors affect an increase of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline, which are typical clinical changes in DN.</p><p>Microalbuminuria is well known as a risk factor resulting in macroalbuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In addition, some Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria showed rapid decline of GFR, although it was unclear whether these patients had more frequent DR compared with the patients without rapid GFR decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). On the other hand, DR was shown to be a risk factor of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, proliferative DR was shown to be a predictor of macroalbuminuria in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but this association has not been investigated in Asian populations. Although DR and glomerulosclerosis seemed to be parallel to progress using the investigation of serial renal biopsy specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) when the blood glucose control was fair to poor, detailed interaction between two complications are still obscure in a large number of patients. Whether DR can predict renal functional decline in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients remains to be clarified.</p><p>The Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS) is a nationwide randomized controlled study of type 2 diabetic patients focusing on lifestyle modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We have reported the extremely low transition rate from normoalbuminuria and low microalbuminuria in this Japanese cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), as well as incidence and progression rates of DR that were also lower than in Caucasian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition, we have also shown that the incidence and progression rate of DR were lower than those in Caucasian populations and that glycemic control, duration of diabetes, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were related to DR in the JDCS cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here, we elucidated the relationships between DN and DR, and the risk factors of the UAE increase and GFR decline according to the presence or absence of microalbuminuria or DR in the JDCS cohort.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a part of the JDCS, a Japanese nationwide multicentered randomized trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In 1996, 2,205 patients aged 40&#x02013;70 years with previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and HbA<sub>1C</sub> levels of &#x0003e;6.5% were recruited and registered from 59 hospitals specializing in diabetes care. The protocol for the study, which is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical/Epidemiological Studies of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, received ethics approval from the institutional review boards of all the participating institutes. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled. The inclusion criteria for participating patients have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Those who had impaired glucose tolerance and major ocular disease including glaucoma, dense cataract, or history of cataract surgery were excluded. A final total of 2,033 patients aged 58.5 &#x000b1; 6.9 (mean &#x000b1; SD) years were included in the study, and their known diabetes duration was 10.9 &#x000b1; 7.2 years.</p><p>The protocol originally specified that patients with nondiabetic nephropathy, macroalbuminuria, serum creatinine levels &#x0003e;120 &#x003bc;mol/L, and mean values of two spot urine examinations for an albumin excretion rate of &#x0003e;150 mg/g creatinine were excluded in the analysis of nephropathy, making up the analysis population of 1,558 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We excluded the patients with high microalbuminuria (150&#x02013;300 mg/gCr) because the INNOVATION (Incipient to Overt: Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker, Telmisartan, Investigation on Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy) trial showed a higher transition rate from high microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). After exclusion of 83 patients without DR assessment, the remaining 1,475 patients were divided into four groups according to the absence or presence of DR and microalbuminuria as follows: normoalbuminuria without DR [NA(DR&#x02212;)] (<italic>n</italic> = 773), normoalbuminuria with DR [NA(DR+)] (<italic>n</italic> = 279), microalbuminuria without DR [MA(DR&#x02212;)] (<italic>n</italic> = 277), and microalbuminuria with DR [MA(DR+)] (<italic>n</italic> = 146).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Assessment of DR</title><p>The presence and severity of DR were determined annually by qualified ophthalmologists at each institute by mydriatic indirect ophthalmoscopic examination and slit lamp biomicroscopic fundus examination using precorneal lens with the international DR and diabetic macular edema disease scales including minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). To validate the consistency of staging between study sites, we cross-examined fundus images and evaluated the agreement in staging between local ophthalmologists and retinal specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Severity of DR was categorized following the international clinical diabetic retinopathy severity scales into five categories as &#x0201c;no retinopathy&#x0201d; (equivalent to the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] scale level 10), &#x0201c;mild nonproliferative DR&#x0201d; (stage 1; equivalent to ETDRS level 20), &#x0201c;moderate nonproliferative DR&#x0201d; (stage 2; equivalent to ETDRS levels 35, 43, and 47), &#x0201c;severe nonproliferative DR&#x0201d; (stage 3; equivalent to ETDRS levels 53A&#x02013;53E), and &#x0201c;proliferative DR&#x0201d; (stage 4; equivalent to ETDRS levels &#x02265;61) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). History of ocular surgery (e.g., cataract, glaucoma, and vitreoretinal surgery) was also surveyed.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Measures of kidney function</title><p>We followed up these groups for 8 years and measured their body weight and blood pressure at least twice a year.

However, these reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) showed little information regarding DR. Microalbuminuria was indicated as a risk factor of DR in type 1 diabetic patients but not in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Thus, whether microalbuminuria itself or DR itself results in GFR decline must be examined to elucidate the exact and detailed clinical course of DN including both UAE and GFR changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Recently, DR has become known as a risk factor for all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), cardiovascular event, and subclinical atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) or cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, it is still obscure whether DR had some effects on UAE increase or GFR decline, especially in normoalbuminuric and low microalbuminuric diabetic patients. Thirty-eight Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria showed higher rates of GFR decline during 6 years of observation when the patients had DR compared with the patients without DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). On the other hand, 25 Danish type 1 diabetic patients without macroalbuminuria revealed higher transition rates to macroalbuminuria when the patients had proliferative DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the current study, microalbuminuric patients with DR obviously revealed GFR decline, while normoalbuminuric patients with DR had a trend toward increase of UAE. In addition, hazard ratio was increased according to DR severity grade, especially in microalbuminuric patients. Therefore, we need to perform ophthalmological examination to detect DR carefully, especially in the patients with normo- or microalbuminuria, to identify persons at higher risk of developing macroalbuminuria. It has not been shown that DR itself is related to renal function decline, although some reports have shown that urinary abnormalities, microalbuminuria, or macroalbuminuria predicts DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and microalbuminuria has been indicated to have a greater impact on predicting DR than GFR decline in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>There are few reports that both microalbuminuria and DR predict renal function loss. In Chinese populations, the reduction of eGFR of &#x0003e;50% or progression to eGFR &#x0003c;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or end-stage renal disease was predicted in the type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or DR compared with the patients with no complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The risk of the renal outcome was obviously increased when both DR and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, the report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) did not show that the slope of GFR decline was related to the presence of microalbuminuria and DR. Therefore, the current study demonstrates for the first time that the rate of GFR decline was faster in patients with microalbuminuria and DR at the early stage of DN.</p><p>One of the reasons why UAE trended to be increased in normoalbuminuric patients with DR or GFR decreased in microalbuminuric patients with DR in the current study might be related to the severity of the renal histological changes including glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and mesangial expansion. In fact, in normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients, abnormal values of GBM thickness and mesangial expansion were more frequently seen in the patients with DR, and these histological changes aggravated according to DR grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) revealed that type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria showed more frequent Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions when the patients had proliferative DR. The patients with nodular glomerulosclerosis frequently had an increase of serum creatinine within 5 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, it was shown that renal histological changes were heterogeneous in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, and three histological categories of renal injury patterns were previously indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In the report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), DR was present in all the patients with typical diabetic glomerular sclerosis. No proliferative DR was seen in the patients with a normal/near-normal pattern or atypical renal histological injury, while background DR was observed in 50 and 57% of patients, respectively. More recently, a link between quantitative assessment of the retinal vessel caliber size and change in glomerulopathy index including mesangial expansion and GBM thickening during 5 years follow-up was reported in normotensive normoalbuminuric Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Change in the retinal vessel caliber size has been speculated to be reflecting inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and prevalence and incidence of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Therefore, DR might reflect renal histological severity as diabetic glomerulosclerosis regardless of albuminuria. In microalbuminuric Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients, the rate of annual GFR decline was related to renal histological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In addition, in normo- and microalbuminuric Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, it was shown that UAE increased 5.6 years after the renal biopsy when renal histological changes, including mesangial expansion, were more severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Thus, the patients with DR have more severe diabetic glomerular changes, which are followed by UAE increase or GFR decline compared with the patients without DR. Further examinations will be warranted to confirm the difference of histological changes among the four groups shown in the current study.</p><p>In the JDCS cohort, both blood pressure and glycemic control were risk factors of the occurrence of DR and the transition from normo- and low microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, whereas the duration of diabetes was a predictor for DR and smoking was a predictor for DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), progression to macroalbuminuria was independently associated with higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and SBP levels in addition to an elevated baseline UACR; and smoking was a significant predictor of macroalbuminuria as well. These factors were also significant predictors of macroalbuminuria in the current study. Therefore, achievement of good glycemic and blood pressure control and smoking cessation education would be valuable to avoid GFR decline in type 2 diabetic patients, which will be examined in larger populations.</p><p>Our study has certain limitations. The first is that death before the onset of macroalbuminuria is a competing risk that potentially influences the association between macroalbuminuria and its risk factors. We handled such patients as censored because the mortality in this study was low (only 58 deaths [3.9%]) and seemed not to have much effect on the results. The second is that the prognosis of DR has not been examined yet. It is very important to clarify whether the presence of baseline microalbuminuria affects the progression of DR. Therefore, further study is warranted to analyze the prognosis of DR using the same cohort in the future. The final one is that the current study was established when angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were not widely used in our country, unfortunately. Since ARBs became available in 1998 in Japan, the number of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor usage was small&#x02014;12.3% at baseline&#x02014;and was increased gradually to 28.4% at 8 years&#x02019; follow-up based on each physician&#x02019;s decision&#x02014;not on the protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It is well known that RAS inhibitors including ACE inhibitors and ARBs remit microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) or retard the onset of microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). It is important to examine the detailed course of albuminuria or GFR prospectively, focusing on the effects of RAS inhibitors in a Japanese cohort in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the presence of microalbuminuria and/or DR profoundly affects renal function in type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore, diabetologists and ophthalmologists should share their acquired information regarding DN and DR, even if it is at milder stages.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
