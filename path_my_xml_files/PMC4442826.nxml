After 72 hours if the result of blood culture was negative and symptoms resolved they were randomly allocated to 3-day or 5-day groups. The main outcome was treatment failure which was defined as reappearance of symptoms of sepsis within two weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics. Infants with congenital anomalies, localized infections, asphyxia, those undergoing surgery or when serum C-reactive protein levels remained abnormal despite treatment, were not included. Randomization was accomplished with simple randomization procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings:</title><p>Sixty patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either group.

Early onset neonatal sepsis occurs in the first 7 days of life. It has a higher case-fatality rate than late-onset sepsis
<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>In spite of decline in the case-fatality rate of neonatal sepsis over the past two decades, it is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality, justifying prompt initiation of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy
<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
. Accordingly studies have shown that between 4.4% and 10.5% of all newborns in the United States receive systemic antibiotics
<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
. It is estimated that between 11 and 23 non-infected newborns have received antibiotics for each documented bacterial infection at intensive care nurseries
<sup>[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>Such approaches could result in unnecessary use of antibiotics leading to increased cost of care, unnecessary intravenous catheterization, mother-infant separation, prolonged hospitalization, increased colonization by pathogenic organisms, emergence of drug-resistant strains, increased risk of neonatal candidiasis, medication errors, intravenous infiltrates, alteration of gut microflora, necrotizing enterocolitis and death especially with prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents (&#x0003e;5 days) in infants with suspected (with negative blood cultures) early onset sepsis
<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>The recommendations for treatment of these infants are not based on strong evidence. This recommendation is originally based on Pichichero&#x02019;s study who reported that 96% of bacteremic cultures drawn prior to antibiotic therapy are positive by 48 hours and 98% are positive by 72 hours
<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>
. Several studies have evaluated the role of serial CRP measurement as a guide to the duration of antibiotic therapy
<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>
. Two consecutive CRP levels &#x0003c;10 mg/L 24 hours apart, 8&#x02013;48 hours after presentation, have a negative predictive value for sepsis of 99%
<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>This trial was conducted because we did not find well-designed adequately powered trials evaluating the appropriate duration of empirical antimicrobial therapy in blood-culture-negative suspected early onset sepsis despite intensive searching
<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>
. We decided to determine whether a policy of stopping antibiotics with negative blood culture after 72 hours causes significantly higher treatment failure rate than 5-day course antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This was a parallel-group, single blind, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio, conducted August 2013 to December 2013 at two level III NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units) (one in a teaching hospital and the other in a private hospital) in Mazandaran/Iran province.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants, eligibility criteria, and settings</title><p>Eligible participants were infants with birth weight over 1500 g; and/or gestational age over 34 weeks; within 7 days postnatal age; with clinical symptoms of neonatal sepsis e.g. fever, respiratory distress, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, apnea, seizure (ICD-10 Code: P36.9); and/or had abnormal CBC, diff, ESR tests; and/or CXR. A minimum of 1 ml of blood using aseptic technique was taken through venipuncture and injected into biphasic blood-culture bottle. They received empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment until determination of the results of blood cultures and they were included in the study if the results of blood culture were negative and symptoms of neonatal sepsis resolved. Exclusion criteria were infants with congenital heart diseases or major congenital anomalies, clinically suspected localized infections, perinatal asphyxia, those undergoing surgery, CRP levels remained abnormal despite treatment and parental unwillingness to enter the research project.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from the parents before recruitment of their neonates.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Neonates who were admitted to NICU of Amirkola children&#x02019;s hospital or Babol-clinic general hospital and were eligible for the study were treated with empirical antibiotics.</p><p>After 72 hours, asymptomatic neonates with negative results of blood culture were divided into two groups.

Infants in both groups were similar in terms of other routine cares. One infant in 3-day group had treatment failure compared with no treatment failure in 5-day group. (<italic>P</italic>=0.5). The risk difference was 0.03 (95%CI: 0.03&#x02013;0.10).</p><p>This term female infant was born by cesarean section due to placental abruption. Her mother had received intravenous antibiotics before delivery. The neonate had meconium stained amniotic fluid and normal Apgar score. At 42 hours of birth, she was hospitalized due to a brief apnea and cyanosis and mild respiratory distress on physical examination. She had mild hyperaeration in CXR and normal CBC and ESR values. Empirical antibiotics were started after a blood culture. After 72 hours, she was enrolled due to negative blood culture and improvement of symptoms and was assigned to first group and intravenous antibiotics were stopped. Her serum CRP levels at time of hospitalization and antibiotic discontinuation were 1mg/L and 2mg/L respectively. She was re-evaluated due to poor feeding 48 hours after cessation of antibiotics. According to abnormal neonatal reflexes and CRP=56 mg/L, intravenous antibiotics were resumed after blood, urine and CSF cultures. After 7 days, the cultures were negative and the infant was asymptomatic, so antibiotics were stopped and she was discharged.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d; for 3-day and 5-day groups of treatment with intravenous antibiotics for suspected early onset neonatal sepsis was not significantly different.</p><p>It could be that the initial non-specific symptoms were not due to neonatal sepsis as evidenced by a negative blood culture 
<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>Despite the paucity of well-designed adequately powered trials evaluating the appropriate duration of empirical antimicrobial therapy in blood-culture-negative sepsis, it has been recommended that the duration of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be 48&#x02013;72 hours pending culture results for suspected neonatal sepsis
<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>The only pilot study by Saini et al. randomized 52 infants (&#x0003e;30weeks gestation and &#x0003e;1000 g at birth), with culture negative probable sepsis to either short-course (48&#x02013;96 hours) or long-course (7 days) antibiotic therapy. Infants with confirmed sepsis and those who had persisting clinical symptoms were excluded. The choice of antibiotic therapy (cephalosporin, amikacin, and cloxacillin) was made by the treating physician. Three babies in the 7-day group had treatment failure (defined as reappearance of signs of sepsis within 15 days of stopping antibiotics, supported by laboratory evidence) as opposed to none in the short-course group (<italic>P</italic>=0.23)
<sup>[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>In addition to small sample size other limitations of this study include lack of segregation between early- and late-onset sepsis, and usage of different antimicrobial regimens for patients.</p><p>Since previous studies have demonstrated that 96% of bacteremic cultures drawn prior to antibiotic therapy are positive by 48 hours and 98% are positive by 72 hours
<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>
, in this study, treatment duration of 72 hours was considered for first group. On the other hand, studies suggest an association between prolonged empirical treatment of preterm infants (&#x0003e;5 days) with higher risks of late onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality
<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>
, duration of treatment in second group was limited to 5 days. In addition, serum CRP levels were measured before starting and stopping antibiotics. Although based on previous studies C-reactive protein is an excellent marker for established neonatal bacterial infections and has a negative predictive value for sepsis of 99% if two consecutive CRP levels are &#x0003c;10 mg/L 24 hours apart, 8&#x02013;48 hours after presentation
<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
, the only treatment failure occurred in spite of negative blood culture and two normal CRP values. Negative blood culture of this baby could be due to intravenous antibiotics administered to the mother before delivery
<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
.</p><p>According to the difficulty of distinguishing nonspecific symptoms of neonatal sepsis in very low birth weight newborns
<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>
, this study was limited to infants with a gestational age &#x0003e;34 weeks and birth weight &#x0003e;1500 g. Although identifying non-inferiority or equivalence between two groups needs high power trials and thus great sample size, but considering the lack of enough studies in this context and so ethical concerns, this study was performed in 60 neonates. Due to the lack of provision of appropriate placebo for the administered antibiotics and discontinuation of intravenous lines in the majority of infants in first group, providing double-blind study was impossible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the results of this study there is no significant difference in treatment failure between 3-day and 5-day course intravenous antibiotic therapy for suspected early onset uncomplicated neonatal sepsis in late preterm and term newborns.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors would like to thank all staff of NICUs and newborn services of Amirkola children&#x02019;s hospital and Babol-clinic general hospital for their contribution to this study and Dr. Ali Bijani for statistical analysis of the data.
