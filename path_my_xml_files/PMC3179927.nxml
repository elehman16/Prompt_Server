Baseline data on participant demographic, clinical (<italic>e.g</italic>., BP, anti-hypertensive medications), psychosocial (<italic>e.g</italic>., depression, medication adherence, self-efficacy), and behavioral (<italic>e.g</italic>., exercise, diet) characteristics were gathered through direct observation, chart review, and interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The sample was primarily female (71.6%), middle-aged (mean age = 56.9 &#x000b1; 12.1 years), high school educated (62.4%), low-income (72.4% reporting less than $20,000/year income), and received Medicaid (35.9%) or Medicare (12.6%). Mean systolic and diastolic BP were 150.7 &#x000b1; 16.7 mm Hg and 91.0 &#x000b1; 10.6 mm Hg, respectively. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.5 &#x000b1; 1.9 antihypertensive medications; 54.8% were on a diuretic; 33.8% were on a beta blocker; 41.9% were on calcium channel blockers; 64.8% were on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). One-quarter (25.6%) of the sample had resistant hypertension; one-half (55.7%) reported medication non-adherence. Most (79.7%) reported one or more co-morbid medical conditions. The majority of the patients had a Charlson Co-morbidity score &#x02265; 2. Diabetes mellitus was common (35.8%), and moderate/severe depression was present in 16% of participants. Participants were sedentary (835.3  &#x000b1; 1,644.2 Kcal burned per week), obese (59.7%), and had poor global physical health, poor eating habits, high health literacy, and good overall mental health.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A majority of patients in the CAATCH trial exhibited adverse lifestyle behaviors, and had significant medical and psychosocial barriers to adequate BP control.

These disparities may explain the poorer adverse hypertension-related outcomes in African Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The cardiovascular benefits of blood pressure (BP) control are well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as are the utility of patient- and provider-centered interventions in promoting BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Lifestyle interventions of reduced sodium intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and other dietary modifications (increased consumption of fiber, fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy; reduced consumption of saturated and total fat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and increased physical activity and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have resulted in significant BP reduction. While these interventions have proven efficacious in clinical trials, and although there are many community-based interventions that engage African Americans (and are often conducted in low-income communities), their effectiveness remains largely untested among hypertensive African Americans who receive care in low-resource settings such as Community Health Centers (CHCs).</p><p>The Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was designed to evaluate, in a cluster randomized trial, the effectiveness of a multi-level, multi-component, evidence-based intervention compared to usual care (UC) in improving BP control in hypertensive African Americans who receive care in CHCs. The trial targets barriers to optimal hypertension control at the patient, provider, and practice levels in a large cohort of African American adults (n = 1,039) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As such, this trial has the potential to expand our understanding of barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation in 'real-world' clinical settings, as well as the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in previously understudied and underserved populations. This paper describes the demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics of CAATCH trial participants in order to highlight some of the patient-related barriers to hypertension control present in this sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>A detailed description of the rationale, design, and methods of this trial has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of Columbia University, New York University, and Clinical Directors Network (CDN), and all participants provided informed consent to participate. Briefly, CAATCH is a two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented in 30 CHCs, with 15 sites randomly assigned to the intervention condition (IC) and 15 to UC.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The participants included 1,039 African American adult men and women. Patients were eligible for the study if they: self-identified as black or African American; were at least 18 years old, were receiving care at the participating CHC for at least six months prior to enrollment; had a diagnosis of hypertension (HTN), were taking at least one anti-hypertensive medication, and had uncontrolled BP at the time of enrollment based on standardized measurement at study visit (systolic BP (SBP) &#x02265; 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) &#x02265; 90 mmHg; for those with diabetes or kidney disease, SBP &#x02265; 130 mm Hg or DBP &#x02265; 80 mm Hg). Additional details on inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Within the IC sites, the CAATCH intervention is comprised of three components targeted at patients (interactive computerized hypertension education, home BP monitoring, and monthly behavioral counseling on lifestyle modification) and two components targeted at physicians (monthly CME-accredited case rounds based on JNC-7 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], chart audit and provision of feedback on clinical performance, and patients' home BP readings). Additional details on the intervention and its delivery are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The goal of CAATCH was to evaluate, in cluster randomized trial, the effectiveness of a multi-level, multi-component, evidence-based intervention compared to UC in improving BP control among hypertensive African Americans who receive care in CHCs. We hypothesize that patients randomized to the IC will have, compared to those in the UC condition: a higher BP control rate at 12 months; greater reduction in both SBP and DBP at 12 months; and a higher rate of maintenance of intervention effect one year after completion of the trial. In addition, the IC will be more cost-effective in improving BP control rate at 12 months compared to UC.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with adequate BP control at 12 months; and the maintenance of intervention effects one year after the trial. BP was defined as uncontrolled if the average BP &#x02265; 140 mm Hg or DBP &#x02265; 90 mm Hg (for those without comorbidity) OR average SBP &#x02265; 130 mm Hg or DBP &#x02265; 80 mm Hg (for those with diabetes or kidney disease). The secondary outcomes are within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months, and the cost effectiveness of intervention at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection and study measurements were performed by trained research assistants (RAs) via interviews, direct measurements, and chart review. A complete listing of all measures and details of assessment protocol has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At baseline, three BP readings were taken by trained RAs using a validated automated BP monitor (BPTru, Model BPM-300; BpTRU Medical Devices, Coquitlam, BC, Canada) with the patient seated comfortably and following American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The average of the three readings was used as the measure for baseline assessment. Psychosocial and behavioral characteristics were assessed with validated self-report measures and included medication adherence (4-item Morisky Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], self-efficacy (Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale; MASES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], health literacy (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; REALM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], dietary intake (Rapid Eating Assessment for Patients; REAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], physical activity (Paffenbarger Physical Activity Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and general physical and mental health (version one of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey; SF-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. At the CHC site level, data were gathered on whether CHCs utilized electronic health records (EHRs), and whether they were part of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Disparities Collaboratives <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthcarecommunities.org">http://www.healthcarecommunities.org</ext-link>. The HRSA sponsored Health Disparities Collaboratives (HDCs) use the structure of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), which is an organizational approach to caring for people with chronic disease who are seen in a primary care setting. The system is population-based, and creates practical, supportive, evidence-based interactions between an informed, activated patient and a prepared, proactive practice team; it identifies six major categories that must be addressed to achieve substantial change, including the healthcare organization, community resources and policies, self-management support, decision support, delivery system design, and clinical information systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Power analysis and sample size</title><p>The design for the CAATCH trial was based on power calculations for the proposed analysis of differential changes in office SBP and DBP between IC and UC sites (CHCs). These calculations were based on post-intervention data available from Phase one of the medication Adherence and Blood Pressure Control (ABC) trial, which was conducted by this research group in several of the same CHCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. BPs for those in the ABC trial home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) intervention (n = 137) were compared to those in the UC group (n = 80) in nine sites, and office BPs decreased substantially in both conditions (SBP/DBP decreased 12.0/6.0 mmHg in HBPM versus 8.7/3.8 mmHg in UC). Of note, they decreased more (3.3/2.2 mmHg, <italic>p </italic>= 0.053/0.078) in the HBPM condition. Clustered sampling due to patients being nested within sites was controlled for, yielding estimates of the between-site and within-site variances in treatment effect (5.13 and 154.21 for SBP, and 1.72 and 86.35 for DBP). Sites were the primary unit of analysis, given that sites are randomized to treatment condition. To estimate the number of sites required, the within-treatment, between-site variance of site-level mean change scores was first estimated. This is estimated as the between-site (true) variance plus the sampling variability of the site mean. For SBP, this was 5.13 &#x000b1; 154.21/Nsite, and for DBP it was 1.72 &#x000b1; 86.35/Nsite, where Nsite is the number of patients per site. We initially planned for 30 patients per site, yielding variance estimates of 10.28 and 4.60 for site-level mean changes in SBP and DBP; taking square roots gives standard deviation estimates of 3.21 and 2.14. These estimates and the usual power calculations for a t-test were used to determine the number of sites needed to have adequate power to detect a specified effect size. With a total of 30 sites (with 30 patients at each site), 15 assigned to each condition (IC and UC), these estimates implied that there would be 80% and 81% power to detect SBP and DBP treatment effects equal to the HBPM effect reported above (using a 2-tailed, 0.05-level test). Because of the multifaceted nature of the intervention that was implemented in this study, it is reasonable to anticipate treatment effects of at least 4 mm Hg for SBP and 3 mm Hg for DBP. The estimated power to detect effects of this magnitude is 91% and 96%, respectively. Thus, based on this power analysis, we planned to randomize 30 sites (1:1). Because we anticipated approximately a 15% rate of attrition, the enrollment target was set at 1,058 patients from these sites, which would yield a final sample of 900 patients who complete the study (an average of 30 per site).</p></sec><sec><title>Analytic plan</title><p>The CAATCH trial has three nested levels of sampling: site, physician, and patient. Sites were matched for size (large/medium versus small), creating 15 matched pairs. Within each pair, one site was randomly assigned to IC and the other to UC. Due to a variety of unspecified factors, it was assumed that patients from the same site, and perhaps also patients having the same physician, would be somewhat more similar than randomly selected patients attending different CHCs or having different physicians. This implies correlated residuals due to 'clustered sampling,' that will be controlled in the primary outcome analysis by treating both CHC and clinician within CHC as random factors. Maximum likelihood estimates, approximate standard errors, and multi-level modeling statistical tests for primary outcome analysis will be obtained using PROC MIXED (SAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The comparison of treatment groups with respect to dichotomous or ordinal measures (<italic>e.g</italic>., gender or smoker) will be performed using the MIXOR software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which estimates a logistic regression (with random effects). The clustered sampling effects associated with CHC and physician will be adjusted for in the equation. As appropriate, the model will be further augmented to include both person-level covariates (<italic>e.g</italic>., gender) and time-varying covariates (<italic>e.g</italic>., body mass index). As stated, the primary hypothesis concerns the treatment by time interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CHC characteristics</title><p>The 30 CHCs serve primarily low-income, African American populations.

For example, CAATCH participants were heavier than those in the Dallas Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Jackson Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP), and PREMIER trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Obesity rates reported for African Americans in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were only 45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], compared to over two-thirds reported in CAATCH. Similar to published data on medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], one-half of the CAATCH participants reported non-adherence, and they experienced diabetes and cardiovascular disease at rates higher than samples in large scale epidemiological trials such as the Jackson Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In fact, CAATCH participants reported higher co-morbid medical conditions, which are recognized as significant barriers to BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Physical activity levels in the CAATCH sample were very low, with most of the participants characterized as sedentary or insufficiently active. This a higher proportion than rates noted in the most recent NHANES data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A noteworthy finding is that prevalence of smoking in the CAATCH trial was higher than those in the Jackson Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the Dallas Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and recent NHANES data on smoking among overweight and obese adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Further attention is warranted for several of the CAATCH sample's psychosocial and behavioral characteristics. CAATCH participants reported a moderate level of self-confidence in their ability to take antihypertensive medications (as measured by the MASES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and a low level of healthy eating (as measured by the REAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While the average general mental health score (Mental Component Summary of the SF-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] of participants fell within normal range of population based norms, the UC participants scored in the mildly depressed range (as assessed by the PHQ-921). Furthermore, participants reported limitations in general physical functioning (Physical Component Summary of the SF-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Though, on average, participants scored within the normal range on an index of sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], problematic levels of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleep Scale score &#x02265; 10) were present among one-fifth. This rate is higher than the prevalence of daytime somnolence observed in recent NHANES data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], yet lower than rates found in a recent analysis from the Sleep Heart Health Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The problematic daytime sleepiness observed in CAATCH participants may be due in part to the higher prevalence of obesity, which is a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. One-quarter of CAATCH participants had resistant hypertension (defined as any patient with uncontrolled BP who is taking at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic). While thiazide type diuretics are the recommended initial pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], only one-half of the CAATCH sample had been prescribed one. However, this percentage is higher than the diuretic rate reported for a population of hypertensive patients from a large managed care organization, located in the southeastern United States, based on prescription fill data two years following publication of the JNC-7 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of the CAATCH trial is how its participants compare demographically and clinically to large-scale efficacy trials of lifestyle modification on BP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and four recently published effectiveness trials of BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Participation of African Americans in previous efficacy trials ranged from 25 to 50% of the sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], while the CAATCH trial sample consists entirely of African American participants. Of particular note, the CAATCH trial represents a substantive improvement in African American male participation over previous trials in that almost one-third of participants were African American men. By contrast, one-tenth of participants in PREMIER were African American men. To our knowledge, the CAATCH trial includes the largest proportion of African American men in community practice-based trials. Because trust is a major hindrance to recruitment of minorities into clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], we adopted a two-pronged strategy to increase the participation of African American men, in addition to the traditional compensation provided to patients. First, we solicited the support of the CHC patient care coordinators and clerical staff in referring patients into the study. CHC staff typically interacts with patients over a longer period of time and have built significant rapport and trust with the patients, whereas research staff have a shorter duration and more circumscribed relationship with prospective study participations. Second, we asked the clinicians to refer their patients into the trial. This strategy also addresses the issue of trust, building on the existing relationships between patients and providers. In addition, we oversampled African American men, because women comprise 70% of the adult users of CHCs. Finally, we held series of educational sessions at the study sites to inform patients about the study and to identify and screen potentially eligible patients; refreshments were offered at these sessions.</p><p>To our knowledge, CAATCH is the largest practice-based trial of patient and physician targeted interventions for BP control in hypertensive African Americans. We are only aware of three other trials that have targeted both patients and physicians in practice-based settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The first is the HIP trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which is a nested, 2 &#x000d7; 2 RCT comparing physician intervention, patient intervention, and both combined versus control condition, among 574 hypertensive patients in eight primary care practices (32 physicians) in central North Carolina. The second is the Veterans Study to Improve the Control of Hypertension (V-STITCH) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which is a 2-level (primary care provider and patient) cluster RCT among 588 hypertensive patients in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic (17 physicians) in North Carolina. The third is a study by Roumie <italic>et al</italic>., which is a cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] that evaluated the impact of three quality improvement interventions (provider education, provider education and alert, patient education) of increasing intensity among 1,341 hypertensive patients who received care in two hospital-based and eight community-based outpatient clinics (182 providers) in the Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System. One qualitative difference between CAATCH and these trials is that CAATCH was focused exclusively on African Americans. Second, the patients in CAATCH all had uncontrolled hypertension and greater co-morbidity than those in the other practice-based trials. Specifically, CAATCH participants had higher baseline BP, were more sedentary, had greater levels of co-morbidity, and higher current smoking rates than participants in the V-STITCH and HIP trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, CAATCH participants had comparable rates of smoking and higher rates of diabetes, and lower rates of medication adherence than participants in Roumie <italic>et al</italic>. VA-based trial of interventions targeting providers and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Perhaps of even more interest, participants in the CAATCH trial had lower income than those in the HIP, V-STITCH, DASH, and PREMIER trials, had less education than participants in DASH, and PREMIER, and as a group, were more likely to be underinsured. Thus, the patient population in CAATCH is more representative of low-income African Americans with poorly controlled hypertension and numerous adverse lifestyle behaviors and clinical characteristics that constitute barriers to adequate BP control. As such, the findings from CAATCH will provide needed information on effectiveness of lifestyle and self-management approaches in care of this high-risk population in a more generalizable context. Furthermore, the participating CHCs are distributed widely across upstate New York, four boroughs of New York City, Northern New Jersey, and serve low-income, African American patient populations. Utilization of EHRs among the participating sites at the time of recruitment and intervention was relatively low, and approximately one-half of the CHCs participating in the trial were involved in the HRSA Health Disparities Collaborative, an initiative that focuses on improving access to quality healthcare and improved health outcomes among medically underserved in order to reduce or eliminate health disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Several strengths of the CAATCH trial deserve consideration. The first is that CAATCH is an evidence-based multi-level intervention in a very large exclusively African American practice-based sample, in contrast to previous efficacy and recent effectiveness trials in which the rate of African American participation has been more modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Second, CAATCH inclusion criteria allowed for the participation of patients with uncontrolled BP and those taking multiple medications, while the exclusion criteria of previous efficacy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were more conservative by comparison. Third, CAATCH joins a small number of effectiveness trials (implemented in the VA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] or community based primary care clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) in efforts to deliver efficacious treatments in real-world primary care settings. CAATCH is one of few studies to address barriers to BP control in this patient population by evaluating the effectiveness of a practice-based intervention targeted at patients (home BP monitoring, lifestyle intervention plus patient education) and physicians (chart audit and feedback plus physician education). Thus, findings from this trial will extend our understanding of applicability and impact of a multi-level intervention in a population whose hypertension may be particularly difficult to control.</p><p>We should note the following limitations of the CAATCH trial. First, similar to other large scale RCTs in African Americans, majority of CAATCH participants were women, making the results less generalizable to African American men. Second, there were imbalances in several important baseline patient characteristics between the IC and UC study sites, which raises potential threats to internal validity of the study findings. The cluster randomized design of the study sought to minimize baseline differences between both groups via matching of CHCs based on practice size. The reason for the observed baseline differences is not clear. One potential explanation for this imbalance may be the small number of sites that were randomized rather than the number of participants. Although the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the sites on these variables was quite small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], the additional matching of sites by size may have required larger number of sites than the proposed 30 sites. Alternative approaches to mitigate this problem maybe the use of a factorial design with randomization at the level of the providers on characteristics, such as number of years practicing in a community-based setting, size of caseload, and number of hypertensive patients in current caseload. This is the approach adopted by Corsino <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], which often requires matching on lesser number of variables than sites and manageable number of providers and patients needed for the study. Other approaches of randomizing at the patient level with matching may also mitigate this problem, but such an approach is limited by the potential for contamination that is often a problematic in practice-based trials using such design, and the loss of the ability to examine the contribution of matching variables to changes in study outcomes.</p><p>In summary, the demographic and clinical composition of the CAATCH trial participants represents an important contribution to the literature on interventions targeted at poor BP control in a high-risk population. Namely, the trial includes implementation of a multi-level, evidence-based, intervention in a real-world setting among participants who experience multiple demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral barriers to hypertension control. Findings from this trial have important implications for dissemination and implementation. First, successful conduct of this study will be an indication that complex multi-level intervention can be integrated into care of high-risk hypertensive African Americans who receive care in CHCs. Second, imbalance noted in the baseline data indicates that investigators considering cluster RCT design in this patient population should strongly consider enrolling a larger number of sites and possibly an alternative design with randomization at the provider level. Third, recruitment of this high-risk patient population was achieved with significant cooperation from the clinical and administrative staff at the participating CHCs. A major lesson learned in this regard is the underlying assumption that all CHCs do not operate in the same manner. While their payment structure may be similar, the staffing in these sites is quite varied in terms of the use of allied health providers and availability of health educators who can provide lifestyle counseling and patient education. Furthermore, the level of enthusiasm for pragmatic trials is quite different for each CHC, with some having more research experience and others lacking experience. This factor affected recruitment rates, follow-up rates, and delivery of the intervention. Specifically, sites that were more research-friendly had the highest completion rates with easier delivery of the intervention. Future practice-based research should better characterize the research sites along these dimensions in order to facilitate implementation of such complex studies and to assess the interaction between aspects of study implementation and CHC trial characteristics. Fourth, implementation of the patient level component of the intervention, including lifestyle counseling, could be strengthened by a flexible delivery format. For example, we found that a combination of in-person intervention sessions coupled with telephone check-in or booster sessions to support patient up-take of new skills allowed us to improve treatment fidelity levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The CAATCH trial is the first of its kind to focus on the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention for BP control in a large, socio-demographically and clinically diverse sample of hypertensive African American patients receiving primary care in safety-net settings.
