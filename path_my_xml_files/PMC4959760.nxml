Protons (<sup>1</sup>H) exist in numerous body parts; therefore, the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) method of detecting chemical shifts of <sup>1</sup>H can be very useful for applications in clinical settings because <sup>1</sup>H-MRS produces a strong MR signal, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The usefulness extends to in vivo study of human metabolism, studies of different disease states and effects of interventions.</p><p>Conventionally, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS has been used only in the field of neuroradiology.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, it was not common for studies of skeletal muscle due to a difficulty in shimming. Recently, it has also been applied in studies of skeletal muscle, and has recently gained popularity for the measurement of fat metabolism.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>As for MRS of skeletal muscle, <sup>31</sup>P and <sup>13</sup>C have been studied in addition to <sup>1</sup>H. <sup>31</sup>P and <sup>13</sup>C have been used mainly for assessment of the metabolisms of phosphate compounds<xref rid="b5-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and glycogen.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Boesch et al reported that skeletal muscle <sup>1</sup>H-MRS could differentiate intramyocellular lipids (IMCL), which exist as droplets near the mitochondria of skeletal muscle cells, from extramyocellular lipids (EMCL), which exist in the stroma.<xref rid="b9-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Skeletal muscle <sup>1</sup>H-MRS can detect the spectra of water and lipid peaks in skeletal muscle. Additionally, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS might suppress the signal from water content, and it might successfully differentiate between IMCL and EMCL. Many studies have been conducted on IMCL because it is considered a key factor in clarifying the pathogenesis of lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), and <sup>1</sup>H-MRS might be used for quantitative and noninvasive measurement for these lipids. It has also been applied in the field of sports medicine. Interestingly, marathon runners have high IMCL content, and this is thought to enable the efficient use of lipids during exercise.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b10-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS has recently been applied to several fields of scientific study.</p><p>We started to study in vivo metabolic fat assessments and muscle conditioning in sports athletes. Initially, we attempted to optimize the scanning parameters by referencing several past studies reporting adequate data acquisition for lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle. However, we were unable to differentiate between the lipid content peaks of IMCL and EMCL in some cases. We acquired data from all subjects by using the same scanning parameters. However, there have apparently been both successful and unsuccessful cases.</p><p>We hypothesize that the cause of this difference is related not only to the optimization of scanning parameters and the quality of the MR system, but it might also reflect different attributes among subjects that could affect successful data acquisition.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to clarify whether differences in the attributes of the subject groups affect the probability of successful data acquisition; namely, differences in age, health status, and the target muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects and measurement method</title><p>The subjects included a total of 68 participants, including 22 participants with diabetes. Diabetes was type II for all the cases. The subjects without diabetes were divided into group A (19 individuals in their 20s; average age, 25.9&#x000b1;2.1 years; average body mass index [BMI], 22.95&#x000b1;2.21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and group B (27 individuals aged 30&#x02013;60 years; average age, 41.58&#x000b1;7.38 years; average BMI, 23.95&#x000b1;2.74 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); subjects with diabetes formed group C (22 individuals aged 30&#x02013;60 years; average age, 50.9&#x000b1;14 years; BMI, 26.91&#x000b1;5.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). For all subjects, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measurements were taken from muscles in the lower thigh (soleus muscle [SOL] and anterior tibial muscle [AT]). AT has a simple structure as it consists of linear combination of the muscle fibers. On the other hand, a structure of SOL is complicated, as the muscle fibers cross. Dependence on the muscle of the signal difference between IMCL and EMCL was considered to be evaluated by AT and SOL comparison. There was no difference in BMI among the three groups.</p><p>We used a 3-T MR device (Achieva; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) and a six-channel Torso coil. Data were acquired by using the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence. The PRESS sequence parameters used in this study were as follows: a repetition time of 3,000 ms, an echo time of 40 ms, a bandwidth of 2,000 Hz, 1,024 sampling points, and 96 repetitions. The volume of interest (VOI) was single voxel of 15&#x000d7;15&#x000d7;30 mm size. The regional saturation technique distribution followed the shape of the measured region. Shimming was performed through automatic processing. The data obtained were analyzed with LCModel (LCMODEL Inc., Oakville, ON, Canada).<xref rid="b12-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Examinations of measurement success rates</title><p>Because our goal in this <sup>1</sup>H-MRS analysis of skeletal muscle was to obtain information about IMCL and EMCL, the sharpness of the separation between the two peaks was graded and taken as an indicator of measurement success. In the analysis results, we regarded cases with an error of 0 and with a standard deviation of &#x02265;20 as failures (0 points), and the remaining cases were regarded as successes (1 point). We compared the measurement success rate for the SOL and AT in groups A, B, and C, and examined the influence of differences between the skeletal muscles. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to check for statistically significant differences. Next, we examined the influence of age and the presence or absence of DM on the measurement success rate of the SOL in the three groups. The Steel&#x02013;Dwass method was used to check for statistically significant differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Examinations based on the full width at half maximum of the water peak</title><p>For the SOL and AT measurements in all subjects, we measured the full width at half maximum (FWHM [Hz]) of the water peak, which is a shimming indicator, and Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to check for statistically significant differences between the SOL and AT. The Steel&#x02013;Dwass method was used for checking for statistically significant differences in the FWHM of the water peak depending on age and the presence or absence of DM.</p><p>This study was approved by the University of Tsukuba Hospital Ethics Committee (H21-414, University of Tsukuba), and all the procedures were performed after providing a thorough explanation of the purpose of the study to the subjects.

We hypothesized that this difference is strongly related to anatomical differences.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is divided according to gross anatomy characteristics (eg, the pinnate muscle versus the fusiform muscle). The pennation angle is a key factor in this differentiation. The pennation angle is defined as the angle between the aponeurosis and the skeletal muscle fiber. The SOL has been shown to have a large and variable pennation angle in several ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.<xref rid="b13-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> On the contrary, the AT has been shown to be almost straight in its craniocaudal pennation angle, which means that the AT has a lower pennation angle than the other calf muscles. Additionally, the pennation angle variation is very small. The AT has anatomic structural regularity, whereas the SOL presents structural irregularity.</p><p>In a VOI, the regularity of a structure (eg, the AT) allows less opportunity to measure the irregularly distributed stromal components such as the gross fatty or vascular components. On the contrary, the SOL has a higher potential for measurement of fatty or vascular components, with its mingled skeletal muscle fibers. These structural differences might result in differences in the success rate.</p><p>We have evidence to support our hypothesis. We measured shimming conditions in all subjects. The index of shimming conditions is the FWHM. When observing the FWHM, the water peak is significantly sharper in the AT than in the SOL. However, shimming comparisons between the young and old and between healthy and DM patients showed no significant differences. Therefore, anatomical differences apparently affected the shimming conditions. An increase in the FWHM of water induced a worse shimming condition, which could also be the cause of the spectrum baseline distortion and decrease in the accuracy in the spectrum divisions. This decrease in accuracy in the spectrum divisions might affect the division of the IMCL and EMCL, because the IMCL chemical shift is 1.3 ppm, whereas that of the EMCL is 1.5 ppm, which are very close.</p><p>There have been several studies that support our hypothesis. Studies of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) showed apparent correlations between the pennation angle and DTT visualization. Concretely, the AT is very easy to be depicted by DTT, but the SOL is not. DTT is a method of tracking more highly anisotropic structures.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Thus, the AT, which could have a regular structure at the macroscopic level, also showed excellent DTT, which represents phenomena at the microscopic level, and the SOL could produce the opposite. This means that differences in the microscopic anatomical structure, such as water molecule diffusion (eg, at the micrometer level), might also affect the MRI signal.</p><p>Factors of aging and DM also decrease the rate of successful data acquisition. These factors tend to induce sarcopenia. Additionally, the above factors are related to decreases in the metabolic rate. Previous papers suggest that healthy adults gain 0.454 kg of fat and lose 0.227 kg of muscle per year from their thirties to their sixties every year.<xref rid="b19-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This increase in fatty components might also be a cause of erroneous measurements.</p><p>Sarcopenia and increases in fat might also cause irregularities in muscle fiber direction. One report suggests that aging causes an elevation in fractional anisotropy.<xref rid="b22-tcrm-12-1133" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A decrease in fractional anisotropy represents a decrease in the anisotropy of water molecules in the skeletal muscle. Anisotropy also represents the irregularity of muscle fibers at the microscopic level. This also increases the excess components in the VOI in the measurements made by <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, with decreases in the shimming level.</p><p>We hypothesize that the decrease in erroneous measurements were related to factors of aging, and DM might be induced for these reasons.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that the correlation between differences in the microscopic structure of skeletal muscles in the present subjects and the success or failure of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS was not investigated. However, because this was a retrospective study, it was physically difficult to perform comparisons with the diffusion tensor imaging results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The successfulness of the differentiation of IMCL and EMCL was evaluated in this study. It is shown that IMCL cannot be differentiated from EMCL not only by the factors on the equipment such as shimming and data acquisition parameters, but also the biological factors. The <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measurement success rates of IMCL and EMCL in skeletal muscle are affected by age, the presence or absence of DM, and the anatomic structures of different skeletal muscle types.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Financial support for this study was provided by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (26350882) and Grant-in-Aid for Challenging
