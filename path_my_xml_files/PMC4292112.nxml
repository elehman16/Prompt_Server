Most of the confusion and debate exists about the right approach for fractures of the mandibular angle. There are certain prerequisites for choosing approach: Type of fracture, amount of displacement of fractured segments, number of fractured segments, ease of accessibility and visibility, perfect anatomic reduction of the segments, perpendicular application of drilling device for fixation and approach related complications Hence a prospective study was performed in patients with mandibular angle fractures between transoral and extraoral (submandibular) approach for management of mandibular angle fractures to evaluate ease of accessibility, time taken for the procedure, ease of anatomic reduction and complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective study was done in 30 patients reporting to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh from November 2011 to August 2013 who were randomly divided in two groups based on computer generated randomization chart. Group I constituted 15 patients requiring ORIF were approached transorally and Group II constituted 15 patients requiring ORIF were approached extraorally. The inclusion criteria of this study was: Unilateral displaced mandibular angle fractures with deranged occlusion, mandibular angle fractures associated with other maxillofacial injuries and patients with undisplaced angle fractures who were not willing for intermaxillary fixation (IMF). Patients who had fractures of mandibular angle but not willing for open reduction, medically compromised patients who were not fit for general anaesthetic procedures, mandibular angle fractures treated elsewhere before/malunited were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board and a structural informed consent was taken from all patients included in this study.</p><p>All eligible patients underwent routine clinical and radiological examination (computed tomography, posteroanterior [PA] view of skull, Orthopantomogram) and haematological examinations of the patients were carried out.

A subplatysmal flap was elevated. Facial artery and vein were identified and ligated. Dissection of the pterygomassetric sling was done and further dissection exposed the periosteum of inferior border of mandible which was incised thereby exposing the fractured site. IMF was placed.

In Group II patients, one patient (6.7%) had a post-operative transient marginal mandibular nerve weakness on the operated side. There was a complete recovery of the sensation after 6 months. Hence, statistically there was no much of significant complication noted in either of the groups. There was a satisfactory healing of extra oral incision 4 weeks following the surgery and the scar was inconspicuous [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 8</xref>].

Treatment philosophies range from simple maxillo-mandibular immobilization to rigid internal fixation of bone fragments.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Fracture can occur either anterior or posterior to mandibular third molar but rarely involving it. The basic need of rigid internal fixation is primary bone healing under conditions of absolute stability. Rigid internal fixation must neutralize all forces (tension, compression, torsion, shearing) developed during functional loading of the mandible to allow for immediate function.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hamill <italic>et al</italic>. advocated that successful fixation method depends upon the choice of approach.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Extra oral approach was once the most standard traditional and popular approach for management of mandibular angle fractures when compared to transoral approach which was first given by Kazanjian in 1933. Due to the increasing aesthetic demands of the patient and avoidance of extraoral scar, transoral approach has overcome the extraoral approach for the management of mandibular angle fractures[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The main aim of any approach is to promote rapid healing and restore the anatomical form and function with particular care to restablish the functional occlusion and facial aesthetics with minimal disability and complications. A very few studies have been done by Raveh <italic>et al</italic>., Ellis and Karas, to discuss the differences between transoral and extraoral approaches.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Decision regarding the approach most often depends upon the anatomical location of the fracture line, type of fracture, amount of displacement of the fractured segments, dentition of the patient, associated maxillofacial fractures and general condition of the patient.</p><p>There was an increase in the time taken to expose and fix the fracture site in Group II patients by 23.7 min when compared to Group I patients. This might be due to need for careful extraoral dissection of the tissues, preservation of marginal mandibular nerve, identification and ligation of facial vessels. This was in favour of previous study done by Toma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in 2003 who found a difference of 21 min between transoral and extraoral approach.</p><p>The ease of accessibility of the fractured site for visibility and instrumentation was good in 86.7% in Group II patients than 53.3% in Group I patients. This provides better chances of good anatomical reduction and control of proximal fragment of the mandible and no iatrogenic damage to the adjacent structures. The advantage of extraoral approach is fixation of 2 miniplates, one at the superior border and one at the inferior border of the mandible to control the tension forces in upper border and compression forces in lower border however certain authors suggest a single superior border plating is enough using transoral approach.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Extraoral approach also benefits in providing access for transosseous wiring at the lower border of mandible to assist reduction of the severely displaced fractured segments due to the pterygomassetric pull.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Difficulty level index was calculated in both the groups based on the time taken for the surgery. There is no much significant difference between both groups. All the patients were operated by 2 maxillofacial surgeons who had more than 6 years of clinical experience in same maxillofacial surgical unit with 2 postgraduate residents. One patient in Group II had a post-operative transient marginal mandibular nerve weakness which was recovered after 6 months following medications. Healing of the incision site in all the patients was good and was inconspicuous in the natural crease of the facial skin. A large incision is much more likely to leave a scar than a small incision but at the same time it must provide a good visualization of the fractured site for reduction and fixation. The deeper and longer the incision, the greater the opportunity for scarring. In our Group II cases, all incisions were 3-4 cm which gave a good exposure for the reduction of fractures. There was no post-operative infection of the extraoral incision or any scar formation in any of our Group II patients and all the incisions healed well with time. Initially all the scars were hard, non-pliable and erythematous, but due course of time they became soft, pale and pliable. Topical application of steroid was given for all Group II\(patients). Evaluation of the extraoral skin incision was done on a periodical basis during follow-up of the patient. None of our Group II patients complained for any cosmetic deformity. Post-operative occlusion was satisfactory in all patients with a mean mouth opening of 35 mm in both groups. Reasons for the post-operative infection of the plate in patient in Group I might be due to improper oral hygiene measures, longer intra-operative time, increased surgical trauma due to excessive manipulation for reduction and fixation of the fractured segments, salivary contamination of the operative field and inadequate post-operative instructions. Empirical antibiotics for compound fractures of the mandibular angle should be instituted as soon as possible after the injury to prevent infection. They should be continued at least until after surgical treatment has been provided. The worth of post-operative antibiotics has not been demonstrated. Complication rates of 0% and 10% were found by some authors[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] on fractures treated before or after 3 days of the injury. Most of the infections were due transoral approach with or without associated tooth in fracture line irrespective whether it was extracted or retained.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However Moreno <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] advocated that post-operative complication is related to the severity of fracture rather than to the approach of treatment used. Another popular approach is transbuccal which includes both transoral and extraoral stab incision for fixation of mandibular angle fractures. Sugar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in 2009 randomly studied 140 patients with mandibular angle fractures to compare fixation with a single mini plate either placed from a combined transbuccal and transoral approach, or intra-orally alone and concluded that transbuccal approach was more preferred by surgeons with the principal reasons being easy to use, minimal requirement to bent fixation in the plate and facilitation of placement of the plate in the neutral mid-point area of the mandible.</p><p>Important finding from our prospective study is that fracture line starting anterior to mandibular third molar and ending at anteroinferior border of the insertion of the masseter muscle can be approached transorally as it gives an enough accessibility and visibility for the operating surgeon for the reduction and fixation of the fractured segments with simultaneous control of occlusion, ease of removing the 3<sup>rd</sup> molar if it is fractured/subluxated or causing an obstruction for the reduction of the fractured segments, less dissection and operating time and minimal oedema due to less manipulation of tissues and minimal healing time. However, the disadvantages include the inability to manage the fractures occurring in the posterior angle region, lack of perpendicular orientation of the drilling device, contamination of the operated site with saliva containing bacteria and food debris if the surgical site doesn&#x02019;t have a water tight closure. However studies done earlier revealed that transoral approach are as stable as extra oral approach and concern over post-operative infections is just unjustified.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>If the fracture line is starting posterior to the third molar or fracture line extending high in the ramus, extra oral approach provides a better choice. It provides a sterile environment for the fixation devices, an excellent direct visual exposure, accessibility and control of proximal as well as distal fractured segments for reduction to get an excellent anatomical contour and occlusion of the mandible. It also helps in direct application of fixation devices without difficulty to retract the tissue as seen in transoral approach.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Some authors proposed that the angle and posterior body fracture have high positive bending moments, small torsion moments and high shear forces and hence need for stability of fixation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This can only be achieved with a good decision of the approach for management of fractures.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] But simultaneously extraoral approach has a great concern regarding a long cutaneous undesirable scar and also there is an increase likelihood of injury to the branches of marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and other associated vital anatomic structures in the hands of inexperienced surgeon and there might be chances of postoperative oedema due to extensive dissection of the tissues with this approach. However from our study we conclude that when compared to the ease of reduction and fixation of fractures and avoidance of residual deformities, extra oral scar is negligible. Achievement of functional and anatomical occlusion is the utmost goal for early rehabilitation of the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The statistical analysis of this study concludes that fracture line starting anterior to mandibular third molar and ending at anteroinferior border of the insertion of the masseter muscle or posterior body of mandible can be approached transorally. Fracture line starting posterior or distal to the third molar or posterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle to the angle of the mandible or fracture line extending high in the ramus, highly unfavourable angle fractures, oblique angle fractures, muscle entrapment between the fractured segments and when there is existing laceration, extra oral approach provides a better choice for reduction and fixation of the fractured segments with restoration of anatomical and functional occlusion.</p><p>However as the study sample is less, studies should be done with a large scale of patients to draw definitive conclusions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kuriakose</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Fardy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sirikumara</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Patton</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugar</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparative review of 266 mandibular fractures with internal fixation using rigid (AO/ASIF) plates or mini-plates</article-title><source>Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1996</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>315</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8866068</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rix</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Punnia-Moorthy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An analysis of 80 cases of mandibular fractures treated with miniplate osteosynthesis</article-title><source>Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1991</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>337</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1770237</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haug</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Prather</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Indresano</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An epidemiologic survey of facial fractures and concomitant injuries</article-title><source>J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1990</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>926</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2395044</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fonseca</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>RV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral and Maxillofacial Trauma</article-title><year>1997</year><volume>1</volume><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Pennsylvania</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.
