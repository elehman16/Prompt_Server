After CCH treatment of their male partners with PD, female sexual partners reported statistically significant improvement (using the PDQ-FSP) in assessment of male partner's PD symptoms (problems during vaginal intercourse; questions S1 to S5) and female bother by their partner's PD (questions S6 to S10; mean score decreases&#x000a0;= 4.8 [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001] and 2.0 [<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= .02], respectively). The last two items of the PDQ-FSP (questions S11 and S12) asked female sexual partners to evaluate the overall changes in their sex lives and in their relationships as a result of partner treatment. Most female sexual partners reported an overall improvement in their sex life (69.6%) and their relationship with their partner (56.5%) since the partner's treatment.</p><p>Statistically significant improvement also was observed on the FSFI domains of arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain (mean change from baseline&#x000a0;= 1.24, 1.54, 1.42, 1.40, and 1.70, respectively); mean improvement on the desire domain (0.3) was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>).

The IMPRESS I and II were conducted in parallel over 52 weeks and, in addition to intralesional injections of CCH or placebo, all patients underwent investigator modeling of the penile plaque and were instructed to perform penile modeling at home.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Therefore, the baseline values for patients in this study offer a glimpse at the natural history of PD after approximately 1 year of using this &#x0201c;active placebo.&#x0201d; For the combined IMPRESS I and II populations, the mean penile curvature deformity at baseline was 49.3&#x000b0; (SD&#x000a0;= 14.0&#x000b0;) in men who were assigned to the placebo arms.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In this study, the mean penile curvature deformity for the mITT population at baseline was 46.9&#x000b0; (SD&#x000a0;= 12.0&#x000b0;), which does not support any meaningful effect of the intralesional placebo injections or penile modeling over the course of a year in this group of patients. Similarly, rates of spontaneous improvement were likely to have been negligible.</p><p>How PD affects men's sexual partners is largely unknown, although speculation based on clinical experience with ED suggests that detrimental effects are likely.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> How PD treatment affects sexual partners seems even less understood. For surgical PD treatments, satisfaction rates for men and their partners vary by the type of surgery performed but are generally high.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, to our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine the effects of PD and PD treatment on affected men and their partners. In this study, after CCH treatment for PD, many female sexual partners reported that their partner's PD symptoms improved and that they were less bothered by their partner's PD symptoms. Most female sexual partners also reported global improvement in their sex lives and in their relationships with their partners. Interestingly, all domains of the FSFI showed improvement in <italic>female</italic> sexual function after PD treatment. Conversely, the percentages of female sexual partners reporting sexual dysfunction decreased substantially after partner treatment. Although direct comparisons cannot be made between PD and ED, the current study results seem consistent with those of studies that have reported improvements in female sexual function after treatment of the male partner's ED (ie,&#x000a0;treatment of a medical condition in one sexual partner improved the functioning of the other).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Limitations of this study include the open-label study population, the inclusion of only heterosexual couples, and the small number of female sexual partners who participated. However, although conclusions on the efficacy of CCH in the management of PD are limited by the unblinded nature of this study and the lack of a control group, the findings are consistent with previous studies and add to our knowledge of the efficacy and safety of CCH. In addition, despite the small number of female sexual partners who participated in the study, this is the first study to examine the effects of PD and PD treatment on sexual partners of men affected by PD. This represents an important first step in evaluating the effects of PD beyond the patient with PD and the patient's own views of his health and the health of his relationships.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this open-label study further support the safety and efficacy of CCH in the treatment of men with PD and provide some new evidence on the detrimental psychosocial effects of PD on affected men and their female sexual partners.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Statement of authorship</title><p><list list-type="simple"><title>Category 1</title><list-item id="o0010"><label>(a)</label><p>Conception and Design<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><p>Irwin Goldstein; L.
