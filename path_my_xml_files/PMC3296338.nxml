Gastro-intestinal disorders show high prevalence in pediatric practice. These conditions generally produce chronic illness. <italic>Grahanidosha</italic> is a disease related with <italic>Agnidushti</italic>. This condition is seen more in childhood period due to faulty dietary habit and changing lifestyle. The present paper deals with study on etiopathogenesis of <italic>Grahanidosha</italic> and evaluates the efficacy of <italic>Deavadarvyadi-Vati</italic>. The etiological factors and symptoms were observed carefully to make clear etiopathogenesis. Total 32 patients (3-12 years) were registered and randomly divided into two groups.

It is certain that socioeconomic and environmental factors are responsible for a much greater prevalence of digestive disorders. Digestive diseases commonly affect the persons at the prime period of their life i.e., in the young - most productive part of the life and the children during the crucial stage of growth and development. Most of the digestive diseases are chronic or recurrent and lead to more disability than acute transient illness. <italic>Grahanidosha</italic> is a disease related with gastrointestinal disorders. This condition is seen more in childhood period due to irregular dietary habit like over-eating; more ingestion of cool, heavy, dry, fried and dehydrated food. A wide variety of gastrointestinal symptoms like loss of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, etc., have been reported in children. Gastrointestinal disorders show high prevalence in pediatric practice. But in today's era, this condition mostly goes unnoticed under the burden of antibiotics or at times is either not reported by the child or is not taken up seriously by the parents. These conditions generally hamper growth and development of the child and produce chronic illness. Proper care of digestive diseases in children will help in &#x0201c;Adding life to years&#x02026;as well as years to life.&#x0201d;</p><p>The formulation having the property of <italic>Deepana-Pachana</italic> has been selected for present study in the form of <italic>Devadarvyadi-Vati</italic> as treated group mentioned by <italic>Acharya Charaka</italic> in <italic>Chikitsa Sthana Grahanidosha Chikitsa Adhyaya</italic> 15/99.
