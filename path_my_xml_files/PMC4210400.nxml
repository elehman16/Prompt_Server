proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) scapular and pelvic patterns might
decrease the pain index and increase the lumbar flexibility of obese patients with low
back pain. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty obese patients with low back pain were randomly
assigned to an experimetal group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The exercise program
of the experimental group consisted of scapular patterns (anterior depression &#x02212; posterior
elevation) and pelvic patterns (anterior elevation &#x02212; posterior depression). The control
group performed neutral back muscle strengthening exercises. Over the course of four
weeks, the groups participated in PNF or performed strengthening exercises for 30 minutes,
three times per week. Subjects were assessed a pre-test and post-test using measurements
of pain and lumbar flexibility. [Results] The results show that lumbar flexion and lumbar
extension significantly improved in the experimental group, had significant improvement
and that the Oswestry Disability index (ODI) significantly decreased. However, there were
no significant changes in the control group. The experimental group also showed
significant differences in the pain index and lumbar flexibility from the control group.
[Conclusion] This study showed that PNF can be used to improve pain index rating and
lumbar flexibility. The findings indicate that the experimental group experienced greater
improvement than the control group by participating in the PNF lumbar stabilization
program.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As society has become highly industrialized and automated, physical activity has decreased,
triggering an overall lack of exercise and which resulted in chronic diseases accompanied by
diverse activity disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these,
low back pain is a clinical, social, and economic problem affecting everybody, and it is a
very important and common condition among humans<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are diverse causes of low back pain. Physical conditions, such as obesity may lead to
secondary occurrence of low back pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, abdominal obesity causes an imbalance in the muscles around the pelvis, and this
unbalanced muscle pattern triggers excessive activity of the hip joint flexors, to
compensate for the weakened abdominal muscles, hip joint contracture, and anterior pelvic
tilt, which results in lordosis and, therefore, low back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Generally, the etiology of obesity with low back pain has been clarified by focusing on
structural parts, such as vertebral joints and intervertebral discs, and muscular
injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, a lot of research has been conducted on improving
the muscle strength of abdominally obese patients through muscle strengthening exercise
programs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>; decreasing pain and enhancing dynamic balance through the use of
directional tilt and rotation exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>;
strengthening of the lumbar region using a ball<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>; engaging in endurance and flexibility training<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; and implementing core muscle stabilizing
exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; and pain control<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, those previous studies solved
structural problems through simple lumbar strengthening exercises and they focused on
strengthening large muscle groups, such as the abdominal muscles. They were lacking in
co-contraction and flexibility training and, therefore, they failed to contribute much to
the stabilization of the lumbar region<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
A previous study recommended proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), which may
stimulate the proprioceptive senses of the lumbar region muscles, and is useful for training
sensory-motor regulation and balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, this study examined the effects of PNF intervention on lumbar flexibility and the
pain index of obese patients with low back pain using interventions for low back pain
patients described in previous studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 obese males in their 20s to 40s who visited S Hospital
located in Daegu Metropolitan City complaining of low back pain from April 15, 2014 to May
15, 2014. The subjects were randomly and equally assigned to an experimental group and a
control group. The criteria for inclusion in this study were: people who had visited the
hospital and received treatment for low back pain; people whose body mass index (BMI) was
higher than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>,
people who had not undergone vertebral fixation or other surgical treatments, and people
who had no cardiovascular diseases related to abdominal obesity and/or metabolic diseases
such as diabetes mellitus. The subjects understood the purpose of this study and consented
to participation in it. This study was approved by the IRB of the Korea Nazarene
University and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration

times per week, for four weeks, after receiving basic physical therapy (hot pack, ICT, US)
and resting for five minutes. Four physical therapists with three years of experience, and
who had completed PNF levels 1 and 2 trained the experimental group.</p><p>The subjects lay on a bed and began the exercise. In order to exercise the upper
extremities first, a therapist positioned himself at the head of each of the subjects, one
by one, and manipulated each of the subject&#x02019;s shoulder joints in a scapular pattern
(anterior depression &#x02212; posterior elevation pattern) using the basic principles of PNF. The
therapist held the acromion areas of the subject&#x02019;s shoulders with both hands and
instructed the subject to &#x0201c;move the shoulder bone toward the pelvis of the opposite side&#x0201d;.
The therapist provided adequate resistance after successful trajectory contraction of the
abdominal muscles while the subject&#x02019;s shoulders were moving. Then, the therapist conducted
a pelvic pattern exercise (anterior elevation &#x02212; posterior depression pattern). He held the
anterior ridge of the subject&#x02019;s pelvis and instructed the subject to &#x0201c;move the pelvic bone
toward the shoulder of the opposite side&#x0201d;, triggering movement of the pelvis and resulting
in trajectory contraction of the abdominal muscles. The therapist then provided adequate
resistance. At that time, for irradiation effect against the resistance, each of the
subjects alternately conducted muscle contractions on both sides of their bodies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were allowed to rest
whenever they felt fatigue during the exercise.</p><p>The control group performed strengthening exercises three times per week for four weeks
after basic physical therapy (HP, ICT, US) and resting for five minutes. For an ordinary
lumbar muscle strengthening exercise, the control group conducted a warm-up exercise
(stretching) for five minutes, a flexion exercise (raising the upper abdominal region in a
lying position, stretching the knees and raising the legs, and flexing the trunk by
stretching the arms and raising the legs in a side-lying position) for 10 minutes, an
extension exercise (pulling the chin and lifting the head and raising the trunk in a prone
position, raising one leg while laying the arms comfortably in a prone position) for 10
minutes, and a cool-down exercise (stretching, breathing exercise) for five minutes<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the subjects felt fatigue during
the exercise, they rested.</p><p>The flexibility of the lumbar region through measured with trunk flexion and trunk
extension. In order to measure trunk flexion, the subjects drew their heels together and
stretched their fingers; they then slowly bent their body forward. Measurements were taken
while rebound of the body and bending of the knees were prevented. In order to measure
trunk extension, the subjects lay prone on a mat with both hands behind their waist, and
the assistant fixed the ankles of the subjects and raised their upper body high,
maintaining that position for more than one second. Measurements were taken from the
ground to the subjects&#x02019; chins. Measurements of trunk flexion and extension were taken
three times and the average values were recorded in cm<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Measurements were taken prior to and after the experiment of
both the experimental group and the control group subjects.</p><p>To analyze low back pain the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used. ODI is a scale
that measures the response that patients with low back pain have to activities of daily
living and disorders. ODI consists of 10 items (the degree of pain, self-management,
raising objects, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, hobbies, movement, and sexual
activity). According to the degree of the patients&#x02019; performance, each of the 10 items is
assigned a point ranging from zero to five. The condition of no pain is given zero points
and the condition of the worst degree of pain is given five points. The total score was 50
points<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study converted the
total score into percentages. The ODI of the experimental group and the control group were
measured prior to and after the experiment.</p><p>For analysis, this study used SPSS ver. 12.0, and each group&#x02019;s mean and standard
deviation were calculated. In order to compare differences in the lumbar flexibility
between each group prior to and after the exercise, two-way ANOVA was conducted, and in
order to compare differences between the groups after the experiment, the independent
t-test was carried out. The significance level (&#x003b1;) was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Lumbar flexion and lumbar extension significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) and ODI

gradually increases as the degree of obesity becomes higher<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the treatment of gradually increasing low back pain in obese
people, the effect of treating low back pain with exercise therapy rather than surgical
therapy was recently clarified, and exercise therapy has developed as an area that has drawn
a great deal of attention<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching
and physical exercise programs are effective for low back pain patients, and in particular,
exercises combined with muscle resistance and aerobic exercises have the best effects<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because a lot of research has already
proven the usefulness of manual exercise therapy directly provided by therapists in a
variety of exercise treatment methods<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study examined the effects of
combination patterns of the PNF on lumbar flexibility and pain index of 30 patients. In
order to reduce subject muscle fatigue and efficiently increase their muscle strength, the
number of exercise repetitions, duration, and resting time should be taken into
consideration<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and exercise should be
conducted for no longer than 20 to 30 minutes a session, two to five times per week, for
four to 12 weeks<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study
conducted exercises for 30 minutes a session, three times per week, for four weeks.</p><p>After four weeks of intervetion, lumbar flexibility and pain index were reassessed. The
experimental group&#x02019;s in lumbar flexion and extension significantly increased after the
intervention, compared to prior to the intervention. However, the control group showed no
significant improvement. In the assessment of changes after the experiment, the experimental
group showed a greater improvement than the control group in all items and a significant
increase in lumbar extension. The experimental group&#x02019;s low back pain index significantly
decreased compared to the control group, and there was a significant difference between the
two groups in terms of the changes after the experiment.</p><p>When PNF combination patterns are applied, the ability of skeletal muscles to trigger
tensile force that is swiftly obtained at an early period greatly contributes to neural
responses, not adaptive changes in the muscles themselves. Such proprioceptive responses to
stimuli lead to repetitive contraction of the muscles, causing concurrent contraction of the
rectus abdominis, oblique abdominal, and transverse abdominis muscles. Consequently,
concurrent contraction of the spinal stabilization muscles occurs, and muscle strength is
increased, raising internal abdominal pressure and strengthening the trunk, helping
functional movement of the human body, greatly effecting an increase in lumbar flexibility
and a reduction of low back pain.</p><p>Bae et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that dynamic
lumbar stabilization exercise decreased the low back pain disability index of patients with
chronic low back pain. Ha<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that
lumbar stabilization exercises performed by chronic low back pain patients greatly improved
lumbar flexibility, and Yand and Choi<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>
conducted stabilization exercises for low back pain patients, which resulted in a greater
effect on trunk extension than trunk flexion. Kofotolis and Kellis<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a combination of isotonic contraction and
rhythmic stabilization for 86 females with chronic low back pain for four weeks, which
reduced their low back pain and increased their flexibility function. Adler et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> strengthened superficial and deep muscles
by applying appropriate resistance to obese patients with low back pain during PNF
exercises. Lee<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted ordinary
lumbar stabilization exercise and lumbar stabilization exercise combined with PNF for 30
non-idiopathic chronic low back pain patients and the group that performed a lumbar
stabilization exercise combined with PNF showed a greater decrease in low back pain than the
group that only performed lumbar stabilization exercise. Jeon and Lee<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 30 chronic low back patients into a PNF exercise
group and a trunk exercise group and trained them for six weeks; the pain index of the PNF
group decreased more than the pain index of the trunk exercise group. Given that diverse
lumbar exercises reduce the lumbar flexibility and pain index of patients with chronic low
back pain, the results of this study are consistent with the results of previous studies
that have examined the effects of PNF combination patterns on lumbar flexibility and
pain.</p><p>To summarize the results of this study, the experimental group showed greater improvement
in lumbar flexibility and decrease in their pain index than the control group. Repetitive
PNF breathing exercises improved the experimental group&#x02019;s overall lumbar flexibility and
pain index by strengthening the ability of the muscles to generate tensile force through
spiral movement of the abdominal muscles. We consider that the PNF treatment method, which
has been routinely applied to stroke patients, has further treatment opportunities in
physical therapy for treating musculoskeletal system conditions like low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hart</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Fritz</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerrigan</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Quadriceps inhibition after repetitive lumbar extension
