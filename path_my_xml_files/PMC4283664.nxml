Following a population survey (n=12&#x02005;297), eligible individuals were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to: leaflet and advice; joint protection; hand exercise; joint protection plus hand exercise. Joint protection and hand exercises were delivered by nine occupational therapists, over four group sessions. The primary outcome was the OARSI/OMERACT responder criteria at 6&#x02005;months. Outcomes were collected blind to allocation (3, 6, 12&#x02005;m).

Baseline characteristics and loss to follow-up were similar between groups. There were no reported treatment side effects. At 6&#x02005;m 33% assigned joint protection were responders compared with 21% with no joint protection (p=0.03). Of those assigned hand exercises, 28% were responders compared with 25% with no exercises (n.s.).

Randomisation was stratified by participants&#x02019; general practice, and was completed using random permuted blocks of size 4 (the blocks were randomly selected using a computer-generated random number sequence in an ACCESS database). Randomised allocation of the next patient was concealed from administrative and OT staff until the point of randomisation.

To detect a difference of 20% or larger between participants receiving and those not receiving hand exercises, with 80% power and &#x003b1; of 5%, a total of 212 participants with data at baseline and at 6&#x02005;months was required. To allow for a 15% drop-out over the 6-month post-randomisation period, we planned to recruit 252 participants to the trial, that is, 126 per group for each comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The main effectiveness analysis was completed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis with imputation of missing data (see online supplementary text S2 and S3 for full details of analysis methods). Continuous outcome measures were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and binary outcomes by logistic regression with treatment differences expressed as mean differences or ORs, as appropriate, with associated 95% CIs. Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline characteristics of participants by randomised treatment arm and by loss to follow-up.

At 6&#x02005;months, the primary end point, participants who received the joint protection intervention were statistically significantly more likely to be classified as responders to treatment than those not receiving joint protection (33% cf 21%). This was not maintained over 12&#x02005;months. We also evaluated whether instruction in hand exercises was more effective in reducing hand pain and disability than no instruction in hand exercises, and found there was no statistically significant difference in the number of &#x02018;responders&#x02019; between those receiving and not receiving hand exercises. Participants receiving joint protection education reported improved pain self-efficacy at 3- , 6- and 12-months.</p><p>The research question arose from clinical practice and was shaped by OT and patient and public involvement.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We followed the OMERACT-OARSI recommendations for design and conduct of clinical trials of OA.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our trial, therefore, had good internal validity with adequate sample size, high follow-up rates and strategies to minimise potential therapist effect. However, because we selected volunteers who indicated that they were able and willing to participate in an OT programme, the results may not be generalisable to all older adults with hand OA.</p><p>All participants received the same advice and leaflet from the research nurse on entry into the trial prior to randomisation, and there were no differences between groups in the timing of this. Additional intervention was delivered using the same protocol for timing of treatment appointments for each arm (no additional treatment; joint protection; hand exercises; joint protection and hand exercises) and appointments for classes were monitored. Benefit of classes may have been diluted at 3&#x02005;months as some participants failed to attend the first set of classes available so were still completing classes after the 3-month follow-up.</p><p>Reviews of non-surgical treatments for hand OA<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> and international guidelines<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> have identified a gap in evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological approaches in the management of hand OA in community-dwelling older adults. Guidelines acknowledge that the strength of the evidence underpinning recommendations for self-management is weak. They highlight one RCT<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> comparing a joint protection programme plus home-based hand exercise (range of motion) versus information alone in 40 patients with hand OA. Stamm's study, while small, has been instrumental in informing clinical guidelines for hand OA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> More recently, Stukstette <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> investigated the effectiveness of an intensive group-based multidisciplinary treatment programme incorporating self-management, ergonomic principles and exercises. The findings of this study in participants recruited from rheumatology clinics suggest that such a programme is not effective in the short term.</p><p>Our study has added to this evidence by investigating the independent effects of each intervention and demonstrating the effectiveness of joint protection in hand OA. All exercises were supervised in the classes by OTs experienced in treating hand OA, however, as we did not measure biomechanical outcome, we cannot determine whether our exercise programme had any effect (positive or negative) on joint deformities. Adherence to home exercises was good&#x02014;those allocated to hand exercises performed a structured exercise programme more often than those who were not&#x02014;but gains in grip strength and other performance measures were not shown to be statistically significant, contrary to findings of others.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Adherence to joint protection approaches was also good, and it is possible that once joint protection principles are established, they may be easier to sustain in the shorter term, but the benefits tailor off in the longer term.</p><p>Although the magnitude of benefit for joint protection was lower than our prespecified minimally clinically important difference, it still reached statistical significance due to the additional power available in our study from an overestimation of the percentage of participants meeting the OARSI responder criteria in the sample size calculation. Our study, therefore, adds to the evidence for expected differences between interventions and comparators for non-pharmacological studies in community-dwelling populations, 50&#x02005;years and older, with hand OA.</p><p>In clinical practice, only those patients who seek help are treated and only a small subgroup of the population with disabling hand pain in community-dwelling populations, aged 50&#x02005;years and older, see an OT (3% in a 12-month period).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Our eligible study population was defined using criteria recommended in secondary care settings,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the treatment approaches should, therefore, be generalisable to patients who are referred to OT. Our findings also highlight the feasibility of supporting self-management in community settings and offer strategies to close the gap between what patients should receive<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> and what therapies are offered.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>While hand OA is common, and has a significant impact and associated disability,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> consultations with a General Practitioner (GP) are low.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> People with hand problems consider the diagnosis of &#x02018;hand OA&#x02019; to represent a serious condition, but they often perceive that nothing can be done.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Our study population was recruited via the community using the ACR criteria for hand OA, hence, to have achieved any improvement in this group is important.</p><p>Joint pain in older adults and OA are public health problems that challenge our healthcare professionals and healthcare delivery systems. We have produced clear evidence about the most clinically effective methods of delivering and supporting self-management at 6&#x02005;months for older adults with hand OA to justify and inform guidelines and recommendations. We have shown that support for self-management, through a joint protection education programme delivered by OTs, provides an effective approach for community-dwelling older adults with hand OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203938-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1999" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203938-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2004" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203938-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2009" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Web tables</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203938-s4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2014" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Rhian Hughes and the health informatics and administrative staff at Keele University's Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, especially Jo Bailey, Tracy Whitehurst, Natalie Burgess, Tracy Reynolds and Claire Calverley, staff of the participating general practices in the Keele GP Research Partnership, Bucknall Hospital (pilot study), Haywood Hospital (training), Leighton Hospital and University Hospital of North Staffordshire (main study).
