It is induced by the lack of pulmonary surfactant (PS),<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> accounting for 50%-70% of premature deaths.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Its main pathogenesis is alveolar collapse due to immature pulmonary development of neonates and insufficient PS secretion, and its clinical manifestations include progressive dyspnea and respiratory failure shortly after birth. PS is a natural mixture derived from porcine lung or bovine pulmonary homogenate with phospholipids and specific proteins as the main ingredients, containing 41% to 48% of lecithin and 51% to 58% of other phospholipids and 1% of hydrophobin. PS is capable of rapidly increasing pulmonary tidal volume, enhancing pulmonary compliance, reducing alveolar surface tension, maintaining alveolar stability, preventing alveolar collapse, reducing alveolar fluid leakage and improving alveolar defense.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The combination of PS with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) can maintain the alveoli in an open state to fully improve the oxygenation status and reduce the respiratory work done by human body.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>NRDS is prone to being complicated by infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, chronic pulmonary disease, patent ductus arteriosus, retinopathy, etc. At present, NRDS is mainly treated by NCPAP, mechanical ventilation and PS replacement therapy.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, mechanical ventilation is invasive, easily causing ventilator-related complications and posing high technical requirements. Our hospital began to combine PS with NCPAP for the treatment of NRDS since March 2014, obtaining satisfactory outcomes as follows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Baseline clinical data</title><p>Forty-nine neonates who were diagnosed as NRDS and admitted in our hospital from May 2014 to June 2015 were selected. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all guardians. NRDS was diagnosed referring to the fourth edition of Practical Neonatology.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The neonates were divided into an observation group and a control group based on whether their guardians agreed to use PS. There were 23 cases in the observation group, including 13 boys and 10 girls, with the gestational ages of 27-36 weeks, (32.4 &#x000b1; 1.6) on average. Their birth weights were 1.33-2.42 kg, (1.79 &#x000b1; 0.45) on average, and the hospitalization ages were 16 min-9 hour. There were 26 cases in the control group, including 12 boys and 14 girls, with the gestational ages of 28-35 weeks, (31.5 &#x000b1; 1.8) on average. Their birth weights were 0.95-3.10 kg, (1.83 &#x000b1; 0.57) on average, and the hospitalization ages were 17 min-11 hour. There were no statistically significant differences in gender ratio, gestational age and birth weight between the two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Methods</title><p>The two groups NCPAP therapy after admission, with the oxygen concentration of 21%-80%, the gas flow of 6-8 L/min and the pressure of 4-7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Meanwhile, they were given warm keeping, nutritional support, infection prevention, fluid infusion, respiration-strengthening management and symptomatic treatment. The therapy was terminated when CPAP reduced to 2-3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, the oxygen concentration reduced to 25%, and dyspnea was significantly alleviated or disappeared. If the oxygen concentration was &#x0003e;80%, pressure &#x0003e;6-7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and the oxygen saturation was still &#x0003c;85% after 6-8 hour of treatment, or type II respiratory failure appeared, the therapy was replaced with mechanical ventilation. For the observation group, exogenous PS (Calsurf, Beijing Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., H20052128) was injected intratracheally as early as possible on the basis of the above-mentioned treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Administration methods</title><p>The neonates were administered with an improved method as early as possible. During traditional administration, the neonate was in the supine position. The trachea was catheterized and ventilated by a balloon. Then a small suction catheter was placed in the trachea catheter, through which drug was injected in 2-3 portions. Ventilation for oxygen supply was stopped in each injection. As to the improved method, sterilization was performed at 3-5 cm of the catheter outside the lips after tracheal intubation. Afterwards, the sterilized site was directly pierced with a No. 4-5 disposable scalp needle pierced in a degree of 30-40&#x000b0;, which was inserted 1-2 cm further along the horizontal direction of the catheter. Then drug (70-100 mg/kg each time) was slowly pushed using a syringe connected with the scalp needle and injected evenly. After injection, ventilation using balloon was continued for 3-5 minutes and then the catheter was removed to continue NCPAP therapy, during which ventilation for oxygen supply was not interrupted. Attention should be paid to the observation of vital signs during administration, and aspiration of sputum was forbidden within 6 hour under non-emergency conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Observation indices</title><p>The improvement of dyspnea and incidence of complications were observed before and after using PS respectively.

The difference in the review of chest X-ray film was significant between the two groups 12-24 hour after treatment (P&#x0003c;0.05). The improvement rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), the incidence of complications was significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), and the average length of stay in the observation group was significantly less than the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), between which the differences were statistically significant, but the difference in the costs of hospitalization was not statistically significant (P&#x0003e;0.05). PS combined with NCPAP in the NRDS treatment not only improved the oxygenation and ventilation in NRDS neonates in a quick and effective way, but also prevented the progression of pulmonary diseases, reduced complications, shortened hospital stay, reduced NRDS mortality and improved premature prognosis and quality of life, without significantly increasing the costs of treatment.

As a result, drug may be easily ejected during administration, resulting in drug waste and affecting the efficacy. Meanwhile, oxygen supply may be interrupted during operation. Hence, spO<sub>2</sub> decline in neonates may aggravate the disease. In contrast, the improved method of administration is a closed operation process, which allows drug to be injected slowly and evenly, without waste or oxygen supply interruption. This strategy is thus worthy of clinical application.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p><bold>CZ</bold> designed this study and prepared this
