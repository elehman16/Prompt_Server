Patients with CNP of more than 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration are being recruited from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (China). Following examination, 175 patients will be randomized into one of five groups (35 patients in each group) as follows: a traditional acupuncture group (group A), a shallow-puncture group (group B), a non-acupoint acupuncture group (group C), a non-acupoint shallow-puncture group (group D) and a sham-puncture group (group E). The interventions will last for 20&#x000a0;min and will be carried out twice a week for 5&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome will be evaluated by changes in the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). Secondary outcomes will be measured by the pain threshold, the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and diary entries. Analysis of the data will be performed at baseline, at the end of the intervention and at 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up.

Studies have shown that the overall prevalence of CNP varies from 0.4 to 86.8% (mean 23.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of CNP is greater among office workers than manual workers. This condition is characterized by activity limitations, dizziness, anxiety and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Physical exercise, massage or physiotherapy, as well as education, have been proved to be efficient in reducing neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Acupuncture has also been well accepted as a non-pharmacological treatment for neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the treatment effect of acupuncture is moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One argument is that &#x0201c;acupuncture is not associated with clinical effects beyond a powerful placebo response&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A growing body of research indicates that clinical trials of acupuncture have encountered many methodological challenges, including the identification of appropriate treatment and control groups, deficiencies in the blinding and follow-up of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Firstly, variable acupoints at different sites are commonly selected for the same disease in clinical practice. Based on our clinical experience, more than 20 acupoints have been selected as the main acupoints in neck pain. An appropriate repeatable treatment has not been established. Secondly, although shallow needle insertion and non-acupoints have been widely used in acupuncture research in sham groups, it has been suggested that these methods have therapeutic effects and are adjusted to accommodate different patients according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The academic literature also indicates that the human body has more than 2200 singular points within formal naming beyond meridians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The notion of a non-acupoint is obscure and there may be a role for specific factors of non-acupoints lateral to the acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, recent academic literature has shown that shallow puncture also produces analgesic effects in pain disorders. Thirdly, it has been reported that about 40% of subjects in these trials could distinguish non-penetrating sham acupuncture from real acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In view of these doubts, the influence of different needling points and depths should be investigated. First, the acupoints of local lesions including <italic>Jingbailao</italic> (EX-HN 15) and <italic>Jianzhongshu</italic> (SI 15) are commonly used in our hospital for neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The analgesic mechanism of acupoints on local lesions has been established in the spinal segments control theory to explain the gate control theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to the innervations of the pain focus, the effects of stimulation of EX-HN 15 and SI 15 on neck analgesia will be studied for feasibility and repeatability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Second, several different groups of non-acupoints and shallow punctures will be established to determine whether traditional acupuncture is more effective for chronic pain relief than sham acupuncture in adults with CNP. The different depth and placement of needle insertion will also be investigated to determine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Third, a single-blinded practice will be used and the adequacy of subject blinding will also be carefully assessed. The patients will be advised to lie in the prone position on the treatment couch and will be unaware of the treatment course in this trial. Data collection will be completed by the researchers over a 3-month follow-up period. Finally, we will assess the pain threshold (PT) and pain diary as semi-objective outcomes to avoid subjective results.</p><p id="Par26">In this research, a randomized clinical trial will be performed to determine whether the outcome of traditional acupuncture treatment is significantly different to sham acupuncture in relieving CNP. We also aim to investigate which type of sham acupuncture is the optimal control for clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par27">A single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been designed to compare the differences between traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture in patients with CNP.

Before randomization, all participants will be informed that they will be allocated into one of the above groups in an equal ratio, using block randomization with a block size of 5, and 35 participants are planned for each group. Randomization will occur on the second visit to the clinical research center according to the sequence generated by PEMS (Package for Encyclopedia of Medical Statistics) 3.1 software (West China School of Public Health, Sichuan, China) and overseen by an independent statistician. Randomization information will be sealed in opaque envelopes. If participants pass the screening test, a random number will be assigned sequentially.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par32">All patients will be treated in the acupuncture clinical research center and will not be informed of the type of treatment that they will receive. Outcome assessors, data managers and the statistician will be blinded in this trial. To preserve masking, only the acupuncturists will have access to treatment allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, they must learn how to use the blinding method to communicate with participants to ensure treatment blinding. The blinding principle will be operated until the data are locked down. The questionnaires regarding blinding will be completed immediately after the 5th and 10th treatments, as well as at the end of the follow-up. The success of these blinding strategies will be appraised at the end of the study by the Blinding Index (BI).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par33">Participants will be randomized to the five treatment groups and receive ten sessions of treatment over a period of 5&#x000a0;weeks. Acupuncture treatment will be performed by a senior acupuncturist who has held a practitioner licence for more than 10&#x000a0;years. The participants will be asked to rest for 15&#x000a0;min before treatment. A constant room temperature of 23 to 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C will be maintained to ensure the patients are comfortable and relaxed during treatment. Subjects will be advised to lie in the prone position on the treatment couch. Interventions will be performed twice a week from Monday to Friday. Each session will last for 20&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par34">The combinations of EX-HN 15 and SI 15 will be selected for the different groups based on the academic literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. EX-HN 15 is an acupoint on the neck, 2 cun (1 cun is equal to the width of the patient&#x02019;s thumb knuckle stripe) above GV 14 (<italic>Dazhui</italic>), and 1 cun lateral to the posterior median line. SI 15 is located on the back, under the 7th cervical vertebra and 2 cun lateral to GV 14. According to TCM theory, stimulation of EX-HN 15 and SI 15 can remove meridian stasis by promoting the circulation of &#x0201c;Qi&#x0201d; and blood to relieve neck pain. After the skin is sterilized with disposable 75% alcohol swabs, a sterile needle (length: 25&#x000a0;mm, diameter: 0.30&#x000a0;mm; Huatuo, Suzhou Medical Supply Factory Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) will be inserted. The needle-punching depth in the acupoint will be 0.5 to 0.8 cun. The needle will be manipulated by lifting and twirling until the participant feels a sensation (denominated <italic>de-qi</italic>).</p><p id="Par35">The needle in the non-acupoint will be inserted without the use of acupuncture techniques during the experiments. Non-acupoints 1 and 2 are located 1&#x000a0;cm lateral to EX-HN 15 and SI 15. The shallow puncture is just enough to maintain the needles in a fixed position and not enough to produce <italic>de-qi</italic>. For subjects receiving sham puncture, &#x0201c;Streitberger&#x0201d; needles (Asiamed Inc., Bridport, UK) with blunt tips will be used in the same areas as those in the treatment group, but will not pierce the skin.

Results from the pilot study with a two-arm design showed that the mean changes in NPQ were 20.71&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.91 (acupuncture group) and 24.04&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.83 (control group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, our trial is a five-arm parallel-group study with the aim of assessing the efficacy of acupuncture. The mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD) values reported in the pilot study will be used as the expected values in the treatment group and four control groups in the present study. PEMS 3.1 software was used to perform the sample size calculation. Thus, we calculated the appropriate trial sample size with 90% power, and the significance level was 0.05. The results showed that a clinically important difference was detected using a minimum sample size of 30 individuals in each group. With a maximum allowable dropout rate of 15%, a total of 175 subjects (35 per group) are being recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par46">A statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) in the Center of Acupuncture Clinical Research. A full analysis set (FAS) will be performed as the main analysis. According to the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT), any participants who randomly receive at least one treatment should be included in the main analysis dataset. The per-protocol (PP) set as the subset of FAS will include subjects who complete the study and have main variable baseline values in this trial. To be included in the safety set, patients will receive at least one safety evaluation after treatment. Statistical analysis of the main parameters will be carried out at baseline, at each visit and in the follow-up period. Frequency tables and charts will be used to analyze completed AE questionnaires.</p><p id="Par47">Descriptive statistics will be performed to compare baseline information, patient characteristics and an evaluation of the credibility of the five groups. To determine the primary and secondary outcomes, the mean differences from baseline to the end of follow-up period will be compared and analyzed. Group differences for continuous variables will be analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the subjective and semi-objective outcomes. The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the outcome measurements before and after treatment. The differences in categorical variables between groups and adverse effects will be analyzed using the chi-square test. A <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Missing data and sensitivity analysis</title><p id="Par48">In order to obtain the complete dataset, the researchers will receive professional training to avoid missing data. Experienced investigators will contact participants through messaging and telephone calls at fixed treatment periods. In addition, the participants will receive economic compensation after the trial. For missing data, we will analyze the underlying reason and use an imputation adjustment approach. The method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be carried out for imputation of missing values. After the main analysis, sensitivity analysis of the various datasets will be used to evaluate the impact of missing data on the trial results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par49">This research was designed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

In the practice of traditional acupuncture analgesia, it is generally acknowledged that structures and physiological functions are modulated by 14 energy meridians and the hypothetical &#x0201c;Qi&#x0201d; is usually translated as energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Acupuncturists with different experiences might have the different methods to operate <italic>de-qi</italic> (bring about the desired sensation) for the acupuncture intervention. Findings from clinical research strongly suggested that these specific differences of interventions have a major impact on the response to the curative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, further trials are required to investigate the differences in these methods.</p><p id="Par53">According to TCM theory, acupoints can be selected in three ways: an acupoint can be selected at a local lesion (with the pain area as acupoint <italic>Shu</italic>), far away from the local lesions, such as on limbs, and in accordance with symptoms. For non-acupoints at local lesions, the possible mechanisms of the analgesic effect may include the gate control theory triggered by neural pathways, alterations in local circulation and the immune environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, for shallow needle insertion, some researchers believe that shallow puncture can stimulate afferent nerves and activate the corresponding brain regions to produce a &#x0201c;limbic touch response&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previous studies have also suggested that non-acupoints beyond the meridian and shallow puncture have an analgesic effect in subjects with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although the use of the &#x0201c;Streitberger&#x0201d; needle with a blunt tip has been supported in studies and reviews, it was reported that nearly half of the subjects could distinguish it from the real treatment in pain disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, further trials are required to investigate these differences. It is necessary to establish a standard for the control (sham) in clinical research due to the unknown analgesia mechanisms of traditional acupuncture.</p><p id="Par54">Clinical trials of traditional acupuncture for chronic pain, with optimal control groups, are rare, with the exception of the use of standard outcome measures and rigorous blinding of participants to treatment assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, few guidelines exist for conducting appropriate sham acupuncture, for the depth of the inserted needle or the parameter for needle stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This randomized placebo-controlled trial addresses the urgent need to provide evidence-based control groups for adults with CNP and to determine the evidence for the specificity of acupoints. At the end of this clinical trial, we expect that the findings will provide evidence to answer the question: is acupuncture more effective than a placebo?</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par55">The participants are beginning to be recruited for this study.
