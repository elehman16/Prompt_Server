We hypothesized that nitrite would improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction by increasing nitric oxide (NO) generation and that the mechanism of this protection is related to the modulation of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized prospective animal study using male Sprague-Dawley rats. Cardiac arrest was induced by intravenous bolus of potassium chloride (40 &#x000b5;g/g). Nitrite (1.2 nmol/g) or placebo was administered when chest compression was started. No cardiac arrest was induced in the sham group. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored invasively for 90 minutes after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Echocardiogram was performed to evaluate cardiac function. Myocardial samples were harvested 5 minutes and 1 hour after ROSC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Myocardial function was significantly impaired in the nitrite and placebo groups after resuscitation, whereas cardiac function (i.e., ejection fraction and fractional shortening) was significantly greater in the nitrite group than in the placebo group. Nitrite administration increased the level of nitric oxide in the myocardium 5 min after resuscitation compared to the other two groups. The levels of phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB) were decreased after resuscitation, and nitrite increased the phosphorylation of phospholamban compared to the placebo.

Postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is one of the major factors contributing to the high mortality after initial resuscitation <xref rid="pone.0082552-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) strategies are continually updated, the mechanism of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction remains poorly understood, and the available data are very limited. Novel therapies that might improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction require further exploration.</p><p>Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a central role in excitation-contraction coupling and myocardial contractile dysfunction through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulating function <xref rid="pone.0082552-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulation of SR is associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins, including sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Previous studies demonstrated that the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) process might induce down-regulation of the expression and function of the SR proteins, which are involved in myocardial dysfunction after I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0082552-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Chohan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, impairment of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling was shown to be involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload observed during I/R injury, which induces hypercontraction of myofibrils and further mitochondrial injury in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related manner <xref rid="pone.0082552-Piper1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Yellon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Such alterations might finally contribute to myocardial reperfusion injury and thus compromise cardiac contractility. Recent studies have shown that SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins might be essential targets for protection against acute myocardial I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0082552-Piper2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of myocardial function; it protects myocardium against I/R injury by preserving SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins via related pathways such as the protein kinase G pathway <xref rid="pone.0082552-Champion1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0082552-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nitrite is an important donor for NO generation via NOS-independent reduction especially during hypoxia, acidosis or the I/R process by iron-containing enzymes such as deoxyhemoglobin and myoglobin <xref rid="pone.0082552-Dezfulian1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Recent studies showed that the administration of nitrite might attenuate I/R injury in the heart, brain or kidney <xref rid="pone.0082552-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Because CA/CPR is an acute global I/R process, we hypothesize that postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is related to the impairment of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins and that nitrite might improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction by a mechanism involving the modulation of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the West China Medical Center of Sichuan University (Permit Number: 2011-12).

The rats were anesthetized with 45 mg/kg of pentobarbital delivered by intraperitoneal injection. An additional dose (10 mg/kg) was administered at an interval of approximately 1 hour to maintain anesthesia. The trachea was then intubated with a 14-gauge cannula, and mechanical ventilation was delivered at 100 breaths per min with a tidal volume of 0.65 ml/100 g and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21 (HX-100E, TME Technology Co, Ltd, Chengdu, China). A heparin-filled (140 U/L) 20G PE50 catheter was inserted through the left carotid artery for the measurement of arterial blood pressure and blood sampling. A 20G PE50 catheter was advanced through the right carotid artery into the left ventricle, for monitoring the waveform of left ventricular pressure (LVP). Another PE50 catheter was advanced through the left jugular vein into the right atrium for measuring atrial pressure. All of the catheters were connected to a high sensitivity pressure transducer (PT-100, TME Technology Co, Ltd, Chengdu, China). Electrocardiograph lead II was recorded continuously. A 24G PE50 catheter was inserted into the left femoral vein for fluid and drug administration. The body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C) with a heat lamp.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CA/CPR model</title><p>We performed a standard CA model with the goal of nearly 100% resuscitation, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abella1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Angelos1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Mechanical ventilation was discontinued simultaneously. CA was confirmed by a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 20 mmHg and asystole on ECG. After 9 min of untreated CA, ventilation was resumed, FiO<sub>2</sub> was increased to 1.0 and manual chest compression was started synchronously with ventilation. Chest compression was performed at a rate of 200/min and a depth of nearly one half of the thoracic anteroposterior diameter, with equal compression-relaxation periods. At the initiation of chest compression, the rats received nitrite sodium (1.2 nmol/g, a dose determined in previous studies) or placebo (0.9% saline of equal volume) <xref rid="pone.0082552-Tripatara1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

If no ROSC was achieved after 6 min of continuous compression, CPR was terminated. No CA was induced for rats in the sham group.

Ringer's lactate solution was continuously infused at a rate of 3 ml/h during the monitoring phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Monitoring and Measurements</title><p>Rats that achieved ROSC were monitored for 90 min after resuscitation. Trans-thoracic echocardiography of cardiac function was performed at baseline and during the 90-minute monitoring after resuscitation. After the chest was shaved, 2-dimensional and M-mode images were obtained with a Vivid 7 ultrasound machine (GE Medical Systems, Horten, Norway) utilizing an 11.5 MHz probe at the level of the papillary muscles. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening was calculated with the manufacturer's software.</p><p>The arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure, LVP waveform and electrocardiogram during CPR were continuously monitored with a computer-based BL-420 biofunction experimental system (BL-420F, TME Technology Co, Ltd, Chengdu, China). Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) during CPR was monitored (coronary perfusion pressure was assessed as arterial diastolic pressure minus right atrial pressure) with the same system. The maximal rate of LV pressure increase (dP/dtmax) and the maximal rate of LV pressure decline (&#x02212;dP/dtmax) were additional measures of cardiac systolic and diastolic function, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Western blot analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins</title><p>We analyzed the expression of SERCA2a, phosphorylated PLB and RyR by Western blot.

SERCA2a and RyR are proteins which directly attribute to the Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release of SR respectively. PLB is a major modulator of SERCA2a activity, phosphorylation of PLB can increase the SERCA2a activity while dephosphorylated PLB act as an inhibitor of SERCA2a activity <xref rid="pone.0082552-Periasamy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. SERCA2a, RyR and PLB are fundamental proteins which regulate SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling. Our findings suggest that, in this CA/CPR model, postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is mainly associated with altered PLB, while SERCA2a and RyR are not involved. Furthermore, nitrite administration may improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, and the preservation of phosphorylated PLB is involved in its mechanism.</p><p>SERCA2a and PLB play an important role in myocardial contractility and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake function. Previous studies showed that reductions of SERCA2a and phosphorylated PLB were closely related to myocardial dysfunction induced by I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0082552-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Chohan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Prunier and colleagues also showed that upregulation of SERCA2a might protect myocardium, prevent ventricular arrhythmias and reduce areas of infarct after I/R by modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload <xref rid="pone.0082552-Prunier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and that phosphorylation of PLB causes an increase in SERCA2a activity <xref rid="pone.0082552-Periasamy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Likewise, in our study, myocardial function was significantly depressed after CA/CPR, and phosphorylated PLB was significantly decreased after resuscitation in the placebo compared to the sham group. It is conceivable that the impairment of PLB phosphorylation is involved in the stunning-like myocardial dysfunction after resuscitation. However, although there was a similar trend with SERCA2a, but it did not reach statistical significance. Also we found no significant alteration in the expression RyR. Thus, we suggested that in this CA/CPR model, postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is mainly associated with the alteration of PLB phosphorylation, but not the expression of SERCA2a and RyR. This differs from the myocardial dysfunction secondary to other I/R models, such as coronary diseases and revascularization after myocardial infarction. CA/CPR process is an acute I/R process with short-term ischemia, and we observe a maximal decrease of the proteins at 5 minutes of ROSC, which is very fast. So we suggest that it is reasonable that the myocardial dysfunction is more likely related to phosphorylation of PLB rather than expression of SERCA2a. Kim et al. suggested that myocardial stunning secondary to an acute I/R process was associated with impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, in which dysfunction of SERCA2a subsequent to a decrease of PLB phosphorylation was involved <xref rid="pone.0082552-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These findings were consistent with ours.</p><p>Specifically, in acute myocardial I/R models, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload induced by impaired SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the first minutes of reperfusion (i.e., 5&#x02013;10 min) might be important in the mechanism of myocardial dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0082552-Piper1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Piper2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abdallah1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The oscillatory elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may cause mitochondrial injury in a mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter-related manner <xref rid="pone.0082552-Piper1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Hajnczky1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, which subsequently induces abnormal energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, a recent study utilizing an intact heart model showed that, at the onset of reperfusion, the depletion of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and corresponding increase of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> played an important role in myocardial stunning after acute I/R <xref rid="pone.0082552-Valverde1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Such an abnormality would reverse in 5&#x02013;10 minutes after reperfusion. Importantly, Abdallah and colleagues have found that these impairments are closely associated with the phosphorylation of PLB <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abdallah1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abdallah2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In our study, it was shown that at 5 min after resuscitation, phosphorylated PLB was significantly decreased in the placebo compared to sham group. Thus, considering that CA/CPR is an acute global I/R process and causes postresuscitation myocardial stunning, it is conceivable that a decrease of PLB phosphorylation in the first minutes of reperfusion might play an important role in the postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.</p><p>The second important finding of our investigation is that the preservation of phosphorylated PLB might be involved in the protective effect of nitrite and NO on postresuscitation myocardial function.</p><p>NO has been reported to mediate cytoprotection in animal models of I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0082552-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In a CA/CPR model, it has recently been shown that improving NO formation would protect cardiac function after resuscitation <xref rid="pone.0082552-Minamishima1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0082552-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although recent studies have also shown that the cardioprotective effect of NO during resuscitation might be related to the attenuation of CA-induced mitochondria injury and ROS generation <xref rid="pone.0082552-Minamishima1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Dezfulian2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, whether SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling functions or SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins are involved in the mechanism is not clear.</p><p>In the present study, a decrease of plasma NO and an increase of myocardial NO were found in the placebo group 5 min after resuscitation compared to the sham group. This finding indicated that an increase of myocardial NO generation might be induced by the I/R process; however, the increase was limited by the depletion of substrates in the plasma, and also the inhibition of NOS activity under hypoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0082552-Lundberg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0082552-Modin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, we used intravenous nitrite as a NO supplement treatment, and in the nitrite group, NO generation was significantly increased in both the plasma and the myocardium because of the exogenous nitrite supplement, which served as a donor for NO generation.</p><p>Our results showed that nitrite significantly preserved cardiac function compared to saline, accompanied by an increased myocardial NO level, and synchronous results were found in the comparison of phosphorylated PLB. These results suggest that the cardioprotective effect of NO during CA/CPR is associated with the upregulation of phosphorylated PLB protein and the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake function. Recent studies have demonstrated that NO acts as an important regulator of SR function mainly by modulating the phosphorylation of PLB. In vitro, Kasseckert et al. have found that stimulation of cGMP might activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and thereby increase the phosphorylation of phospholamban and modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake during reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0082552-Kasseckert1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Abdallah and colleagues have also found that NO conferred myocardial protection against acute I/R injury, which was related to the upregulation of phosphorylated PLB via the cGMP pathway in the early stage of reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abdallah1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Abdallah2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, it has been shown that NO might regulate PLB phosphorylation via the guanylyl cyclase/cGMP/PKG pathway. In vivo, Jung et al. have found that nitrite increased the cGMP level via a NO/guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway during I/R <xref rid="pone.0082552-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In a CA/CPR model, Minamishima and colleagues have found that NO inhalation might induce a cytoprotection effect and affect postresuscitation outcomes via guanylate cyclase-dependent mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0082552-Minamishima2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that, in our model, the cardioprotective effect of NO during CA/CPR is related to the modulation of PLB phosphorylation via a guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent mechanism.</p><p>In addition, intravenous nitrite significantly increased the NO level in myocardium early after CPR and thereby induced an increase in PLB phosphorylation and postresuscitation myocardial function, suggesting that the early stage of reperfusion is a window of opportunity for modulating SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and attenuating myocardial injury during CPR. Our results also showed that the level of phosphorylated PLB tended to be reversed in the nitrite group 90 min after ROSC, which again suggests that myocardial stunning after CPR is mainly associated with reversible mechanisms and can be improved by appropriate therapies.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we focused only on the expression and phosphorylation of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins. Also, PLB is phosphorylated at residues Ser-16 and Thr-17 with different mechanisms (including PKA and CaMKII pathways), and we only examined total phosphorylated PLB. Therefore, we anticipate further mechanistic studies including the PLB phosphorylation at ser-16 and Thr-17, we also anticipate further studies including the alteration of the guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway and the possible involvement of other pathways related to NO or SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, such as Akt- and AMP-activated protein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathways to better understand and confirm the role of SR proteins and related pathways in CA/CPR.</p><p>Our findings have shown that the impairment of PLB, an important SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake protein, is involved in the mechanism of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and that the cardioprotective effect of nitrite during resuscitation is also associated with the modulation of PLB phosphorylation. Recently, different exogenous NO therapies, such as intravenous nitrite or sodium nitroprusside administration and NO inhalation, have been shown to be beneficial in resuscitation <xref rid="pone.0082552-Dezfulian2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Minamishima2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082552-Yannopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.
