Recently, several studies revealed significant clinical benefits of intensive reduction of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in patients with coronary artery disease for prevention of cardiovascular events. Prior ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines suggested the achievement of a target LDL-C level as the optimal goal of LDL-C management in secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127835.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists`(CTT) Collaboration, a meta-analysis of data from 169,138 individuals in 26 randomized trials, suggested that percent reduction of LDL-C is more important for secondary prevention than achievement of a target LDL-C level in patients with coronary artery disease [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Accordingly, the recent 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline recommend using high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a percent reduction of LDL-C level instead of a target LDL-C level for secondary prevention [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with high-intensity and moderate-intensity statin therapies defined as daily doses that lower LDL-C by &#x02265;50% or between 30% and 50%, respectively. All patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and no safety concerns should receive high-intensity statin therapy; whereas moderate-intensity therapy can be used if safety concerns are present. In 2012, Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease recommended the target LDL-C level of less than 100 mg/dL for secondary prevention and stated that a 20 to 30% decrease in LDL-C level could reduce coronary artery events by approximately 30%. Because of the stricter regulatory requirements, the maximum allowed statin doses in Japan are comparable with the moderate-intensity doses from the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline. Importantly, the optimal period to achieve a target percent reduction of LDL-C level in patients with AMI has not yet been well established. Based on the aforementioned differences in clinical guidelines and statin usage, we hypothesized that rapid LDL-C reduction by &#x02265; 30% after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) might be beneficial, in terms of clinical outcomes. Accordingly, this study evaluated long-term clinical outcomes of AMI patients who had been treated with moderate-intensity doses of statins within 96 hours after PCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>The ALPS-AMI (Assessment of Lipophilic vs. Hydrophilic Statin Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-labeled study designed to provide up to 24 months of clinical follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Briefly, men and women at least 20 years old hospitalized with ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non ST-segment elevation MI, were randomly allocated within 96 hours of their PCI to receive either 10mg of atorvastatin or 10mg of pravastatin daily. The protocol required the baseline serum LDL-C level to be &#x0003e;70 mg/dL. If the LDL-C level was &#x0003e; 100 mg/dL after a 4-week statin treatment, the dose was increased to 20 mg daily. All patients were pretreated with clopidogrel (75 mg daily) in addition to aspirin (100&#x02013;200 mg daily). A loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel was administered to clopidogrel-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The interventional strategy and stent selection were left to the discretion of the operator in all procedures. Exclusion criteria included planned surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting, pregnancy, active liver or renal diseases, malignant diseases, withdrawal of informed consent, and serious arrhythmic events or the presence of hemodynamic instabilities (hypotension, congestive heart failure, or mechanical complications following AMI).</p><p>Between June 2008 and December 2010, a total of 508 patients enrolled in the ALPS-AMI study.

Previous studies have already revealed that intensive statin lipid-lowering therapy reduce the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with AMI [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127835.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether achieving a large or rapid reduction of the LDL-C level is more important. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes of AMI patients after PCI depending on the time period needed to achieve the target LDL-C percent reduction (&#x02265; 30%) with moderate-intensity statin therapy.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Changes of the LDL-C level</title><p>Previous reports have suggested that higher baseline LDL-C levels are associated with favorable clinical outcomes after PCI in patients with AMI (the cholesterol paradox) [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, the baseline LDL-C levels and percent reduction of the LDL-C levels during the initial 4 weeks were not associated with adverse events in overall analysis including the patients with prior statin therapy. However, these were independent predictors for adverse events in stain na&#x000ef;ve patients alone. The design of many previous study excluded the patients with prior statin therapy or required those to have higher cholesterol level. In current study, there were no exclusion criteria for patients with prior statin therapy who had already lowered LDL-C level. Therefore, although overall analysis didn`t show the efficacy of rapid reduction of LDL-C level on adverse events, statin-na&#x000ef;ve patients analysis revealed the efficacy of those on adverse events.</p><p>Furthermore, although the patients with higher baseline LDL-C levels had larger initial reduction of LDL-C level in overall analysis, statin-na&#x000ef;ve patients analysis showed these phenomenon was more pronounced. Therefore, higher LDL-C at baseline was associated with lower event rates in statin-na&#x000ef;ve patients analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Target percent reductions in LDL-C and the periods needed to achieve them</title><p>In statin-na&#x000ef;ve patients analysis, age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that percent reduction of LDL-C levels during the initial 4 weeks were independent predictors of adverse events, but percent reduction and range of LDL-C reduction during initial 8 weeks and the achievement of LDL-C percent reduction &#x02265; 30% during 8weeks were not. This result demonstrates that the achieving a target percent reduction in LDL-C during the initial 4 weeks is significantly associated with favorable prognosis in patients with AMI. Furthermore, in age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, although the LDL-C &#x02264;100mg/dL and the LDL-C &#x02264;70mg/dL at 4 weeks after randomization were not independent predictors of adverse events, the percent reduction of LDL-C levels during the initial 4 weeks was independent predictor of them. This result might suggest that aggressive LDL-C reduction by percent reduction of LDL-C was more important than by target LDL-C levels for secondary prevention in patients with AMI.</p><p>Early statin treatment has been shown to decrease long-term mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with AMI [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the PROVE IT-TIMI22 trial revealed that intensive statin therapy reduced C-reactive protein levels more significantly than moderately intensive statin therapy in patients with AMI [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another study showed that intensive statin therapy reduced coronary plaque, and this reduction was associated with anti-inflammatory effects of statins [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, a prior report found that rapid reductions in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake detected by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/ computed tomographic imaging may represent changes in atherosclerotic plaque inflammation that occur as early as 4 weeks after the initiation of statin therapy [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These previous studies support the critical role of achieving a target percent reduction of the LDL-C level within the initial 4 weeks after AMI revealed in the present study. Whereas, Vale N et al previously reported that initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following ACS does not reduce death, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to four months, but reduces the occurrence of unstable angina at four months following ACS [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In current study, early reduction group had significantly lower mortality and rate of cardiac death than late reduction group. This discrepancy may teach us that the early achieving a target percent reduction in LDL-C was more important than only early initiation of statin therapy. Furthermore, in Comparisons between achievement and non-achievement of LDL-C percent reduction &#x02265; 30%, we showed similar adverse events rate in two groups. This results suggested early achieving a target percent reduction in LDL-C was more important than late achieving therapy.</p><p>Regarding MACE rate, those in the late reduction group was comparable to previous reports. A 6.4% major adverse events which including MI, stroke, cardiovascular death at 2 years were reported from Pacific registry [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Heart Institute of Japan Acute Myocardial Infarction (HIJAMI) registry showed 9.4% in-hospital mortality and 15.9% post-discharge mortality at 4.3 years [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In current study, although late reduction group had comparable outcomes, the percent reduction of the LDL-C levels &#x02265; 30% during the initial 8 weeks was not an independent predictor.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Other predictor of adverse events</title><p>Many previous report revealed renal insufficiency was strong predictor of adverse ischemic events in patients with AMI [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127835.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In current study, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was an independent predictor of MACE after adjustment for age. Previous studies showed the presence of diabetes was the important risk factor for the MACE after ACS [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127835.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Present study revealed diabetes was not independent predictor of MACE, because there were a few severe diabetic patients such as HbA1c &#x02265;8.0% (24; 5.6%). A previous report from the JAPAN-ACS study showed that the low HDL-C at the baseline was significantly associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events [<xref rid="pone.0127835.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In current study, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of MACE adjusted as age revealed HDL-C &#x02264;40mg/dL was not independent predictors of MACE.</p><p>Nevertheless of these confusing effect, our results indicate the importance of rapid reduction of the LDL-C level in patients with AMI for the favorable outcome. Therefore, to achieve larger percent rapid reduction of LDL-C as recommended by the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline, statin therapy of at least moderate-intensity should be initiated as soon as possible in patients with AMI.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this was a prospective, multi-center study, some limitations are still present.
