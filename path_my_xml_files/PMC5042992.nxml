The aim of the treatment of osteoporosis is the prevention of fragility fractures. Progress in osteoporosis treatment has reduced fracture risk. However, although there are many effective ways to prevent osteoporotic fractures, the treatment gap has been reported to still be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This may be due to a lack of treatment strategy; thus, efforts to determine treatment targets and goals have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fragility fracture risk increases with increasing age, decreasing bone mineral density (BMD), and the presence of prevalent fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the aim of osteoporosis treatment is to reduce fracture risk, BMD is the only modifiable marker. Therefore, the measurement of BMD after treatment is the most useful tool for the assessment of treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Osteoporosis is diagnosed by the presence of a fragility fracture or measurement of BMD, because if the BMD is below &#x02212;2.5SD of the young adult mean (YAM), a higher fracture risk is observed. In other words, when the absolute BMD value is increased to &#x02212;2.5SD by treatment, it could be said that the fracture risk will decrease significantly. However, this concept of treatment goal has not been adequately studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fracture risk reduction judged by achievement of BMD after treatment has been reported to be poor for alendronate, risedronate, and raloxifene, but more attractive for denosumab and zoledronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the site of BMD measurement should be defined. Although many clinical trials have used lumbar BMD measurement as an indicator, the fracture risk model has used femoral neck BMD because of fewer confounding factors. The BMD change after weekly teriparatide treatment is more prominent for lumbar BMD, but small for femoral neck BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another issue related to BMD for determining the treatment effect is whether the BMD effect should be represented as percent changes of BMD or the absolute value of BMD. We have reported that the percent change in BMD after treatment was less sensitive for assessing fracture risk reduction than the achievement of &#x02212;2.5SD of the YAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although limitations exist, the change in BMD has been considered a useful marker to evaluate the treatment response, not only in clinical studies but also at an individual patient level.</p><p>In 2012, judgment of treatment failure using measurements of BMD or bone turnover markers (BTMs) was proposed by the Scientific Task Force Group of the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which was based on the concept of least significant change (LSC) in each measure of BMD. According to the authors, since the LSC is calculated by the coefficient of variation (CV) of BMD measurement, a value that exceeds the LSC can be recognized as a significant change in BMD during short-term observation. The assessment of treatment effect shortly after initiation is quite important to establish the therapeutic dynamism of osteoporosis, because the achievement of the treatment goal is judged after long-term treatment by the presence or absence of incident fracture occurrence, until which time one cannot judge whether the treatment given for the patient was appropriate. However, few studies have used the IOF criteria for treatment failure to judge treatment success at the patient level.</p><p>The current study aimed to evaluate whether the criteria of IOF and absolute value of &#x02212;2.5SD of the YAM can be used to evaluate treatment failure or success in a subset of patients who participated in the Teriparatide Once-Weekly Efficacy Research (TOWER) trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Treatment responses were analyzed using the data from the original TOWER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The TOWER trial was a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial performed in Japan. Subjects with osteoporosis were randomly divided into two groups: those who received once-weekly subcutaneous injections of 56.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of teriparatide (teriparatide group) or placebo (placebo group) for 72&#x000a0;weeks. All subjects received daily oral supplements of calcium 610&#x000a0;mg, vitamin D 400&#x000a0;IU, and magnesium 30&#x000a0;mg. Subjects who had taken bisphosphonates within the past 52&#x000a0;weeks or the other drugs for osteoporosis within the past 8&#x000a0;weeks were excluded. The protocol was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. Written, informed consent was obtained from all subjects before undergoing any examinations.</p><p>For this analysis from the TOWER trial, postmenopausal women who underwent measurements of lumbar or femoral neck BMD at baseline and two times after the initiation of the treatment regimens were included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measurement</title><p>From the original TOWER trial, baseline age, weight, and height were analyzed. The lumbar and femoral neck BMD values were measured at baseline and 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;weeks after the initiation of treatment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, either QDR (Hologic, Bedford, MA) or DPX (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). Incident vertebral fracture was identified by a semi-quantitative (SQ) method using lateral spine X-ray films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The SQ grade was evaluated at baseline and 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;weeks after treatment initiation by an independent physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Criteria for treatment response</title><p>Treatment response was defined using the criteria described in the IOF report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CVs were 2.0&#x000a0;% for lumbar BMD and 1.6&#x000a0;% for femoral neck BMD; the LSC with a one-tailed test would be 1.19 times for evaluation of individual cases, with 80&#x000a0;% confidence. Therefore, the patients&#x02019; percent change of BMD after treatment was classified as failure (&#x0003c;&#x02212;2.4&#x000a0;%), success (&#x02265;+2.4&#x000a0;%), or borderline (&#x02212;2.4 to +2.4&#x000a0;%) for lumbar BMD and as failure (&#x0003c;&#x02212;1.9&#x000a0;%), success (&#x02265;+1.9&#x000a0;%), or borderline (&#x02212;1.9 to +1.9&#x000a0;%) for femoral neck BMD.</p><p>Another criterion for treatment response, &#x0201c;absolute change,&#x0201d; was also used to classify the patients based on the achievement of BMD at the last observation exceeding &#x02212;2.5SD of the YAM value, i.e., the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD of the YAM measured by QDR was 0.790&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.090&#x000a0;g/cm<sup>2</sup> at the femoral neck and 1.011&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.119&#x000a0;g/cm<sup>2</sup> at the lumbar spine, and the value measured by DPX was 0.939&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.114&#x000a0;g/cm<sup>2</sup> at the femoral neck and 1.192&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.146&#x000a0;g/cm<sup>2</sup> at the lumbar spine.</p><p>In order to evaluate the treatment effectiveness of weekly teriparatide for osteoporosis, the number needed to treat (NNT) in this dataset [1/(absolute risk reduction)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics are reported as means and SD or percentages.

PTEs of total hip BMD to non-vertebral fracture with other anti-resorptive agents were estimated with zoledronate (61&#x000a0;%) and denosumab (87&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding bone-forming agents, daily teriparatide showed an estimated PTE of 30&#x02013;41&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], while weekly teriparatide showed an estimate as high as 83&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], indicating that the percent change of BMD would be a significant surrogate for fracture risk. In addition, we have reported that the absolute value of BMD up to &#x0003e;&#x02212;2.5SD with anti-resorptive agents reduces the risk of further fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this analysis, the treatment response with weekly teriparatide was evaluated using the percent change categorized by the IOF criteria and the absolute change by the &#x02212;2.5SD threshold, and their contribution to anti-fracture efficacy was evaluated. The treatment success rate by the LSC criterion for lumbar BMD (&#x02265;+2.4&#x000a0;%) increased with longer treatment duration and reached 79.2&#x000a0;% at the end of observation (72&#x000a0;weeks). Moreover, 50&#x000a0;% of the subjects achieved treatment success judged by the absolute change in lumbar BMD (&#x02265;&#x02212;2.5SD). On the other hand, changes in femoral neck BMD were smaller than those in lumbar BMD. Therefore, measurement of lumbar BMD showed a clearer treatment response.</p><p>Other factors contributing to treatment response were investigated in this dataset (data not shown). First, the changes of bone turnover markers did not show a significant contribution to vertebral fracture incidence. This was thought to be because the changes of bone turnover markers occur in a very short time and to a small extent after the injection of weekly teriparatide. Second, the correlation with clinical fragility fractures was investigated, but the incidence was too small (one case in the teriparatide group, five cases in the placebo group) to show a significant distribution along with the treatment response. Regarding the treatment response to weekly teriparatide, the changes in BMD would be the dominant contributor to fracture prevention, but we believe there should be other factors.</p><p>Recently, changes in radial BMDs at the distal one tenth (trabecular bone-rich site) and one third (cortical bone-rich site) with once-weekly teriparatide were reported to be different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], namely a larger increase of BMD was observed at one tenth compared to one third. This difference was explained by the difference in the bone compartment by measurement site. This report indicated that teriparatide was more effective at trabecular bone-rich sites than at cortical bone-rich sites. In contrast to the daily teriparatide preparation, weekly teriparatide reduced bone resorption with a small increase in bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The metabolic effect of weekly teriparatide may be beneficial on trabecular bone sites, where bone remodeling occurs more prominently.</p><p>In the present study, treatment success or failure judged by the LSC criterion for lumbar BMD indicated a time-dependent increase in the rate of treatment success, indicating that the LSC criterion for lumbar BMD may be an early phase indicator for the treatment response. On the other hand, the absolute BMD value category (&#x02265;&#x02212;2.5SD) at 72&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, which reflected a significantly lower incidence of fractures, may be useful to evaluate vertebral fracture risk reduction. The rate of patients achieving over the &#x02212;2.5SD criterion was around 30&#x000a0;%, suggesting that 30&#x000a0;% of patients recovered their BMD from the osteoporosis level with weekly teriparatide treatment. Considering that the absolute criterion of &#x02265;&#x02212;2.5SD of the YAM has been established as the diagnostic criterion at an individual level, and that the fracture incidence is correlated with this BMD threshold, this criterion could be also useful for the assessment of treatment success, though some caution is needed.</p><p>The NNT of weekly teriparatide was also calculated and found to be 11.4. In the previous reports, NNT values of osteoporosis medications ranged from 9 to 21 to prevent a new vertebral fracture over 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Comparing the reports, it could be considered that the NNT value of weekly teriparatide is comparatively low, despite the fact that the TOWER trial was a 72-week study, which indicates that weekly teriparatide is effective treatment for osteoporosis.</p><p>Injections of weekly teriparatide are given to patients at medical institutions, so that compliance with drug administration is guaranteed to be 100&#x000a0;% as long as the patients visit such institutions to receive the injections. Thus, one of the characteristics of weekly teriparatide could be considered to be that treatment failure is extremely rare in the earlier phase.</p><p>There were some limitations in this analysis. First, the number of subjects in this analysis was limited to 317 of the subjects of the original TOWER trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;542). This is because not all study subjects had BMD measured using DXA. There was no selection bias, because there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics such as age and BMI between the subjects included in this analysis and all subjects in the TOWER trial. This small sample size might be a reason why the difference was not significant between the teriparatide and placebo groups. Second, the incidence of vertebral fracture was low. Incident vertebral fracture was observed in 20 subjects in the placebo group and 4 subjects in the teriparatide group in this analyzed dataset. However, there was a significantly lower incidence in the teriparatide group, and the incidence was relatively higher in the treatment failure group.</p><p>In conclusion, the LSC criterion for lumbar BMD appears to be a useful surrogate marker at an earlier time during treatment for the assessment of treatment success at an individual level, based on the finding of a time-dependent change in the patient proportion with once-weekly teriparatide treatment. Simultaneously, the criterion of &#x02212;2.5SD was also confirmed to be useful to evaluate treatment efficacy, reflecting the fracture incidence at the final observation. It might be more efficient to use both criteria for treatment assessment to select the most appropriate medications for osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This original study was supported by Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation.
