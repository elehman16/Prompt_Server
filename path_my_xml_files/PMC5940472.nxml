balance and balance confidence in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen
patients with stroke were randomly divided into either the circular gait training (CGT)
group (n=8) or the straight gait training (SGT) group (n=7). Both groups had conventional
therapy that adhered to the neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) approach, for 30&#x02005;min. In
addition, the CGT group performed circular gait training, and the SGT group practiced
straight gait training for 30&#x02005;min. Each intervention was applied for 1 h, 5 days a week,
for 2 weeks. Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and Activities-specific
Balance Confidence (ABC) scale were used to test balance and balance confidence. [Results]
After the intervention, both groups showed significant increases in balance and balance
confidence. Significant improvements in the balance of the CGT group compared with the SGT
group were observed at post-assessment. [Conclusion] This study showed that circular gait
training significantly improves balance in patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Circular gait training</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recovery of walking ability for patients with stroke is one of the most important
rehabilitation goals<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance in the
standing posture is important to achieve proper gait patterns<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance of the standing posture is closely related to the
ability to shift the body weight on one side limb. This is a prerequisite for functional
mobility and daily living, and is important for activities, such as standing, transferring,
walking, changing direction, and stair climbing<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The problem of balance is a major factor in delaying the recovery
of daily activities, reducing movements, and increasing risk of falls, which further
prevents standing or walking<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients
with stroke need complex mobility to perform their daily activities in the home and
community after discharge<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Activities
related to walking around the table, crossing obstacles, and turning on the road require
walking ability in the curved pathway. The ability to walk around the corners and change
direction around the obstacles is essential for successful locomotion in the home and
community<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During daily life, 20% to
50% of all steps were reported to be associated with turning<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. During straight walking, the coordination of the segments for body
movement is symmetrical, but both lower extremity patterns of walking change unstably when
walking with curves in daily living<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
more diverse biomechanical reaction is required compared with the straight walking to
perform smooth walking along the curved trajectory. However, patients with stroke are
adversely affected from changing directions during walking due to lack of coordination
ability and paralysis of the lower limb muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 8-shaped track combines a pattern of curved walking in
clockwise and counterclockwise directions between straight gaits and is designed to assess
the complex gait ability required for independent daily activities. In previous studies,
walking on an 8-figure track has been suggested to evaluate complex walking ability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to date, studies on training for
independent walking in patients with stroke are focused on walking ability using treadmill
or straight gait training, and studies on curved walking are rare. In addition, research on
the training intervention of patients with stroke in the 8-figure track is limited, which
has been used only as a tool to evaluate the balance and gait ability of the elderly. In
this regard, this study investigates to determine the effect of circular gait training on
balance and balance confidence of patients with stroke by dividing walking in straight and
8-shaped track.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this research were 15 patients with stroke, hospitalized in the D
rehabilitation hospital in Seoul, Korea and randomly assigned to 8 patients in the CGT group
and 7 patients in the SGT group by using a table of random sampling numbers. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of the Sahmyook University (IRB No.
2-1040781-AB-N-01-2016042HR), and all experimental procedures and contents were explained to
each participant, who gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The
inclusion criteria were: presence of hemiparesis, secondary to stroke that had occurred in
less than 2&#x02005;years; ability to walk 10&#x02005;m independently with or without an assistive device or
person; ability to communicate and understand, with a Mini-Mental Status Examination score
of more than 24 points; no visual disorders or visual field deficit. Exclusion criteria were
use of medication or other therapies for cardiovascular or metabolic disorder and known
musculoskeletal conditions that would affect the ability to walk safely.</p><p>The CGT and SGT groups had training one hour a day, five times a week, for two weeks. The
CGT group was trained using the 8-figure track, which was 121.9&#x02005;cm in width and 152.4&#x02005;cm in
length and consisted of two corn-shaped markers, which were the returning points. The
starting point was the middle of the 8-figure track, The SGT group was trained using the
20-m straight track and started at both sides. The main outcomes of this study were the
balance and balance confidence scale. The balance was measured using the BBS and the TUG
test. To evaluate balance confidence, the ABC scale was used.</p><p>In the statistical analysis of this study, means and standard deviations were calculated
using PASW software 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A paired t-test was conducted to
compare the effects before and after the intervention of each group, and in order to look at
differences between the groups, independent t-test was performed. The significance level was
set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general and clinical characteristics are described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the general characteristics of the subjects between the CGT and

rather than moving along a straight pathway, and are more likely to experience disproportion
of weight support, loss of coordination between body segments and stiffness, and postural
instability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies,
patients returning to the community without being sufficiently recovered to perform outdoor
walking reported inefficient walking using a compensatory strategy that did not consider the
biomechanical factors<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients should
be able to pass through obstacles, such as stairs ramps, roads, jaw, and must avoid
conflicts with people in crowded places to achieve a successful walk in the community<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research results have been recently
reported with emphasis on walking in the community rather than walking in managed and
restricted environment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
reliability study on the 8-figure track, walking evaluation for the elderly, walking
velocity, cadence, and step length were evaluated. As a result, walking on the 8-figure
track was reported to be an evaluation tool for the elderly to provide complex information
on walking speed, mobility, and fall prediction. In this study, we performed gait training
for stroke patients using this 8-figure track and evaluated balance and balance
confidence<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, BBS was
used to evaluate the patient&#x02019;s balance ability. Although the BBS has the disadvantage of
making precise and delicate measurement difficult, such as the balance analysis method using
the motion analysis system, it is easy, inexpensive, and possible to interpret the
functional balance reflecting the daily life function. BBS showed statistically significant
increases in both groups, but no statistically significant difference was found between the
two groups. This indicates the result of the improvement of the flexibility of the ankle
angle change and the improvement of the weight shifting ability with the 8-figure track
training<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, TUG test was
used to measure the dynamic balance ability of patients with stroke. The TUG test included
sitting and standing in a chair, straight walking, and turning in one direction. In this
study, statistical improvement of TUG test was observed in each group and between both
groups. In the SGT group, the time of the TUG test was decreased by the improved speed of
straight walking, and the reduction of the TUG test time in the CGT group seemed to be
improved by the curved gait training in both directions. In this study, the Korean version
of ABC Scale was used. In previous studies, the better the balance ability, the higher the
balance self-confidence. In this study, results also showed a significant improvement in the
BBS, the TUG test, and ABC scale similar to the previous study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although a significant improvement in balance ability in
all training groups and a significant improvement in balance self-confidence were observed,
no significant difference was found between groups. Distinguish between the two tasks was
speculated to be difficult because of the simplicity of the single task condition training
program. In this study, we investigated the effect of an 8-figure track training on balance
and balance self-confidence in patients with stroke. However, whether changes in the leg and
trunk muscles result in a positive effect is still unclear, and neurological effects could
not be precisely defined. Future research will require more long-term studies with more
subjects, focusing on the kinetic and neurological aspects of curvilinear gait and direction
change training using 8-shaped tracks. Moreover, fall efficacy should also be studied. In
addition, developing various intervention programs using the 8-figure track for the
treatment of patients with stroke and to prove the continuity of intervention effects would
be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This paper was supported by the fund of the Sahmyook University in 2017.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship
