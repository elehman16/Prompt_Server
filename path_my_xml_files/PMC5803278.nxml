Changes in size of the pouch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], stoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and minor changes in the length of the alimentary limb do not seem to impact weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Such assessment can be performed by using generic- and diagnose-specific questionnaires measuring a broad variety of dimensions of life, e.g., HRQOL, symptom burden, attitudes, and emotions.

It consists of six domains measured on a 10-point scale from &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.50 to +&#x000a0;0.50. The domains are added into a sum score ranging from &#x02212;&#x000a0;3.0 to +&#x000a0;3.0, scoring from a very poor to a very good outcome.

The mean scores of anxiety are higher than the population norm of obese patients (BMI &#x0003e;&#x000a0;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Aasprang et al. published a study on duodenal switch showing improved anxiety from baseline to 2&#x000a0;years and a worsening of symptoms from 2 to 5&#x000a0;years. The mean (95% CI) HADS-A at 2&#x000a0;years in their study was 4.7 (3.7&#x02013;5.8), slightly lower but comparable to our 2-year results and the scores for anxiety are comparable to their 2-year results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Both results are higher than the Norwegian population for BMI &#x0003e;&#x000a0;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, but high-quality data from patients in the BMI 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> range is lacking. Other studies have shown improvement in depression after bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and both our groups have mean scores comparable to a non-obese population. Long-term follow-up is needed to adequately study this.</p><p id="Par39">Previous studies describe significant improvements in uncontrolled and emotional eating after both RYGB and duodenal switch, but with no significant differences between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which is in line with our observations. Previous studies have not shown significant changes in cognitive restraint, and our results are slightly higher for both proximal and distal RYGB than those published by S&#x000f8;vik et al. Although non-significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.06), the mean uncontrolled eating score was slightly higher in the distal RYGB group than in the standard RYGB group in the present study. The lack of baseline data makes the clinical implication of this finding uncertain.</p><p id="Par40">Strengths of this study include the double-blind randomized controlled design and standardized surgical procedures. The patients had a BMI in the 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> range, creating a homogenous population. Nearly all patients attended follow-up, and the completion rates of questionnaires were high. All patients were recruited from two public hospitals, and treatment provided was independent of health insurance and personal finance.</p><p id="Par41">An important limitation is that evaluation of PROMS was a secondary endpoint. This might induce sample size issues such as type II errors. To evaluate potential differences, we calculated effect sizes to estimate any potentially undetected differences. Only some of the effect sizes are small; all others are trivial suggesting negligible differences. Another limitation is that eating behavior, anxiety, and depression were only measured at 2&#x000a0;years, making comparison of changes impossible. Despite the randomized controlled design, small random differences cannot be excluded.</p><p id="Par42">Standardized reporting of PROMs is gaining more attention and may help patients and clinicians choose appropriate procedures. However, several of the obesity-specific measures of HRQOL are in fact weight dependent and might not differentiate adequately between the adverse effects of surgical procedures. Relevant differences between the procedures with regard to gastrointestinal symptoms and eating quality as well as behavior and specific adverse events are not adequately covered by existing PROMs. The GQLI index measures gastrointestinal symptoms with regard to quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], but does not explore other post-bariatric problems such as dumping and postprandial hypoglycemia. The development of a symptom measure focusing exclusively on these problems might help clinicians and patients differentiate between different bariatric procedures. However, if differences are subtle and not detectable by existing PROMS, the impact is likely to be small.</p><p id="Par43">The greatest improvement in quality of life and resolution of weight-specific symptoms occur during the first year after bariatric surgery during the greatest weight loss. Weight loss may thus be an important determinant for improvement of quality of life. However, assuming that greater weight loss would improve quality of life even more is not so certain. It could be that the improvement is mostly due to the initial weight loss, and that further weight loss would not lead to further improvement in quality of life. In a study of duodenal switch and RYGB, the increased weight loss after duodenal switch did not translate into increased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The large initial weight loss may decrease the patients&#x02019; feeling of stigma and increase a feeling of normality and this trumps some of the adverse effects of bariatric surgery, at least in short term. Studies have shown that 5-year HRQOL decreased significantly when compared with the scores 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;years post surgically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, the 2-year span may not be a sufficient length to detect clinically relevant differences in PROMs.</p><p id="Par44">Our findings cannot be extrapolated to other variants of distal RYGB that might lead to more malabsorption and greater weight loss. At 2&#x000a0;years, we find no evidence to support the use of distal RYGB; however, evaluations following prolonged follow-up may reveal other findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">In patients with BMI 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, both standard and distal RYGB lead to sustained weight loss and improved HRQOL 2&#x000a0;years after surgery. We found no significant differences between the two procedures in regard to obesity-specific HRQOL, weight-related symptoms, anxiety and depression, and eating behavior. Standard RYGB continues to be our first choice in treating patients with BMI above 50&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The current study is a work-intensive collaboration between two bariatric centers in South Eastern Norway.
