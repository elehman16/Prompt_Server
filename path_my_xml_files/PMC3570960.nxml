Introduction</title><p>The success of nonsurgical root canal retreatment highly depends on removal of previous root filling material, bacteria and necrotic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R1">1</xref>]. Different methods have been proposed to gain this goal such as manual or rotary instrumentation, solvents and ultrasonics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R3">3</xref>]. Use of hand files with or without solvent is a commonly used technique. Chloroform is classified as a group 2B carcinogen by International Agency for Research of Cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R4">4</xref>]. Despite the concerns about chloroform, this solvent is still the most widely used solvent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R3">3</xref>]. Also its efficacy in root canal retreatment has been studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R8">8</xref>]. Some suggest that chloroform can demonstrate adverse effects on cleanliness of canal wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R9">9</xref>] but this is still a matter of controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R5">5</xref>].</p><p>The ability of different types of Nickel-Titanium rotary files have been investigated in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R12">12</xref>]. Findings in regard to the efficacy of these systems compared to hand files are controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R13">13</xref>].</p><p>ProTaper D series, containing three flexible instruments, are designed for root filling material removal from different thirds of the canal. They should each work at special torque and speed according to the manufacturer in electric motor controllers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since rotary instruments necessitate special education and equipment for proper operation hand files are still common use among dentists.</p><p>This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of H-File and ProTaper with or without chloroform solvent in removing gutta-percha from root treated human extracted mandibular premolars. The time taken to remove gutta-percha was also recorded and evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec5062"><title> 2. Material and Methods</title><p>For this experimental study 60 single-canalled mandibular premolars which were extracted for periodontal reasons were selected. The inclusion criteria were as follows: fully formed apices, no sign of internal/external resorption, verified radiographically/apical patency with K-file #10 (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), root curvature less than 30&#x025e6; according to Schnieder criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R15">15</xref>] and a tooth length of 21-23 mm.</p><p>Working length was established 1 mm short from the point a#10 K-file was visualized at the apex. Root canal treatment was accomplished using step-back technique, with MAF (Master Apical File) equal to #30 K-file (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Each subsequent instrument was withdrawn 1 mm up to size # 60. Canals were flushed with 5 mL 5.25% NaOCl, delivered with a 27 gauge needle, between each instrument. At the end of canal preparation smear layer was removed with 2 mL of 17 % EDTA and 2 mL 5.25% NaOCl followed by 2 mL normal saline. Canals were dried with #30 paper points (GAPADENT CO. Tianjin, China). Master cone #30 (GAPADENT CO. Tianjin, China) was placed at the working length and lateral condensation was accomplished using # 15 lateral cones and AH26 (Dentsply, Detry, Konstanz, Germany) as sealer. Access cavities were sealed temporarily with Coltosol (Ariadent, Coltosol, Iran) and teeth were incubated at 37&#x025e6;C/100% humidity for 2 weeks. After that period the samples were randomly divided into 4 groups.</p><p>Retreatment procedure:</p><p>Group A: The #3 and #2 GG (Gates-Glidden) drills (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were used in a crown down technique to remove gutta-percha from the coronal part of the canal. Exactly 0.2 mL chloroform (Kimia, Tehran, Iran) was placed in the space prepared by GG drills. After 2 minutes a #15 H-file (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) was introduced into the canal till it reached the working length. In order to remove the gutta-percha and sealer, canals were instrumented up to size 40. The solvent was refreshed when needed. Retreatment was deemed complete when no more filling materials or sealer was seen on the last instrument.</p><p>Group B: The specimens were treated the same as group A except that no solvent was used in this group.</p><p>Group C: ProTaper universal retreatment instruments were used in a crown-down manner as stated by the manufacturer in this group. After removal of the coronal third gutta-percha, 0.2 mL chloroform was placed in the reservoir space prepared by D1 and enough time was given to soften the gutta-percha. The softened gutta-percha was removed by D2 and D3 with the last instrument reaching the working length. The solvent was refreshed between D2 and D3.</p><p>Group D: The teeth in this group went through the same procedure as group C except for the use of the solvent.</p><p>It should be mentioned that all rotary instruments were used with an electric motor controller (ENDO-MATE, NSK, Japan). Torque and speed were set according to the manufacturer. Canals were irrigated with 0.5 mL 2.5% NaOCl between each instrument in all groups. The time required for retreatment in each group was recorded by a stop watch.</p><p>Remnant Evaluation</p><p>Two longitudinal grooves were made in the buccal and lingual aspects of samples with a diamond disc without entering the canal space. The teeth were sectioned longitudinally with a chisel. They were then inspected visually and the root half with more filling remnants was inspected under a stereomicroscope (Olympus, SZX9, Tokyo, Japan) with &#x000d7;25 magnification attached to a Pentium V computer. Images were made of each half. The percentage of the area of the canal to the total area covered by sealer and gutta-percha were measured by Auto CAD 2007. The evaluator was blinded to the group assignment.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed by means of Two-way ANOVA, t-test and Tukey&#x02019;s test. Level of significance was set at P=0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec5063"><title>3. Results</title><p>All the retreatment cleansing techniques left some filling material inside the root canal.

Discussion</title><p>Adequate removal of previous root filling materials plays a major role in the success of orthograde retreatment. In this study, like most previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R10">10</xref>], remnant fillings were found on root canal walls after root cleavage in all groups. Longitudinal cleavage of root in a buccolingual direction is a practical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the retreatment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>] and unlike radiographic images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R21">21</xref>] provides a three dimensional view of the canal. The important point in this method as mentioned by Takahishi et al. is that the chisel should not touch the root canal walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>].</p><p>Among different retreatment methods; retreatment rotary instruments have become more attractive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R25">25</xref>]. In this study ProTaper D series specified for retreatment purposes were compared with H-Files which were traditionally used for root canal retreatment. Although some studies have found no significant difference among ProTaper D and hand files efficacy in removing gutta-percha remnants on canal walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R26">26</xref>], Unal et al. found K-files and H-files to be more effective in removing filling material than ProTaper and R-Endo instruments in curved canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R13">13</xref>]. In our study, ProTaper retreatment without solvent visibly showed less filling remnants. The slight curvature of the specimens might have allowed better performance of the D series instruments (D1, D2, D3) with tapers equal to (9%, 8% and 7% respectively). They are more likely to contact the root canal walls and remove filling remnants compare to 2% tapered H-Files. Gu et al. suggested that better performance of ProTaper D series in straight canals was due to the progressive taper and length of these files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R9">9</xref>]. They mentioned that this design may result in not only removal of gutta-percha but also cut the superficial layer of dentin. Chloroform is considered a common solvent which has been used in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R27">27</xref>]. In terms of root canal wall cleanliness, we found that solvent did not play significant role; this concurred with Takahashi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R20">20</xref>]. Also, in a recent study, Dadresanfar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R18">18</xref>] showed that solvent application had adverse effect on retreatment ability of Mtwo R instruments. Although Horvath et al. found less filling remnants in their non-solvent group, they only compared hand files with or without solvent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R8">8</xref>]. The use of solvent has reduced the time needed for retreatment in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R28">28</xref>]. In the present study, the shortest retreatment time was in the ProTaper + solvent group. It seems that the heat generated by rotary instruments helps the solvent to plasticize the gutta-percha and eases the penetration of rotary instruments into the gutta-percha mass. Bramante and Betti believe softened gutta-percha is less resistant and easier to be penetrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R28">28</xref>]. Since antibacterial effect of chloroform has been proved in a study by Edgar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10176R6">6</xref>] and it shortens the time required for retreatment by ProTaper D series the authors assume that its use might be beneficial during retreatment procedure.</p><p>Since root curvature plays important role on the efficacy of root canal instrumentation, further investigations on severely curved roots is suggested.</p></sec><sec id="sec5065"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Under the conditions of the present study, ProTaper D retreatment series with chloroform compare to hand instruments performed faster and more effective root canal retreatment in straight root canals.
