Fortunately, the majority of these injuries are &#x02018;closed&#x02019;, that is, the skin around the fracture is intact. In such cases, the risk of infection is low. However, if the fracture is &#x02018;open&#x02019; such that the barrier provided by the skin is breached, then the broken bone is exposed to contamination from the environment.</p><p>In open fractures, the risk of infection is greatly increased.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Wounds associated with open fractures of the lower limb are graded by severity, as part of routine clinical practice, using the classification of Gustilo and Anderson;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> grade 1 injuries are small wounds (a laceration less than 1&#x02005;cm), grade 2 involve larger wounds (laceration greater than 1&#x02005;cm) but without extensive soft-tissue damage, and grade 3 wounds have a laceration greater than 1&#x02005;cm with extensive soft-tissue damage. In addition, Gustilo and Anderson described a special type of grade 3 injury that involved damage to a major blood vessel that required surgical repair. The greater the extent of the injury to the soft-tissues around the broken bone, the greater the risk of infection.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In severe, high-energy fractures of the lower limb, infection rates of 27% are still reported, even in specialist trauma centres.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>If complications, such as surgical site infection occur, treatment frequently continues for years after the open fracture. There is a huge healthcare cost associated with such injuries (US study: $163&#x02005;000 if the limb can be salvaged and $500&#x02005;000 + if amputation is required), and this is a fraction of the subsequent personal and societal cost.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the UK civilian population, the risk of an open long-bone fracture is approximately 11.5/100&#x02005;000/year,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but this is much higher in the military population and the severity of the injuries frequently greater.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The initial management of open fracture of the lower limb in the emergency department involves the removal of gross contamination, the application of a sealed dressing and the administration of antibiotics, as described in the joint British Orthopaedic Association/British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons publication &#x02018;standards for the management of open fractures of the lower limb&#x02019;. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boa.ac.uk/site/show">http://www.boa.ac.uk/site/show</ext-link> publications.aspx?id=59). Some patients may be transferred immediately to a hospital with specialist facilities (Major Trauma Centre). However, the key component of the management is the surgical &#x02018;debridement&#x02019;&#x02014;removal of all contaminated tissue and washout of the open fracture in the operating theatre. Once the wound is clean, the fracture is usually immobilised with some form of internal or external fixation and a dressing is applied. This proposal concerns the type of dressing that is applied to the wound at the end of the operation.</p><p>Traditionally, a non-adhesive layer is applied to the exposed area. This is then covered with a sealed dressing or bandage to protect the open fracture from further contamination. The wound is covered in this way until a second look is done and further debridement is performed in the operating theatre, usually 48&#x02005;h after the initial injury. This method has been used throughout the National Health Service (NHS) and in military practice for many years. However, any bleeding or ooze from the open fracture will collect under or on the dressings; this may be uncomfortable for the patient and may pose an infection risk.</p><p>Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an alternative form of dressing which may be applied to open fractures. In this treatment, an &#x02018;open-cell&#x02019;, solid foam is laid onto the wound followed by a sealed dressing. A hole is made in the dressing overlying the foam and a sealed tube is used to connect the foam to a pump which creates a partial vacuum over the wound. This negative-pressure therapy removes blood and ooze from the area of the wound, may also remove any bacteria left in the wound and encourages the formation of &#x02018;granulation&#x02019; (healing) tissue.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Recent laboratory studies have also suggested that NPWT may stimulate the release of &#x02018;cytokines&#x02019; that encourage new blood vessel formation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, NPWT is considerably more expensive than traditional wound dressings, for the dressing and the associated machinery which generates the partial vacuum.</p><p>NPWT has shown encouraging results in clinical trials related to diabetic foot wounds<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and abdominal wounds,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but there is only one randomised trial comparing standard wound dressing with NPWT for patients with open fractures of the lower limb.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This trial demonstrated a reduction in the rate of wound infection in the group of patients treated with NPWT. However, the study had relatively small numbers (59 patients, 63 fractures), was single-centre, included only the most severe types of injury and was funded by a commercial company which produces a NPWT system. There are no similar trials registered on the international trials database.</p><p>Despite the limited supporting evidence, the current British Orthopaedic/British Association of Plastic Surgery guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boa.ac.uk/site/showpublications.aspx?id=59">http://www.boa.ac.uk/site/showpublications.aspx?id=59</ext-link>) for the management of open fractures of the lower limb already include reference to the use of NPWT. A recent consensus paper, published by the International Expert Panel on NPWT (NPWT-EP)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> also recommended that NPWT &#x0201c;should be considered when primary closure is not possible&#x0201d; in the management of wounds associated with open fractures, but acknowledged that the evidence base to support this statement was very limited.</p><p>We believe that there is a pressing need to evaluate this relatively expensive technology. We, therefore, propose a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing negative pressure wound therapy with standard dressings for patients with wounds associated with open fractures of the lower limb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Medical Research Council's Good Clinical Practice (MRC GCP) principles and guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, Warwick Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) SOPs, relevant UK legislation and the Protocol.

In these centres, an average of four eligible patients are admitted with an open fracture to the lower limb every month. All centres involved in the trial will be Major Trauma Centres or Trauma Units with similar catchment areas as the five initial sites. During the main phase of the trial, trial site recruitment of the remaining sites will occur over a period of 8&#x02005;months.

All patients with an open fracture of the lower limb will be screened for eligibility by a research associate.</p><p>The nature of these injuries means that a majority of patients will be operated on immediately or be on the next available trauma operating list, depending on access to an appropriate operating theatre. A small number of patients are transferred between hospitals or wait for an operation, and could potentially give consent prior to randomisation. These are the patients who may wait up to 72&#x02005;h before surgery.</p><p>Some patients may be unconscious, all will be distracted by the injury to their leg and its subsequent treatment, and all will have had large doses of opiates for pain relief, affecting their ability to process information. The majority of patients will, therefore, lack capacity to make a decision about participation in a research project at this stage. In this emergency situation, the focus will be on informing the patient and any next of kin about immediate clinical care. There will be limited time for the patient, if they had capacity, or their next of kin to review trial documentation and make an informed decision about whether they would wish to participate.</p><p>Conducting research in this &#x02018;emergency setting&#x02019; is regulated by the <italic>Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005</italic>. As patients are likely to lack capacity, as described above, and because of the urgent nature of the treatment limiting access to and appropriate discussion with personal consultees, we propose to act in accordance with section 32, subsection 9b of the MCA for following a process approved by the relevant research ethics committee. The patients who have surgery on the next available trauma operating theatre enter the study under presumed consent. We will not obtain consent prior to surgery, but will inform the patient and seek patient consent for continuation in the trial at the first appropriate time point in the postoperative period.</p><p>For those patients who are able to give consent before their operation, namely those who have been transferred or are waiting up to 72hrs for their operation, will be approached by the research team for consent into the study.</p><p>A small number of the patients who have had their surgery delayed may still not have capacity to give consent, for example, those who are unconscious. If the clinical team in charge of that patient&#x02019;s care do not think that the patient is able to provide clinical consent for their operation, then the research team will approach a consultee for agreement to randomisation. The patient themselves will be approached for consent as soon as the clinical team deem that they have regained capacity following their operation.</p><p>The treating surgeon will determine the final grade of the open fracture at the end of the debridement of the wound as per routine practice in the operating theatre, and then patients will automatically be enrolled into the study via the online randomisation system.</p><p>For those patients who did not give consent prior to surgery, at the first appropriate time when the patient has regained capacity, the research associate will provide the patients with all of the study information. The patients will be given the opportunity to ask questions, and discuss the study with their family and friends. They will then be asked to provide written consent for continuation in the study.</p><p>Throughout the whole study, screening logs will be kept at each site to determine the number of patients assessed for eligibility and reasons for any exclusion. Patients who decline to continue to take part during the feasibility phase will be given the opportunity to discuss/inform the research team of their reasoning behind their decision not to take part.</p><p>Any new information that arises during the trial that may affect participants&#x02019; willingness to take part will be reviewed by the TSC; if necessary, this will be communicated to all participants. A revised consent form will be completed, if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Qualitative substudy</title><p>Within the feasibility study, a qualitative substudy will assess patient experience of having an open fracture of the lower limb, being enrolled in the study, giving or declining consent for the trial, and the acceptability of the trial procedures.</p><p>The sample will include patients at two UK sites (Coventry and Oxford). This will include standard wound care and negative pressure wound therapy. Semistructured interviews will be undertaken with up to 20 consecutive patients who provide informed consent for the interview during their hospital stay. Participants will be given information about the interview study and provide written consent. The interviews will be conversational in style<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and focus on three areas (1) the experience of open fracture of the lower limb, (2) the impact and acceptability of the trial procedures, and (3) the process of consent to a trial. Those who preferred not to take part in the trial will be asked to tell us about (1) the experience of open fracture of the lower limb, and (2) their thoughts and feelings about the trial. The key interview questions will be what is it like: to experience an open fracture; have an open wound and dressing/negative pressure wound therapy; to be part of a trial/prefer not to take part in a trial? These will be followed by prompts such as: tell me more about that; how did that affect you; how did you feel about that; what were you thinking at that point. The interviews will take place in hospital when the patients are well enough and feel able to take part in the interview. Where possible, these interviews would take place in a private area on the ward, but at the bedside is more likely due to the nature of the injury. Attention will be paid to privacy and dignity of the patient, and the interview will be stopped and reconvened if the patient is uncomfortable or feels that their privacy is being compromised.</p><p>Interviews will be performed with both patients who agree to continue in the trial and those who decline to be further involved. The research team is aware that ethically patients do not have to provide a reason for their choice and should not be coerced in anyway. However, in light of the limited knowledge in this area, the value of understanding what trauma patients&#x02019; think and feel about research in this context would be substantial and would help to inform the recruitment process in the main trial. The researcher would take an exploratory, non-judgemental stance while allowing the patient to tell their story. As interviews will take place with participant refusers after they have withdrawn from the trial, the interview cannot be construed as coercive in relation to the trial.</p><p>Two focus groups, 1 on each site with up to 12 staff, will be undertaken with staff involved in the management of the trial or the management of patients in the trial. This will include surgeons, emergency department staff, theatre staff, ward staff and research staff. The participants will consider the factors that facilitate and inhibit the daily process of running the trial. This will include optimal timing and method to approach the patient with the participant information. Focus groups are a good way to access a range of views on a topic and provide opportunities for debate and challenge within the group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Managing the dynamics of a group is important to ensure all participants have a chance to share their views and strong views are contained. Attention will be paid to this through the use of basic ground rules and good facilitation of the group. The focus group discussions will take place in a quiet room away from interruptions. The interviews and focus groups&#x02019; meetings will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis will be line-by-line, identifying codes, building categories and themes by drawing on the work of Miles and Huberman.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> NVivo9, a software package for qualitative data, will be used to help with data management. The intention of the patient interviews is to understand how patients make sense of their treatment and to specifically address any issues related to their consent to participate. The focus groups will develop a greater understanding of the factors that facilitate and inhibit the process of the trial. The qualitative data will be used to provide indepth understanding of the process to augment the quantitative data.</p></sec><sec id="s2f4"><title>Trial ID</title><p>When a patient enters the trial, sufficient non-identifiable details will be logged on a secure, encrypted, web-based system, provided by York CTU. Basic information, including the patient's initials, date of birth, gender and eligibility checks will be entered. The patient will then receive a trial ID that will be used on all trial documentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f5"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The allocation sequence will be generated by an independent randomisation centre&#x02014;York CTU. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by trial centre and Gustilo and Anderson grade&#x02014;2, 3, or 3 with vascular injury requiring surgical repair. Eligibility for the trial is based on a wound of grade 2 or above, which will be established definitively at the end of the initial surgical debridement in the operating theatre as per routine clinical practice. Therefore, participants will be assigned to their treatment allocation at the end of the initial surgery, but before the wound dressing is applied. All modern operating theatres include a computer with web-access; so a secure, 24&#x02005;h, web-based randomisation system will be used to generate the treatment allocation intraoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s2f6"><title>Post randomisation withdrawals/exclusions</title><p>Participants will be excluded in the postrandomisation phase if it is established that they would be unable to adhere to trial procedures or complete questionnaires.</p><p>Participants may decline to continue to take part in the trial at any time without prejudice. A decision to decline consent or withdraw will not affect the standard of care the patient receives.</p><p>Participants have three options for withdrawal:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Participants may withdraw from completing any further questionnaires, but allow the trial team to still view and record anonymously any relevant hospital data that is recorded as part of normal standard of care, that is, X-rays and further surgery information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants can withdraw wholly from the study, but data obtained up to the point of withdrawal will be included in the final analysis of the study; thereafter, no further data will be collected for that participant.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants can withdraw wholly from the study and data collected up to the point of withdrawal will not be included in the final analysis.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Once withdrawn from the study, the patient will be advised to discuss their further care plan with their surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="s2f7"><title>Blinding</title><p>As the wound dressings are clearly visible, the patients cannot be blinded to their treatment. In addition, the treating surgeons will also not be blind to the treatment, but will take no part in the postoperative assessment of the patients. The functional outcome data will be collected and entered onto the trial central database via postal questionnaire by a research assistant/data clerk in the trial central office.</p><p>In addition, we will use photographs of the wound at the 6-week clinical follow-up to provide an objective assessment of wound healing and infection. The photographs will be reviewed independently by two experienced assessors who are blind to the treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Trial treatments</title><p>Patients with an open fracture of the lower limb usually have surgery on the next available trauma operating list. Some patients may be transferred to a Major Trauma Centre for definitive care&#x02014;within the first 48&#x02005;h of injury&#x02014;but will still have their initial surgery as soon as possible. All patients will receive a general or regional anaesthetic. The wound associated with the fracture is &#x02018;debrided&#x02019; (surgical decontamination and cleansed) in the operating theatre and the fracture is treated with either internal or external fixation. At the end of the initial operation, a dressing is applied to the wound. This trial will compare two types of wound dressings: standard dressing versus negative pressure wound therapy.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Treatment options</title><p>Standard dressing: The standard dressing for open fractures comprises a non-adhesive layer applied directly to the wound which is covered by a sealed dressing or bandage. The standard dressing does not use &#x02018;negative pressure&#x02019;. The exact details of the materials used will be left to the discretion of the treating surgeon as per their routine practice, but the details of each dressing applied in the trial will be recorded.</p><p>NPWT: The NPWT dressing uses an &#x02018;open-cell&#x02019;, solid foam which is laid onto the wound followed by an adherent, sealed dressing. A hole is cut in the layer over the foam and a sealed tube is used to connect the foam to a pump which creates a partial vacuum over the wound. The basic features of the NPWT are universal, but the exact details of the dressing will be left to the discretion of the treating surgeon. Again, the details of the dressings used will be recorded in the trial documentation.</p><p>Both groups of patients will then follow the normal postoperative management of patients with an open fracture of the lower limb. This will usually involve a &#x02018;second-look&#x02019; operation after 48&#x02005;h, where a further debridement is performed and the wound closed (with sutures or a soft-tissue graft, as necessary). Depending on the specific injury and according to the treating surgeons&#x02019; normal practice, the wound may be redressed again pending further surgery. Any further wound dressing will follow the allocated treatment until definitive closure/cover of the wound is achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Rehabilitation</title><p>The rehabilitation will be recorded but left entirely to the discretion of the treating surgeon, as the type of injury will vary between patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Baseline, standardised radiographs will be copied onto CD from the hospital PACs (archiving) system. Copies of the baseline clinical report forms and CD will be delivered to the trial coordinating centre.</p><p>The research associate will make a record of any early complications at the routine 6-week follow-up appointment and take a photograph of the wound. This data will be returned to the trial coordinating centre, together with a copy of the routine 6-week follow-up radiograph. The number and timing of any subsequent follow-up appointments will be at the discretion of the treating surgeon. All patients will be reviewed at 12&#x02005;months as per routine practice after this type of injury. Details of any late complications and copies of the 12-month radiographs will be sent to the trial coordinating centre.</p><p>The functional outcome data will be collected using questionnaires at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months postoperatively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009087TB2">table 2</xref>). In addition to the DRI, the patients will be asked to fill out the EuroQol and SF-12 questionnaires, and a complications/further surgical interventions and health economics questionnaire. The 3, 6 and 9&#x02005;months postoperative questionnaires will be sent to the patients by post, a process done centrally by a data clerk at the Warwick CTU. All of the outcome questionnaires can be completed over the phone if postal copies are not returned. Patients will be asked to complete their 12&#x02005;months postoperative questionnaire during their routine follow-up appointment 1-year postoperation.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015009087TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Follow-up measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time point</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI and SF-12 preinjury, EQ-5D preinjury and contemporary, routine radiographs of leg wound(s)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x02005;weeks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Complication records, radiographs, operative record, photograph of leg wound(s)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02005;months</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI, EQ-5D, SF-12 record of complications/rehabilitation or other interventions, and economics questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x02005;months</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI, EQ-5D, SF-12 record of complications/rehabilitation or other interventions, and economics questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9&#x02005;months</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI, EQ-5D, SF-12 record of complications/rehabilitation or other interventions, and economics questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;months</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI, EQ-5D, SF-12 record of complications/rehabilitation or other interventions, and economics questionnaire, radiographs</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>DRI, Disability Rating Index.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Adverse event management</title><p>Adverse events (AE) are defined as <italic>any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject and which do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment</italic>.

The Warwick CTU has a quality assurance manager who will monitor this trial by conducting regular (yearly or more, if deemed necessary) inspections of the Trial Master File. Furthermore, the processes of consent taking, randomisation, registration, provision of information and provision of treatment will be monitored. A TSC and a DMC will be set up.

The estimated recruitment rate and the overall rate of withdrawn patients in the feasibility phase will inform the design and the decision to proceed to the main RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Main RCT</title><p>Standard statistical summaries (eg, medians and ranges or means and variances dependent on the distribution of the outcome) and graphical plots showing correlations will be presented for the primary outcome measure and all secondary outcome measures. Baseline data will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms, and to highlight any characteristic differences between those individuals in the study, those ineligible and those eligible, but withholding consent.</p><p>The main analysis will investigate differences in the primary outcome measure, the DRI score at 1&#x02005;year after injury, between the two treatment groups (standard wound dressings and negative pressure wound therapy) on an intention-to-treat basis. In addition, early functional status will also be assessed and reported at 3, 6 and 9&#x02005;months. Differences between groups will be assessed, based on a normal approximation for the DRI score at 12&#x02005;months postinjury and at interim occasions. Tests will be two sided and considered to provide evidence for a significant difference if p values are less than 0.05 (5% significance level).</p><p>The stratified randomisation procedure should ensure a balance in Gustilo and Anderson grade and the recruiting centre's between-test treatments. Although generally we have no reason to expect that clustering effects will be important for this study, in reality, the data will be hierarchical in nature, with patients naturally clustered into groups by the recruiting centre. Therefore, we will account for this by generalising the conventional linear (fixed effects) regression approach to a mixed effects modelling approach, where patients are naturally grouped by recruiting centres (random effects). This model will formally incorporate terms that allow for possible heterogeneity in responses for patients due to the recruiting centre, in addition to the fixed effects of the treatment groups, Gustilo and Anderson grade, and other patient characteristics that may prove to be important moderators of the treatment effect such as age and gender.</p><p>It seems likely that some data may not be available due to voluntary withdrawal of patients, lack of completion of individual data items or general loss to follow-up. Where possible, the reasons for data &#x02018;missingness&#x02019; will be ascertained and reported. Although missing data is not expected to be a problem for this study, the nature and pattern of the missingness will be carefully considered&#x02014;including, in particular, whether data can be treated as missing completely at random. If judged appropriate, missing data will be imputed, using the multiple imputation facilities available in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). The resulting imputed datasets will be analysed and reported, together with appropriate sensitivity analyses. Any imputation methods used for scores and other derived variables will be carefully considered and justified. Reasons for ineligibility, non-compliance, withdrawal or other protocol violations will be stated and any pattern observed will be summarised. More formal analysis, for example, using logistic regression with &#x02018;protocol violation&#x02019; as a response, may also be appropriate and aid interpretation. About 1&#x02013;2% of patients are expected to die during follow-up; so this is unlikely to be a serious cause of bias. However, we will conduct a secondary analysis taking account of the competing risk of death, using methods described by Varadhan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The main analyses will be conducted using specialist mixed effects modelling functions available in the software package R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) where DRI data will be assumed to be normally distributed, possibly after appropriate variance stabilising transformation. The primary focus will be the comparison of the two treatment groups of patients, and this will be reflected in the analysis which will be reported together with appropriate diagnostic plots that check the underlying model assumptions. Results will be presented as mean differences between the trial groups, with 95% CIs.</p><p>Secondary analyses will be undertaken using the above strategy for approximately normally distributed outcome measures SF-12 and EQ5D. For dichotomous outcome variables, such as indicators of deep infection and other complications related to the trial interventions, mixed effects logistic regression analysis will be undertaken with results presented as ORs (and 95% CIs) between the trial groups. Also, temporal patterns of any complications will be presented graphically and if appropriate, a time-to-event analysis (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) will be used to assess the overall risk and risk within individual classes of complications.</p><p>A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be agreed on with the DMC. Any subsequent amendments to this initial SAP will be clearly stated and justified. Interim analyses will be performed only where directed by the DMC. The routine statistical analysis will mainly be carried out using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and S-PLUS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insightful.com/">http://www.insightful.com/</ext-link><italic>).</italic> Results from this trial will also be compared with results from other trials.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>An economic evaluation will be integrated into the trial design.

Observational research may be required to detail additional staff and material inputs associated with clinical complications. At 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months postrandomisation, trial participants will be asked to complete economic questionnaires profiling hospital (inpatient and outpatient) and community health and social care resource use, and for the purposes of sensitivity analysis, out-of-pocket expenditures and costs associated with lost productivity. Current UK unit costs will be applied to each resource item to value total resource use in each arm of the trial. <italic>Per diem</italic> costs for hospital care, delineated by level or intensity of care, will be calculated by the health economics researcher using data from detailed questionnaires completed by the local finance departments, giving cost data and apportioning these to different categories of patient using a &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; methodology. The unit costs of clinical events that are unique to this trial will be derived from the hospital accounts of the trial participating centres, although primary research that uses established accounting methods may also be required.

Results will be presented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) generated via non-parametric bootstrapping. This accommodates sampling (or stochastic) uncertainty and varying levels of willingness to pay for an additional QALY. Owing to the known limitations of within-trial economic evaluations,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> we will also construct a decision-analytical model to model beyond the parameters of the proposed trial the cost-effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy in this clinical population. The model will be informed partly by data collected as part of the proposed trial, and also by data collected from other primary and secondary sources, including data sets held by the research team. Long-term costs and health consequences will be discounted to present values using discount rates recommended for health technology appraisal in the UK.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A series of probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the implications of parameter uncertainty on the ICERs.
