practice on the quality of life of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Through a
randomization of 32 stroke patients, this research allocated the experimental group (n=15)
and the control group (n=17). Regarding the experimental group, the imagination practice
intervention and the ordinary rehabilitation therapy had been applied 1 time a day and 5
times a week for 4 weeks. Regarding the control group, the ordinary rehabilitation therapy
had been provided during the same session as that of the experimental group. In order to
measure the quality of life, the SS-QOL was used. [Results] The mental practice and CON
groups showed significant differences with the SS-QOL scores. [Conclusion] Through the
result of this research, we were able to find out that the mental practice intervention is
effective with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of the stroke patients.
Regarding the researches that will take place later on, the researches which achieved the
securing of even more experiment subjects and the control of the diverse variables of the
quality of life will be needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The mental practice is a method of intervention which can make the subjects learn the
exercise skills and improve the ability to engage in an exercise by having the subjects
imagine the movements in their minds and carry them out without actually moving the body and
which can improve the ability to carry out the exercises<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, as a method for the learning and improvement of the
exercise skills, the imagination practice interventions have been used in the diverse
therapy and rehabilitation areas<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a
strong point of this intervention is that the training is possible without any expensive
treatment tools without regard to the time and the place<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. If we take a look at the researches that applied the mental
practice with the stroke patients as the subjects, Korn said that he carried out an exercise
mental practice for the improvement of the exercise execution capabilities with the stroke
patients as the subjects and that the balancing ability while sitting down of the group
which carried out the mental practice significantly improved more than that of the group
which carried out the rehabilitation therapy<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to his research results, Park reported the improvement of
the manual function and the capability of carrying out the everyday lives through the
positive changes of the muscular activities of the stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Generally, the quality of life of the stroke patients has been emphasized very much in the
field of rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. And it has been
known that such a quality of life has the significant correlation with the functions and the
ability to carry on the everyday lives of the patients themselves<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. If we take a look at the results of the researches related
to the imagination training that were reported previously, in most of the researches, there
have been the limitations to the improvements and others of the like of the balance, the
manual function, and the ability to carry out the everyday lives. As such, the results of
the researches on the influences of the mental practice due to this on the quality of life
of the stroke patients are on an insignificant level. As such, in this research, it is
intended to take a look at the influences of the mental practice on the quality of life of
the stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this research were the 32 patients who received the diagnosis of the
hemiplegia due to stroke and had been receiving the hospitalized therapy at Hospital D in
Korea. The subjects received an explanation about the purpose and methods of the study prior
to their participation and provided informed consent according to the ethical principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki. The criteria for the selection of the subjects of this research
are as below. The persons who had the laterality hemiplegia for over 6 months. The persons
whose scores are 24 points or higher in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE-K). The persons whose averages are 2.26 or below in the Vividness of
Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ). The persons who do not have any problems in
communicating. The persons who do not have hemi-neglect. The persons who do not have any
hearing and visual impairments. As a person who shows the functions of the pronation of the
wrist with the manual function, the extending of the wrist by at least 20 in the condition
of bending the wrist, and the extending of the metacarpophalangeal joint to at least 10, a
person who can grasp and place the things with the affected side. The general
characteristics of the subjects are noted in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

dividing them into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group had
received the traditional, occupational therapy for 20 minutes a day, 5 times a week, and for
4 weeks. And the imagination practices for 10 minutes each were carried out at the end of
the occupational therapy time. And the total time of the imagination training that was
applied was 200 minutes. In contrast to this, regarding the control group, the traditional,
occupational therapy and the physical therapy had been carried out for 30 minutes a day, for
5 times a week, and for 4 weeks. The mental practice was carried out in the occupational
therapy room with the quiet environment and when the subjects were in the condition in which
their physical and psychological conditions were stable. Regarding all the training
programs, the files that were recorded in advance with the length of 10 minutes were used
and applied. The programs that were used for the training were a total of three, including
turning the pages of a book, putting in the beans, and piling up the plastic cups.</p><p>The experimental design in this study was the pre-test and the post-test with the control
group design for the 4 weeks intervention. The pre-test and post-test measurements were
obtained 1 day before and after the training, respectively, using the clinical measures. The
evaluations of the quality of life of the subjects were measured by using the
Stroke-Specific Quality of Lives (SS-QOL) for both before and after the intervention for
both groups. The 12 domains of the SS-QOL were the energy, the role in the family, the usage
of language, the moving, the mood, the individual&#x02019;s personality, the self-help activities,
the social role, the ability to think, the manual function, the eyesight, and the
occupational production activities. The number of the questions was a total of 49 questions.
And it is an evaluation tool with the 5-point scale. According to a report on a research
with the stroke patients in Korea as the subjects, the reliability appeared high at 0.806).
The SPSS ver. 18.0 was used to calculate the means and the standard deviations. The
descriptive statistics were used to analyze the general characteristics of the subjects. The
differences with the quality of life scores between the 2 groups were investigated using the
independent t-test. For all the data, the significance was accepted at the values of
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of quality of lifes of each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">mental practice</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">CON</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SS-QOL*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">152.72 &#x000b1;

the mental practice with regard to the quality of life of the patient aspect by applying the
mental practice to the stroke patients who were the subjects. As a result, the significant
therapeutic improvements of the quality of life of the stroke patients who received the
mental practice interventions were observed. If we take a look by detailed item, in most of
the items, no significant result could be obtained. However, in the items of self-care,
upper extremity function, the significant improvement results were shown. This is judged to
be a result that was obtained because the mental practice that was carried out in this
research was organized by being centered on the program of the training of the arms. Other
than the research results<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> that the mental
practice reported in the previous, many research results can improve the balance, the manual
function, and the ability to carry out the everyday life of the stroke patients, such
results mean that the mental practice can have the positive influences on their quality of
life. But, as the limitations of this research, first, there is the point that there is a
difficulty in generalizing the results as the number of the subjects is small and there is
the point that the groups had the differences with regard to the factors that can influence
the quality of life and that all such factors could not be controlled. As a result, it is
thought that, in the future researches, the securing of more subjects and the analyses that
control the diverse variables will be needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Lafleur</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Malouin</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Potential role of mental practice using motor imagery in
