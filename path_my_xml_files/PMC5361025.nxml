training and mirror therapy to improve on balance and gait function of stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] The participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups:
The action observation training with activity group practiced additional action
observation training with activity for three 30-minute session for six weeks (n=12). The
mirror therapy with activity group practiced additional mirror therapy with activity for
three 30-minute sessions for six weeks (n=11). The only action observation training group
practiced additional action observation training for three 30-minute sessions for weeks
(n=12). All groups received conventional therapy for five 60-minute sessions over a
six-week period. [Results] There were significant improvements in balance and gait
function. The action observation training with activity group significantly improved
subjects&#x02019; static balance. The action observation training with activity group and the
mirror therapy with activity group significantly improved subjects&#x02019; gait ability.

rehabilitation hospital. 35 stroke patients were selected as the sample, which was randomly
and evenly divided into three groups: (1) the action observation therapy with activity
(AOTA) group (n=12), (2) the mirror therapy with activity (MTA) group (n=11), and (3) the
action observation therapy (AOT) group (n=12). The inclusion criteria included (1) more than
six months post-injury, (2) the ability to walk 10&#x02005;m independently without aid, (3) a Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 23 or higher, and (4) no visual perception
deficits.</p><p>Individuals were excluded if they had an orthopedic disorder that could interfere with the
experiment, neglect of space on the affected side, or any other neurologic disease or
auditory or visual deficit that could prevent data collection.</p><p>For the AOTA group, the average age was 62.8 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;years, the average height was 165.3 &#x000b1;
6.9&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 68.3 &#x000b1; 9.7&#x02005;kg. For the MTA group, the average age was
57.27 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;years, the average height was 165.6 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 61.8 &#x000b1;
10.6&#x02005;kg. For the AOT group, the average age was 59.8 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;years, the average height was
162.2 &#x000b1; 8&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 59.9 &#x000b1; 10.6&#x02005;kg. Using Levene&#x02019;s variance homogeneity
test and a normality test on the general physical characteristics, no statistically
significant difference was found between the three groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). The Daegu University
Research Ethics Board approved the study protocol, and all the subjects gave their informed
consent.</p><p>The training program was conducted three times per week, for six weeks, from March to July
2014. The AOTA group conducted action observation using a video for 15 minutes a day and
physical training of the same motions as the observed ones, for 15 minutes a day. The MTA
group received mirror therapy for 15 minutes a day and physical training of the same motions
without a mirror for 15 minutes a day. The AOT group conducted action observation only,
without physical training, for 30 minutes a day. The three groups received general physical
therapy twice per week for 30 minutes per day.</p><p>For action observation training, a mirror therapy program by S&#x000fc;tbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was modified and complemented. Dorsiflexor
training was composed of three stages according to the level of difficulty, and action
observation training consisted of three stages; each stage was conducted six times for two
weeks. All training was conducted active assistive exercise with physical therapist. The
first stage was composed of knee joint extensor and dorsiflexor training. The second stage
consisted of knee joint flexor and dorsiflexor training. The third stage was comprised of
hip and knee joint flexor and dorsiflexor training.</p><p>For mirror therapy training, a mirror with width and length were 50&#x02005;cm and 70&#x02005;cm,
respectively, and a step board whose height, width, and length were 20&#x02005;cm, 60&#x02005;cm, and 50&#x02005;cm,
respectively, were employed. The subjects flexed their knees at 90 degrees on a chair with
their back and arms in a comfortable position, and to receive visual feedback only with the
non-paretic leg on the mirror, the mirror was placed on the paretic side and the step board
was arranged in front of the non-paretic lower limb. Step board was used to reflect the
non-paretic side properly. Their training program consisted of three steps including the
same motions as those of the action observation training.</p><p>The AOT group sat comfortably in an arm chair and watched a video of motions performed by
other people through the monitor installed 1&#x02005;m away from them. To minimize deviations among
individuals, the front and lateral side videos were produced separately for the left and
right hemiplegic subjects. While viewing the video, the subjects were asked not to follow
the content of the video or move, and the therapist encouraged the subjects to concentrate
on the content of the video.</p><p>To assess balance index, the Biodex Balance System (BBS, SD, Biodex Inc., USA), a type of
balance measuring equipment, was used. In this study, postural stability and fall risk were
used to measure the static and dynamic balance indexes, respectively. The Modified
Functional Ambulation Profile (mEFAP) is used to evaluate task-specific gait ability and to
measure the walking time taken to perform the five tasks in different environments.
Interrater reliability for the total E-FAP was&#x02265;0.997.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> The different tasks consist of walking 5&#x02005;m on a hard and even
ground surface, walking 5&#x02005;m on carpet, getting up from a chair, walking 3 m, and then
sitting in the chair, crossing a structuralized obstacle course, and climbing up five
stairs. The descriptive statistics, tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk Test), and homogeneity
of variance were calculated as the outcome variables using SPSS 21.0 software for Windows. A
paired t-test was used to determine pre- and post-experiment differences, and one-way
analysis of variance was performed to investigate intergroup differences. The least
significant difference (LSD) was used for post-hoc analysis. The significance level was set
at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The Overall Balance Index (OBI) significantly decreased in the AOTA group (p&#x0003c;0.05), did

mimicked them, a group that observed their own motions and mimicked them, and a group that
performed motions only without any observation and applied balance training on a level
surface to the three groups. They found a significant improvement in the balance of those
who observed their own motions and training them<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such result is considered to be because dorsiflexion movement
stimulated proprioceptors within the muscles and tendons, improving proprioceptive senses,
thereby ameliorating damaged functions, and increasing anteroposterior stability, thereby
having a positive effect on static balance ability. This is consistent with prior reports
that the movement of the ankles among the lower limbs plays an important role in balance
recovery<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and strategies to maintain
anteroposterior stability included ankle, hip, and stepping strategies<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FR did not significantly differ in all groups. In a study by Cha et al. whose subjects
were 20 stroke patients, the subjects performed task-oriented exercises five times per week,
twice a day, for four weeks and there were significant improvements in static and dynamic
balance indexes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was an increase
in dynamic balance ability in the AOTA and MTA groups, without statistical significance,
however. In that an exercise program for balance improvement should be dynamic and related
to actual functions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, the video in the
present study did not greatly affect subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance ability because it was
composed of static movements in a sitting posture, not dynamic movements moving the center
of gravity with the application of weight.</p><p>Nonetheless, AOTA and MOT significantly improved subjects&#x02019; gait abilities, as demonstrated
by their mEFAP outcomes, supporting the findings of several previous studies. In a study by
Park et al., 21 stroke patients were divided into a control group (11 subjects) that
observed a landscape and an experimental group (10 subjects) that observed gait motions 30
minutes per day, three times per week, for four weeks. Then, they showed significant
differences in a 10-m walking test, a figure of 8 walking test, the dynamic gait index, and
stance phase, swing phase, and stride, which are gait asymmetry scores<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study by Sutbeyaz et al. whose subjects were
sub-acute stroke patients, mirror therapy training was applied where their ankles were
dorsiflexed 30 minutes per day, for five days per week, for four weeks. The experimental
group saw their Brunnstrom stage and functional independence measure (FIM) score
significantly improve. They reported that a combined method of mirror therapy training and
general physical therapy may strengthen a stroke patient&#x02019;s lower limb motor function and
recovery of motions.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> In a study of 34
sub-acute stroke patients to whose lower limbs mirror therapy training and virtual therapy
were applied, Ji and Kim presented that mirror therapy was an applicable intervention to
improve the lower limb functions of stroke patients by verifying that the mirror therapy
group saw their single support, step length, and stride significantly improve.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Based on previous research results and a report<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> that motor memory was formed in a group when action observation and
actual training of such images were conducted, but motor memory was not formed in a group
that was trained with the same motions but observed other images, the present findings also
indicated that observing and performing motions repetitively would have enabled motor
learning by activating mirror neuron cells. In addition, the physical training of performing
the same motions after their observation strengthened the recovery of the damaged areas by
adding elements of action performance to motion observation and may have more greatly
affected the recovery of the patients&#x02019; abnormal brain activity and functional recovery. A
limitation of this study was that it utilized a small number of participants, and it was not
confirmed that the positive effects persisted.</p><p>In conclusion, AOTA improves static balance and gait function, and MOT improves gait
function. Mirror neuron activation combined with a conventional stroke physiotherapy program
enhances lower-extremity motor recovery and motor functioning in stroke patients. The effect
is enhanced when the action is executed following observation. Furthermore, research should
be done using mirror neuron activation to develop methods to improve the gait function and
balance of stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rizzolatti</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Fogassi</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallese</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding
