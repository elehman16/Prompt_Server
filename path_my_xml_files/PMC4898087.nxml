The Working Party estimated the prevalence of NAFLD in adult population from 5% to 30%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is a rapid change in the socioeconomic status in Asia, which has led to inappropriate diet and sedentary lifestyle. The management of patients with NAFLD consists of treating liver disease as well as the associated metabolic comorbidities such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. A variety of drugs have been tried for treatment of NASH, including metformin, pioglitazone, Vitamin E, Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA), omega-3 fatty acids, anti-hypertensives, antiobesity drugs, antioxidants, and many more. The most controversial of these drugs is UDCA with some studies favoring its use and others not. UDCA, a secondary bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria as metabolic byproduct, has been shown to be effective in the nonsurgical treatment of cholesterol gallstones and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Studies have investigated UDCA (conventional and high doses) to improve aminotransferases and steatosis in patients with NAFLD and liver histology in patients with NASH.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A single large multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that UDCA offers no benefit over placebo in patients with NASH.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Chalasani <italic>et al</italic>. recommends against the use of UDCA for the treatment of NASH.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recent Chinese studies favor UDCA as monotherapy or in combination. However, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends the use of Vitamin E administered at daily doses of 800 IU/day in nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH and is considered as a firstline pharmacotherapy for this patient population.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We carried out this study to compare the efficacy of these two drugs for treatment of NAFLD.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a prospective, single center, open-labeled, RCT carried out at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital between December 2011 and December 2013.

Most of its hepatoprotective effects were demonstrated under experimental conditions. Early clinical studies suggested a potentially beneficial effect in NASH as well. Data on the efficacy of UDCA specifically in experimental models of steatosis/NASH is heterogenous. Between 1994 and 2008, four prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the treatment of NASH with UDCA were conducted and until 2013, 12 randomized, controlled studies investigating the effects of UDCA in patients with NASH have been carried out. Th first study, by Lindor <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] compared the impact of 13&#x02013;15 mg/kg/day of UDCA to a placebo. The second study by Dufour <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] had an additional third arm that administered a combination therapy with UDCA and vitamin E. The third and fourth studies by Leuschner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and by Ratziu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] evaluated high doses of UDCA at 25&#x02013;35 mg/kg/day, and used liver biopsies and serum liver enzyme levels to evaluate the impact of UDCA. With the exception of the Ratziu <italic>et al</italic>. study, none of these studies showed any significant differences in the treatment of NASH with UDCA compared with a placebo. However, Dufour <italic>et al</italic>. did observe a significant improvement of NASH with the combination (UDCA/VitE) versus placebo therapy. Nine of later RCTs, however, found that UDCA had positive effects in patients with NASH, whether as monotherapy or combined with other drugs. Six of these studies were Chinese.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Trials in China of UDCA therapy in patients with NASH have not been available to Western researchers because of language limitations, and there has been no complete overview of these data. Seven of these trials assessed the effects of UDCA monotherapy, with the other five testing combinations of UDCA with vitamin E, polyene phosphatidylcholine, silymarin, glycyrrhizin, and tiopronin. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 24 months, with two studies using high doses of UDCA (23-35 mg/kg/day).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The PIVENS study by Sanyal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that Vitamin E is effective in NAFLD and is considered the treatment of choice for nondiabetic noncirrhotic NASH patients by AASLD. The study compared Vitamin E with Pioglitazone and placebo and concluded that Vitamin E is the drug with significant benefit, with an efficacy of 40%. Pioglitazone, although beneficial, did not reach statistical significance. For this reason we included a Vitamin E-treated arm as a comparison group. Our study showed improvement in 56% of the patients.</p><p>The present study has has shown that in Indian patients UDCA is noninferior to Vitamin E in NASH patients. The two drugs were comparable in terms of normalization of transaminases, reduction in transaminases, improvement in symptoms, improvement in APRI, AAR, and NFS. Both the drugs are well tolerated. When the two drugs are accompanied by lifestyle modification, the improvement is equally efficacious.</p><p>The therapeutic effect of UDCA on NASH is biologically plausible. In an animal model, UDCA was found to improve hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Although its mechanism of action is still unclear, UDCA can protect hepatocytes by inhibiting the absorption of toxic hydrophobic bile salts from the small intestine, competing with toxic bile acids to bind to cell and organelle membranes and maintain cell membrane stability.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In addition, UDCA can reduce oxidative damage by inhibiting hydrophobic bile salt-induced Kupffer cell activation and increasing hepatic glutathione levels.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Finally, UDCA has immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic properties, as shown by its interaction with the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor at the hepatocyte level, its repression of IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II gene expression and its maintenance of mitochondrial membrane stability.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Hence, UDCA is a well tolerated drug with minimal side effects, has a non-inferior efficacy as compared to Vitamin E and has a biologically plausible benefit. Clinical trials from China, like in our study, have also shown benefit. Hence, it is worthwhile to carry out double blinded studies with a larger sample size in Indian patients to prove or disprove the efficacy of UDCA, rather than following the trends of Western populations where UDCA has shown questionable benefit.</p><p>A major limitation of our study was that the benefit of both drugs was not documented histologically as a repeat biopsy was not permitted by the ethics committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>UDCA is as effective as vitamin E in Indian patients when combined with adequate dietary guidance and lifestyle modification. UDCA can be utilized as an alternative to Vitamin E in the treatment of NASH as it has minimal side effects and equal tolerability.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>PP, PS, JP, PB, VP, and MI confirm that they have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Viggiano</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>McGill</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Mayo Clinic experiences with a hitherto unnamed disease</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>1980</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>434</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7382552</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chitturi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the Asia-Pacific region: Future shock?</article-title><source>J Gastroenterol Hepatol</source><year>2004</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>368</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15012772</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chitturi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hashimoto</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Saibara</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name><name><surname>Sollano</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Asia-Pacific Working Party on NAFLD.
