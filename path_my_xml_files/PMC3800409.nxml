This time lag may result in re-infection of instrumented pocket and may impair healing. Therefore, a new approach to full-mouth non-surgical therapy to be completed within two consecutive days with full-mouth disinfection has been suggested. In periodontitis, leukocyte counts and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are likely to be slightly elevated, indicating the presence of infection or inflammation.

There is considerable evidence to support scaling and root planning (SRP) as one of the most effective procedures for the treatment of infectious periodontal diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Conventional nonsurgical periodontal therapy is performed on the quadrant basis with 1-2 week interval. This time lag may cause reinfection of instrumented pocket by the periodontal pathogens that are present in other sites of the oral cavity, such as the dorsal surface of the tongue, buccal mucosa, palate and tonsils, in addition to the subgingival pockets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Although the role of an extra-oral source cannot be totally ruled out.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In order to prevent this bacterial recolonization, Quirynen <italic>et al</italic>. in 1995 proposed one stage full mouth disinfection (OSFMD).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] A series of clinical and microbiological studies conducted by Quirynen <italic>et al</italic>. reported that OSFMD resulted in significantly greater improvements than conventional quadrant-wise therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>As the periodontal disease progresses, it is speculated that the inflamed and ulcerated subgingival pocket epithelium may facilitate bacterial entrance into the circulation causing bacteremia resulting in inflammation and infection of distant sites.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] There are various studies, which have demonstrated the effect of periodontitis and non-surgical periodontal therapy on various inflammatory parameters in blood,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] but no study has determined the effect of OSFMD on serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and other inflammatory parameters in blood like total white blood cell (TWBC) count. The rational to carry out this study was to evaluate two different FMD protocols as several studies comparing FMD versus quadrant wise SRP and failed to show any clinical significance and also hematologically. Thus, the present study aims to determine the effect of one stage versus two stages FMD on serum CRP levels and leucocyte count in patients with chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 20 chronic periodontitis patients aged between 30 and 55 years (8 Male and 12 Females) were recruited from the Department of Periodontics, Mamata Dental College, Khammam, India. Informed consent and ethical clearance was obtained from the ethical committee of the Mamata Dental College, Khammam. The inclusion criteria were patients with moderate to severe periodontitis who did not undergo any treatment at least 1 year before, patients with at least 20 teeth including third molars and systemically healthy individuals were included in the study. Patients under antibiotic therapy, smoking, pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study. The selected patients were divided into two groups randomly using coin toss. Each group consisted of 10 patients. Group 1 received OSFMD following Quirynen's protocol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] where complete supragingival scaling was performed using the ultrasonic scalers and subgingival SRP was performed using Gracey curettes in two visits within 24 h. Subgingival irrigation of all pockets was performed with 1% chorhexidine gel (3 times repeatedly within 10 min), tongue brushing was carried out with 1% chlorhexidine gel and Mouthrinsing and gargling was perfomed with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for 2 min. This protocol helps in disinfection of all the niches in the oral cavity.</p><p>Patients in Group 2 received supragingival scaling on the day of the first visit, later complete full mouth sub gingival SRP was accomplished after 1 week and disinfection of the periodontal pockets and other oral structures was carried out similar to the Group 1 on the day of the second visit [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Patients in both groups were prescribes ibuprofen 20 mg and were asked to take whenever they experienced pain. No antibiotics and specific oral hygiene instructions were not given to any patient as it may aid in reducing the bacteremia and may act as a confounding factor in effecting the results of the study. The clinical and hematological parameters were evaluated at baseline (on the day of the first visit before beginning the scaling) and 1 month post-treatment for both the groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>]. As the usual period of reevaluation after phase-I therapy is 1 month and the patients were planned for further surgical procedures; all the clinical and hematological parameters in the study were monitored for only 1 month. The clinical parameters were evaluated for plaque index, bleeding index, pocket depth, clinical attachment level (CAL) using UNC 15 (Hu-Friedy Manufacturing Co., Chicago, IL, USA). The hematological parameters were estimated for TWBC count and the CRP levels. The TWBC count was not estimated immediately after initial therapy because of the lack of patient's compliance. To evaluate the hematological parameters the blood was drawn from the patients anticubital vein and was sent to the laboratory for further estimation. TWBC count was evaluated using SYSMEX automatic hematological analyzer. The serum CRP levels were analyzed using turbidimetric immunoassay (Beckman Coulter-Au 400). In this method, the latex particles were coated with an antibody directed against the CRP in the sample. The increase in turbidity, which accompanies aggregation, is proportional to the CRP concentration. As the microbiological investigations were not under the scope of the study's aim they were not evaluated.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Disinfection of periodontal pockets using chlorhexidine gel as a part of Quirynen's full mouth disinfection protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-466-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Evaluation of clinical parameters</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-466-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Hematological analyzer SYSMEX</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-466-g003"/></fig><p>Patients were asked to estimate the degree of pain after treatment, on a visual analog scale from 0 to 10 and also to note the number of analgesics taken.

In order to avoid intraoral transmission of periodontal pathogens from periodontal pockets to recently instrument and healing periodontal sites, the FMD concept was propagated. The &#x0201c;OSFMD&#x0201d; concept was introduced to improve the results of subgingival scaling in the treatment of chronic periodontitis (Quirynen <italic>et al</italic>. 1995).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] As the bacterial load is reduced it is anticipated that a reduction of the inflammatory markers such as serum CRP levels and TWBC count may occur. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two different FMD protocols on systemic inflammatory markers such as serum CRP levels, leukocyte count in patients with chronic periodontitis.</p><p>The results of this study show that there is statistically significant reduction in plaque scores, bleeding scores and pocket depth after therapy in both groups from baseline to 1 month post-treatment. There is a significant gain in attachment level seen in both the groups from baseline to 1 month post-treatment. These findings are in accordance with several studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] which suggest an improvement in clinical parameters after SRP. The reduction in periodontal parameters in both groups indicates that periodontal therapy was effective in reducing the bacterial load and infection, which may enhance the process of healing.</p><p>Both therapies were associated with an improvement in the clinical parameters. No statistically significant difference was observed in the clinical parameters at baseline and 1 month after non-surgical therapy between Group 1 and Group 2. This is in accordance with study performed by Savitha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The methodology followed in that study is similar to that of the present study and have suggested that the improvement seen in the clinical parameters could be due to decreased bacteremia caused due to full mouth disinfection, which might have improved healing.</p><p>Although periodontitis is chronic in nature, acute-phase elements such as CRP are also part of the innate immunity in periodontitis and confirm that in periodontitis a systemic inflammation is present.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] It is biologically plausible that inflammatory mediators, especially interleukin-1 and -6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are released under conditions of periodontitis and present the capacity to stimulate hepatocytes to produce CRP. In this manner, it can be expected that, in the presence of chronic periodontitis, higher serum CRP levels would be found.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The results suggest a positive association existed between the presence of chronic periodontitis and high serum CRP levels and these levels subsequently decreased after therapy in both groups, which was statistically significant. These results are in accordance with the studies carried out by Paraskevas <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] D&#x02019;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and Joseph <italic>et al</italic>. (2011).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Contrastingly Ioannidou (2006)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] in a systematic review concluded that there is no difference in CRP levels before and after non-surgical treatment. These findings were based on the studies reviewed by them, where CRP levels before periodontal therapy were within the normal range and that is why there was no much difference found after periodontal therapy and also they suggested that none of the studies, which they reviewed have adequate data to support that CRP levels decreased after non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study both therapies were associated with an improvement in the serum CRP levels. No statistically significant difference was observed at baseline and 1 month after nonsurgical therapy with Group 1 when compared with Group 2. In a recent study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] non-surgical periodontal therapy was performed on 60 type 2 diabetic patients and were followed for 6 months. The authors concluded that the non-surgical periodontal therapy has limited effect on the levels of CRP in type 2 diabetic patients. However in a pilot study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] of 10 patients with both types of diabetes mellitus, a significant reduction of CRP levels was observed, which is in accordance with the present study.</p><p>Comparision of the baseline and 1 month post-treatment TWBC counts, the results showed a statistically significant improvement in both the treatment groups. The TWBC count decreased after the intervention of therapy in both the groups, which is in accordance to study performed by Christgau <italic>et al</italic>. (1998) suggesting that the decreased bacterial load has significantly decreased the level of inflammation and thereby decreasing the leukocyte count.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] In an another study, Radafshar <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] has proposed that non-surgical periodontal therapy results in a significant decrease in circulating levels of CRP and WBC count.</p><p>Both therapies were associated with a reduction in leukocyte count indicating that FMD performed in either one stage or in two stages was effective in reducing the infection caused by bacteremia and consequently there was a reduction in the count of these inflammatory cells. No statistical significant difference was observed in the TWBC count at baseline and 1 month after non-surgical therapy with Group 1 when compared with Group 2, which is in accordance with the study carried out by Sambashivaiah <italic>et al</italic>. (2011).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] As there are limited studies that followed the methodology similar to that of the present we have compared FMD with that of quadrant wise SRP.</p><p>The TWBC count was evaluated 1 month post-treatment, but not immediately after the treatment because of the decreased patient compliance. The WBC count appears to be within the expected range both at baseline and after a month with a slight decrease. These minor changes can be interpreted to be of any less clinical significance. Further studies have to be carried out to verify these findings.</p><p>In the present study, though there is no statistical significant difference seen between the two treatment modalities in the present study yet OSFMD has many advantages over Two Stage FMD such as the reduction in bacterial load and prevention of cross-contamination of the instrumented pockets is made possible,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] frequency of visits is decreased, which is comfortable and economical to both patient and the clinician and may be hypothesized as an ideal treatment approach for patients with low compliance. However, clinicians should select the treatment modality based on practical considerations, related patient compliance and clinical condition.</p><p>Limitations of this study include small sample size and also the short time period. Further studies with long duration and large sample size are required in the future to overcome these limitations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Both the treatment modalities showed significant improvement in both clinical and hematological parameters after therapy providing its clinical effectiveness. However comparison between the treatment modalities showed no statistical significant difference after 1 month. Though OSFMD may have a limited additional benefit over two stage FMD, in the treatment of periodontitis, it has certain advantages such as a reduction in bacterial load and prevention of cross-contamination of the instrumented pockets, frequency of visits is decreased, which is comfortable and economical to both patient and the clinician.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
