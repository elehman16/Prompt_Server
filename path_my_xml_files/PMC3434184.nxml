A simple equation that measured neurophysiological effects of alcohol in the first group of 15 participants performing repetitive cognitive tasks was applied to a second group of 15 operating an automobile driving simulator, and to a third group of 10 ambulatory people recorded simultaneously during a cocktail party. The equation derived from the first group quantified alcohol&#x02019;s effect by combining measures of higher frequency (beta) and lower frequency (theta) power into a single score. It produced an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve of .73 (p&#x0003c;.05; 67% sensitivity in recognizing alcohol and 87% specificity in recognizing placebo). Applying the same equation to the second group operating the driving simulator, AUC was .95, (p&#x0003c;.0001; 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity), while for the cocktail party group AUC was .87 (p&#x0003c;.01; 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity). EEG scores were significantly related to breath alcohol content in all studies. Some individuals differed markedly from the overall response evident in their respective groups. The feasibility of measuring the neurophysiological effect of a psychoactive substance from an entire group of ambulatory people at a cocktail party suggests that future studies may be able to fruitfully apply brain function measures derived under rigorously controlled laboratory conditions to assess drug effects on groups of people interacting in real world situations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding came from the National Institute of Mental Health R43MH071865, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Strokes R44NS048815, National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse R44AA014824, and the United States Air Force Research Laboratory FA8650-05-C-6553.

The question naturally arises how drug effects measured in the laboratory extend to real world situations. Such effects have rarely been measured outside the lab, for instance in vehicles being driven by fatigued and/or medicated drivers <xref rid="pone.0044676-Mackie1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Ramaekers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further, since so much of human experience involves social interactions, an additional frontier is to extend brain function measurements to groups of people simultaneously. Progress has been made in this regard with EEG and fMRI measures <xref rid="pone.0044676-Poldrack1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Cacioppo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but neurophysiological effects of drugs have not been measured from more than one person at a time. Again, the frontier is to extend from contrived laboratory conditions to studies in real world situations.</p><p>Here we report initial progress in this regard in three studies in which an EEG measure of the effect of a psychoactive substance during highly controlled repetitive cognitive testing in the lab was applied first to the more complex activity of operating an automobile driving simulator and then to a real world situation in which EEGs were recorded concurrently from 10 ambulatory people during a cocktail party. To establish feasibility, a strong effect was studied across increasingly naturalistic conditions, namely the acute neurophysiological response to alcohol <xref rid="pone.0044676-Begleiter1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An analytic method developed to measure drug effects by combining EEG and task performance measures into a single score <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> was adapted for use here on EEG measures by themselves. Different groups of subjects were used in the three studies to help assure that the findings were not idiosyncratic to the small groups of individuals studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Ethics</title><p>All studies were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

In this task, a stimulus (letter of the alphabet) was displayed for 200 ms in one of 12 positions on each trial, every 4.5 s. Participants responded &#x0201c;match&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no-match&#x0201d; on each trial with the left and right mouse buttons, respectively. Participants also performed an easier version of the WM task in which they had to decide whether the position of the current stimulus was the same as that of the first stimulus in the block of 50 trials. Stimulus and response parameters were the same as in the 2-back task. Participants also performed a zazen control task for 1.5 minutes in which they stared at a foveally presented dot and focused their attention on their ordinary inhalations and exhalations. Data from the WM and control tasks were combined to derive a multivariate metric for assessing alcohol effects during laboratory cognitive testing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Study 2</title><p>Participants in this study operated an automobile driving simulator (STISIM Drive; Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA) for &#x0223c;20 minutes.

For each test, participants performed one of 30 different scenarios, with the difficulty and number and position of unpredictable events equated across scenarios. Each scenario could be performed in &#x0223c;16&#x02013;20 minutes and presented a variety of different conditions, ranging from long stretches of highway driving with few other cars to urban driving conditions with heavy traffic, stoplights, pedestrians, and other hazards.

Prior to the analysis, sites were selected and the data was digitally filtered and down-sampled to match the data recorded in Studies 2 and 3. In Studies 2 and 3, EEG was continuously recorded with a stretchable nylon cap with disposable solid-hydrogel electrodes placed over bilateral and midline dorsolateral prefrontal locations (F3, F4, Fz), midline sensorimotor cortex (Cz), lateral superior parietal cortex (P3, P4), and midline parieto-occipital cortex (POz), referenced to digitally linked mastoids <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins8" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins9" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Automatic detection and removal of artifacts due to eye movements and blinks, scalp muscle activity, head and body movements, and bad electrode contacts <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins10" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> was followed by visual inspection of all decontaminated and raw data. Power spectral estimates were computed from Fast Fourier Transforms of the decontaminated, Hanning-windowed EEG data of each electrode of each participant by averaging the 50% overlapped 2-second periodograms over a task(s) in Studies 1 and 2, or over the two &#x0223c;3 minute intervals in Study 3. The individual frequency component powers were then averaged into 3 standard bands, theta (4&#x02013;7 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;13 Hz) and beta (13&#x02013;18 Hz) determined in prior studies to be sensitive to alcohol's effect on the EEG <xref rid="pone.0044676-Begleiter1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0044676-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins6" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Ilan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The 3 banded powers and their standard deviations constituted a total set of 6 variables for each of the 7 electrode sites. For each study, the power and standard deviation values were transformed to z-scores within subjects across alcohol and placebo or pre-drinking conditions to reduce scale differences between the variables and between subjects <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins11" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins12" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The values of the 6 variables at the 7 electrode sites were then averaged over all sites to produce 6 final candidate variables characterizing alcohol&#x02019;s effect over the entire cerebral cortex <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Differences in the variables between alcohol and placebo/pre-drinking conditions were assessed for each study by ANOVAs with condition and variable as within-subjects factors.

The resulting combination of variables and their weighting in an equation was then tested on data from Studies 2 and 3 to assess generalization to the more complex simulated driving task and to the real world situation of a group of people interacting socially. Application of divergence analysis to produce such an equation is described in detail in Gevins et al. <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and is briefly summarized here.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Study 1 exploratory analysis</title><p>For each participant, the values of the 6 candidate variables during cognitive testing for both alcohol and placebo sessions were submitted to a multivariate divergence analysis, a simple type of discriminant analysis that searched for the subset of variables producing the largest divergence between alcohol and placebo data <xref rid="pone.0044676-Tou1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The divergence analysis considered all possible subsets of up to 3 of the 6 variables and chose the subset that, considered together as a group, best recognized alcohol.

For each participant, for alcohol and placebo conditions, the values of each of the variables chosen in Study 1 were weighted by multiplying it by the percentage of the total divergence contributed by that variable in Study 1 and dividing by its variance in Study 1. The resulting values were then summed with a constant to form an EEG score quantifying the neurophysiological effect of alcohol and a score for placebo. EEG scores from each study were scaled such that the mean of scores from Study 1 were &#x02212;0.5 in the alcohol condition and +0.5 in the placebo condition. A relatively negative score in the alcohol condition indicated that the individual was affected by alcohol in a similar manner to that of participants in Study 1. A relatively positive score in the alcohol condition indicated that the individual had variable values more typical of the placebo condition in Study 1. Corresponding interpretations would apply for relatively positive and negative scores in the placebo condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2e5"><title>Study 3</title><p>The equation from Study 1 was similarly applied to the pre- and post-drinking data from each cocktail party participant to produce EEG scores for that individual.</p><p>Thus, for each study, data from each participant were combined into EEG scores in the alcohol and placebo/pre-drinking conditions, using the up to 3 variables, weights, and variances calculated in the divergence analysis in Study 1.

An incremental approach was used in which an equation was generated to assess alcohol effects on the EEG during cognitive testing in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment, 30&#x02013;50 minutes after drinking when breath alcohol concentrations were just under the California legal limit for driving. The resulting equation distinguished alcohol from placebo with a simple weighted combination of beta band and theta band power measures. The equation was then applied, with good results, to a second double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alcohol effects on a different group of participants performing the more complex task of operating an automobile driving simulator. Finally, the same equation readily recognized the effect of alcohol in the third group who were having a good time at a cocktail party.</p><p>Alcohol did not affect working memory task performance in Study 1 or automobile driving simulator performance in Study 2. Values for theta, alpha and beta band power and standard deviation variables were not affected by alcohol in Study 1, but were affected in Studies 2 (p&#x0003c;.01) and 3 (p&#x0003c;.01). These differences in EEG ANOVA significances between the three studies may merely reflect chance variations in the small subject populations. In Study 3, post-hoc tests showed significantly greater power and standard deviations for the alpha and beta variables, consistent with prior studies <xref rid="pone.0044676-Begleiter1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins6" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Ilan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Stenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Thus, the equation generated on EEG data with a weak alcohol effect performed well when applied in the two independent studies with the same BAC level. This suggests that the equation indeed quantified a salient aspect of the neurophysiological effect of alcohol.</p><p>With few exceptions <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, prior EEG research on alcohol effects during cognitive performance has not focused on individual variations in response to alcohol. In the current study, individual differences were assessed by applying the same equation to the data of each of the participants. There was a significant negative correlation between BAC measures and the individual EEG scores in all three studies. While the EEG scores for most individuals were relatively more negative after drinking and relatively more positive in the placebo condition or before drinking, there were individual variations, more so in Study 1. While some of these individual differences are interesting (e.g. the two subjects in Study 2, u01 and u31, with the best driving performance had driving EEG scores that were markedly less affected by alcohol than the group), the small number of subjects precludes further discussion of such findings until further research is undertaken.</p><p>A major concern in measuring brain function from active ambulatory people is loss of data because of unrecoverable contamination due to artifacts. Automated methods for artifact detection and decontamination have improved over the years <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins10" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins13" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044676-Gwin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and are helpful in reducing human labor, improving consistency and recovering some of the data that would otherwise have to be discarded. However, such methods are still far from perfect and it is still essential that all data be subjected to labor-intensive expert manual review. In the current studies, data attrition increased markedly when recording under real world conditions. In Studies 1 and 2 in which participants were seated, stared straight ahead at a video monitor, made constrained limb movements and did not talk, &#x0223c;4% of the data to be analyzed was lost. By contrast, in Study 3, &#x0223c;40% of the data to be analyzed could not be recovered due to artifacts generated by chewing, swallowing, talking and moving around during the cocktail party. Yet, even so, it is encouraging that the majority of the data was valid under such conditions. Future improvements in automated artifact decontamination methods will hopefully produce higher rates of valid data.</p><p>The results reported here are merely a pilot study that helps to establish the feasibility of validly measuring the neurophysiological effects of a psychoactive substance in real world conditions from groups of people simultaneously. We do not wish to attach too much significance to the specific findings. Given the small number of participants, regional cortical effects of alcohol were not examined because the large number of variables produced by including data from each electrode site in the divergence analysis would have produced an unreliable equation that over fitted the data <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins15" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Rather, a global effect on the cerebral cortex was obtained by averaging the data from the individual electrodes. Application of principal components analysis <xref rid="pone.0044676-John1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, statistical pattern recognition methods <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins16" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins17" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, global field power <xref rid="pone.0044676-Lehmann1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044676-Lehmann2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, independent components analysis <xref rid="pone.0044676-Makeig1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, etc. might be more effective. Future studies with larger subject populations might fruitfully explore differential effects on frontal, parietal and other cortical areas, for instance using high resolution EEG methods with many electrodes, spatial deblurring and MRI co-registration <xref rid="pone.0044676-Gevins18" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Amongst the many types of analysis available, the simplest form of spectral analysis into traditional frequency bands was used to parameterize the EEG. The beta band and theta band EEG power variables chosen by the divergence analysis may not be the best measures of alcohol&#x02019;s effect during naturalistic situations. They are merely variables that were most effective in combination when characterizing alcohol effects 30 minutes after drinking during performance of repetitive cognitive tasks in one sample of healthy adults. Other analyses such as, time-frequency analysis, independent component analysis, autoregressive models of various sorts, nonlinear dynamical models, etc. might be more effective.</p><p>Modest though they are, these initial results promisingly suggest that future studies may be able to apply brain function measures of drug effects derived in rigorously controlled laboratory neurocognitive research to groups of people interacting in natural social situations. By doing so, we hope that the effects of alcohol and other drugs on particular aspects of social interaction will be elucidated with a focus on the fine grain structure of interactions between individuals and relationships to varying doses and pharmacodynamics. In addition to advancing basic knowledge, such future research may provide useful information for improving pharmacological treatments of a variety of psychiatric disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Gordon Abraham, Cliff Baum, Zachary Davis, Jamie Elmasu, An Jiang, Aaron Ilan and Emilie Schwager for their help with data collection and analysis, and An Jiang for analysis and software development.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0044676-Hermann1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hermann WM (1982) Electroencephalography in drug research.
