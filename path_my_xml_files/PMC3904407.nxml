Furthermore, the impact on the family of the patient can be high. We designed an intervention called &#x02018;Stand still &#x02026;, and move on&#x02019;, which is a concise, individualised, semi-structured intervention for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers, consisting of between one and six face-to-face consultations provided by a trained nurse. The intervention is directed at early detection of cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information, promotion of self-management and referral to specialised care if necessary. The effectiveness of the intervention is being examined in a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN74835019]. Alongside this trial we performed a process evaluation which aims to investigate the feasibility of the intervention by assessing: 1) the attendance and dose delivered; 2) performance according to protocol; and 3) the opinion of patients, caregivers and nurses on the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants of this process evaluation were 97 patients allocated to the intervention group of the RCT, their 91 caregivers, and six nurses who conducted the intervention. Measurement instruments used were evaluation forms for patients and caregivers, registration and evaluation forms for nurses, and semi-structured interviews with nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-nine of the patients (81%) allocated to the intervention group and 65 caregivers (71%) participated in the intervention. The mean (SD) number of consultations per patient was 1.8 (1.0), and most consultations were conducted at the patients&#x02019; home. The intervention was performed largely according to protocol, except that the intervention usually started later than intended, consultations were longer than expected, and the topic of self-management was not regularly addressed. Patients marked the quality of the intervention with a mean score of 7.5 and the performance of the nurse with an 8.0 out of ten. Overall, the intervention was positively evaluated by patients, caregivers and nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention &#x02018;Stand still &#x02026;, and move on&#x02019; is a promising intervention which was performed largely according to protocol and seems feasible for implementation after some adaptations, if it is found to be effective.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiac arrest</kwd><kwd>Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury</kwd><kwd>Cognitive impairments</kwd><kwd>Emotional impairments</kwd><kwd>Caregiver</kwd><kwd>Nursing intervention</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Surviving a cardiac arrest is a major life event. Persons who survive a cardiac arrest may suffer from hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury due to the temporary cessation of blood circulation in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This can lead to cognitive and emotional impairments, and may affect daily functioning, participation in society and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, a cardiac arrest can have considerable impact on the family and caregivers in terms of psychosocial problems and high perceived care burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In literature only a few aftercare interventions for survivors of cardiac arrest have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We identified two psychosocial interventions that resulted in improved knowledge and reduced physical and emotional symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although these interventions addressed psychosocial topics, they did not include screening for possible cognitive impairments. We have previously shown that cognitive impairments occur in almost fifty percent of the survivors of cardiac arrest and are related to a reduced quality of life, which suggests that early detection of cognitive impairments may be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We therefore developed an early intervention service called &#x02018;Stand still &#x02026;, and move on&#x02019;&#x02009;, which is directed at early detection of cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information on possible consequences of a cardiac arrest, promotion of self-management and referral to specialised care if necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The main goal of this intervention was to improve societal participation and quality of life, and the effect of this intervention is examined in a randomised controlled trial (RCT): &#x02018;Activity and Life After Survival of a Cardiac Arrest&#x02019; (ALASCA) [ISRCTN74835019] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this RCT the intervention group received the new intervention, while the control group received care as usual.</p><p>In the current paper we present the results of the process evaluation of this intervention, which was performed alongside the trial. A process evaluation is a systematic way to monitor the delivery of an intervention and can provide insight into factors that may have influenced the effectiveness of the intervention and can help to understand why an intervention was effective or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We performed this process evaluation prior to analysing the results of the trial, in order to prevent possible bias related to already knowing the effectiveness of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this process evaluation was to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention by assessing: 1) the attendance and dose delivered; 2) performance according to protocol; and 3) the opinion of patients, caregivers and nurses on the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention &#x02018;Stand still &#x02026;, and move on&#x02019; is a concise, individualised, semi-structured intervention, for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The intervention is conducted by trained nurses and consists of between one and six face-to-face consultations, depending on the individual needs of patient and caregiver. The first consultation is planned soon after discharge from hospital, preferably within one month. Both patient and caregiver are invited to the consultations. If the patient has a caregiver who decides to participate, patient and caregiver attend the consultations together. The first consultation has an intended duration of approximately 60 minutes and follow-up sessions are intended to last about 30 minutes. The consultations take place in hospital or at the patients&#x02019; home. Additional consultation by telephone is possible.</p><p>The intervention is designed for the early detection of cognitive and emotional consequences of cardiac arrest and consists of four elements: 1) screening for cognitive and emotional problems; 2) provision of information and support; 3) promotion of self-management strategies; and 4) referral to specialised care if indicated. Below, each element will be described in more detail.</p><p>First, the nurse screens for signs of cognitive impairments in the patient and for possible emotional problems in patient and caregiver by conversation and observation. In addition, the nurse can use one of the following screening instruments: Checklist Cognition and Emotion (CLCE-24) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Cognitive Log (Cog-log) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], Impact of Event Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the Caregiver Strain Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Second, the nurse provides information about possible consequences of cardiac arrest. She also hands out an information booklet that was developed for this intervention. In this information booklet frequently occurring cognitive and emotional problems after cardiac arrest are described, and suggestions for effective coping strategies are provided. In addition, the nurse has a set of brochures from patient organisations on topics such as medication, cardiac treatments, memory problems, fatigue or driving restrictions, which she can offer at indication.</p><p>Third, self-management strategies are promoted. The goal of self-management is to stimulate patients to take responsibility for actions that should give the best quality of life given their possibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Self-management interventions have shown to be effective in several chronic illnesses, including in heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To promote self-management, self-management skills such as problem solving and making action plans can be practiced with the participants if needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the nurse discusses whether referral to specialised care is indicated. Referrals can be made, for example, to a cardiologist in case of cardiac symptoms or concerns, to a neuropsychologist for further cognitive testing and treatment, or to a consultant in rehabilitation medicine to evaluate the need for multi-disciplinary rehabilitation treatment. More details on the rationale and description of the intervention have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The 97 patients eligible for this process evaluation were all survivors of a cardiac arrest who were allocated to the intervention group of the ALASCA trial. Inclusion for the ALASCA trial took place between April 2007 and November 2010. During this period 185 patients were included for the trial at the coronary care units and intensive care units of five hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria for the ALASCA study were: survival more than two weeks after in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, living within 50&#x000a0;km of one of the participating hospitals, age 18 years or older and sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language. Exclusion criteria were a life expectancy lower than 3 months (as evaluated by the treating physician) and living in residential or institutional care prior to the cardiac arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Caregivers</title><p>Ninety-one of the 97 patients in the intervention group had a caregiver. Caregiver was defined as partner, spouse, or other informal caregiver closely related to the patient. There were no additional in- or exclusion criteria for the caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Nurses</title><p>Six nurses undertook the intervention. Prior to the start of the interventions, training was offered to the nurses directed at acquiring skills to detect cognitive and emotional problems and promoting self-management among survivors of cardiac arrest. In addition, once a year a booster session was organised, and throughout the intervention period the nurses could contact a consultant in rehabilitation medicine (JV) for advice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> describes the measurement instruments used in this process evaluation. All patients allocated to the intervention group, who had participated in at least one consultation, received an evaluation form after the last consultation. Also all caregivers who had been present in at least one of the consultations received an evaluation form. Evaluation forms were sent by mail and non-responders received one reminder. The nurses registered the course and contents of the intervention after each consultation on a registration form, and after the last consultation of each patient the nurses filled out an evaluation form. Finally, after completion of the trial the nurses were invited for interviews.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcome measures and measurement instruments of the process evaluation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center"><bold>Evaluation form patient</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Evaluation form caregiver</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Registration form nurse</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Evaluation form nurse</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Interview nurses</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>1.

The most frequently reported weakness was the late start of intervention. A suggestion made by several participants was to add a group session with other patients who survived a cardiac arrest and their caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Opinion nurses</title><p>The nurses considered the intervention useful for most patients (n = 71, 95%) and also for most caregivers (n = 61, 95%). All nurses recommended implementation of the intervention into regular health care. The interviews showed that nurses had different opinions on the optimal number of consultations per patient. Two nurses regarded one consultation sufficient for most patients, while the other two nurses considered it important to see patient and caregiver more frequently. All nurses reported that face-to-face contact was essential and could not be replaced by telephone calls. According to the nurses, home visits were highly appreciated by the patients, but were more time consuming for them due to travel time. The three nurses who had used the Checklist Cognition and Emotion, considered it to be a valuable screening instrument, mainly because it helped to structure the conversation. All nurses mentioned that the information booklet provided useful information for patients and caregivers, which is not present in regular brochures. During the interviews, the nurses explained that they regarded self-management not particularly useful for this patient group on this moment after their cardiac arrest. They considered self-management more suitable for more extensive interventions provided during the chronic phase.</p><p>The main strong aspects of the intervention reported by the nurses were the time, attention and open conversations they had with patients and caregivers. In addition, they valued that the well-being and burden of the caregiver was specifically addressed. The nurses reported that the information they could provide was highly appreciated. According to the nurses, the protocol provided sufficient structure to conduct the intervention and was feasible in most cases. Also, the semi-structured format of the intervention was positively evaluated as this enabled them to tailor the intervention to the individual needs and wishes of patient and caregiver.</p><p>The nurses also reported some weaknesses. Their main comment was that the intervention started too late. Besides, the nurses considered the intervention to be less useful for two groups of patients, namely for patients who experienced no problems at all and for patients that had already started a rehabilitation treatment. A suggestion made by one nurse was to introduce the intervention to patient and family already during hospital admission. As such, patients and family know what they can expect and rely on after discharge from hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Differences between nurses</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> shows how the six nurses performed several aspects of the intervention.

survived a cardiac arrest and we found that most patients and caregivers participated and received on average 1.8 consultations. Nurses followed the protocol in most aspects, but the intervention started later after the event than intended, consultations were longer than expected, and self-management was rarely discussed. Overall, the intervention was positively evaluated by patients, caregivers and nurses.</p><p>The late start of the intervention, on average 90 days after cardiac arrest instead of the intended 1 month after discharge, can be mainly contributed to the design and organisational aspects of the ALASCA trial as, prior to randomisation, patients had to be informed about the trial, give their consent and perform the first measurements for the study. One can question whether the delayed start of the intervention may have influenced its effectiveness. We think that performing the first consultation earlier, that is more according to protocol, will probably increase the effectiveness because potential problems are addressed earlier, which may prevent some of the future negative consequences. Also the evaluations from patients, caregivers and nurses have shown that it is important to reduce this delay, which seems feasible in case of implementation of this intervention outside a scientific trial.</p><p>The duration of most consultations was longer than intended, namely 60 &#x02013; 90 minutes, instead of the intended 60 minutes for first consultations and 30 minutes for subsequent consultations. However, as the number of consultations per patient was lower than we had expected, the total time spent on face-to-face contact was not exceeded.</p><p>The most unexpected deviation from protocol was that the topic of self-management was not frequently addressed: only in 19% of the patients was this topic discussed. Interviews with the nurses revealed that they considered self-management not suitable for this patient group in this phase, which explains why they did not promote it. According to the nurses, the topic of self-management is more appropriate for a later phase, and can be better practised during more extensive interventions. Indeed, most previous studies on self-management have been performed in chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the two effective self-management interventions for survivors of cardiac arrest were much more elaborate and consisted of eight and eleven sessions respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We therefore conclude that it is not feasible to address self-management properly in the current intervention and propose to eliminate it as one of the obligatory elements.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the process evaluation</title><p>A risk in evaluation studies is that participants may tend to give socially desirable answers. We tried to prevent this by providing anonymous evaluations forms to patients and caregivers, and by sending out these forms after the intervention had finished.</p><p>The interviews and evaluation forms for the nurses were not anonymous. To limit the risk that the nurses would provide socially desirable answers, the interviews were administered by a researcher who was not involved in the trial. Moreover, the nurses did not have any formal or personal relationships with the researchers before or after the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Suggestions for implementation</title><p>This process evaluation has shown that the intervention is sufficiently feasible. However, there can be some tension between &#x02018;a flexible intervention&#x02019; and guaranteeing that certain content is sufficiently addressed. The advantage of a flexible intervention is that it can be tailored to the actual needs of the participants and, in case there are no problems or questions, the number of consultations remains limited, which will positively affect the cost-effectiveness. We have noticed structural differences between the nurses with regard to their performance of the intervention, and believe that the feasibility and reproducibility of the intervention can be improved on some aspects by making several of the optional elements of the intervention more obligatory.</p><p>First of all, we suggest offering at least two consultations to all patients. When not taking into account the nurse who had only consulted one patient, the two nurses who consulted patients most frequently also received the highest grades for the intervention and their performance. This suggests that conducting several consultations improves the perceived quality of the intervention.</p><p>Secondly, we advise administering a formal screening instrument to all patients. The nurses that used the Checklist Cognition and Emotion were very positive about it, and previous research in stroke patients also showed that formal screening significantly contributed to the detection of cognitive and emotional problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We think that making such a screening instrument obligatory will secure that &#x02018;screening for cognitive and emotional problems&#x02019; is effectuated in all patients.</p><p>During the trial, most consultations were conducted as home visits. This seemed to be appreciated by the patients, but also demonstrated the disadvantage that it is more time consuming for the nurse. We recommend that home visits should remain possible but suggest combining the consultation with the nurse with regular out-patient consultations with the cardiologist. As such, the extra effort for the patient is limited while it can improve efficiency for the nurse.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the intervention &#x02018;Stand still &#x02026;, and move on&#x02019; is a promising intervention, which seems to be feasible and was positively evaluated by patients, caregivers and nurses. Although the intervention was performed according to protocol on most aspects, we have reported a few deviations and we have made recommendations how to address this in future implementation. If the intervention turns out to be (cost-) effective we recommend implementation in regular health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>VM was the principle investigator on this project.
