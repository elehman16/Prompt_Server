Toward this aim, many institutes use autologous blood storage to perform perioperative transfusions. However, there is no standard timeline for collecting blood for storage. Therefore, the objective of this prospective cohort study was to compare the outcome of two different schedules for collecting autologous blood before operation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria are AIS patients, younger than 20 years old, female, operated between 2009 and 2013 with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation who had 1600 mL autologous blood collected before operation. A total of 61 patients were participated in this study. They were randomly divided into 2 groups based on the storage interval. Weekly group (1W-G) consisted of 30 patients with a total of 1600mL blood collected weekly beginning 4 weeks before the operation. Biweekly group (2W-G) consisted of 31 patients with a total of 1600 mL blood collected biweekly beginning 8 weeks before the operation. The instrumented levels, total bleeding, complications during blood transfusion, and hematological examinations (RBC, Hb, Hct, MCH, MCV, MCHC) were evaluated. A hematological examination was performed before blood collection, before the operation, and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. Vasovagal reflex (VVR) was evaluated as complications during blood drawing.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>Mean age, height, and weight did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in instrumented levels, bleeding during operation, after operation, and collected blood during operation. With the autologous blood, allogeneic blood transfusion was completely avoided. VVR was more frequent in the biweekly group significantly (1W-G 4.2% vs 2W-G 15.3%). In terms of hematological examination, all values showed no significant differences between two groups in the pre-drawing and the pre-operation stage. However, the postoperative Hb and Hct values were higher in the weekly group.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database analysis by Yoshihara [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] demonstrated that 37.9% patients who underwent spinal fusion of more than 9 vertebrae had received some kinds of transfusion during and after operation. We believe that it is very important for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients to avoid perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions to avoid the risk of transmission of chronic infections. Toward this aim, our institute have regularly uses stored autologous blood for perioperative transfusions. Generally, blood collection starts 4 weeks before the operation to match with the time limit of maintaining the quality of citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine 1 (CPDA-1). According to autologous blood transfusion guidelines, the maximum permissible total amount of preoperative autologous blood is 1600 mL. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], There is however, no standardised timeline for collecting blood for storage. We hypothesized that a longer period for collecting autologous blood would allow patients to have sufficient time to recover from the induced anemia preoperatively. To verify our hypothesis, we compared prospectively two different schedules for collecting autologous blood; one was to collect 1600 mL on weekly schedule, and the other was to collect on a biweekly schedule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria of this study were AIS girls younger than 20 years old and operated between 2009 and 2013 with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation.

However, contrary to our hypothesis, the shorter schedule group showed faster recovery from anemia than longer group in this result. Two potential explanations for this phenomenon are the freshness of autologous blood and the behavior of the endogenic erythropoietin. Concerning the freshness of autologous blood, d&#x02019;Almeida reported the viability of stored RBCs of rat and human with CPDA-1 medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They mentioned that post-transfusion viability in rat cells was 79%, 26% and 5% after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of storage respectively and human RBC deformability decreased significantly by 34% after 4 weeks of storage. In our trial, 800 mL of the blood from the biweekly group was older than that of the weekly group. This could lead to an increased amount of lower-viability blood cells in the biweekly group, resulting in lesser effectivc transfusion. Furthermore, improvement of anemia in the weekly group was found to be more rapid than biweekly group. This may be due to better stimulation of endogenic erythropoietin production in the weekly group than in the biweekly group, resulting in quick recovery of the weekly group.</p><p>In addition, biweekly group shows higher incidence of VVR than weekly group. Generally, grade 2 or 3 VVR incidence is reported in less than 1% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Comparing these reports, weekly group whose incidence of VVR (grade2 or 3) was 0.83% Vs the biweekly group of 4.84%.</p><p>There are some limitations in the present prospective study. First, we did not evaluate endogenic erythropoietin and iron concentrations. Secondly, the postoperative follow-up period was 7 days. Finally, although this is the first study of comparing schedule to collect autologous blood prospectively, we compared just only two schedules. Further studies should attempt to investigate further the best schedule to collect autologous blood for AIS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We concluded that a weekly schedule of pre-operative autologous blood storage is better than a biweekly storage schedule in terms of postoperative recovery of anemia and complications.</p><p>This is the extended abstract of IRSSD 2014 program book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and their parents for publication of this paper and any accompanying images.
