The reported effects of allelic variation at this SNP on alcohol-related behaviors, and on opioid receptor antagonist treatments, have been inconsistent. We investigated the pharmacogenetic interaction between A118G variation and the effects of two &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists in a clinical lab setting. Fifty-six overweight and moderate&#x02013;heavy drinkers were prospectively stratified by genotype (29 AA homozygotes, 27 carriers of at least 1 G allele) in a double-blind placebo-controlled, three-period crossover design with naltrexone (NTX; 25&#x02009;mg OD for 2 days, then 50&#x02009;mg OD for 3 days) and GSK1521498 (10&#x02009;mg OD for 5 days). The primary end point was regional brain activation by the contrast between alcohol and neutral tastes measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Secondary end points included other fMRI contrasts, subjective responses to intravenous alcohol challenge, and food intake. GSK1521498 (but not NTX) significantly attenuated fMRI activation by appetitive tastes in the midbrain and amygdala. GSK1521498 (and NTX to a lesser extent) significantly affected self-reported responses to alcohol infusion. Both drugs reduced food intake. Across all end points, there was less robust evidence for significant effects of <italic>OPRM1</italic> allelic variation, or for pharmacogenetic interactions between genotype and drug treatment. These results do not support strong modulatory effects of <italic>OPRM1</italic> genetic variation on opioid receptor antagonist attenuation of alcohol- and food-related behaviors. However, they do support further investigation of GSK1521498 as a potential therapeutic for alcohol use and eating disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The A118G polymorphism in the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor (MOR) gene (<italic>OPRM1</italic>) has attracted much attention as a putative modulator of opioid antagonist treatment response in alcohol use disorders. This single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799971 in exon 1 of <italic>OPRM1</italic> causes an adenine to guanine substitution leading to the replacement of asparagine with aspartic acid at a putative N-glycosylation site (N40D) of the MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although the minor G allele is often thought to result in a gain of function of the MOR, the evidence is equivocal.</p><p>Cellular assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bond <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mague <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramchandani <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) have demonstrated that G allele carriage causes both increased and decreased response to opioid agonists and antagonists. In macaques, the G allele of the C77G <italic>OPRM1</italic> polymorphism was associated with increased <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-endorphin binding affinity, greater alcohol preference and consumption, as well as greater decreases in preference and consumption following naltrexone (NTX) administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2010</xref>).</p><p>In humans, G allele carriage (G&#x0002b;) was associated with greater feelings of intoxication, stimulation, sedation, and happiness following pharmacokinetically controlled alcohol infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ray and Hutchison, 2004</xref>). Heavy G&#x0002b; drinkers had greater approach tendencies for alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiers <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), greater self-reported alcohol craving in a cue reactivity task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van den Wildenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), and greater intravenous self-administration of ethanol than AA homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendershot <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In functional neuroimaging studies, G-carriers had greater brain activation to alcohol taste in reward regions, including the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filbey <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), and reduced frontostriatal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). PET imaging has shown greater striatal dopamine release to intravenous alcohol administration in G-carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramchandani <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, G-carriage had no effects on drinking behavior measured in alcohol-dependent subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) and effects on alcohol-related behaviors were moderated by dopamine transporter genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ray <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; Schacht <italic>et al</italic>, 2013). Even in studies that have reported positive evidence of some phenotypic associations with A118G allelic variation, the results have not been consistent across all the phenotypes measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ray <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Initial findings of better treatment response to NTX in alcohol-dependent G&#x0002b; patients from <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses of clinical trial data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anton <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oslin <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) have not been consistently replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gelernter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Most evidence suggests that the A118G SNP is not a risk factor for alcohol dependence, at least in Caucasian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rouvinen-Lagerstrom <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwantes-An <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>); although there is stronger evidence for this in East Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Greater frequency of the G allele has been reported in obese binge eating disorder (BED) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), and GG homozygous subjects demonstrated higher preference for sweet, fatty foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The G allele has also been associated with a greater dose requirement for opioid analgesia (see the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref> and references therein).</p><p>GSK1521498 is a novel &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ignar <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) with some inverse agonist properties that is being investigated for the treatment of disorders of compulsive consumption of food, alcohol, and drugs. GSK1521498 has been differentiated from NTX in a series of human, animal, and cellular models in terms of its opioid receptor pharmacology, its pharmacokinetics, and its greater pharmacodynamic efficacy on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation by fruit juice, on consumption of food and alcohol, and on behavioral models of drug seeking behavior for heroin, cocaine, and alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ignar <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giuliano <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ripley <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). In humans, GSK1521498 reduced the pleasurable response to high-fat/high-sugar food samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziauddeen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013a</xref>), food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziauddeen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013a</xref>), attentional bias to foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamberlain <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), and fMRI activation by food images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambridge <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). In a 28-day dosing study of patients with obesity and high levels of binge eating behaviors, GSK1521498 did not cause significant placebo-controlled weight loss; however, <italic>post hoc</italic> genetic analysis suggested greater weight loss in the small number of G&#x0002b; patients compared with AA homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziauddeen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013a</xref>).</p><p>In this context, we aimed to assess the effects of allelic variation at the A118G SNP on a range of pharmacodynamic markers of rewarding consumption of alcohol and food, and to explore the potential pharmacogenetic interaction between <italic>OPRM1</italic> genotype and &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonism by both NTX and GSK1521498. We studied healthy overweight moderate&#x02013;heavy drinkers in an experimental medicine study, prospectively balanced to measure genetic and drug effects in a sample comprising approximately equal numbers of AA and G&#x0002b; participants. We predicted (1) that opioid receptor antagonists would attenuate markers of alcohol- and food-related reward processing; (2) that there would be a significant pharmacogenetic interaction between A118G genotype and opioid antagonist drug treatment; and (3) given that G allele enhances opioidergic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ray and Hutchison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramchandani <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filbey <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), we predicted that G carriage would have functionally opposite effects to opioid antagonist drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 56 volunteers (<italic>n</italic>=49 (88&#x00025;) males) aged 18&#x02013;65 years (mean&#x000b1;SD, 44.3&#x000b1;11.1 years) with body mass index &#x02a7e;22&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean 28.9&#x000b1;3.5&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were enrolled after providing written informed consent.

More generally, we used mixed models to estimate the main effects of genotype, treatment, taste, and period; and the two-way interactions between these factors. The main effect of taste was not significant for any ROI, ie, fMRI activation by the alcohol <italic>vs</italic> neutral contrast was not different to activation by the juice <italic>vs</italic> neutral contrast. The main effect of treatment (on both appetitive taste contrasts) was significant in two of the <italic>a priori</italic> anatomically defined ROIs. In both the amygdala and the midbrain, this treatment effect reflected significant attenuation of appetitive activation by GSK1521498 compared with both placebo and NTX; and these pharmacodynamic effects of GSK1521498 were positively correlated with PK measures of peripheral exposure. These results are convergent with prior data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), demonstrating significant attenuation by &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist drugs of amygdala activation by an experimentally very similar juice <italic>vs</italic> neutral contrast; however, the taste stimuli and contrasts tested here are not so directly comparable to the methods of previous studies that have used either fruit juice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filbey <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>) or distilled water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ray <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), as the neutral taste contrasted with alcohol taste. It is important to acknowledge that such pharmacological fMRI signals may be confounded by drug effects on cerebral blood flow; and that these results in a male-dominated sample may not generalize to the pharmacogenetics of <italic>OPRM1</italic> in women. In addition, there is a potential limitation of assessing responses to alcohol in the morning (a time of day not normally associated with nondependent alcohol consumption) and all the fMRI sessions took place in the morning. However, GSK1521498 also demonstrated significant effects on subjective changes on the ARS and SHAS scales following controlled alcohol infusion. On both these measures, GSK1521498 significantly reduced feelings of intoxication and high from, and liking for, alcohol compared with placebo, and on the SHAS scale compared with NTX as well. Both GSK1521498 and NTX significantly reduced feelings of vigor (POMS-B vigor subscale). NTX significantly reduced the experienced stimulating effects of alcohol (BAES stimulant items subscale) as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>There were significant treatment effects on total calories consumed <italic>ad libitum</italic> in a buffet and a snacking paradigm.

The finding that both antagonists significantly increased plasma cortisol concentrations is also consistent with prior data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Avila <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and theory implicating MOR signaling as an inhibitor of ACTH secretion by the pituitary.</p><p>In short, the primary and other end points of the study demonstrate reasonably robust and significant effects of drug treatment. However, the pharmacogenetic interaction was only on the cusp of significance for three of the many end points tested: the anatomical ROI for caudate (<italic>P</italic>=0.05), the functional ROI for amygdala (<italic>P</italic>=0.057), and one of the self-reported questionnaire subscales (POMS-B confusion) in the alcohol infusion experiment (<italic>P</italic>=0.02).</p><p>Two key methodological issues might have detracted from a clearer demonstration of hypothetically predicted effects of the A118G SNP on MOR antagonism. First, we sampled moderate&#x02013;heavy drinkers rather than patients with alcohol dependence. There is some prior evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van den Wildenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiers <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schacht <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) to suggest that the pharmacogenetic interaction of <italic>OPRM1</italic> and opioid receptor antagonist drugs may be greater in alcohol-dependent patients (rather than nondependent, frequent alcohol drinkers). Second, the sample size may have been too small to detect a pharmacogenetic effect. However, the sample size was defined by a prior calculation that predicted 80&#x00025; power to refute the null hypothesis if it was false. We note that our final sample included a larger number of G&#x0002b; participants (27) than several studies that have demonstrated a significant pharmacogenetic interaction with unbalanced genotype groups (Ray and Hutchison, 2004 (23AA, 15G&#x0002b;); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref> (23AA, 20G&#x0002b;); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filbey <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref> (33AA, 11G&#x0002b;)). Two other studies that have more evenly balanced the genotype groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref> (40AA, 43G&#x0002b;); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schacht <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref> (38AA, 36G&#x0002b;)) have not replicated a significant pharmacogenetic interaction. A recent randomized control trial of NTX in 221 alcohol-dependent subjects, which included one of the largest samples of G-carriers in a prospectively designed experiment (82G&#x0002b;), also did not demonstrate a significant pharmacogenetic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oslin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that these data provide further evidence for GSK1521498 as a potential therapeutic for disorders of alcohol or food consumption.

In each treatment period, participants were admitted to the GSK Clinical Unit Cambridge (CUC) on day 1 for an overnight stay. They underwent safety assessments, routine blood tests, and received their first dose (GSK1521498 10&#x02009;mg, NTX 25&#x02009;mg, or placebo). On day 2, participants received their second dose, repeated safety assessments, and were discharged with medication doses for days 3 and 4. They returned to the CUC on the afternoon of day 4 and underwent pain threshold assessments, an intravenous alcohol infusion challenge, and were served a buffet dinner. After an overnight fast, they received their final dose on day 5, then underwent fMRI scanning followed by hedonic taste response tests and an <italic>ad libitum</italic> snacking paradigm. Participants were discharged at the end of day 5 after final safety assessments. Participants attended a follow-up assessment 7&#x02013;10 days after completion of the final washout period.
