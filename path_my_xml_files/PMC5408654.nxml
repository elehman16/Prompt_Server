The aim of the present study was to illuminate mechanisms of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root treatment on AF. In the present study, 60 AF patients after surgery were randomly divided into two groups, external applied with or without the <italic>D. genkwa</italic> extractive. Wound healing times were compared and granulation tissues were collected. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we constructed damaged human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) with the treatment of <italic>TNF-&#x003b1;</italic> (10 &#x003bc;g/ml). Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the effects of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root extractive on cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis of damaged HSFs. Furthermore, protein levels of <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;, COL1A1, COL3A1, Timp-1</italic>, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 (<italic>MMP-3</italic>) and <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> signalling pathways were investigated both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.

This disease mostly occurs in male patients and can be ascribed to excessive secretion of sex hormone [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, surgery is the standard treatment, but it remains controversial to be an effective therapy for some potential risk factors, such as internal open wound, prolonged wound healing and susceptible infection [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great necessity to shorten the wound healing time and repair contaminated wounds after operation.</p><p>It has been reported that the basic pathology and physiology of wound healing includes three stages, including local inflammation response, cell proliferation and granulation tissue formation and tissue reconstruction, which determined the time and quality of wound healing [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The complex healing process consisted of interaction of structural protein, growth factors and protein kinase, as well as consequence of repaired cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis etc. [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among these, granulation tissues played a crucial role in the process of wound healing. As the main cellular constituents of granulation tissues, fibroblast cells could regulate reparative process by secreting a variety of types of cytokines [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>Daphne genkwa</italic> is a medicinal plant widely distributed in Yellow and Yangtze Rivers regions in China, which has already been used as traditional agent for anti-inflammation, tranquilization, analgesia and anticonvulsion [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the root of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> constituted the majority of the secondary metabolites including flavonoids, coumarins and diterpenoids [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous studies presented that total flavonoids from the root of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> possessed profiles of anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], immunomodulatory [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], analgesic [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and even antitumour activities [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the function of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root on wound healing after operation in patients with AF remains unclear. Thus, the potential mechanism and activity of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root need to be ascertained.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of human skin fibroblasts (HSFs), as well as the mechanism underlying the biological functions.

The operation line in the experimental group was presoaked in the roots extract of<italic> D. genkwa</italic> (boiled) and the root extract was also applied outside the wound site. The operation line boiled with the extract followed the way of traditional Chinese medicine. <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root has been reported to possess antitumour and anti-inflammatory activities, but its effects on wound healing remain largely unknown. The key finding of the present study was the root extractives of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> could promote wounding healing by accelerating granulation tissue formation and facilitating fibroblast cell proliferation via multiple signalling pathways. These results suggested that <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root functioned as a positive factor during the wound healing process.</p><p>Further investigation indicated that the root extractives of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> elevated the expressions of type I collagen (<italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic>)<italic>, TIMP-1, c-fos</italic> and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> at mRNA and protein levels in granulation tissues and fibroblast cells. As we all know, ECM was involved in directing epithelial cell functions [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a major structural component of ECM, type I collagen played an important role in remodelling ECM microenvironment [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our results, up-regulation of <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> showed <italic>D. genkwa</italic> might enhance the function of ECM by regulating type I collagen. Activating protein-1 (<italic>AP-1</italic>) mainly participated in JNK stress pathway via the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>c-fos</italic> has been identified as a major component of <italic>AP-1</italic> complex and implicated in signal transduction, cell proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, mouse fibroblast cell lines deficient in <italic>c-fos</italic> was found to be more sensitive to radiation by which cell apoptosis was intensified [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also observed <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> was up-regulated by the root extractives of <italic>D. genkwa</italic>, which was closely associated with cell cycle at G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in fibroblast cells. As evidence showed that the induction of G<sub>1</sub>/S-phase arrest was engaged with cell apoptosis, our data validated that <italic>D. genkwa</italic> promoted the cell proliferation via inhibiting the arrests of cells at G<sub>1</sub> /S-phase. It has been demonstrated that <italic>MMPs</italic> belonged to a family of metal-dependent proteolytic enzymes that degraded the ECM components and participated in bone remodelling, wound healing and apoptosis [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <italic>Timps</italic> were specific inhibitors of <italic>MMPs</italic> and there was a balance among them [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In agreement with the evidence, our result indicated that <italic>D. genkwa</italic> significantly elevated the expression of <italic>Timp-1</italic>, but reduced the expression of <italic>MMP-3</italic>, which had a significant effect on wound healing.</p><p>We found <italic>D. genkwa</italic> elevated phosphorylation levels of <italic>MEK/ERK</italic>. Previous study showed that the classic <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> pathway was a key signal transduction component of cell proliferation in many cells, which contains a cascade of protein kinases: <italic>MEK</italic> and <italic>ERK</italic> [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Activation of <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> signalling pathway has been shown to contribute to cell growth, invasion and EMT [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These data further support our results that activation of <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> pathway was required for <italic>D. genkwa</italic> stimulated cell proliferation in granulation tissues as well as the growth of fibroblast cells. Interestingly, the total expressions of <italic>MEK</italic> and <italic>ERK</italic> were also elevated. For we cannot exclude difference of the total <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> of the clinical samples detected by WB, we will further analyse the effective components of the extract, and it is more appropriate to determine the mechanism of activation of <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> pathway with the monomer. However, in the present study, we additionally built damaged cell model of HSF and also determined the effects of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> on these damaged cells. Consistently, we found <italic>D. genkwa</italic> could effectively protect cells against the damage of <italic>TNF-&#x003b1;</italic> and reverse the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, via activating <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> signalling pathways and ECM components. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root played a crucial role in wound healing via protecting granulation tissues and fibroblast cells. We also found the function of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root in wound healing had a close relation with ECM components and <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> signalling pathway. The extracts induced the expression of <italic>Timp-1</italic> protein and inhibited the degradation of extracellular collagen by MMP. The deposition of collagen itself was also considered as the manifestation of wound healing, along with the activation of <italic>MEK/ERK</italic> signalling pathway in the promotion of skin fibroblast proliferation, which together facilitated the fibrosis of wound healing and led to wound closure.</p><p>As the difference of treatment between AF wound and ordinary wound was the source of infection, the wound healing difficulty of AF was mainly due to contamination of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in faeces. However, the specific bacteriostatic effect of the extracts needs to be further investigated. Besides, the clinical value of these findings requires to be evaluated before <italic>D. genkwa</italic> root was applied to shorten the period of wound healing in patients with AFs.
