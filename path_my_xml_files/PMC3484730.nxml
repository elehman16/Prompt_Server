Haemodiafiltration (HDF) has been shown to be able to reduce the incidence of IDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, crossover international study focussed on a variant of traditional HDF, haemofiltration with endogenous reinfusion (HFR). After a 1-month run-in period on HFR, the patients were randomized to two treatments of 2 months duration: HFR (Period A) or HFR-Aequilibrium (Period B), followed by a 1-month HFR wash-out period and then switched to the other treatment. HFR-Aequilibrium (HFR-Aeq) is an evolution of the haemofiltration with endogenous reinfusion (HFR) dialysis therapy, with dialysate sodium concentration and ultrafiltration rate profiles elaborated by an automated procedure. The primary end point was the frequency of IDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Symptomatic hypotension episodes were significantly lower on HFR-Aeq versus HFR (23 &#x000b1; 3 versus 31 &#x000b1; 4% of sessions, respectively, P l= l0.03), as was the per cent of clinical interventions (17 &#x000b1; 3% of sessions with almost one intervention on HFR-Aeq versus 22 &#x000b1; 2% on HFR, P &#x0003c;0.01). In a post-hoc analysis, the effect of HFR-Aeq was greater on more unstable patients (35 &#x000b1; 3% of sessions with hypotension on HFR-Aeq versus 71 &#x000b1; 3% on HFR, P &#x0003c;0.001). No clinical or biochemical signs of Na/water overload were registered during the treatment with HFR-Aeq.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>HFR-Aeq, a profiled dialysis supported by the Natrium sensor for the pre-dialysis Na<sup>+</sup> measure, can significantly reduce the burden of IDH.

IDH not only interferes with the delivery of an adequate dialysis dose but also causes a critical hypoperfusion of the cerebral, cardiovascular and mesenteric districts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C7">7</xref>]. Therefore, reducing the frequency of IDH is of paramount importance to improve patients' quality of life and possibly general outcomes.</p><p>It has recently been demonstrated in a randomized control trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C8">8</xref>] that online haemodiafiltration (HDF) and, to a lesser extent, online haemofiltration significantly reduced the frequency of IDH in comparison with standard low-flux HD. The adjusted relative risk reduction of IDH was 54% in patients randomized to HDF in comparison with low-flux dialysis.</p><p>The commonest cause of IDH is an ultrafiltration rate that exceeds an adequate plasma refilling rate, thus reducing plasma volume to a critical level. During the first 2 h of treatment, there is a marked fall in plasma osmolality mainly due to the reduction of urea and to a lesser extent of sodium and other small electrolytes. Thus, it is not surprising that sodium profiling represents one of the most investigated approaches to the IDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C9">9</xref>]. Tailored approaches, based on the biofeedback core concept, have been also developed to further counteract the frequency of IDH.</p><p>The difficulties in the realization of a correct intradialytic sodium mass balances have led to a decline in everyday clinical practice the use of sodium profiling. Col&#x000ec; <italic>et al.</italic> developed a new mathematical model of sodium profiling, named &#x02018;Profiler&#x02019;, in order to predict the intradialytic sodium removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C13">13</xref>]. The model takes into account blood flow, pre-dialysis plasma sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and urea concentration, creating coupled ultrafiltration and sodium conductivity profiles in order to achieve the planned weight loss (WL) and reach the desired target post-dialysis plasma sodium concentration. This approach was implemented in clinical practice by coupling the Profiler kinetic model with the haemodiafiltration with endogenous reinfusion (HFR) extracorporeal technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C14">14</xref>] realizing the so-called HFR-Aequilibrium (HFR Aeq). Col&#x000ec; <italic>et al.</italic> found a significant reduction of the number of sessions complicated by hypotension by applying this kinetic model to HD in an open-loop system named automated adaptive system dialysis (AASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C15">15</xref>]. The incidence of other disequilibrium syndrome symptoms was also lower on AASD.</p><p>The aim of the present randomized controlled multinational trial was to evaluate the impact of HFR-Aeq (sodium profiling) in comparison with the standard (no sodium profiling) HFR technique on the overall and cardiovascular intradialytic stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="gfs091_s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="gfs091_s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Aequilibrium International Multicentric Study (AIMS) is a prospective, multicentric multinational randomized crossover study.

The first one is a convective chamber (high-flux high permeability polyphenylene membrane) in which the ultrafiltration of patient's plasma water (the ultrafiltrate) is regenerated through a resin cartridge inserted into the ultrafiltration circuit. This regenerated ultrafiltrate is reinfused into the bloodstream before the second diffusive chamber (low-flux low permeability polyphenylene membrane), in which standard HD process takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="gfs091_s2e"><title>Intervention treatment (HFR-Aequilibrium)</title><p>The patient's plasma sodium concentration was estimated on the available pre-resin ultrafiltrate by means of a conductivity cell sensor as a surrogate for sodium cell sensor (Natrium sensor).

However, in order to avoid the hypotension occurrence, the patients with IDH are treated in everyday clinical practice with standard HD on higher and constant dialysate sodium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C24">24</xref>]. The major drawback of this approach is the possible lower than needed sodium removal, which can lead to hypertension and pulmonary oedema, because the intradialytic sodium balance is not taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the last 20 years, the mathematical modelling of sodium kinetics has been developed and validated in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C14">14</xref>]. Even if nowadays there are technological premises to simplify the daily use of profiling, their routine application is still scarce.</p><p>Over the years, the complexity of mathematical model has been progressively tuned down and the setting requires just a few minutes at the beginning of every treatment. The core concept was to start the treatment with a high dialysate sodium concentration to curb the drop in plasma osmolarity and then to reduce it towards the end to avoid thirst, the consequent large interdialytic BW increase and the risk of acute and/or chronic congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C27">27</xref>] by achieving a zero sodium mass balance.</p><p>During HFR-Aeq period for both arms AB and BA, SBP and DBP were more stable on significantly higher values, during the last treatment hour, but clinically modest and still in the acceptable range of values. Apparently, no additional stress on the cardiovascular system was observed during HFR-Aeq, as suggested by the fact that the HR did not vary significantly.</p><p>Moreover, pre- and post-dialysis plasma sodium concentrations were continuously monitored during the entire experimental sessions by using the conductivity as a surrogate. From the run-in to the wash-out period to the end of the trial for both A and B periods, a non-significant increase of plasma sodium concentration from 138.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 to 139.4 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/L was registered.</p><p>As reported above, the peculiar sorbent cartridge of the HFR treatment does not adsorb sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarbonate and urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C16">16</xref>]. This suggests that only convection and diffusion are fully accounted for the electrolytes mass balances, as in standard HD. There were neither statistical nor clinical significant variations of both BW and WL and, consequently, the better cardiovascular stability in HFR-Aeq seemed not to be due to a dialysis-induced hypervolaemia. The anti-hypertensive therapy did not show any significant variation during the study follow-up further, supporting this hypothesis.</p><p>In addition to the water and sodium balance, HFR-Aeq has shown to be effective in the reduction of intradialytic symptoms.</p><p>The better effect on the cardiovascular tolerance was further supported by the number of interventions made by the nurses during the sessions. A marked reduction of saline infusions, stop UF and premature interruption of the treatment due to IDH was obtained during the profiled period. These data were confirmed by the contingency tables analysis: during HFR-Aeq periods, a more than &#x02212;30% relative risk reduction of any intervention due to hypotension occurrence was observed. Adding up these positive confirmations, the better clinical tolerance was noted during the standard HFR period for the arm BA patients.</p><p>This study has both weaknesses and strengths. One of its strengths is that it is a primary analysis of a randomized control multicentric multinational study, thus the general applicability of the result is very high. Another strength is the crossover study design and the prospective 2-month run-in period before the experimental phase, heavily reducing the interpatient variability. Moreover, the enrolled patients were well dialysed, treated with HFR and with a low level of inflammation. The difficulty of demonstrating the positive effect of any kind of experimental treatment under optimal conditions of the control group is well known. As far as the weaknesses of the study are concerned, we would like to underline that, despite the relative small number of the enrolled patients, the power of this study is mainly dependant on its crossover design, thus as underlined above, dramatically reducing interpatients variability. As far as selecting online HDF as an option for the control treatment, the prominent presence of infusion flow with online HDF would have largely altered the electrolytes and thermal balances. On the other hand, the clinical efficacy of the &#x02018;Profiler&#x02019; in HD had already been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GFS091C15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, the blood pressure behaviour during 24 h and bioimpedentiometry measures were not collected as well as the evaluation of patient's quality of life.</p><p>In conclusion, the application of HFR-Aeq further improved the intradialytic tolerance in comparison with standard HFR and did not induce any risk of sodium and water overload during the whole study follow-up. These positive findings may have an important clinical impact, considering the relevance of hypotension for both patient well-being and life expectancy and for the related increase in workload of the nurses in the daily management of dialysis patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by an unrestricted grant from Bellco.
