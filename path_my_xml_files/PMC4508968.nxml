However, to date, only limited data from randomized trials support its efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The efficacy and safety of corneal cross-linking for halting progression of keratoconus were investigated in a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled, multicentre trial. Twenty-nine keratoconus patients were randomized in three trial centres. The mean age at inclusion was 28&#x000a0;years. Longitudinal changes in corneal refraction were assessed by linear regression. The best corrected visual acuity, surface defects and corneal inflammation were also assessed.

The genetic and environmental contributions to the pathogenesis of keratoconus remain controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, associations with genetic disorders like Down&#x02019;s syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and influences of atopic dermatitis and eye rubbing have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Keratoconus usually starts during adolescence and progresses until the third or fourth decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The CLEK (Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus) Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed a mean change in flatter keratometry readings of 1.6 dioptres in the natural course of keratoconus progression over an eight year period, where higher rates of progression occurred in younger than in older patients. Furthermore, an increase of more than 3 dioptres in spherical equivalent was observed in 24.1&#x000a0;% of patients with risk factors for high progression, such as young age and poor high-contrast visual acuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The intention of the corneal cross-linking (CXL) procedure using riboflavin is to halt the progression of keratoconus. The induction of covalent molecular cross-links in corneal tissue using riboflavin and UVA-Radiation was first described by Spoerl et al. in porcine corneas in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In vitro experiments have since shown that CXL leads to changes in the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the collagen fibre diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the resistance to enzymatic digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the corneal thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, apoptosis and loss of keratocytes have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The method was clinically introduced in 2003 with a non-randomized pilot study in 22 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this prospective pilot study, Wollensak et al. reported a halt in the progression in all treated eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since then, many more non-randomized studies, case series or cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have demonstrated similar results, with the largest trial being that of Raiskup-Wolf et al., which included 241 eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Four promising randomized controlled trials of corneal cross-linking were performed in the past. Wittig-Silva et al. first published interim results of an Australian trial in 2008 which showed a stabilization of all treated eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The final results with 46 patients in the treatment group and 48 patients in the control group demonstrated an improvement in maximal keratometric power (Kmax) and visual acuity in the treated patients, while the untreated patients showed further keratoconus progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A second randomized controlled trial performed by Hersh et al. included eyes with keratoconus and post-lasik ectasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as well as a sham treatment group that received corneal cross-linking after three months. All patients were aware of their randomly assigned groups. An improvement in uncorrected and corrected visual acuity, as well as the topographic measurements was reported in the treatment group. After one-year follow-up, an overall improvement in corneal shape was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A third randomized controlled study, conducted by O&#x02019;Brart in 24 patients, demonstrated an improvement in in corrected visual acuity, Orbscan simulated and keratometry simulated astigmatism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The control group consisted of the fellow eyes. Sharma et al. performed the fourth study&#x02014;a prospective randomized controlled trial in an Asian population with a total of 43 patients. A decrease was observed in the maximum and minimum keratometry in the cross-linking group in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The safety of cross-linking has also been assessed in various trials. The removal of the epithelium can lead to the occurrence of bacterial keratitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], corneal melting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], haze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], corneal endothelial loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and even calcific band keratopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A study by Greenstein et al. described an increase in haze up to three months after treatment, followed by a decrease up to month 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Koller et al. described an overall complication rate of 2.9&#x000a0;% in a prospective trial and identified risk factors such as patient age of more than 35&#x000a0;years and a visual acuity better than 20/25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of corneal cross-linking has been suggested by different authors, but clear proof of a therapeutic effect is not available through a placebo-controlled study with an independent control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of corneal cross-linking with riboflavin in halting the progression of keratoconus by conducting a placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded, multicentric clinical trial that included an independent control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed at three university eye hospitals&#x02014;in Freiburg, Munich and W&#x000fc;rzburg&#x02014;and was registered at cliniclatrials.gov (NCT00626717). Ethics Committee approval was obtained at Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich and University Hospital W&#x000fc;rzburg. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient, or in case of minors, from the parent or legal guardian. Research adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria for this study were keratoconus at an early stage, defined as correction of refractive error possible with spectacles or contact lenses. The progression had to be either proven by measurement of the corneal topography (an increase of more than 1 dioptre in Kmax within one year) or by a clinically significant change in refraction. The change in refraction was defined as a change in spectacle correction or change in contact lens parameters. Exclusion criteria were patient age under 12&#x000a0;years, corneal thickness below 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, further pre-existing ocular diseases, prior ocular surgery, pregnancy and allergy to riboflavin. Written informed consent was obtained prior to participation.</p><p>The initial examination included best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy and assessment of corneal topography with the Orbscan II system (Bausch &#x00026; Lomb) at the Freiburg centre or with the Pentacam (OCULUS Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH) at the Munich and W&#x000fc;rzburg centres. The change in keratometric corneal refraction was the primary evaluation and every measurement on each patient was done using the same topography system; consequently, we only assessed the longitudinal changes. Systematic errors due to the keratometry measurements by different systems are therefore unlikely. Computerized randomization was performed at the coordinating centre in Freiburg. Randomization was stratified by centre and the randomizations were submitted via fax. The patients were either randomized to the treatment or the placebo group. On the same day, the worse eye was treated either with a standard CXL protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or with a sham procedure. The worse eye was defined as the eye with a greater progression, or steeper K-values in case of equal progression in both eyes. The CXL was performed according to an established protocol, as follows: corneal epithelial removal, 0.1&#x000a0;% riboflavin eye drops (MedioCROSS H Riboflavin&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0,1&#x000a0;%, Medio-Haus Medizinprodukte GmbH, Kiel) every two minutes for 30&#x000a0;min, and UVA 370&#x000a0;nm at 3&#x000a0;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 30&#x000a0;min with continued application of 0.1&#x000a0;% riboflavin eye drops every two minutes. The sham procedure consisted of application of fluorescein eye drops every two minutes for 30&#x000a0;min, radiation with visible blue light for 30&#x000a0;min and no epithelial removal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Postoperative slit-lamp examinations were scheduled at days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after the intervention. Examinations included best corrected visual acuity and slit lamp examination, as well as ophthalmoscopy and corneal topography. Topography assessment was repeated three times each visit and the averaged K-values were entered into the case report forms. Examination was performed on days 14, 30 and 90 as well as months 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 post intervention.</p><p>The controls were easily identifiable during the first 4 visits since the epithelium was not removed. Therefore, a second examiner, who had not participated in the treatment or the first examinations, took over follow-up examinations from the 5<sup>th</sup> visit on to achieve a blinding of the examiner. The patients were informed about possible symptoms of dry eye and pain due to epithelial removal. However, patients were not informed about the connection of these symptoms with the placebo or CXL treatment. The patients therefore were not fully aware of their assignment to the placebo or CXL group. The use of contact lenses was not restricted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Clinical endpoints and statistics</title><p>The primary end-point was progression of keratoconus. An increase of 1 dioptre per year in patients younger than 20&#x000a0;years and an increase of 0.2 dioptres per year in the complete cohort was considered as progression according to the data of the natural course of the disease from the CLEK Study. This was measured by the longitudinal change in keratometric corneal refraction (maximum simulated K-readings) and calculated by linear regression over the steeper K-readings plotted against follow-up time for each patient. Sample size was calculated to ensure detection of a halting of the spontaneous progression rate from the CLEK study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According to the CLEK study, we assumed a progression risk of 30&#x000a0;% within two years. A one-year recruiting time and minimum follow up of two years were expected. A two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test power calculation estimated a statistical power of 80&#x000a0;% with a total sample size of 65 patients per group. Unfortunately, this was not achieved, since most candidates were either non-progressive or reluctant to undergo randomization. Therefore, we closed the trial after recruitment of 30 patients. As secondary endpoints, we also assessed the minimal simulated K-readings, the central corneal thickness, worsening of best corrected visual acuity and the occurrence of further adverse events. The trial was originally analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Because we did not stratify randomization for age in the protocol, we opted for a multiple linear regression model with group assignment and age at inclusion to control for these potential confounders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The consort chart is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

In the placebo group, three eyes developed epithelial defects after the intervention probably due to drying of the ocular surface despite intensive eye drop application during the process.

The patients were increasingly unwilling to be randomized against sham procedures. We eventually had to terminate the recruitment period after recruitment stalled. For this reason, our study includes only 30 patients and not the anticipated number of 120. However, we strongly believe that our results are of interest because equally-sized unbiased data can no longer be collected these days.</p><p>This is one of the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of riboflavin CXL to halt keratoconus progression. The control group underwent a sham procedure and did not comprise the fellow eyes of the treated patients. This is especially important since keratoconus is an asymmetric disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The study reported by O&#x02019;Brart et al. used a control group without sham treatment, consisting of the fellow eye of the 24 study patients. Randomization was performed to account for asymmetric progression. Only three eyes of 24 in the control group showed a slight deterioration in the investigated parameters and the majority of the untreated eyes remained stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Intra-individual controls, without sham treatment or blinding, were also used by Wittig-Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], whose data showed stabilization of all treated eyes compared to progression in the fellow eyes. The trial by Hersh et al. included a control group that underwent a sham procedure. The patients were aware of their assigned group. Keratoconus in this group remained stable and no significant changes were noted in any of the investigated corneal indices or in best corrected visual acuity. However, a crossover to the treatment group was performed three months after placebo treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This group also showed no significant changes in corneal indices or best corrected visual acuity at the time of conversion. A trial by Sharma et al. included a control group with a sham procedure. Epithelial debridement was also performed in the sham group. Similar to our study, this trial showed a significant decrease in Kmax in the cross-linking group. Additional confocal analysis of the epithelial healing and the regeneration of the sub epithelial plexus was performed in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Blinding the patients in the present study was challenging due to its design. Patients of the CXL arm were more likely to suffer from postoperative pain in comparison to the controls. To address this, we educated all patients that postoperative pain can occur but not at a 100&#x000a0;% rate. Nevertheless, we cannot fully rule out that some patients were possibly aware of their treatment arm. Our opinion, however, is that this did not introduce any systematic bias.</p><p>Despite its low power, the study also confirms that CXL can significantly alter the steepening of the topographic K-readings in keratoconus patients, since the overall maximum K-reading decreased by 0.35 +/&#x02212; 0.58 dioptres per year. This finding was adjusted for age, a well-known risk factor for progression of keratoconus. However, four of the 15 patients in the treatment group showed an increase in Kmax from 0.02 to 0.32 dioptres per year. The age of these patients ranged from 19 to 38&#x000a0;years. Six of 14 patients in the control group showed no steepening of any kind in their corneal topographies. Moreover, the remaining eight patients in this group all suffered only from a mild to moderate steepening of the topographic K-readings, so that only two of the controls finally fulfilled our criteria for the progression of keratoconus. Incidentally, one of these two patients had the highest slope and by far the highest simulated maximum K-reading of more than 65 dioptres. Since this patient was assigned to the control group, this might represent a bias in our study. However, omission of this patient from the statistical analysis still reveals a significant difference between both groups (data not shown).</p><p>In the treatment group, four patients showed a slight steepening of their corneal topographies. One of these patients fulfilled our criteria for the progression of keratoconus. The reason why only a few of the control patients maintained progression during the course of the trial might be that, according to the protocol, the progression required for inclusion did not have to be proven by keratometry. Another possible explanation is that the noise of the tomography system that may render the detection signs of progression impossible, especially in patients with higher K-values or irregularities of the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] or after use of contact lenses. We sought to counteract this potential error by repeating the measurements on each visit. Nevertheless, a small inaccuracy of the keratometric K-readings cannot be fully ruled out. The recent consensus states that the progression of keratoconus is best evaluated with additional thickness and posterior keratometric data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; however, this had not been established at the time of preparation of the study protocol.</p><p>Some of the patients may have had a progression rate that was lower than estimated. This limitation of our study may be due to the fact that the patients did not require a proven keratometric progression for enrolment in the trial.</p><p>Not all enrolled patients had documented objective progression. We therefore characterized this subgroup to rule out confounding from this factor. Fifteen patients were enrolled with objective documented progression, whereas 14 patients only had subjective worsening. Of those 14 patients, eight were in the treatment and six were in the placebo group. The difference in slope of Kmax was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47) between the patients with objective progression before recruitment (&#x02212;0.22 +/&#x02212; 0.57 dioptres per year) and the patients with subjective worsening (&#x02212;0.03 +/&#x02212;0.67 dioptres per year). We added this possible confounder to the multiple linear regression model. This factor missed statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39) and the treatment effect remained statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02).</p><p>The patient age may also account for the low progression rate observed in the study, especially since nine patients were above 30&#x000a0;years of age. This age group has been shown to have only subtle changes in keratometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, this was also true for the treatment group as a principle of randomization. The low rate of progression is incidentally concordant with the CLEK Study and other CXL trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, our study found a slight, but statistically significant, superiority of CXL over placebo treatment regarding the change in corneal topography. This agrees with the findings of the other prospective trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The absence of progression in many untreated patients emphasises the need for careful selection of suitable patients in order to prevent overtreatment.</p><p>Since three patients were lost to follow-up, a higher incidence of progression cannot be fully ruled out.</p><p>The change in visual acuity did not show a statistically significant difference between the control and treatment group. Even though the cross-linking group experienced more haze, this obviously did not impair the visual acuity of the patients, as also found by Greenstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The occurrence of haze after corneal cross-linking has been described by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The decrease in haze over a period of several months to years is also confirmed. Three patients had remaining haze three years after corneal cross-linking, but none of these patients suffered any visual loss in comparison to their vision before treatment. The absence of other more severe complications shows that corneal cross-linking is a safe therapeutic option for keratoconus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our randomized trial confirms a beneficial effect of CXL with riboflavin and UVA radiation as a treatment for progressive keratoconus that halts the changes in corneal topography. We also found that some patients show no worsening or progression of any kind, even without treatment, and we observed a slight steepening in maximum K-readings despite CXL. The number of patients needing treatment may therefore be higher than expected. Some patients might receive an overtreatment if corneal cross-linking was performed and CXL seems to be less effective in some patients than in others. Therefore, in the future, we need to determine the clinical parameters that will allow for a distinction of keratoconus patients who will benefit from the treatment and the ones who will not.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CLEK</term><def><p>Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CXL</term><def><p>Riboflavin corneal cross-linking</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Kmax</term><def><p>Maximal keratometric power</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors have made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data.
