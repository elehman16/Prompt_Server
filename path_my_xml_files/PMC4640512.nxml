HIV has been identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within weeks after infection and is associated with CNS immune activation and inflammation measured by brain imaging and CSF examination [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the absence of early treatment, alterations in blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity as measured by plasma-CSF albumin ratio, and elevated CSF activation markers are noted within the first year prior among individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Early treatment may be protective. Neurofilament light chain (NFL), a marker of neuronal injury, is elevated during primary (up to one year post exposure) but not acute HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In primary HIV, NFL correlates to an array of toxic markers including CSF neopterin and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Whether additional benefit is seen when standard combination ART (cART) is intensified with an integrase inhibitor and a CCR5 antagonist during acute HIV is not known [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most publications related to cART intensification strategies have focused on chronic HIV stages and typically evaluate only systemic outcomes.</p><p>CCR5 antagonists are particularly important to examine during early infection because they have been shown to block entry of virus into cells with CCR5 receptors, including monocytes, a cell type that is tightly linked to CNS outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In one macaque model study (n = 6), treatment with maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, was associated with reduced brain SIV RNA, DNA, and monocyte activation markers when compared to 22 historic untreated controls [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrate inhibition of monocyte chemotaxis in response to a CCR5 antagonist, providing an additional potential mechanism for neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Clinical CNS benefits have been demonstrated in pilot studies of CCR5 antagonists when initiated during chronic HIV. A small case series of six individuals with neurological symptoms noted improvement in 5 out of 6 individuals whose treatment was intensified with maraviroc [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During chronic infection, HIV DNA burden in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) enriched with CD14+ (i.e., monocytes) has been linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and brain inflammation, both of which decline with maraviroc intensification [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this single arm study of maraviroc intensification (n = 12), participants experienced concurrent neuropsychological testing improvement.</p><p>Raltegravir blocks the pre-integration complex&#x02019;s ability to bind to host DNA, resulting in a nonintegrated proviral HIV DNA that is rendered inactive [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One potential benefit of adding an integrase inhibitor to cART relates to maximizing the suppression of viral replication and reducing immune activation including T-cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A small randomized study of raltegravir intensification failed to identify benefit on CSF immune activation markers or HIV RNA; however, participants had low levels of these disease markers at enrollment. A pooled investigation (n = 453) noted raltegravir-associated CNS toxicities in 10% of participants and linked these toxicities to concomitant use of medications that increase raltegravir blood levels [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both maraviroc and raltegravir have moderate-to-good CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE) ratings and are therefore likely active in CNS during these studies [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The current study was designed to investigate CNS-relevant outcomes of cART intensification when initiated during the earliest stages of acute HIV-1 infection, Fiebig stages I-V [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

As previously described, participants were identified from a voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) clinic at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre. [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] All were confirmed to have acute HIV (Fiebig stages I-V). One participant with marked CSF pleocytosis and a positive serum syphilis test (i.e. possible neurosyphilis) was excluded from this analysis. HIV-uninfected Thai participants of similar age and gender underwent one-time neurological characterization including brain imaging (n = 28) and CSF sampling (n = 18) using the same processing algorithms and MRI/MRS prescription applied to HIV-infected participants. Normative neuropsychological data were available from over 500 healthy Thais. [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Neurological characterization occurred at baseline (i.e., week 0, pre-cART) and included MRI/MRS, lumbar puncture (LP), neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, and sampling for plasma markers. Optional CSF sampling was conducted for 27 and 22 participants at 0 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. All other measures were repeated at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The expedited pre-cART evaluations were typically completed within 48 hours; thus, more than 95% of cases initiated randomized therapy within three days of identification.</p><p>All participants signed written informed consents approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), Chulalongkorn University, Yale, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). These same Institutional Review Boards also approved this study. Patient records and information were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Intervention</title><p>Initial treatment consisted of efavirenz (EFV), tenofovir (TDF), and emtricitabine (FTC) in both arms with lamivudine (3TC) used interchangeably for FTC depending on availability. Raltegravir (RAL) and maraviroc (MVC) were added for the cART+ arm. In the cART only arm, participants who were intolerant to EFV (n = 2) or who had EFV resistance (n = 1) were switched to RAL whereas EFV was simply discontinued in the cART+ arm for those intolerant (n = 6) or resistant (n = 1). There were no MVC reassignments in either group.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Neuropsychological characterization</title><p>Trained nurse-psychometrists conducted a four-item neuropsychological testing battery using a subset of our larger international HIV battery, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The battery consisted of the Color Trails I and II, the Grooved Pegboard for the non-dominant hand, and the Trail-Making Test A. We calculated z-scores (standard deviations compared to Thai normative data) using standard techniques and defined an NPZ-4 as the arithmetic mean of the four z-scores from individual tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Neurological examination and imaging</title><p>Participants underwent a standardized neurological examination by a trained clinician. We completed single-voxel MRS using a double spin echo data acquisition (PROBE-P) with TE = 35ms and TR = 1.5s on a GE Sigma HDx 1.5T scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, software version 12-M4) using an 8-channel head coil for data reception and a standard body coil for transmission [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. One co-investigator (NS) quantified all metabolites that were captured at left frontal white matter (FWM, 8cc), midline frontal gray matter (FGM, 8cc), posterior gray matter (OGM, 8cc), and basal ganglia (BG, 12cc). After each acquisition, we performed short echo-time (TE = 35ms) single voxel MRS of a standard spectroscopy phantom (GE Healthcare) to assess scanner stability. We used the time domain linear combination fitting software, LCModel (version 6.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://s-provencher.com/pages/lcmodel.shtml">http://s-provencher.com/pages/lcmodel.shtml</ext-link>) for all metabolite quantification to measure N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), Creatine (Cr), Choline (Cho), myoinositol (MI), and glutamate and glutamine (Glx). Metabolites were analyzed as pure concentrations rather than ratios to Cr since descriptive analyses demonstrated a change in Cr longitudinally after initiation of antiretroviral treatment in each voxel (all p-values &#x0003c; 0.05), a finding also seen in chronic HIV (<xref rid="pone.0142600.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Citation</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Serum and CSF measurements</title><p>Although numerous cytokines were measured, to minimize type 1 error, our analyses were driven by <italic>a priori</italic> scientific hypotheses and focused on interleukin 6 (IL-6), IP-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and neopterin since these are tightly linked to CNS injury. We quantified IL-6 and MCP-1 in plasma and CSF by customized multiplex ELISA (Quansys Biosciences, Logan UT) captured on the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and analyzed using Quansys Q-view Plus software (Quansys Biosciences). We employed traditional single-analyte ELISAs to measure IP-10 (Life Technologies, Grand Island NY) and neopterin (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA) and analyzed these with SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA).</p><p>Blood CD4 T-lymphocyte subsets were measured by standard flow cytometry. The plasma HIV RNA level was measured by the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test v1.5 (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ). The CSF HIV RNA level was measured in specimens that had been frozen for &#x0003c;6 months using a slight modification of the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test v1.5. RNA was extracted from ~200 &#x003bc;L of CSF by using the Boom silica extraction procedure (NucliSens Basic Isolation Reagents and Lysis buffer; bioMerieux, Durham, NC), as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lower limit of detection was 50 copies/ml in plasma and 100 copies/ml in CSF. Neurofilament light chain was measured in CSF using a highly sensitive, two-site enzymatic quantitative immunoassay with a lower limit of detection of 50ng/L [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>We compared controls, cART, and cART+ groups at Week 0 using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for ordinal data, Chi-squared and Fisher&#x02019;s Exact tests for categorical data, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) controlling for multiple comparisons for continuous data over the three groups over time. Paired t-tests and ANOVA were used to compare changes from baseline within groups over time. General Linear Models (GLM) controlling for baseline values were used to compare the two treatment groups, and when comparing the HIV group with the control group, covariates included age, gender, and mean educational level. Analyses of MRS data were examined using GLM and ANOVA controlling for multiple comparisons. Because of the novelty of this work and the small sample size, actual p-values are presented. For interpretation, we recommend a false discover rate proposed by Benjamini for clinical data, which, for four tests within each voxel, gives a p-value of 0.028 as the cutoff for significance [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Due to floor effects for IL-6 in plasma and CSF, we did not complete statistical analyses for this cytokine. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata v13.2. Figures were produced with Prism 6.0. An overall p-value of 0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons, if necessary) was used for testing statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Baseline composition of the sample</title><p>We randomized 62 participants resulting in treatment arms that were well-matched on key demographic and clinical variables including age, gender, baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and both plasma and CSF HIV RNA level (<xref rid="pone.0142600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>).

However, we did not find differences in the arm where cART was augmented with an integrase inhibitor and CCR5 antagonist. This study did not include an arm of HIV-infected patients who do not start cART; thus, we are unable to estimate the amount of change attributable to therapy. However, there are data demonstrating detrimental effects as early as the first year of HIV in the absence of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Together, our data and published work bolster the argument for early therapy; yet, the immediate clinical relevance is limited since identifying individuals to have HIV during seroconversion remains a challenging task.</p><p>This study leads to a number of other considerations relevant to CNS outcomes. Despite treatment of these individuals during the earliest stages of infection, cytokine that are pertinent to the CNS remain higher in the blood and MRS NAA remained lower than that of our controls. We measured these cytokines (MCP-1 and IP-10) because they are linked to monocyte function increasing the relevance to neuroHIV. We did not identify persistent abnormalities in CSF cytokines within a small sample nor did we note abnormalities on neuropsychological testing, which may require a longer duration of inflammation to develop. It is possible that demographic differences between controls and HIV-infected participants (i.e. gender, age, lifestyle issues) influenced this finding; however, we are unaware of data elsewhere to support the claim that elevations of these markers are associated with male gender or younger age, as seen in our HIV-infected group. A sensitivity analysis omitting three patients with cART resistance or intolerance did not change the overall results or statistical calculations.</p><p>This is the first attempt to look systematically at the CNS impact of intensification strategies implemented during acute HIV. Results from systemic studies are mixed. A small case series of ten participants with CSF HIV RNA suppressed to less than 2 copies did not identify changes in HIV RNA or neopterin associated with MVC intensification [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A 12-week, randomized, open-label pilot study of RAL intensification in chronic HIV patients with suppressed plasma HIV RNA did not identify a reduction in intrathecal immune or CSF HIV RNA [<xref rid="pone.0142600.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>This study focused on 6-month follow-up of cART treated AHI, and resolution of immune activation could require longer treatment. Since all cART+ subjects were switched to standard cART at 6 months, the impact of longer treatment with the cART+ regimen is unknown. It is possible that resolution of immune activation could require further treatment. We are also unable to determine from the current analysis if an initial 6-month intensification strategy is associated with improvement in long-term outcomes (e.g. beyond 6 months).</p><p>In sum, the present study identifies improvement in important makers concurrent with treatment during acute HIV and important residual abnormalities pertinent to CNS outcomes. Over this 24-week period, we did not identify incremental benefit associated with intensification with MVC and RAL. We cannot exclude the possibility that smaller differences would emerge with a larger sample of participants or more sensitive measures. Although intensification with MVC and RAL was not associated with improvement, small unresolved abnormalities that persist at 24 weeks raise the possibility for improvement beyond standard cART to reduce viral trafficking that is theorized to mechanistically drive neurological injury in later stages of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142600.s001"><label>S1 Citation</label><caption><title>Citation in press.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142600.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142600.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Manuscript Dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142600.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank our study participants and staff from the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre and the Silom Community Clinic in Bangkok for their valuable contributions to this study.</p><p>The Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (tenofovir, lamivudine, efavirenz), Gilead (Truvada, Atripla), Merck (Sustiva, Isentress), and ViiV Healthcare (Selzentry) provided antiretroviral therapy.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Contributors</title><p>
