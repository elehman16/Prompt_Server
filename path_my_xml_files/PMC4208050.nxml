Although antidepressant treatment is the most common therapy provided in routine practice, there is little evidence to guide second-line therapy for patients who have failed to respond to antidepressants. The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial that measures the clinical effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an augmentation strategy to treat patients with non-psychotic major depression identified as suboptimal responders to usual depression care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The current study is a 16-week assessor-blinded randomised, parallel-groups superiority trial with 12-month follow-up at an outpatient clinic as part of usual depression care. Patients aged 20&#x02013;65&#x02005;years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Major Depressive Disorder who have experienced at least one failed trial of antidepressants as part of usual depression care, will be randomly assigned to receive CBT plus treatment as usual, or treatment as usual alone. The primary outcome is the change in clinician-rated 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) score at 16&#x02005;weeks, and secondary outcomes include severity and change in scores of subjective depression symptoms, proportion of responders and remitters, safety and quality of life. The primary population will be the intention-to-treat patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>All protocols and the informed consent form comply with the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare). Ethics review committees at the Keio University School of Medicine and the Sakuragaoka Memorial Hospital approved the study protocol. The results of the study will be disseminated at several research conferences and as published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The study will be implemented and reported in line with the CONSORT statement.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: UMIN000001218.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>cognitive behavior therapy</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>clinical protocols</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This protocol will provide new evidence concerning the administration of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for major depression as an augmentation strategy for patients who have failed to respond to pharmacotherapy in psychiatric care settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Central randomisation and blinded assessment will be used.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study cannot examine the efficacy of CBT itself because there no attention-placebo control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The small number of study sites may affect generalisability.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As in other high-income countries, major depression is a common mental disorder in Japan.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Left untreated, major depression can cause substantial distress and impairment in individuals and negatively affect their quality of life, morbidity and mortality; it also places an enormous burden on society.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Latest estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study indicate that major depression accounts for 2.5% of the global disease burden,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and it is predicted to be the leading cause of disability in high-income countries by 2030.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Treatment guidelines for this debilitating mental disorder recommend antidepressants for first-line treatment of moderate to severe acute major depression,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and this remains the most common treatment in routine practice. However, available evidence indicates that only a third of patients fully respond to initial treatment with antidepressants.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Thus, many patients with major depression are left with considerable symptomatology after initial treatment and are described as having treatment resistant (refractory) depression (TRD).</p><p>Although many treatment studies investigating the best treatment strategies for TRD have been reported,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> no standard treatment has yet been established.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> When patients fail to respond to an adequate course of antidepressants, current guidelines recommend increasing the dose of the current antidepressant, switching to a different antidepressant, or augmenting treatment with other&#x000a0;drugs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, one major problem with TRD is the lack of agreed operational definitions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Given the heterogeneity of TRD associated with complex aetiological pathways, a non-pharmacological approach such as depression-specific psychotherapy may have a role in treatment.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>It is well established that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), the best known structured form of psychotherapy and which is based on Beck's cognitive theory,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> is effective for the treatment of depression.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Numerous randomised controlled studies have shown that CBT is superior to wait-list, non-specific controls or treatment as usual.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Further evidence shows that combining psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy is more effective than pharmacotherapy alone.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As a result, CBT has been gaining considerable attention in Japan as an effective treatment for depression among clinicians, academics and the general public. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has been encouraging training for, and practical implementation of, CBT, as exemplified by the coverage of CBT for mood disorders by the Japanese national health insurance scheme since 2010.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Despite these developments, few empirical studies have evaluated the effectiveness of CBT as a second-line therapy for patients who have failed to respond to antidepressants.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study examined CBT and pharmacotherapy as a sequential approach to manage patients who had failed an initial 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks of citalopram treatment by using either augmentation or switch strategies.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> No differences in outcome after treatment were observed between patients receiving augmentation with CBT and augmentation with other pharmacotherapy, or between patients switching drugs. However, the STAR*D trial implemented a unique equipoise-stratified randomisation design which allowed participants to refuse the non-preferred treatment arm; only a quarter of the STAR*D participants were randomised to CBT for their second-line treatment and this selection bias makes it difficult to interpret the outcomes. Next, Kennedy <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> compared cognitive therapy and lithium augmentation as a sequential treatment option for 44 outpatients with major depression who had a partial response during 8&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks of antidepressant treatment in an 8-week randomised controlled trial. They found that cognitive therapy showed no significant benefit over lithium augmentation. However, the sample size was small, which may have limited power to detect differences over time, and the duration of the trial was relatively short. Furthermore, the trial focused on partial responders (defined as having a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 8&#x02013;15) and excluded non-responders to the initial antidepressant treatment. Finally, the recent CoBalT trial<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> examined the effectiveness of CBT as second-line therapy for patients whose depression did not respond to usual depression care delivered by general practitioners in the UK. In this pragmatic clinical trial with a sample size of 469, adding CBT to usual care increased the treatment response threefold at 6&#x02005;months compared to those with usual care alone. However, the primary outcome of this trial was a self-reported measure (ie, the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition) that might have been affected by the treatment process. Further, it is unclear if this result could be applied to different clinical settings such as psychiatric care or other socio-cultural contexts.</p><p>There is little evidence to guide second-line therapy for patients who have failed to respond to antidepressants in psychiatric care settings. We therefore planned to carry out a randomised controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of CBT as an augmentation strategy for antidepressant non-responders compared with pharmacotherapy as part of usual patient care. The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol of the current study.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of CBT as an augmentation strategy to treatment as usual (which includes treatment with antidepressants) versus only treatment as usual in a 16-week randomised controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up for patients with non-psychotic major depression who were identified as suboptimal responders to usual depression care.</p><p>The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety (incidence of treatment discontinuation and adverse events) of CBT as an augmentation strategy to treatment as usual for patients with non-psychotic major depression who have not adequately responded to usual depression care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The current study is a 16-week assessor-blinded, randomised, controlled superiority trial of two parallel groups with 12-month follow-up at an outpatient clinic as part of usual depression care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006359F1">figure 1</xref>).

The incidence of SAEs in the sample and the 17-item GRID-HAMD score after treatment (16&#x02005;weeks) will be compared between groups to determine if the intervention is futile (ie, a 15% or less mean difference between the groups). The results of the interim analyses will be discussed with the principal investigator, who will decide whether to continue, stop, or modify the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2g4"><title>Premature termination of the study</title><p>The study will be terminated if the principal investigator, upon advice from the DSMC, judges it necessary for medical safety, for instance if a causal relationship between the study intervention and SAEs is established or there is a serious ethical violation according to the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, revised in 2008).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Reporting of adverse events</title><p>All adverse events reported spontaneously by patients or observed by the treating psychiatrists will be recorded.

Based on the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, revised in 2008) an SAE is defined as &#x02018;an adverse event that may lead to death or to enduring severe impairment depending on the patient's conditions and circumstances&#x02019; and will include: (1) death (all deaths regardless of causal relationship with the intervention or whose causal relationship with the intervention cannot be excluded, during the intervention phase or up to 30 days after the completion of the intervention); (2) a life-threatening event; (3) an event leading to enduring and severe impairment and dysfunction; and (4) hospitalisation (all hospitalisation regardless of causal relationship with the intervention or whose causal relationship with the intervention cannot be excluded, during the intervention phase or up to 30 days after the completion of the intervention).The treating psychiatrist must notify the principal investigator (YO) of the SAE immediately, and the principal investigator must also notify all collaborating investigators. The head investigator of the study site must report the SAE to its own ethics review committee and, if it concerns an unforeseeable SAE, must report it to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval of the study protocol was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of Keio University School of Medicine (reference no. 20070070, 19-70-4) and the Ethics Review Committee of Sakuragaoka Memorial Hospital.

The study psychiatrist is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient. The appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent form must be obtained before administration of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Ethics review</title><p>The principal investigator (YO) and the co-principal investigator (AN) must agree on the protocol and informed consent form before they are submitted to the ethics review committee and are used at sites. The protocol and informed consent form must comply with the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, revised in 2008). The ethics review committee will review the protocol as required. When the protocol needs to be amended for a legitimate reason, such as safety concerns, the protocol will be revised and after the agreement of the principal investigator and the co-principal investigator, will be submitted to the ethics review committee for review.</p></sec><sec id="s2i3"><title>Compensation and insurance for harmed patients</title><p>We cannot guarantee that unforeseen serious complications or health damage will not occur during or after completion of participation in this study. If such do occur, appropriate measures will be taken, the same as in cases of treatment for health damage in usual medical care. The medical expenses shall be borne by the patient, since the treatment will be supplied as a healthcare service provided under national health insurance, the same as for usual treatment. There will be no special financial compensation; however, any negligence on the part of the physician may be covered by the doctors&#x02019; liability insurance.</p></sec><sec id="s2i4"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Research objectivity and commitment to academic integrity is of paramount importance and the basis for obtaining and maintaining public trust, so all investigators will comply with the site's policy on conflicts of interest in research and relevant conflict of interest guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2i5"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of the study will be disseminated at several research conferences and as published articles in peer-reviewed journals.

The design of the study is expected to detect a meaningful difference in clinical effectiveness outcomes. The ECAM study differs from previous studies in that the study design uses a standardised psychiatric interview to assess depression symptomatology by blind raters, recruits patients from secondary and tertiary psychiatric care facilities who tend to have more severe and more difficult-to-treat depression, and evaluates the long-term effects of CBT for up to 12&#x02005;months.</p><p>The challenge and limitation of this study is that we cannot examine the efficacy of CBT itself because we did not choose an attention placebo, such as relaxation, as control. Our aim is to conduct a study to examine the effectiveness of augmenting usual clinical care with CBT rather the efficacy of CBT itself. We are also aware that the participating sites in this study are, clinically speaking, experienced in the treatment of patients with depression. Thus, the results might not be the generalisable to other settings. Nevertheless, this is the first randomised controlled study to assess the effectiveness of CBT for TRD in Japan. The results of the current study will hopefully improve the evidence-based treatment of patients who have residual symptoms of depression despite adequate pharmacotherapy.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Current study status</title><p>The ECAM study began recruiting patients in September 2008 and closed recruitment in August 2013. Data collection will be completed in December 2014.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e268" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006359.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e269" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006359.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank our study sites for their support.
