Since then, it has endured more than one century of uninterrupted and flourishing use. An ECG exam is the most common and simple method for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Hervey regarded ECG as &#x0201c;the middle one of the five fingers&#x0201d; approaching to the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although ECG has been used and improved since many years, it has developed zero meaningful breakthroughs on basic information (P-QRS-T wave) throughout the years. The microwaveform of the specialized conduction system cannot be recorded to date; thus, the clinical requirements for analysis of arrhythmia cannot be met. With the help of the PhysioSign research team, we used the new instrument [&#x0201c;SAN-Atrial-AVN-His (Saah) ECG,&#x0201d; model PHS-A10] designed and developed by PhysioSign, Inc. (Los Angeles, USA). Along with traditional ECG scanning/recording, PHS-A10 can accurately extract various time-domain ECG electric potentials in the 0&#x02013;150 Hz range and perform automated integrated signal recognition. Therefore, not only the P-QRS-T waves but also the microwavelets on surface ECG were initially recorded using the &#x0201c;Saah ECG&#x0201d; machine. We analyzed the positions and characteristics of the microwavelets and the &#x0201c;intervals&#x0201d; of these new wavelets before the QRS complex in 100 healthy subjects.
