Although CP is primarily a physical disability, children with CP have an increased risk of experiencing cognitive difficulties, particularly attention and executive function deficits. Impairment in cognitive abilities can lead to subsequent impairment in independent functioning, education, employment and interpersonal relationships. This paper reports the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of a novel family-centred lifestyle intervention based on mindfulness and hatha yoga principles (MiYoga). MiYoga aims to enhance child and parent outcomes for children with CP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The aim is to recruit 36 child-parent dyads (children aged 6&#x02013;16 years; bilateral or unilateral CP; Gross Motor Function Classification System I&#x02013;III), who will be randomly assigned to two groups: MiYoga andwaitlistt control. The MiYoga programme will be facilitated in a group format for 8 weeks. Assessments will be administered at baseline, prior to MiYoga, following completion of MiYoga, and at 6-month follow-up (retention). The primary outcome will be the child&#x02019;s sustained attentional ability as measured by the Conner&#x02019;s Continuous Performance Test II. Other outcomes of interest for children with CP consists of attentional control, physical functioning, behavioural and well-being. For parents, the outcomes of interest are mindfulness, psychological flexibility and well-being. Data will be analysed using general linear models, specifically analysis of covariance and analysis of variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Full ethical approval for this study has been obtained by the Children&#x02019;s Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service Research Ethics Committee (HREC/12/QRCH/120) and The University of Queensland (2012000993). If MiYoga is proven effective, its dissemination would assist children with CP and complement their ongoing therapy by improving the ability of the child to pay attention at school and in therapy, and alleviating environmentalstressorss for both the child and his/her parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12613000729729; Pre-results.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12613000729729.aspx">http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12613000729729.aspx</ext-link>

</p><p>Present therapies focus primarily on physical difficulties faced by children with CP,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> despite the fact that children with CP also have an increased risk of experiencing cognitive difficulties. In 2009, the Australia Cerebral Palsy Register reported that one in three children with CP experience cognitive difficulties.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> More recent studies reported that one in two children with CP had an intellectual disability,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and compared with typically developing children those with CP are more likely to have attention and executive function deficits.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> The deficits may explain why children with CP have increased social and learning problems.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It is therefore important to consider interventions that target attention, in addition to the existing physical therapy, for children with CP.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Attention</title><p>The attention system underpins most cognitive and&#x000a0;neuropsychological functions in everyday life, such as self-control (inhibition), decision-making, goal setting, planning, problem solving, emotional responses and behaviour. Typically, the attention system is understood using the &#x02018;three network model&#x02019;, comprising the alerting network, and the orienting and executive networks.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>The alerting network is a &#x02018;bottom-up&#x02019;, stimulus-driven (or exogenous) attention system that automatically responds to external stimulus, such as visual, auditory input.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For example, a sudden loud noise or motion can attract our attention and we attend to them whether we want to or not. This network is thought to involve both the parietal and temporal areas of the brain, as well as the brain stem arousal systems.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Orienting and executive networks are the other networks in this model. In contrast to the alerting network, they are both &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; processes, responding to internally determined goals. Together, these two attentional networks are also known as goal-driven, endogenous attention, attentional control or executive attention networks.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> They determine our ability to voluntarily select, and orient, attention to relevant stimuli or tasks, mediated primarily by the frontal cortex and basal ganglia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref>
</p><p>The orienting network determines our ability to consciously orient attention in a spatial setting. Functionality of this network can be measured by the speed and accuracy of responses to cues that indicate where a future stimulus may occur on a computer screen.</p><p>In contrast, the executive network involves mechanisms for monitoring and resolving conflict when two responses are simultaneously called for by an external stimulus. This network aids attentional switching, and provides the ability to disengage from distracting stimuli and re-engage attention to the relevant task or stimulus. Previous studies have confirmed that these two &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; networks are related to executive functions,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 15</xref> working memory<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and conflict resolution and inhibition.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>Both orienting and executive networks of attention are involved in sustained attention, which is the ability to maintain and focus attention on a given task. Sustained attention is a core executive function, typically defined as the ability to maintain an alert, goal-directed focus in the absence of an external stimulation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Difficulty maintaining sustained attention can interfere with non-cognitive aspects of therapy and rehabilitation, including for children with CP. Impairments in attention in children may lead to reading problems,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> poor&#x000a0;math achievements,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> poor self-confidence and cognitive impairments,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> poor executive function and executive attention (such as working memory) leading to poor social skills<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 23</xref> as well as problem behaviours.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, the capacity to self-sustain attention has been shown to predict motor recovery in adults following a right hemisphere stroke over a 2-year period.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These findings suggests sustained attention deficits in the development of interventions and rehabilitation programmes are a worthwhile target for interventions, particularly in children with CP, where poor attention may hinder their ability to benefit from existing physical therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Cognitive abilities in children with CP</title><p>Attention, executive function and other intellectual capabilities are impaired in one in two children with CP.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 8 9 25</xref> One cross-sectional study of sustained attention in 10 adolescents with CP, using a visual Continuous Performance Test (CPT),<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> indicated that sustained attention ability was affected by CP, even after controlling for motor deficits by using eye movements to measure sustained attention.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Another study investigated attention and executive function in children with unilateral and bilateral spastic CP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Four&#x000a0;subtests from the&#x000a0;Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02014;information, similarities, comprehension and vocabulary&#x02014;were used to measure general cognitive functioning. They also used three&#x000a0;subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> to measure selective attention (Sky Search), sustained attention (Score!) and divided attention (Sky Search Dual Task). Executive functions were assessed by the Contingency Naming Test and the teacher version of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The results demonstrated that impairments in sustained attention, divided attention, inhibition, switching and general executive function were present in children with CP.</p><p>Few therapeutic interventions aim to increase a child&#x02019;s ability to sustain their attention on task, or selectively focus their attention on appropriate stimuli. Previous research has explored attention and problem-solving training for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> children with learning disabilities and comorbid ADHD.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In addition, some studies investigated efficacy of interventions that may increase attentional abilities in children with traumatic brain injury<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 32</xref> and for the late effects of treatment for childhood cancer.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> There is a paucity of research on interventions to improve attention in children with CP.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Mindfulness and attention</title><p>Several investigators have recently proposed theoretical explanations of how the practice of focused attention through mindfulness (awareness of the present moment) training can enhance and develop attention regulation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> Mindfulness practice involves sustaining attention on a chosen object, such as one&#x02019;s breath, an object or a mantra, and directing attention to that object while sustaining this focused attention for as long as possible.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;38</xref> In order to sustain this focus, one must monitor the quality of this focus. For example, while focusing on the rise and fall of the chest with each breath, one might notice their attention has shifted to something that happened during the day, or what they would like for dinner later. At some point, they would realise their focus has wondered and let go of their distraction and reattend to their breath. Mindfulness is the state of awareness of the thoughts or feelings that arise when our minds wander. This awareness provides the opportunity to inhibit the more dominant response of rumination and switch our attention back to the point of focus.</p><p>It has been proposed<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> that this type of monitoring of one&#x02019;s attention and focus consists of three types of attention regulation: (i) monitoring the present moment (ie, detect mind wandering), (ii) attentional switching (ie, disengage from a distracting object/thought without further involvement) and (iii) selective attention (ie, ability to redirect focus promptly back to target object). Researchers reason that mindfulness training entails extended practice of these attentional abilities.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35 37</xref>
</p><p>These proposed theoretical models of the cognitive mechanism of mindfulness have inspired experimental research examining the effects of mindfulness training on attention performance. The effects of mindfulness practice on the three attentional networks (alerting, orienting and executive) were examined by&#x000a0;Jha <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> using the Attention Network Test.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Attentional efficiency was assessed before and after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> course administered to&#x000a0;meditation-na&#x000ef;ve participants, as well as a 1-month intensive mindfulness retreat attended by experienced&#x000a0;meditators, compared with an 8-week no treatment control group. The retreat group (experienced&#x000a0;meditators) showed better conflict monitoring at baseline than participants in the control and MBSR groups (both groups with&#x000a0;meditation-na&#x000ef;ve participants), suggesting that executive attention improves with long-term exposure to mindfulness meditation. The retreat group had improved alerting among the previously experienced&#x000a0;meditators. The authors concluded that mindfulness training improves voluntary (top-down; endogenous) attentional control leading to improved orienting and conflict monitoring, and prior experience with concentrative meditation allows for the development of improved bottom-up, receptive attention involved in alerting. It may be that mindfulness training improves the functioning of each of the attentional subsystems at various points in the course of mindfulness training.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Yoga</title><p>Traditional yoga is a mindfulness practice that directs attention towards the present moment.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The aim of yoga is to calm and unify the mind, body and breath to promote positive health, self-awareness and spirituality.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Yoga postures, known as <italic>asana</italic> in Sanskrit, are the third of the eight &#x02018;limbs&#x02019;, or practices, of yoga according to the traditional texts of the YogaS&#x0016b;trass of&#x000a0;Pata&#x000f1;jali. <italic>Asana</italic> directly translates to &#x02018;posture&#x02019; and was derived from the Sanskrit root word which means &#x02018;to be&#x02019;, &#x02018;to sit&#x02019;, &#x02018;to stay&#x02019; or &#x02018;to be established in a particular posture&#x02019;.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The YogaS&#x0016b;trass of&#x000a0;Pata&#x000f1;jali describe <italic>asana</italic> as having two important qualities. The first is steadiness and alertness and the second is the ability to remain comfortable in a posture.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> When&#x000a0;practicing <italic>asana</italic>, both of these qualities should be present. The combination of performing <italic>asana</italic> with&#x000a0;pranayama (breathing techniques), comprise the style of yoga commonly referred to as&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga.&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga unites the actions of the body, breath and mind by the synchronisation of movement with the breath, which in turn directs the practitioner&#x02019;s attention and awareness to the present. The unity of body and mind is what makes traditional&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga an embodied mindfulness practice.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Mindfulness and yoga for children</title><p>In the paediatric literature, it has been documented that mindfulness and yoga improves memory in school children,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> cognitive function in children with mental retardation,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> planning abilities and executive function in healthy school aged girls<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> as well as attention, behaviour and emotional control in healthy children and children with ADHD.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Yoga has been shown to improve balance, motors skills and strength as well as the quality of life and general well-being, in a range of different participant groups.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48&#x02013;51</xref>
</p><p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> programmes combine mindfulness and&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga techniques to cultivate greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as of the ways the unconscious thoughts, feelings and behaviours can undermine emotional, physical and spiritual health. The underlying principles for MBSR programmes are to (a) be&#x000a0;non-judgmental, (b) be patient, (c) see the world as if for the first time, (d) accept seeing things as they are without trying to change anything, (e) and let go of attachment to repetitive thoughts, actions or beliefs. MBSR programmes usually feature group interaction, formal and informal meditation practice, daily homework and/or silent retreats.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The formal practice includes mindfulness meditation and mindful movements in the form of&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga. The informal practices include mindful eating and walking. Although a number of studies explored the effectiveness of MBSR in the adult population,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> there is a paucity of randomised controlled trials that explore the effects of a developmentally appropriate MBSR programme for children.</p><p>A systematic review<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> investigating the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions identified 13 randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of the 13 identified studies,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56&#x02013;68</xref> 5 studies found a statistically significant intervention effect for at least one outcome measure of attention or executive function with medium to large effects sizes (0.3&#x02013;32.03).<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 59 61 63 66</xref> The overall findings from the review suggested that mindfulness-based interventions targeting attention are a promising approach for children and adolescents. This systematic review did not find randomised controlled trial of mindfulness-based interventions with children or adolescents with CP. Quality trials are therefore needed to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions targeting attention in children and adolescents with CP.</p><p>By adapting a mindfulness-base programme for children, with a focus on mindful movements through&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga, it may provide a developmental approach to mindfulness training. Yoga has been shown to improve body awareness in adults,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> and it may teach children and adolescents about their growing bodies as they become more aware of their bodies and their movements. School-age children have also been found to be interested in yoga as a mind-body therapy for pain and other ailments.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> As children are naturally more active, teaching them mindfulness through movements using traditional&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga postures along with the&#x000a0;some mindfulness exercises to begin with, may be more developmentally appropriate than teaching them the more traditional seated mindfulness meditations. This remains to be tested.</p><p>The mindful movement programme in this project, MiYoga, combines both cognitive (mindfulness) and physical (yoga postures) aspects into therapy. It has the potential to assist children with CP to alleviate negative effects of environmental&#x000a0;stressors by improving their ability to focus attention on the present moment, ultimately helping them to focus on activities at school, in therapy, or when interacting with peers. At the same time,&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga may provide additional physical benefits to complement the ongoing therapy for children with CP.</p><p>MiYoga will be delivered to both the children and their parents, to enable parents to facilitate and monitor the MiYoga approach, which may improve translation and implementation of techniques into everyday life. This project will test the efficacy of a mindful movement (MiYoga) programme administered to children with CP, and one of their parents. The MiYoga programme would be an adjunct to children&#x02019;s ongoing rehabilitation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Aim</title><p>The focus of this study is to design and test a novel mindful movement programme, MiYoga, and to investigate its efficacy for enhancing sustained attention in children with CP. Efficacy will be tested in a randomised controlled trial (n=36) with an intervention group (MiYoga programme+standard care) compared with a waitlist control group receiving standard care alone. This enables all participating children to receive the intervention, maximising participant recruitment and retention and fulfilling ethical obligations to participating children and families. Outcomes measures will be taken at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at follow-up 6 months post-intervention.</p><p>Qualitative interviews will also be conducted with each child and parent participant individually.

Children must also have sufficient cooperation and cognitive understanding to follow simple instructions. The primary parent of eligible children will participate alongside their child. Children with comorbid diagnoses to CP are included.</p><p>Children will be excluded if they have (i) received upper-limb or lower-limb surgery in the previous 6 months; (ii) unstable epilepsy (ie, frequent seizures not controlled by medication); (iii) spinal instability or other spinal problems that would prevent them from participating safely in the MiYoga programme; (iv) have a medical condition that would prevent them from participating safely in the MiYoga programme or (v) parents/guardians who are pregnant as a safety precaution. Diagnosis of CP must be confirmed by the treating paediatrician or clinician and in accordance with published recommendations.</p><p>Eligible children living in South East Queensland, Australia, will be recruited through patient databases of Queensland Cerebral Palsy Rehabilitation Research Centre (QCPRRC) at the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital and the Queensland Cerebral Palsy Register, and via referrals from clinicians in the Queensland Pediatric Rehabilitation Service. Potential participants will be invited to participate in the study via letters and follow-up phone calls. Flyers and posters will displayed in the reception areas of clinics, and clinicians will be informed of the study, and encouraged to refer appropriate patients to the programme.

Participants who have received intramuscular BoNT-A prior to beginning the study will have their baseline assessments postponed until 1&#x02009;month after their standard follow-up has been completed. Questionnaires will record the type, frequency and duration of any concurrent therapies provided by public and private services during the study for all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Prior to the intervention, participants will be asked to complete baseline assessments and questionnaires. Once these are completed, participants will be randomly assigned to either the waitlist group or immediate group and informed of the dates and times of their group. The randomisation sequence will be computer-generated. Treatment allocations will be recorded in pieces of paper, which will be folded and placed inside sealed, numbered, opaque envelopes by a staff member not involved in the study. A staff member not involved in the study will also open consecutive envelopes as each participant returns their baseline questionnaires. After the randomisation process is complete, study personnel will be informed of group allocation and information packs will be sent out to families.

Participants in the immediate group will begin the 8-week MiYoga programme within 3&#x02009;weeks of their baseline assessment, while the&#x000a0;waitlist group will continue care as usual for the next 8 weeks. When the immediate group has completed the MiYoga programme, all participants from both groups (immediate and&#x000a0;waitlist) will be reassessed (T2). The&#x000a0;waitlist group can then commence a future MiYoga group of their choice. For each participant, data will be collected at baseline (T1) and following the immediate MiYoga group&#x02019;s completion of the programme at 8 weeks (T2). The&#x000a0;waitlist group will also complete assessments after they have completed the MiYoga programme at 16 weeks (T3). Both groups will complete their follow-up assessments 24 weeks after completing the MiYoga programme&#x02014;this will be 32 weeks post-baseline for the immediate group and 40 weeks post-baseline for the&#x000a0;waitlist group (T4). Participants will complete their assessments within 3&#x02009;weeks of the target time-points (in weeks) listed above.</p><p>The principal researcher (CM), a registered psychologist and a qualified yoga teacher, will conduct all the assessments and MiYoga sessions. A physiotherapist from the QCPRRC will perform the physical screen assessment for each child at baseline. In addition, they will be present at the initial assessment to provide professional advice to the child, the parent/guardian and to the psychologist/yoga teacher regarding the child&#x02019;s ability to perform various yoga postures and the adaptations that may be necessary. Either a physiotherapist or the principal researcher (CM) will conduct the physical assessments. Participants are encouraged to complete their online questionnaires in person during their assessment session, if they prefer they may also complete them&#x000a0;online from home (via&#x000a0;Qualitricscs Insight Platform). Registered clinical and developmental psychologist (KW) will provide regular supervision. In addition, study coordinator will be able to consult with Professor Boyd (RB), a registered physiotherapist, if there are any physical concerns.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>MiYoga intervention</title><p>Following randomisation (immediate MiYoga group), or the time 2 neuropsychological and physical assessments&#x000a0;(waitlistst control group), participants and their parents will complete the MiYoga programme. All MiYoga sessions will be delivered in a group format where possible. Child-parent dyads in the&#x000a0;waitlist control group will receive the same intervention after a delay. In two-parent families, one of the parents will be invited to attend all sessions, and the same parent will complete all the questionnaire measures.</p><p>The MiYoga programme itself is an 8-week programme that consists of six 90&#x02009;min sessions over the initial 6&#x02009;weeks, then two phone or Skype consultations over the last 2 weeks of the programme. Over these 8 weeks, children and their parent or guardian are asked to partake in a minimum of 20&#x02009;min daily home practice. To assist with participants&#x02019; home practice, a MiYoga DVD and a MiYoga poster developed by the principal researcher will be provided at the first MiYoga session. The MiYoga DVD is based on the mindfulness exercises and <italic>asana</italic> delivered in the group sessions. The MiYoga poster shows pictorially the <italic>asana</italic> delivered in the group sessions. In addition, it includes child specific modifications identified from the initial assessment session. Each MiYoga poster will contain general instructions as well as general and specific modifications for how parents may assist their child. Where possible, a photo of the child performing the postures with their modifications will also be included. Researchers will assess the child&#x02019;s abilities in each of the yoga postures and provide modifications for the child as required in each posture. These modifications will be documented and put into the respective child&#x02019;s poster for them to take home and practice. This will ensure that participants will not attempt any new exercises or poses at home without assistance and guidance from a therapist (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix A</xref> for a MiYoga programme summary).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015191.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary Appendix 1</title></caption><p>

</p></supplementary-material><p>There are formal and informal mindfulness activities in MiYoga. The formal mindfulness activities consist of mindful movements in the form of&#x000a0;Hatha Yoga and short mindfulness meditations. The yoga postures selected for the programme aim to help them build strength and increase flexibility (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix B</xref> for a table and illustrations of the MiYoga postures for children with cerebral palsy). The informal activities present mindfulness techniques as game-like explorations, based on exploring our internal and external worlds with the five senses as well as consciously reflecting on thoughts and feelings. These activities and games were developed based on literature on mindfulness and yoga for both children and adults.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43 52 81&#x02013;91</xref>
</p><p>One of the informal activities involves children having to guess what they are eating while blindfolded. This game will involve the child to consciously notice the food with all their senses, such as by feeling the texture of the food in their hands and mouth, smelling and tasting it and possibly even hearing the sounds the food makes when chewing it (and subsequently noticing crunchy, chewy or soft foods). Children may have to identify an object by exploring it only with their hands (sense of touch) and then describe how the object feels in their hands to another person without naming the object. This game encourages the child to use their sense of touch to explore their environment and increase their awareness of how the sense of touch provides them with information about their surroundings. Such activities are both interesting for the participants, but are also mindful practices that stimulate a state of awareness.</p><p>ThHathaha Yoga techniques or postures in this study were based on&#x000a0;Viniyoga principles<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and they were tailored for children with CP. The synchronisation of breath and movement is a key element as it helps to focus the mind on the present&#x000a0;(ie, moving through yoga postures with the breath) providing a mindful movement practice. To make synchronising breath and movement more natural and fun for children, participants will be invited to make sounds along with the instructor, such as &#x02018;Ahh', in the&#x000a0;asana sequences to assist with their exhalation. The yoga postures will be modified as required for each participant. Some of the modifications will use supports such as&#x000a0;a wall, chair or blocks, to ensure correct posture, adequate support and comfort, or to accommodate muscle shortness or postural difficulties. For example, some children may sit on a block to keep their pelvis level and to accommodate their shorter hamstring muscles and leading to posture pelvic tilt within long sitting. These physical modifications will be individualised to each child&#x02019;s need based on the baseline physical screen by a physiotherapist. The physical adaptations may not be the same for all children with CP while some children did not require any physical modifications. For this reason, online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix B</xref> mainly illustrates non-adapted postures and only some examples of possible modifications. In addition to the physical modifications, verbal prompts will guide the children into the postures. For example, &#x02018;going as far as it is comfortable for you, this may be coming forward to thighs or your knees&#x02019; or &#x02018;notice the sensation in the back of your legs as you fold forward, you may like to explore how it feels for you to keep your knees straight as you come forward&#x02019;. A verbal prompt for children to sit with good alignment (avoid W-sitting) may be &#x02018;as we sit back onto our heels be mindful that your knees and big toes are together&#x02019;.</p><p>Each session will be of 90&#x02009;min with guided instruction throughout each component of mindfulness practice. DurinHathaha Yoga postures, instructions will be provided on safe ways to get in and out of the positions, pose modification and use of props to suit needs and limitations of each child. For instance, the supine twist can be performed on a chair rather than on the ground. Blankets, cushions, bolsters, straps and other props may be used to maintain body alignment, structural support and comfort (see the possible modification column of online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix B</xref> for more details). Emphasis will be placed on building length along the spine while maintaining neutrality of spinal position, keeping awareness of the breath and using breath and sensations within the body to anchor attention to the present moment.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Locations</title><p>It is expected that groups and assessments will be conducted in Brisbane, and various locations in South East Queensland. Locations in Brisbane will include The University of Queensland, St Lucia and&#x000a0;Herston campuses and the Centre for Children&#x02019;s Health Research in South Brisbane. If participants are located outside of Brisbane, then suitable locations will be organised with the participating families in those areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Participation and data management</title><p>To maximise participation and retention, email reminders will be sent to participants 3&#x02009;days prior to their scheduled appointments, and text message reminders will be sent to participants the day prior to their appointments and their weekly MiYoga sessions. To further promote recruitment, participation and retention, the study offers waitlist control group so that all participants have an opportunity to take part in the MiYoga programme. It is also possible to extend the period of recruitment and the delivery MiYoga groups should recruitment be more challenging than anticipated. The number of participants recruited and participant retention will be recorded throughout the trial period.</p><p>Treatment dose will be calculated based on participants&#x02019; attendance at the weekly MiYoga sessions, as well as the amount of home practice completed by participants between sessions. The therapist will record participant attendance after each weekly MiYoga session, and parent participants will record the amount of home practice they completed each week in their MiYoga diary. The MiYoga diaries will be collected weekly and monitored by the therapist. Strategies to facilitate and support engagement in the programme will be discussed with the participant and their parents throughout the duration of the MiYoga programme in the group sessions as well as via individual phone calls.</p><p>A protocol&#x000a0;checklist will be completed by the therapist (first author) at the end of each MiYoga session. This protocol&#x000a0;checklist will be used to monitor therapy fidelity and to ensure that all the MiYoga content was delivered as per protocol.</p><p>Paper copy data will be de-identified and physically stored in a locked file cabinet at the QCPRRC. These physical documents may be scanned (after de-identification) and password protected in a computer file on a secure server. Computer files will be de-identified and password protected on a secure server.</p><p>Video files of the MiYoga sessions will be used to assess for therapist integrity and consistency across groups. These video files will be managed and and kept on a secure&#x000a0;online database run through QCPRRC and backup files may be kept on a external&#x000a0;harddrive or CD in a locked cabinet.</p><p>Study updates and general outcomes will be sent to participants in a newsletter format.

</title><p>Intellectual functioning will be assessed using the WISC&#x02014;fourth edition (WISC-IV) short form.<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref> The WISC-IV comprises seven&#x000a0;subtests that generate the four indices of Verbal Comprehension (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning (PRI), Working Memory (WM) and Processing Speed (PSI). From these overall short form index scores, a Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) score can be calculated. In the WISC-IV short form, the VCI index is made up of the Vocabulary and Similarities&#x000a0;subtests. The Vocabulary subtest assesses knowledge of word meanings and will require participants to name pictures or provide spoken definitions of words&#x000a0;(eg, &#x02018;what is a bicycle?'). The Similarities subtest assesses verbal abstraction and reasoning and will require participants to describe how two words are similar&#x000a0;(eg, &#x02018;how are anger and joy alike&#x02019;). The Block Design and Matrix Reasoning&#x000a0;subtests make up the PRI index in the WISC-IV short form. Block Design will require participants to construct abstract visual designs with a set of red-and-white 3D blocks within a specified time period. Matrix Reasoning, will require participants to use their non-verbal abstract reasoning and problem solving skills in order to select the correct picture from an array of five options that fits into the missing space of a visual design. The WMI index is made up of the Digit Span subtest in which participants will be required to repeat a number of verbally presented digits in forward and reverse order. Finally, the PRI index is made up of the Coding and Symbol Search&#x000a0;subtests, each of which has a 2&#x02009;min time limit and therefore require participants to work as quickly as possible without making mistakes. For the Coding subtest, participants will need to match abstract symbols with a number key while for Symbol Search, participants will be required to detect the presence of one or more symbols in a sequence of five.<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>

The provided normative data in the manual will allow raw scores to be converted into T scores (M=50, SD=10). Eight&#x000a0;subscales are combined to form the Behavioural Regulation Index (initiate, working memory, plan/organise, organisation of materials and monitor&#x000a0;subscales) and the&#x000a0;Metacognition Index (inhibit, emotional control and shift&#x000a0;subscales). Together these form the overall Global Executive Composite (GEC). T scores of 65 or more (1.5 SD above the mean) indicate elevated levels on the corresponding&#x000a0;subscales and indices. Higher T scores indicate greater executive dysfunction. In this study, the GEC will be used as primary measures of executive function in everyday life. The BRIEF has been shown to be a valid measure of executive functioning and has good internal consistency&#x000a0;(&#x003b1;=0.80&#x02013;0.98) and high test&#x02013;retest reliability on the GEC (r=0.86).<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>
