Each time the patient moves his hand upward and backward or rotates it externally, the anterior dislocation of shoulder may happen. Recurrent shoulder instability is the most common complication of shoulder dislocation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Recurrent dislocation occurs commonly in young patients and is especially seen during exercise.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It mostly happens anteriorly.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Most of these patients are the ones who did not keep their joints immobile enough after the reduction of dislocated shoulder and resumed their state of sport activities rapidly.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The joint capsule is ruptured every time it dislocates. This rupture repairs spontaneously after joint reduction by enough immobilization of the joint. In cases where the capsule's rupture does not heal, the joint becomes unstable and easily dislocates.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Several methods have been used to stabilize the shoulder joint.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Two of these techniques are Bankart arthroscopic repair and Bristow open procedure. Nowadays the most popular treatment of shoulder instability with Bankart lesion is the Bankart method of surgery (repair and reconstruction of labrum capsule)[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in which the pathologic lesion is repaired anatomically.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the other hand, the Bristow surgery (coracoid transfer to the edge of glenoid) of all types of shoulder instability is associated with favorable outcomes.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In this technique, two mechanisms are used to make the shoulder stable; one is the role of coracoid as the blocker of the bone and the other one is the dynamic buttress of anterior and inferior site of capsule by short head of biceps muscle and brachioradialis muscle. In fact, both methods are useful for stabilizing of isolated chronic shoulder instability.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Several studies conducted in different regions of the world disclosed no significant difference between these two methods,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and random studies showed no preference for each of these techniques.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] As these two surgical procedures are performed in our country's medical centers and such a study has not been done on the Iranian population,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] it seemed necessary to conduct a study to evaluate the outcome of these techniques and make a better decision.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical trial was performed between 2008 and 2011 in Alzahra Hospital and Kashani Hospital of Isfahan. In this survey, we investigated patients over 18 years of age with traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation and referring to Alzahra and Kashani hospital clinics between the years 2008 and 2011.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included suffering from recurrent dislocation of shoulder due to trauma, age over 18 and less that 45, dislocation not healing following nonsurgical treatments, having limitations in daily life and physical activity, permanent disability with a phobia of dislocation, Bankart lesion in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and patient's willingness for participating in this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria consisted of failure to follow the patients in order to assess their state of improvement after surgery, multidirectional instability of the shoulder, bone defects, patient's refusal to participate, uncontrollable seizures, and patient's inability to cooperate in mental and physical rehabilitation.</p><p>Using simple sampling, 40 patients who referred to Isfahan university clinics and satisfied the inclusion criteria were selected. Then, they were randomly assigned to two groups with 20 patients in each. Before the project, conscious consent forms were obtained from all participants. In the first group, Bankart arthroscopic surgery was used for stabilizing the joint and in the second, Bristow open surgery was used. After surgery, all the patients were estimated by an orthopedic surgery resident using CONSTANT, ASES,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] UCLA,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and ROWE score, and related forms were filled. Patients&#x02019; satisfaction was determined with the question &#x0201c;Are you willing to advise others to choose this route of treatment or not?&#x0201d; and by using American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon's Shoulder FormASES parameters. All data were collected in data collection forms by a definite orthopedic resident. At the end, all the data were analyzed in version 20 of SPSS. For comparing the mean of quantitative variables before performing the surgery, we used independent <italic>t</italic>-test and for comparing them after surgery, we applied independent <italic>t</italic>-test and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To compare the relative frequency of relapse between the two groups, Chi-square test was used. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this survey, we selected 40 patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation and then randomly divided them into two groups with 20 people in each.

As previously mentioned, one of the common problems of the society is recurrent shoulder dislocation, especially in athletes and persons with careers in which more pressure than usual is imposed to this region. Shoulder dislocation requires no surgery by itself, but recurrent shoulder dislocation requires surgery to stabilize the joint.</p><p>In this study, we investigated 40 patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation and we randomly divided them into two equal groups of 20 patients each. The first group underwent Bristow procedure and the second group was treated by Bankart arthroscopic surgery. During the study, three patients were excluded due to unavailability and not getting readmitted (one from Bristow group and two from Bankart group). Finally, the population of the two groups became 19 and 18, respectively.</p><p>The mean ages of Bristow and Bankart group were 30.4 &#x000b1; 4.8 and 28.4 &#x000b1; 4.5 years, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant. In terms of gender, occupation, and education, the two groups were not significantly different. The confounding effects of demographic variables were controlled and the two groups were comparable.</p><p>Based on our results, 24.3% of the patients were professional athletes. Shoulder dislocation occurred in 29.7% of our patients less than 5 times, in 13.5% from 5 to 9 times, in 32.4% for more than 10 times, and in 24.3%, the number of dislocations was undefined. Sport activities, particularly professional sports, are a major cause of shoulder dislocation. While special motions which predispose shoulder to dislocation are performed too many times during these sports, these athletes are prone to recurrent shoulder dislocation. Indeed, in our study, 32.4% of the patients had shoulder dislocation more than 10 times.</p><p>Mean duration of hospitalization in Bristow and Bankart groups was 2.8 &#x000b1; 1.5 days and 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.1 days, respectively, which did not differ significantly. Recovery time was 76.3 &#x000b1; 34.2 days in Bristow group and 65.5 &#x000b1; 28.5 days in Bankart group, which were not significantly different.</p><p>Mean ROWE score including stability, mobility, and performance was 87.4 &#x000b1; 13 in patients who underwent Bristow surgery and 85 &#x000b1; 12.8 in Bankart group, and no significant difference was seen between the two groups.</p><p>In a study conducted in 2000 by Grastman, similar results were obtained and the mean of mentioned score in this study did not differ significantly. Notably, mobility parameter was different in our study, but the other two parameters were not. There was no significant difference in the two methods for treatment of shoulder dislocation.</p><p>CONSTANT score was the other criterion to estimate the efficacy of the method. The mean of this score in Bristow group was 58.7 &#x000b1; 6.3 and in Bankart group was 50.9 &#x000b1; 12.6, and they showed a significant difference. Parameters measured by this score were pain intensity, daily performance, lifting the limb to the lateral and anterior direction, and internal and external rotation of the joint. The two parameters, limb positioning and lifting the limb to lateral and anterior direction, differed significantly between the two mentioned methods. Patients who underwent Bristow open surgery had a favorable condition.</p><p>UCLA score investigated parameters such as performance, active forward flexion, forward flexion power intensity, and patient satisfaction. The mean of this score was 29.7 &#x000b1; 4.5 in Bristow group and 28.6 &#x000b1; 6 in Bankart group, which were not significantly different.</p><p>The mean score in Bristow group was 85.5 &#x000b1; 8.1 and in Bankart group was 76.2 &#x000b1; 20.7, and the difference was not significant. Pain is one the parameters measured by this score. The other parameter is use of analgesics and narcotics to relieve the pain. In our survey, patients treated by Bristow procedure experienced less pain and used less analgesics and narcotics than the patients treated in Bankart group. Among the several investigated criteria by this score, ability to brush hair and throw the ball over the head was more favored in Bristow group. Range of active and passive internal rotation was more in Bristow category. In a study performed by Gerard <italic>et al</italic>. on 79 patients who underwent Bankart arthroscopic procedure, the mean values of UCLA score pre- and postoperatively were 20.2 &#x000b1; 5 and 32.4 &#x000b1; 4.6, respectively. The difference in patients&#x02019; score before the surgery and 2 years after the surgery was quite significant. Based on this score, in this study, the condition of 34 patients was great 2 years after the surgery, 35 patients had a good situation, 1 patient was not in a favorable condition, and 3 were in poor condition.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Another study performed in Sweden by Lennart <italic>et al</italic>. investigated 24 persons treated by Bankart surgery and 30 patients who underwent Bristow procedure. In this study, the recurrence of shoulder dislocation and patients&#x02019; satisfaction did not differ between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>A domestic study conducted in 2006 by MehdiNasab <italic>et al</italic>. investigated 19 patients with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation due to trauma. Mean follow-up time in these patients was 7.5 years and none of the patients had relapse. Feeling of instability was seen in three patients. Five patients suffered from mild shoulder pain at the end of the active day. Finally, 15 patients (78.9%) showed good and even excellent improvement. This study concluded that Bristow procedure is accompanied by good outcomes and the postoperative instability rate is low.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>We found in our study that the two mentioned techniques did not differ significantly, although some parameters such as level of performance, pain intensity, use of analgesics, and range of internal rotation showed more improvement in Bristow procedure.
