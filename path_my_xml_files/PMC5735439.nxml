The bispectral analysis decomposes the EEG signal into its component sine waves using a Fourier transformation. A set of bispectral features is calculated by analyzing the phase relations between the component waves. These bispectral features are combined with other EEG features into a single measurement, the bispectral index (BIS), which is a numeric index ranging from 0 to 100.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The BIS correlates well with sedation and is a good indicator of a patient's response to stimulus.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The BIS has also been validated as a measure of anesthetic effect for a number of anesthetic agents, including isoflurane, sevoflurane, and propofol.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Titration of volatile anesthetics including desflurane using BIS as a guide has been done previously by a number of studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial to study the effect of perioperative intravenous magnesium sulfate on MAC of desflurane using BIS monitoring.

Lungs were ventilated using air/oxygen, and anesthesia was maintained with desflurane. Dial setting of desflurane was adjusted to target a BIS of 45&#x02013;55; increased or decreased if BIS value fell out of range for &#x0003e;10 s. The fresh gas flow was set at 6 L for 5 min (or till end-tidal desflurane [EtDEs]/desflurane inspired fraction equalized to about 80%), and after equilibrium, flows were reduced to 600&#x02013;800 ml/min. EtDES and MAC were monitored continuously and recorded every 5 min.</p><p>Fentanyl boluses of 0.5 mg/kg were given on hourly basis or on increase of heart rate (HR) or mean arterial pressure &#x0003e;20% of baseline. Atracurium boluses 0.15 mg/kg were given when more than two responses were detected on TOF stimulation. Desflurane was discontinued at skin closure, and muscle relaxant was antagonized using glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) and neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg).</p><p>Time from cessation of desflurane to beginning of spontaneous movement, time taken to respond to verbal commands, time of extubation, and time taken to reach BIS value of 70 were recorded. All infusions were discontinued after 2 h and patients were observed for 4 h after cessation of infusion for possible residual effects. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analog score (VAS), and morphine bolus was used for pain management. Total morphine requirements were recorded during 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> h after surgery.</p><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, (Version 17.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Continuous variables are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentage. Data were checked for normality before statistical analysis using Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using ANOVA.

Peck and Meltzer have reported its use as a &#x0201c;sole anesthetic&#x0201d; in humans in 1916.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Thompson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported a 60% reduction in MAC of halothane in Mg-treated rats. However, experimental animal studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. This is the first prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial to study the effect of perioperative intravenous magnesium sulfate on the MACs of desflurane using BIS monitoring.</p><p>We did not observe any significant difference in the requirement of desflurane in the three groups. Results of our study are in contrast to the study by Durmus <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] who demonstrated an increase in MAC for endotracheal intubation and surgical incision (MAC) of sevoflurane with the administration of magnesium sulfate. The increase was 10% and 15%, respectively, at dose of 50 mg/kg followed by infusion of 10 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate. Incidence of side effects was 50%, and this has been postulated to be responsible for the increased MAC levels. They also reported attenuation of presser response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Lower doses were used in our study (40 mg/kg), and thus, we did not report any side effect or any significant difference in the hemodynamic parameters among the three groups. Most of the studies demonstrating attenuation of presser response with Mg have been conducted on hypertensive patients, and this may also account for the difference in our results as none of our patients were hypertensive.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>BIS monitoring has been used in our study to assess depth of anesthesia. Durmus <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] recorded the incidence of &#x0201c;purposeful movements&#x0201d; to intubation and skin incision at different dial settings of sevoflurane and then calculated MAC of sevoflurane using logistic regression analysis. They did not administer any intravenous induction agent, muscle relaxant, or opioid. However, clinically, we administer &#x0201c;balanced anesthesia&#x0201d; to patients scheduled for operative interventions, and thus, we have administered propofol, fentanyl, and atracurium in our study.</p><p>NMDA receptor is responsible for excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS and has modulatory sites for Mg. Analgesic action of Mg is due to voltage-dependent blockade of these channels and hence prevention of nociception-associated central sensitization.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Calcium channels are involved in the modulation of nociceptive transmission, Mg is an antagonist of calcium, and this could also explain its analgesic properties. We did not report a statistically significant difference in the opioid consumption in our study. This could be attributed to the type of surgery chosen for our study, breast conservation surgeries which usually involve lumpectomy which is a less radical surgery. Studies reporting an analgesic sparing action of magnesium sulfate include patients undergoing laparotomies[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and thoracotomies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Significant reduction in total consumption of atracurium was observed in the presence of magnesium sulfate infusion in our study. Mg is known to decrease the presynaptic release of acetylcholine and reduce the sensitivity of the postjunctional membrane. It potentiates the effects of all nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator is advocated to guide further dosing.</p><p>Mg has been known as a CNS depressant, but certain properties of this ion need to be reconsidered, and its anesthetic potency needs to be re-investigated. Blood&#x02013;brain barrier limits the transport of Mg, and thus, its concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is well controlled.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Perioperative administration of magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg bolus and 15 mg/kg/h continuous infusion) has no effect on cerebrospinal fluid Mg concentrations and thus no analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>We did not measure serum Mg levels and this is one of the limitations of our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Perioperative intravenous magnesium sulfate did not affect the MACs of desflurane or perioperative opioid consumption. There was no advantage in terms of hemodynamic stability, but recovery was delayed. Thus, there is no advantage in perioperative administration of magnesium sulfate to patients anaesthetized with desflurane for breast conservation surgeries.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial
