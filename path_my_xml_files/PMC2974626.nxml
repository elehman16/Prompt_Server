<italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> is a gram positive, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that has the ability to form endospores. Due to their durability, the endospores have the potential to be weaponized and therefore pose a threat for use by terrorists and/or adversary governments. <italic>B. anthracis</italic> produces a tripartite toxin composed of: protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). The binding of PA to the target cell initiates a sequence of events that result in EF and LF accessing the cytosol of the target cell, eventually culminating in cell death <xref rid="pone.0013849-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The bio-terrorism attacks in 2001 involving spore-laden envelopes mailed to individuals in the U.S. Capitol building and elsewhere have reinforced the need for vaccination strategies to protect against anthrax exposures.</p><p>The currently licensed anthrax vaccine in the U.S., BioThrax&#x02122; (previously called anthrax vaccine adsorbed, or AVA), protects against inhalation anthrax in monkeys and rabbits <xref rid="pone.0013849-Fellows1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Ivins1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Ivins2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and a prior version of the vaccine conferred protection from occupational exposure in humans <xref rid="pone.0013849-Brachman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Biothrax&#x02122; is a cell-free filtrate and while the components of the vaccine have not been fully elucidated, the major immunogen in this vaccine is PA <xref rid="pone.0013849-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been well documented in animal challenge studies that antibodies against PA lead to protection from anthrax exposure <xref rid="pone.0013849-Keitel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The next generation of vaccines has focused on using rPA expressed in prokaryotic systems such as <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) as the sole immunogen.</p><p>The primary immunization schedule for BioThrax&#x02122; in humans is time intensive, requiring up to 5 injections spaced over an 18 month period <xref rid="pone.0013849-Anthrax1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although determined to be safe by the FDA <xref rid="pone.0013849-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and more recently by the VAERS Working Group <xref rid="pone.0013849-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, there is still controversy surrounding the safety profile of this product. Specifically, local and systemic reactions to the vaccine are reported to be more common and of longer duration compared to other experimental rPA vaccines <xref rid="pone.0013849-Zink1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Gorse1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These drawbacks, real or perceived, have stimulated a desire to develop new vaccines to prevent anthrax. These new vaccines would likely be available to U.S. defense forces, to emergency support personnel, as well as to the general public, for protection from potential bioweapon attacks.</p><p>Currently, there are two reports of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> expressed rPA vaccines in humans <xref rid="pone.0013849-Gorse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Similar humoral responses to the rPA vaccines were reported in both of these studies, despite differences in the amount of adjuvant used and the number of vaccinations. Herein, we report the results of a randomized phase I clinical trial of an <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed rPA vaccine administered to humans. The humoral responses we observed following administration of two injections of the current rPA vaccine were found to be similar to those previously reported <xref rid="pone.0013849-Gorse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, we provide data for the first time on the cellular immune response to rPA in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013849.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013849.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an anthrax vaccine in which a recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-derived, <italic>B. anthracis</italic> protective antigen is the principal antigenic component.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants and Randomization</title><p>The study enrolled 73 healthy adults age 18 to 40 years who were anthrax vaccine na&#x000ef;ve. If any participants were unable to complete the vaccine schedule for any reason, they were replaced within the study recruitment time period. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail in the included trial protocol. Briefly, individuals were required to be between 18 and 40 years of age, and in good health. Individuals who had chronic medical or psychiatric illness, required immune modulators, reported drug or alcohol abuse or were unable to meet all required protocol visits were excluded. The first 12 participants received 5 &#x000b5;g of active vaccine with or without adjuvant under open label (i.e., not blinded) to test initial safety; the remaining study subjects were blinded to receipt of vaccine or placebo. For the blinded portion of the study, the study statistician prepared a randomization list using the RANUNI function in SAS Version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC USA); only the study pharmacist and the statistician had access to this randomization list, and study personnel were unblinded only after study completion. The study plan is diagramed in a CONSORT flowchart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Safety data was analyzed and reported on every subject (73 total) at every available time point immediately after initial injection. These include immediate reactions and at 48&#x02013;72 hours and 2 weeks post each injection. Longer term safety and immune response data was collected at visits 6, 10, 16, 26, 36, and 52 weeks after the initial injection. Serious adverse events were solicited at all time points through the 52 week visit. All adverse and serious adverse events were graded on a scale that is used for rating adverse events associated with vaccines, as recommended by the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rcc.tech-res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance">http://rcc.tech-res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance</ext-link>). Immunogenicity data was analyzed and reported on all subjects who provided a sample at the time point being assessed. Two subjects were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses; one subject who was randomized to receive placebo inadvertently was administered vaccine product (50 &#x000b5;g of rPA with PBS) at the second inoculation and thus was included in safety analysis, but not immunogenicity analysis. One subject, randomized to the 100 &#x000b5;g rPA with PBS arm, had prior undisclosed anthrax vaccine exposure as determined by detectable levels of anti-rPA antibodies prior to injection of vaccine. This volunteer denied anthrax vaccine exposure at entry and after unblinding reported never being aware of receiving an anthrax vaccine. This subject was also included in safety analysis, but excluded from the immunogenicity analysis. The samples and data were collected in Rockville MD USA at the Rockville Vaccine Assessment Clinic (RVAC).</p><fig id="pone-0013849-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0013849.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT flowchart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0013849.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Trial Design</title><p>Subjects were enrolled into four sequential, escalating dosage groups (5, 25, 50 or 100 &#x000b5;g of rPA) formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Alhydrogel&#x000ae; adjuvant resulting in 8 dosage/formulation groups as well as a placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The volunteers enrolled in the initial, open-label, phase of the trial received vaccine containing the lowest antigen concentration (5 &#x000b5;g) under study. Within the subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study (25, 50 or 100 &#x000b5;g doses of rPA formulated with PBS or Alhydrogel&#x000ae;), 10&#x02013;11 volunteers were randomized at each antigen dosage level to receive placebo (PBS alone) or active agent (rPA) at one of the two formulations in a 1&#x02236;4 ratio. Each vaccine or placebo was administered as two intramuscular injections in the left deltoid four weeks apart. Safety assessment included a diary of local reactions such as pain, tenderness, or warmth and systemic reactions such as fatigue, headache, or diarrhea for one week post-immunization which was used as memory aid to identify solicited adverse events (post-injection reactions, PIRs). The PIRs were recorded separate from other adverse events (AEs) unless a PIR persisted beyond one week post-injection. Also, at each of the 13 clinic scheduled visits, samples were collected for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis and immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Vaccine</title><p>The rPA component of the vaccine formulations tested in the study was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> by Cambrex BioScience Inc, now Lonza Biologics Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). The bulk rPA was formulated (25 mM Sodium Phosphate, 150 mM Sodium Chloride, pH 8.0) and vialed at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Pilot BioProduction Facility, (Forest Glen, MD). In addition, empty vials and vials containing diluent used to prepare vaccine formulations were processed at the same facility. Alhydrogel&#x000ae; is an aluminum hydroxide preparation manufactured under cGMP by HCI BioSector (Frederikssund, Denmark). For vaccine formulations containing adjuvant, rPA was adsorbed to 1.3&#x00025; Alhydrogel&#x000ae; (w/v) resulting in formulations containing 704 &#x000b5;g of elemental aluminum per dose.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>ELISA</title><p>The validated ELISA was performed with a modified version of the protocol generously provided by Conrad Quinn and reported previously <xref rid="pone.0013849-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Immulon 2 microtiter plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were coated with rPA (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS, (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD), pH 7.4] overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing the plates three times, reference standard (Anti-AVA sera AVR801, kindly provided by Conrad Quinn, CDC, Atlanta, GA), serum samples and controls were diluted in serum diluent (5&#x00025; skim milk in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20, pH 7.4) and incubated in antigen-coated wells for one hour at 37&#x000b0;C. Plates were then washed three times with wash buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (affinity purified, gamma chain specific monoclonal antibody, clone HP6043 (Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory, Baldwin, MD) (diluted 1&#x02236;16,000 in serum diluent). After an hour incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, plates were washed three times, after which substrate (ABTS; Kirkgaard &#x00026; Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. The reactions were stopped and optical densities were read using a Molecular Devices Vmax microplate reader with Softmax Pro software (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The endpoint titers were calculated using software (ELISA for Windows) kindly provided by Conrad Quinn, CDC Atlanta, GA <xref rid="pone.0013849-Quinn2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For all calculations, values that were below the lower limit of detection were given an arbitrary value of &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and those below the limit of quantitation were given an arbitrary value of &#x0201c;5&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Toxin neutralization assay (TNA)</title><p>The validated TNA was performed using a modified version of the protocol provided by Conrad Quinn, CDC Atlanta, GA <xref rid="pone.0013849-Quinn2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Briefly, J774A.1 cells (mouse macrophage/monocyte cells &#x02013; ATCC TIB-67) were used as targets for toxicity mediated by rPA and recombinant lethal factor (rLF). A working solution of anthrax toxin with a final concentration of rPA and rLF (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA) at 0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml and 0.08 &#x000b5;g/ml, respectively was used in the assay. Sample sera were diluted with a six-point 2-fold dilution scheme. Anti-AVA sera pool AVR801 was used as a positive control and standard curve. Normal human serum (NHS, Sigma, MO) was used as a negative control. The working solution of toxin was added to plates that contained serially diluted sample serum and after a 30 min incubation, the toxin/sera was added to J77A.1 cells and incubated for four hrs at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell viability was assessed by adding 25 &#x000b5;l of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and incubating for an additional two hrs at 37&#x000b0;C. Prior to addition of 100 &#x000b5;l Solubilization Buffer [50&#x00025; N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 20&#x00025; SDS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 4.7], which allows for visualization of MTT color changes, media was removed from plates by gently inverting and tapping the plates onto a paper towel. Plates were read using a Molecular Devices Vmax microplate reader with Softmax Pro software. The ED<sub>50</sub> for antibody-mediated protection from killing was calculated using the &#x0201c;c&#x0201d; parameter (or the mid-point) from the serum sample ODs plotted in a 4-parameter curve from the Softmax Pro software. For all calculations, values that were below the lower limit of detection were given an arbitrary value of &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and those below the limit of quantitation were given an arbitrary value of &#x0201c;10&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Lymphocyte proliferation assay (LPA)</title><p>The LPA was modified from previously published assays <xref rid="pone.0013849-RattoKim1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Briefly, whole blood was collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD) citrate tubes and PBMC were separated by ficoll-hypaque density centrifugation. Five million PBMC were set-aside for LPA and the remaining PBMC were cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen. Triplicate wells of 100,000 fresh PBMC were incubated in 96-well U-bottom plates with the following antigens or mitogens: 1, 5 or 10 &#x000b5;g/ml of rPA (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA), 2.5 or 5 &#x000b5;g/ml of tetanus toxin (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA). In separate plates 100,000 fresh PBMC were stimulated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml phytohaemagglutinin, 1.25 mg/ml pokeweed mitogen and 20 &#x000b5;g/ml concavalinA. After three and six days of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C respectively for the mitogens and antigens, cells were pulsed with one &#x000b5;Ci/well of [3H]-thymidine for six hr. Radioactivity incorporated into dividing cells was assessed by measuring counts per minute (cpm) in a Wallac Micobeta (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) scintillation counter. The data is expressed as a lymphocyte stimulation index [LSI &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; (mean cpm of stimulated cells)/(mean cpm of unstimulated cells)] to define antigen specificity. Samples were designated as positive if the LSI was greater than or equal to 5. Assays were considered invalid if there was documentation of technical failure due to lack of tritium incorporation, high background cpm, not enough cells to complete the assay or lack of response to the mitogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was approved by independent institutional review boards both at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Human Subjects Review Board of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.

Of the 73 participants enrolled in the study, 60 (82.2&#x00025;) completed all vaccinations and follow-up visits, providing samples for immunogenicity assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Safety and adverse events</title><p>Common local and systemic adverse events associated with vaccines were solicited by clinic staff with the aid of diary cards filled out by the volunteer and referred to as &#x0201c;post-injection reactions&#x0201d; or PIRs. PIRs were defined as adverse events (AEs) that occurred within the first 6 days after vaccination, which, due to the close temporal (and as applicable, spatial) relation to injection, were regarded as probably or definitely related to inoculation as determined by the principal investigator. If any PIR had a duration that lasted beyond 6 days post vaccination, it was recorded as both a PIR and an AE. All local PIRs were of mild severity. Overall, 47/62 (76&#x00025;) rPA recipients had a local PIR, the majority of these subjects (40/47: 85&#x00025;) experienced tenderness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Warmth, pain and erythema were the next most common PIRs observed. The most common local PIRs for placebo recipients were tenderness (5/11, 45&#x00025;) and warmth (2/11, 18&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The rate of local reactions for placebo recipients (7/11: 64&#x00025;) was not statistically different from those of vaccine recipients (Fisher's exact test, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.46). Overall, 28/62 (45&#x00025;) of rPA recipients and 4/11 (36&#x00025;) of placebo recipients experienced a systemic PIR again with no statistical difference between rPA and placebo recipients (Fisher's exact test, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.75). The most common systemic PIR was fatigue for both vaccine (13/62, 20&#x00025;) and placebo (3/11, 27&#x00025;) recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Considering all three assays for immunogenicity, there was only one participant who received rPA (in the 25 &#x000b5;g PBS formulation group) that did not respond to the immunogen. The toxin neutralization assay (TNA) was able to detect responses in sera from all vaccinees, except the previously mentioned participant. The lymphocyte proliferation assays (LPA) response rate was lower compared to the other two assays, especially at the higher concentrations of rPA (50 &#x000b5;g and 100 &#x000b5;g). No rPA specific immune responses were detected by TNA or LPA in placebo recipients (data not shown); however, detectable, but unquantifiable, levels of anti-rPA specific antibodies were found in two participants who received placebo. For one of these participants, this activity was found in a single sample obtained prior to initiation of study injections, while for the other participant, the levels of anti-rPA antibody became quantifiable at a low level (15 &#x000b5;g/ml of anti-rPA antibodies) transiently. However, this sample was approximately 30 days post placebo injection (data not shown), indicating that these measurements were most likely due to non-specific binding.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Humoral Immunogenicity</title><p>Anti-rPA specific antibodies responses among rPA recipients are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The peak geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-rPA antibodies was observed 2 weeks after the second vaccination and diminished over time to low, but detectable, levels by the final study visit. Antibody levels were quite low after the initial injection, while the second vaccination elicited a much stronger immune response. For all rPA doses, inclusion of adjuvant with the rPA stimulated GMCs equal to, and in most cases higher than GMC produced following receipt of rPA alone at 2 weeks post-second immunization. This was most pronounced in the 5 &#x000b5;g and 25 &#x000b5;g groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g005">5</xref>).

The relative difference between the two formulations was maintained for all groups through the final visit. Participants who received 5 &#x000b5;g rPA (both formulations) or 25 &#x000b5;g rPA with PBS no longer had quantifiable levels of anti-rPA antibodies at the final visit. Of the 24 volunteers within the groups who received the lower two doses of rPA, only 3 (12.5&#x00025;) had both detectable and quantifiable concentrations of anti-rPA antibodies, all of whom were in the Alhydrogel&#x000ae;-formulated 25 &#x000b5;g rPA group. Of the volunteers within the groups who received the higher two doses of rPA formulated with PBS, 8 out of 14 (57&#x00025;) had both detectable and quantifiable concentrations of anti-rPA antibodies at the final visit as compared to 9 out of 12 (75&#x00025;) of the dose-matched group who received rPA formulated with adjuvant (data not shown). Overall, the volunteers who received either the 50 &#x000b5;g or 100 &#x000b5;g dose of rPA, regardless of formulation, had significantly higher GMCs of anti-rPA specific antibodies at the final visit than those who received 5 &#x000b5;g and 25 &#x000b5;g of rPA (Kruskal-Wallis p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0063).

We show here, as have others <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that formulation with Alhydrogel&#x000ae; tended to enhance antibody responses, especially at 5 &#x000b5;g and the 25 &#x000b5;g dosage levels where, at 2 weeks post-second vaccination (near the presumed peak of immunogenicity), the GMCs of anti-rPA antibodies were nearly a log higher in the groups receiving Alhydrogel&#x000ae;-formulated rPA than those in groups receiving PBS-formulated rPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g004">Figure 4</xref>). At later post-vaccination time points, the concentration of rPA antigen appears to influence the levels of anti-rPA antibodies more than the presence of adjuvant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g005">Figure 5</xref>), however, due to the narrow range of GMCs for all eight groups it is unknown if there is biological relevance in terms of potential protection between these values.</p><p>The relatively rapid decrease in anti-rPA antibody titers after receipt of the second injection that we observed in this study has been recognized previously <xref rid="pone.0013849-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the current Biothrax&#x02122; vaccination schedule, injections are given at 0, 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months with annual boosts recommended to maintain high levels of anti-PA antibodies <xref rid="pone.0013849-Anthrax1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

The fourth injection was shown to be critical for maintenance of higher levels of antibodies for prolonged periods of time <xref rid="pone.0013849-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However after only two Biothrax&#x02122; vaccinations, protection was still achieved with challenges two years post-vaccination in rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0013849-Ivins1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013849-Belton1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> despite relatively low levels of anti-PA antibodies present in the monkeys at the time.

A recent study using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against PA in rabbits and monkeys found that a concentration of 40 mg/kg lead to 100&#x00025; protection in rabbits and 90&#x00025; protection in cynomolgus monkeys. While the dosage groups in our study did not reach this level of antibody, protection in the setting of a vaccine involves not only neutralizing antibodies present at the time of exposure, but also the time involved with stimulating the memory immune response. Interestingly, humans vaccinated with the United Kingdom's licensed human anthrax vaccine had measurable T cell immune responses 10&#x02013;15 years after vaccination without boosts <xref rid="pone.0013849-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the third published study that examines the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant PA vaccine. Some trends become evident by comparing the studies. First, as has been noted <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, increased amounts of Alhydrogel&#x000ae; within the rPA vaccine formulation enhances humoral immunogenicity. Formulation of 704 &#x000b5;g (used in this study) or 800 &#x000b5;g <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> of elemental aluminum with 50 &#x000b5;g of rPA resulted in higher GMCs of anti-rPA binding antibodies and higher GMTs of neutralizing antibodies than formulation with 82.5 &#x000b5;g of Alhydrogel&#x000ae; <xref rid="pone.0013849-Gorse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> with rPA after two immunizations. To achieve similar GMCs and GMTs using less Alhydrogel&#x000ae;, a third immunization is required <xref rid="pone.0013849-Gorse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Second, when rPA is formulated with at least 704 &#x000b5;g of Alhydrogel&#x000ae;, doses of rPA above 50 &#x000b5;g unexpectedly show a slight decrease in immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0013849-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) instead of an increase.</p><p>The cellular response to anthrax toxins has rarely been studied, most likely because the role that anti-PA antibodies play in protection has been so well documented <xref rid="pone.0013849-Keitel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the cellular response is critical for the support of antibody production. Studies of cell-mediated immune responses in individuals exposed to anthrax spores from bio-terrorism attacks in the Capitol building in 2001 demonstrated that the CD4&#x0002b; immune response is potently stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by anthrax spores <xref rid="pone.0013849-Doolan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The magnitude of cell-mediated responses elicited from rPA-based vaccines in humans has yet to be reported. Here we have seen that the groups of participants who received the higher doses of adjuvanted rPA had fewer responses than those who received the lower doses of adjuvanted rPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013849-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This trend does not correlate with the ELISA or TNA data, where the higher doses of rPA resulted in higher humoral responses. Additionally, results with the higher doses of the non-adjuvanted rPA are somewhat conflicting. The 50 &#x000b5;g dose has fewer responders, appearing to follow the trend observed in the higher doses of the Alhydrogel&#x000ae;-formulated rPA. The 100 &#x000b5;g PBS-formulated dose, however, showed only one non-responder, similar to the lower doses (both formulations). The assessment of T cell stimulation through LPA provides indirect evidence of T cell help induced by the vaccine regimen. However, the observed T cell response did not directly correlate with the humoral response. Additionally, these data conflict with the data generated from spore exposure in humans <xref rid="pone.0013849-Doolan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. It is probable that spores activate the T-helper cell response more potently than does rPA alone. One caveat is that the sample size for each group is quite small (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5&#x02013;8, depending on the group), thus the current trends may be different than trends that would be observed in larger datasets. Further experiments are required to explore this issue.</p><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> derived rPA product evaluated for the first time in humans in this study was safe, well-tolerated and produced humoral immune responses comparable to those observed in previous human trials of other recombinant PA vaccines. Based on the safety and immunogenicity data described here, 50 &#x000b5;g of rPA formulated with Alhydrogel&#x000ae; would provide the best immune response while minimizing the amount of antigen administered. Further study of this product with a late boost or novel adjuvants may enhance durability and peak immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013849.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.22 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013849.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013849.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(10.72 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013849.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Conrad Quinn for his very generous help with getting the ELISA and TNA operational including sharing of protocols, software and precious reagents.
