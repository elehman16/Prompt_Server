Robenacoxib is a NSAID with high selectivity for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzyme. In this study, the efficacy and safety of robenacoxib were evaluated in a prospective, randomised, active- and placebo-controlled masked clinical trial in 147 cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Cats were randomised into two treatment groups: Group 1, robenacoxib (2 mg/kg) administered via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection before surgery, followed by robenacoxib tablets (1&#x02013;2.4 mg/kg) administered post-operatively for approximately 9 days (n = 101) and Group 2, meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg) administered s.c. before surgery, followed by placebo tablets administered post-operatively for approximately 9 days (n = 46). Cats were assessed using numerical rating scales (NRSs) by clinicians before surgery and at 3, 8, 22 and 28 hours after surgery and at the final visit (VF on approximately Day 10), and daily by their owners from Day 1 to the VF.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary end point was the global investigator score which was the sum of clinician NRSs for posture, behaviour and pain on palpation/manipulation. The efficacy of the single robenacoxib injection, assessed during 3 to 22&#x000a0;hours, was statistically non-inferior to meloxicam, with a relative efficacy of 1.029 (95% confidence interval, 0.847&#x02013;1.231). No significant differences were detected during the follow-up treatment with robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9&#x000a0;days compared with placebo via clinician assessments at 28&#x000a0;hours and the VF, or in owner assessments on Days 1&#x02013;VF. There were no significant differences in frequencies of reported adverse events, clinical observations and haematology or clinical chemistry variables between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single s.c. injection of robenacoxib before surgery had non-inferior efficacy compared with meloxicam in controlling post-operative pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Follow-up treatment with oral robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9&#x000a0;days was well tolerated, but there were no differences in the efficacy scores after Day 1 compared with the group receiving meloxicam s.c. followed by placebo control.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cat</kwd><kwd>Coxib</kwd><kwd>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Peri-operative</kwd><kwd>Robenacoxib</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to manage pain, inflammation and fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the recognised need for effective drugs of this class in cats, there are relatively few preclinical and clinical studies on NSAIDs in this species and fewer approved NSAIDs in cats compared with dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One reason for the limited availability of feline NSAIDs is the low safety indices of many NSAIDs in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Robenacoxib is a NSAID of the Coxib class which is registered for use in cats and dogs. Owing to its availability as injection and tablet formulations with proven efficacy and good safety, robenacoxib has an interesting profile for use in cats. Robenacoxib is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection and oral administration in cats, with mean time to maximal concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) values of 1 and 0.5&#x000a0;hours, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Robenacoxib demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activity in cats in a kaolin-induced paw inflammation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In clinical trials, non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib compared with ketoprofen was observed in acute musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and superior efficacy against pain was reported versus meloxicam in cats undergoing surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Superiority of robenacoxib tablets versus placebo was also demonstrated in cats undergoing surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Robenacoxib has a high safety index in healthy cats: oral dosages up to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for 42&#x000a0;days were well tolerated compared with the recommended dosage of 1&#x02013;2.4&#x000a0;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The good safety profile of robenacoxib may be attributed to its combination of enzyme specificity (for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)), short half-life (~1.5&#x000a0;hour) in blood and selective tissue distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the field efficacy and safety of robenacoxib in controlling peri-operative pain and inflammation associated with orthopaedic surgery in cats. Robenacoxib (s.c. followed by tablets) was compared with meloxicam (s.c. followed by placebo tablets). Meloxicam is a preferential inhibitor of COX-2, with a long terminal plasma half-life in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a multi-centre, prospective, randomised, masked, parallel-group design clinical trial comparing two treatment groups. Group 1 received robenacoxib by s.c. injection pre-operatively, followed by robenacoxib tablets administered post-operatively. Group 2 received pre-operative meloxicam by s.c. injection, followed by post-operative placebo tablets. Meloxicam was selected as the active control as meloxicam 5&#x000a0;mg/mL solution for injection is registered for single use at a dose of 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg, administered before surgery, for the reduction of post-operative pain after ovariohysterectomy and minor orthopaedic surgery in the European Union (EU), and for the control of post-operative pain and inflammation associated with orthopaedic surgery, ovariohysterectomy and castration in the United States (US). At the time the study was initiated, meloxicam was not registered for post-operative use in cats in the EU (or the US). Therefore robenacoxib (s.c. injection followed by tablets) was compared to single pre-operative meloxicam by s.c. injection followed by administration of placebo tablets. The administration of placebo tablets to Group 2 was considered acceptable on welfare grounds because of the absence of registered products at the time of the study and the fact that meloxicam has a long duration of action in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clinicians were instructed to administer additional analgesia of their choice as rescue therapy at any time, if judged to be needed.</p><p>The study was authorised by the French (Agence Nationale du M&#x000e9;dicaments V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaire, authorization # EC/05/043) and United Kingdom (UK) (Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Animal Test Certificate Vm12501/0038) regulatory authorities and internal Novartis reviews based on scientific, ethical and animal welfare guidelines.</p><p>The study was also conducted in compliance with: (a) the EMEA/CVMP/237/01 document, Guideline for the Conduct of Efficacy Studies for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs; (b) the document, Procedures and Principles of Good Clinical Practice as detailed in the Veterinary International Conference on Harmonization Guideline on Good Clinical Practices (GL9)&#x02014;CVMP/VICH/595/98; and (c) the Guideline on Statistical Principles for Veterinary Clinical Trials (EMEA/CVMP/816/00). All owners gave written informed consent to include their cats in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Animals</title><p>The inclusion criteria for cats were age &#x02265;6&#x000a0;weeks, body weight 2.5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;kg, either sex, any breed, presenting for major orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia. The exclusion criteria for cats were pregnant or lactating or females intended for breeding; with severe concomitant disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, kidney or liver insufficiency); treated before study commencement with local or systemic NSAIDs or opioids (within 24&#x000a0;hours, apart from butorphanol in the UK as part of the pre-anaesthetic regimen), corticosteroids (short-acting systemic or locally acting within 30&#x000a0;days, long-acting within 60&#x000a0;days); and undergoing repeated surgeries within a few days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation and blinding procedures</title><p>Animals were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups in a 2:1 robenacoxib:meloxicam ratio from computer-generated randomisation lists. The 2:1 ratio was used to obtain data in more cats receiving robenacoxib and was predicted to cause only a modest (approximately 10%) reduction in statistical efficiency compared to a 1:1 ratio. Case allocation was stratified according to the investigation centre and the anticipated duration of surgery (&#x0003c;45&#x000a0;minutes, &#x0003e;45&#x000a0;minutes). Investigators were blinded to the block length, which was six. The robenacoxib and meloxicam solutions for injection have a different appearance. Masking was therefore maintained by the &#x02018;blinding by function&#x02019; technique: a clinician was responsible for clinical assessments, whereas a separate dispenser was responsible for treatment prescription, administration and compliance control. For the oral treatment, both placebo and robenacoxib tablets had the same appearance and packaging, therefore owners were blinded to the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Drugs and administration procedures</title><p>Investigational drugs were a parenteral formulation of robenacoxib<sup>a</sup>, a tablet formulation of robenacoxib<sup>b</sup>, a parenteral formulation of meloxicam<sup>c</sup> and placebo tablets<sup>d</sup>. Target and actual dosages are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The s.c. injections of robenacoxib and meloxicam were given between the shoulder blades, shortly before the induction of anaesthesia. Owners were instructed to administer tablets either with no food or with only a small quantity of food. Cats received once daily one (body weight, 2.5&#x02013;6.0&#x000a0;kg) or two (body weight, &#x0003e;6.0-12.0&#x000a0;kg) tablets containing robenacoxib or placebo for 9&#x000a0;days (range, 7&#x02013;11 days). There was no mandatory anaesthetic regimen, but times of anaesthetic induction, duration of anaesthesia and recovery from anaesthesia were recorded.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Both drugs provided good efficacy, as evidenced from low scores for pain and inflammation post-surgery and low frequency of rescue therapy.</p><p>The primary end point, the global investigator score, was the unweighted sum of three secondary end points (behaviour, posture and pain on palpation). This end point fulfilled normal distribution assumptions after log transformation, permitting non-inferiority of the robenacoxib injection versus meloxicam to be tested (and demonstrated) using the powerful parametric RMANCOVA analysis. The relative efficacy (95% CI) of robenacoxib versus meloxicam was 1.029 (0.847-1.231), showing numerical but not significantly superior efficacy of robenacoxib. All five secondary investigator end points showed significant deviation from a normal distribution even after transformation, therefore statistical comparison between groups for these end points had to be based on lack of significant differences using the non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney test.</p><p>Meloxicam injection was selected as the positive control as it is registered and extensively used, and its efficacy is documented in the literature in cats. The superiority of meloxicam by injection at the 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg dose versus placebo was demonstrated in experimental models of endotoxin-induced fever (intravenous administration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and kaolin-induced fever, pain and inflammation (s.c. administration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The superiority of meloxicam injection in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy was also reported versus placebo and buprenorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, equivalent efficacy of meloxicam has been reported in cats compared with butorphanol for onychectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and compared with carprofen, ketoprofen and tolfenamic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], carprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and tolfenamic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for ovariohysterectomy. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence published for the efficacy of meloxicam to control pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery to justify its use as a positive control for this study. However, in none of the mentioned published studies were the same scoring schemes used as in our study. In optimally designed non-inferiority studies, the methods and outcome measures should be similar to those used in the original studies of the active control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although the primary objective of the study was the non-inferiority comparison of robenacoxib injection versus meloxicam injection, the effects of follow-up treatment with robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9&#x000a0;days were assessed as a secondary objective. During the following examinations by the clinician at V5 (28&#x000a0;hours post-surgery) and VF, non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib versus the control group was demonstrated for pain on palpation and overall pain control. Non-inferiority was also shown for inflammation intensity which was assessed at VF. Comparison of robenacoxib tablets versus placebo tablets from Day 1 to VF showed low scores on all days with no significant differences between groups. This result may reflect the possibility that a single pre-surgical administration of robenacoxib or meloxicam was sufficient to control post-operative pain and inflammation in most cats. However, it is also recognised that the methods for assessment of efficacy after Day 1 were not optimal; the veterinarians made only assessments at V5 and VF, and the owner evaluations assessed animal demeanour and general well-being (level of activity, behaviour, appetite, and interaction) and did not monitor anti-hyperalgesic actions. The benefit of administration of robenacoxib tablets for 2&#x000a0;days after surgery in cats was demonstrated statistically versus placebo in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Anaesthesia and surgery are both potential stressors. Therefore plasma cortisol, a stressor glucocorticoid biomarker, was measured at four pre-determined times to compare the effects of the two NSAIDs. In both the groups, mean values remained relatively constant at the first three sampling times (T0, T1 and V5) and then increased moderately but significantly at VF. Differences between groups were not statistically significant. Lower plasma cortisol concentrations post-surgery were reported previously in cats receiving meloxicam compared with butorphanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], vedaprofen compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and fentanyl compared to control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the relevance of plasma cortisol is not clear, as no differences in plasma cortisol concentrations between surgery and control cats were reported in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>There were no significant differences in the frequency of reported adverse events in the two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.070). Several clinical chemistry and haematology variables increased compared with baseline in both the groups, and these changes were attributed to the anaesthetic protocols and surgical procedures rather than the NSAIDs. The only significant differences between the two groups were higher values for plasma creatinine and urea in the meloxicam group. These results may be type I errors, as the frequency is consistent with the multiple analyses (17 variables at two time points) and an alpha value of 5%.</p><p>The rationale for the development of highly COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as robenacoxib, is that they should offer the same efficacy but better safety than older less selective NSAIDs, such as meloxicam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The finding of no significant differences in tolerability between robenacoxib and meloxicam&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo in this study is not surprising however, as the study was underpowered to detect differences in safety parameters, with only 147 cats and a relatively short treatment duration (maximum 12&#x000a0;days). In addition, we did not include specific safety investigations, for example gastroscopy, which might have revealed differences in tolerability.</p><p>The major limitations of the study are discussed here. First, the scoring schemes used have not been validated in cats. Second, the frequency of assessments was relatively sparse, especially the follow-up from Day 2 onwards, and consisted of daily assessments of the cat&#x02019;s demeanour and general well-being by the owner. Third, with the exception of the primary end point (the global investigator score), statistical comparisons of efficacy data had to rely on non-parametric statistics because of lack of normal distribution of the data. Reliable non-inferiority analyses could only be performed using RMANCOVA for the primary end point. Fourth, the limitations of non-inferiority studies using positive controls are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study the proven non-inferiority of robenacoxib versus meloxixam could be due to the fact that both NSAIDs were similarly effective or ineffective, or alternatively that the study lacked sensitivity. It was judged that the use of a placebo pre-surgery would have been unethical, as a number of NSAIDs are registered for pre-operative use in cats in the EU and are widely used. In addition, as noted previously, the efficacy of both meloxicam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and robenacoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in cats versus placebo has been shown previously A feature of our study was the choice of a non-inferiority threshold (&#x003b4;) value of 0.25. The &#x003b4; value should reflect the largest margin that is clinically acceptable, but to date no specific guidelines on &#x003b4; values for veterinary NSAIDs have been published. In fact, the results show that non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib to the positive control would also have been achieved if we had defined &#x003b4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16 for the primary end point, that is with a maximum of 16% difference in the global investigator score. Furthermore, robenacoxib had numerical superiority to meloxicam for the primary end point (relative efficacy 1.029), which supports the conclusion of non-inferior efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single s.c. injection of robenacoxib (2&#x000a0;mg/kg) before surgery had good tolerability and non-inferior efficacy compared with meloxicam (0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg) for the control of pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Follow-up treatment with oral robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9&#x000a0;days was well tolerated, but there were no differences in the efficacy scores after Day 1 compared with the group receiving meloxicam s.c. followed by placebo control. This might be the result of single pre-surgical administration of robenacoxib leading to adequate control of pain and inflammation in most cats. However, it is also recognised that the methods for assessment of efficacy after Day 1 were not optimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Endnotes</title><p><sup>a</sup>Onsior&#x000ae; solution for injection 2%, Novartis Animal Health Inc, Basel, Switzerland.</p><p><sup>b</sup>Onsior&#x000ae; non-divisible tablets containing 6&#x000a0;mg of robenacoxib, Novartis Animal Health Inc, Basel, Switzerland.</p><p><sup>c</sup>Metacam&#x000ae; 5&#x000a0;mg/mL injectable, Boehringer Ingelheim Inc, Ingelheim, Germany.</p><p><sup>d</sup>Placebo tablets manufactured by Novartis Animal Health Inc, Basel, Switzerland with identical appearance to the Onsior&#x000ae; tablets</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP</term><def><p>Alkaline phosphatase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p>Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p>Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COX-2</term><def><p>Cyclo-oxygenase-2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Maximal concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>European Union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRT</term><def><p>Mean residence time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p>Numerical rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMANCOVA</term><def><p>Repeated measures analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>s.c</term><def><p>Subcutaneous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T</term><def><p>Time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Time of maximal concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>V</term><def><p>Visit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VF</term><def><p>Final visit</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>All authors are employees of Novartis Animal Health Inc, now owned by Elanco Animal Health, which manufactures and distributes robenacoxib (Onsior&#x000ae;).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The study was designed by JMG and JNK.
