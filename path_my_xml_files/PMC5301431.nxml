Tropical and subtropical countries also have a significant burden of disease from influenza but the epidemiology is much more variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This includes multiple annual influenza seasons and year-round virus activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The implications of this for influenza vaccination schedules have not been tested in randomised clinical trials but are likely to be important in older people and in other populations with impaired vaccine responses.</p><p>Year-round influenza virus activity implies that an effective vaccine must also provide year-round protection. However, the duration of protection provided by the influenza vaccine has not been well established. No clinical studies of vaccine efficacy or effectiveness are available from countries with year-round influenza activity, but over the course of a single winter season declining vaccine effectiveness has been reported from test-negative case control studies in Europe and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, in Spain vaccine effectiveness was 61% (95% CI 5 to 84) in the first 100 days after vaccination, 42% (95% CI &#x02212;39 to 75) between 100 and 119 days, and 0% thereafter. This decline in effectiveness mainly affected older people aged over 65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In response to these reports, the I-MOVE multicentre, test-negative, case-control study reviewed data collected from more than 11,000 seasonal influenza infections over 2010&#x02013;2015 in eight European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza A/H3N2 and B infection declined across all age groups as the winter season progressed. This decline was most marked in older people, with little vaccine effectiveness evident by day 140 (subtype A/H3N2) or day 200 (influenza B). Surprisingly, vaccine effectiveness appeared to be maintained (over 200 days) for subtype A/H1N1. The authors hypothesise that this may reflect the homogeneity of the A/H1N1 strain (pdm2009) across the period of the study, with repeated vaccination (or infections) boosting strain-specific antibody titres.</p><p>As an alternative to clinical effectiveness, the trajectory of immune responses after vaccination can be used to estimate the duration of protection. The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre is the major immune correlate of protection, and is used by regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for influenza vaccine licensing. A titre &#x02265;1:40 is estimated to offer 50% protection against infection, and this threshold is conventionally labelled as &#x02018;seroprotection&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A systematic review of vaccine antibody persistence studies, performed by the study team in preparation for this trial, suggested that in older people there is a steady decline in HI titres, and at between 180 and 360 days titres return to the pre-vaccination level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies have identified increasing age and lower pre-existing HI titres as predicting reduced duration of antibody persistence, while the impact of comorbidities, such as diabetes, on persistence is less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The study aims to assess the effect of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) booster at 180 days on HI antibody titres for each of the influenza strains present in the administered vaccine in adults, aged 65 years and older.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>

Each study participant who meets eligibility criteria and signs the Informed Consent Form will be allocated to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants will be followed for 1 year, with five scheduled visits. All participants will provide blood samples for immunogenicity assessment at days 1 (pre-injection), 28, 180 (pre-injection), 208, and 360 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Stratified randomisation by age at enrolment day 1</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1808_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) will be collected for all participants for 7 days after each vaccination. All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected for 28 days after each vaccination. SAEs that are considered related to vaccination and/or study procedures will be monitored until resolution or stable. Participants will also be contacted 2-weekly as surveillance for clinical endpoints, including influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p>A web-based, computer-generated randomisation code will assign participants using a random permuted block method. Allocation will be stratified by age (65 years or under to 74 years, 75 years or older). Age is a significant predictor of response to vaccination, and the proportion of participants recruited who are older than 75 years may be small.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>To minimise the potential for unintentional bias an observer-blind procedure will be followed. The participant, investigators, study staff members, and laboratory personnel will all be blinded to group assignment. One or more unblinded vaccine administrators will perform randomisation and will be responsible for both preparing and administering the blinded vaccine. This person will not be authorised to collect any safety data or to perform any other study procedures. This person will not provide any information about the contents of the syringe to study participants or personnel, and will not allow anyone to see the content of the syringe. Blinded study personnel will not be present during product preparation and administration. The vaccine will be administered in a private setting with no observers present. Contents of the syringe will be masked with an opaque tape to ensure participant blinding to group allocation. The unblinded staff will ensure that vaccination documents revealing participant group assignment are stored in a secure place to which only they have access.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Unblinding procedures</title><p>The vaccine blind will be broken by the investigator in the event of an SAE if identification of the vaccine received could influence treatment of the SAE, or in the event of death or a life-threatening SAE where the investigator&#x02019;s causality assessment is &#x02018;related&#x02019; to the trial product. Vaccine blind will also be broken at the request of the health authority in the event of an SAE. Code-breaking will be limited, when possible, to the participant(s) experiencing the SAE. Any intentional or unintentional code breaking will be reported to the Domain Specific Review Boards (DSRB).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Potential risks</title><p>As with any vaccination, participants may experience pain, swelling, redness or itching at the injection site. Rarely, a participant may experience an allergic reaction which produces rash, urticaria or difficulty breathing. Serious allergic reactions that can be life-threatening may occur. The incidence of severe adverse reactions are low with the trial vaccines. An increased risk of SAEs has not been reported from studies of repeated vaccination at 1 year or earlier. The risk of nonsevere local and systemic adverse reactions may be increased with repeated vaccination as a result of increased reactogenicity from pre-existing immunity. Blood taking is a common medical procedure with very low risk of complications, such as prolonged bleeding or infection, when standard procedures are followed. Risks of breaches in trial participant confidentiality will be ameliorated by following the Singapore Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (SGGCP) and the DSRB-approved study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Potential benefits</title><p>There is a possibility that the booster vaccine administered in the experimental arm will prevent an influenza infection that might otherwise have occurred. There is also a possibility that the vaccine administered in the control arm will prevent a tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis episode that might otherwise have occurred. Participants will not be paid for participation in this study, but will be reimbursed for their time and travel costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study population</title><p>Two hundred participants will be enrolled (approximately 100 per group). The study population will be drawn from people attending outpatient services at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore and healthy volunteers from senior activity centres and community clubs in Singapore. There are no participant restrictions based on sex or race. A complete review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility will be performed. This will entail a face-to-face interview with the potential participant and screening of electronic medical records. The potential participant will be provided with information about the trial and written informed consent obtained.

</p><p>Participants will receive one injection of 0.5 ml standard dose, inactivated IIV3 at days 1, and no or one injection at day 180 depending on group allocation. Participants will receive no or one injection of 0.5 ml Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (TDap) at 180 days depending on group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Treatment compliance and specific restrictions</title><p>The following measures will ensure that the vaccine doses administered comply with those planned, and that any noncompliance is documented so that it can be accounted for in the data analyses. All vaccines will be administered by qualified trial personnel, the person in charge of product management will maintain accountability records of product delivery to the trial site, product inventory at the site, doses given to each participant, and the disposal of unused or wasted doses. Participants will be asked not to take any influenza vaccinations except as provided by the study team for the duration of the study. This restriction will not apply in the event of a national immunisation programme by the Ministry of Health for a pandemic influenza vaccine. There are no restrictions on other vaccines. If prescribed at the same visit they will be administered to a separate body site. There are no limitations on medications, herbs, vitamins, and mineral supplements while participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Safety measurements</title><p>AEs, SAEs and &#x02018;Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Participants or Others&#x02019; (UPIRTSO) events are defined below. Events will be reviewed and graded by the principal investigator (PI) or other investigator. Only members of the study team blinded to participant group allocation will be involved in safety assessment. Severity will be classified using the Common Terminology for Adverse Events version 4.03. The relationship of the event to the study drug, and whether the event is an expected event or not, will be assessed using the list of AEs contained in the product summary of characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Adverse event (AE)</title><p>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a trial product. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this product. Pre-existing medical conditions are not reported as an AE; an AE may be a new illness, the worsening of a concomitant illness or an effect of vaccination. All AEs include serious and nonserious AEs. Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are the action taken to treat a medical condition. The condition leading to the surgical procedure is the AE, if it occurs during the trial period. AEs will be further categorised as solicited and unsolicited AEs.</p><p>A solicited AE is a reaction that is prelisted in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). It is defined by nature and time of onset post vaccination, and is considered to be related to vaccination. Unsolicited AEs are all observed AEs which do not fulfil the conditions for a solicited AE, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Serious adverse events (SAEs)</title><p>A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life-threatening (immediate risk of death), requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event. Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalisation. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardise the participant and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Collecting, recording and reporting of SAEs to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA)</title><p>All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported to the HSA within 15 calendar days after initial notification to the PI. For fatal or life-threatening cases, the HSA will be notified as soon as possible, but no later than seven calendar days after first knowledge that a case qualifies. A complete report will then follow within eight additional calendar days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Collecting, recording and reporting of UPIRTSO events to the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Boards (NHG DSRB)</title><p>Any events that are unexpected (in terms of severity or frequency), that can be reasonably attributed to the study drug and that may expose other participants to harm will be reported. A UPIRTSO event refers to problems, in general, that include any incident, experience, or outcome (including AEs) which meet all of the following criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency of the problem as described in the study documentation (e.g. protocol, consent documents, etc.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Related or possibly related to participation in the research. Possibly related means that there is a reasonable possibility that the problem may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Risk of harm. This suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognised</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>For urgent reporting, all problems involving local deaths, whether related or not, should be reported immediately &#x02013; within 24 h after first knowledge by the investigator. For expedited reporting, all other problems must be reported as soon as possible but not later than seven calendar days after first becoming known to the investigator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Safety assessment methods</title><p>To ensure participants&#x02019; safety, there will be an immediate post-vaccination surveillance period. Participants will be kept under observation for 15 min after each vaccination. AEs will not be actively solicited during this surveillance period. To collect solicited AEs, all participants will be provided with a safety diary card, a digital thermometer, and a flexible ruler and will be instructed how to use them. The following items will be recorded in the diary card on the day of vaccination and for the next 6 days or until resolution: daily temperature with the route by which it was taken; daily measurement or intensity grade of all other solicited injection site and systemic reactions; action taken for each event (e.g. medication), if any. To collect unsolicited AEs, all participants will be instructed to record any unsolicited AEs that may occur for 7 days after each vaccination. Space will be provided in the diary card for this purpose. AEs which are likely to be related to trial products, whether serious or not, will be followed up by the investigator until their complete disappearance or stabilisation. Information on all SAEs and UPIRTSO events will be collected and assessed throughout the trial, from enrolment until the final study visit (day 360).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Safety monitoring plan</title><p>All vaccines used in this study are part of routine vaccination schedules. Safety data has been established from millions of administered doses. According to the WHO, the incidence of vaccine-related SAEs, such as anaphylaxis and GBS, is approximately 1 per million doses. The rate of mild, nonsevere AEs in clinical trials is similar between influenza vaccine and placebo. Vaccine-related SAEs are not expected in a clinical trial of this size. AEs will be monitored for the first 7 days after each vaccination. SAEs will be monitored for the first 28 days after each vaccination. An interim safety analysis will not be performed. The study team will review any UPIRTSO events and stop the trial if significant risk to participants from continuing in the trial is suspected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Data entry and storage</title><p>Paper Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be used for initial data collection. These will be transcribed to an eCRF developed with an independent web-based hosting facility called Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The trial database will include information on demographics (age, gender), underlying illnesses, concomitant medications and vaccination history. AE and SAE data will also be entered. Paper documents will be maintained and stored in a locked office, with access restricted to study personnel. All electronic documents with participant information will be password-protected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Data quality assurance</title><p>A random sample of source documents and CRFs will be audited to substantiate the integrity of trial data entered into the electronic database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The following assumptions were made for determination of sample size expected to meet primary outcome:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Rate of seroprotection (HI antibody titre &#x02265;1:40) on day 208 after vaccination is 60%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proportion seroprotected at day 208 in the experimental group will be 80%</p></list-item><list-item><p>A loss to follow-up rate of 10%</p></list-item><list-item><p>A power (1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) of 80% to detect differences between the two primary study groups</p></list-item><list-item><p>A two-sided significance level (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) of 5%</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The primary statistical null hypothesis is of no increase in seroprotection rates (HI antibody titre &#x02265;1:40) at day 208 following booster IIV3 vaccination, compared to a control injection. Formally, the trial will test:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>H<sub>0</sub>: Seroprotection rate (booster)&#x02009;=&#x02009;seroprotection rate (control), versus</p></list-item><list-item><p>H<sub>A</sub>: Seroprotection rate (booster)&#x02009;&#x02260;&#x02009;seroprotection rate (control)</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A sample size of 164 (82 per group) will provide 80% power to test this hypothesis, based on approximations to the normal distribution. A total sample size of 200 (100 per group) has been chosen to allow for up to 15% dropout. This sample size will provide adequate power for a range of seroprotection rates assuming an increase in absolute seroprotection of at least 20%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all participants who received at least one injection. Participants will be analysed according to the group to which they were randomised. The per-protocol analysis set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS who have no major protocol violations. Participants presenting with at least one of the following protocol deviations will be excluded from the per protocol analysis: participant did not meet all protocol-specified inclusion criteria or met at least one of the protocol-specified exclusion criteria; participant did not complete the vaccination schedule; participant received a different vaccine than the one randomised to receive; participant did not receive vaccine within the protocol-determined time window; participant received additional seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines during the trial period; preparation and/or administration of the vaccine was not performed as per protocol.</p><p>The safety analysis set is defined as those participants who have received at least one vaccine. All participants will have their safety analysed according to the vaccine that they actually received. The FAS will be the primary analysis to infer superiority of a 180-day IIV3 booster vaccination compared to the active-comparator control in terms of the proportion of participants with day-208 HI antibody titres &#x02265;1:40. This will be supported by per-protocol analysis. Analysis of secondary endpoints will use both the FAS and PPS.</p><p>Immunological data will be analysed per CHMP guidance (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). Results will be presented by vaccine strain and will include GMTs (with 95% confidence intervals) and pre-/post-vaccination ratios (GMRs). Reverse cumulative distribution curves will also be provided, supplemented by tables presenting percentages of vaccinees with titres above a range of cut-off levels on a logarithmic scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Confidentiality and retention of trial documents</title><p>All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The investigators and other study personnel will not disclose such information without prior written approval from the PI. Participant confidentiality will be strictly maintained to the extent possible under the law and as required by the SGGCP. Identifiable information will be removed from any published data. Any electronic data records stored locally will be kept on a networked, password-protected, single computer within the Department of Infectious Diseases. The PI will keep any paper-based records, DSRB files or source documentation in a locked cabinet within the department. These records, electronic and physical, will be kept for a minimum of 6 years after trial completion, before being destroyed or erased as per SGGCP requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>SPIRIT Checklist</title><p>Please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the SPIRIT Checklist</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial addresses a neglected issue in tropical countries. Demonstrating superior protection against influenza infection with a simple booster vaccination has the potential to offer a significant public health benefit. For example, in South East Asia alone, demographic estimates by the United Nations are for the number of persons aged 65 years and older to almost triple over the next 30 years, from 37.6 million in 2015, to 111.3 million in 2045 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A 6-monthly booster schedule with standard dose inactivated trivalent vaccine is attractive due to its simplicity, low cost, and safety profile. This would support its implementation into clinical practice if proven to offer superior efficacy against influenza infection. Six-monthly vaccination coincides with the approximate periodicity of epidemics in countries with biannual seasons synchronous with the Northern and Southern Hemisphere winters. A 6-monthly schedule also coincides with WHO strain recommendations which, since 1999, have been made biannually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Between hemisphere winters, a change in at least one of the strains in the trivalent vaccine has been recommended approximately half of the time (19/37 from 1999 till the SH 2017 recommendations). Repeat vaccinations are not associated with an increased risk of AEs, though data is not available for 6-monthly vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The limitations in older people of standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine are well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Even if this study finds a significant immunological benefit from repeat vaccination at 6 months, this may not be the optimal solution for providing year-round protection. Alternative influenza vaccine formulations have been licensed for older people; for example, a high-dose vaccine with 60 &#x003bc;g of haemagglutinin (HA) per strain, and vaccines which include an immune adjuvant. These vaccines do offer superior short-term immunogenicity in older people, which in some studies persists for at least 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, by 1 year, either no significant residual benefit is reported (adjuvanted vaccine), or data is not currently available (high-dose vaccine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>If evidence of significantly improved seroprotection by an IIV3 booster can be inferred from this study, we believe that it will provide the basis for a large-scale clinical trial in older people to determine whether this translates into reduced influenza infection rates.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial began recruiting participants in May 2016.
