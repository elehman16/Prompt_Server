Action&#x02013;observation training (AOT) has been shown to effectively improve upper limb motor function in adults with chronic stroke. AOT is based on action observation, whereby new motor skills can be learnt by observing motor actions. This process is facilitated by the Mirror Neuron System, which matches observed and performed motor actions. This study aims to determine the efficacy of AOT in: (1) influencing the early development of reaching and grasping of typically developing infants and (2) improving the upper limb activity of infants with asymmetric brain lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study design comprises two parallel randomised sham-controlled trials (RCTs) in: (1) typically developing infants (cohort I) and (2) infants with asymmetric brain lesions (eg, arterial stroke, venous infarction, intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia; cohort II). Cohort II will be identified through a neonatal ultrasound or neonatal MRI. A sham control will be used for both RCTs, taking into consideration that it would be unethical to give no intervention to an at-risk population. Based on a two-tailed t test of two independent means, with a significance (&#x003b1;) level of 0.05, 80% power, predicted effect size of 0.8 and a 90% retention rate, we require 20 participants in each group (total sample of 40) for cohort I. The sample size for cohort II was based on the assumption that the effect size of the proposed training would be similar to that found by Heathcock <italic>et al</italic> in preterm born infants (n=26) with a mean effect size of 2.4. Given the high effect size, the calculation returned a sample of only four participants per group, on a two-tailed t test, with a significance (&#x003b1;) level of 0.05 and 80% power. As cohort II will consist of two subgroups of lesion type (ie, arterial stroke and venous infarction), we have quadrupled the sample to include 16 participants in each group (total sample of 32). Infants will be randomised to receive either AOT or standard Toy Observation Training (TOT). Both interventions will be of 4&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; duration, from the infant's 9th&#x02013;13th post-term week of age. Three sessions of 5&#x02005;min each will be performed each day for 6&#x02005;days/week (total of 6&#x02005;h over 28&#x02005;days). Parents of the AOT group will repeatedly show the infant a grasping action on a set of three toys, presented in random order. Parents of the TOT group will show the infant the same set of three toys, in random order, without demonstrating the grasping action. At 14, 16 and 18&#x02005;weeks, the quantity and quality of reaching and grasping will be measured using the Grasping and Reaching Assessment of Brisbane; symmetry of reaching and grasping will be measured using the Hand Assessment of Infants (HAI) and pressure of grasping for each hand with a customised pressure sensor. At 6&#x02005;months&#x02019; corrected age, the primary outcome measures will be the HAI and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (third edition; BSID III), to measure cognitive and motor development. At 8&#x02005;months, HAI and EEG will be used to measure brain activity and cortical coherence. At 12&#x02005;months, the primary outcome measures will again be HAI and BSID III.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>This paper outlines the theoretical basis, study hypotheses and outcome measures for two parallel RCTs comparing the novel intervention Action&#x02013;observation training with standard TOT in: (1) influencing the early development of reaching and grasping of typically developing infants and (2) improving the upper limb motor activity of infants with asymmetric brain lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTRN1261100991910.

The incidence of asymmetric brain lesions at birth is 1&#x02013;2 of every 1000 newborns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>Congenital hemiplegia is the most common type of cerebral palsy (CP), with a prevalence of 1 in 1300 live-births.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The economic impact of CP is substantial. In 2007, the financial cost of CP was estimated at AUS$1.47 billion, with $124.1 million of that cost directly attributed to intervention costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Approximately 43% of these costs are covered by the families of individuals with CP, with the remaining 57% being covered by various levels of government.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>The main focus of early intervention for infants with asymmetric brain lesions who may progress to classification of unilateral CP is very early and accurate detection of the brain lesion, followed by provision of an enriched environment and training to maximise upper limb function during critical periods of development. The challenge for clinicians and researchers is the limited number of tools available to identify the problem and measure progress, as well as a paucity of evidence for efficacy of very early upper limb rehabilitation.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are two common clinical presentations of asymmetric brain lesions, early or delayed. Early presentation consists of a perinatal onset of neurological symptoms, or seizures, or reduced movement at 24&#x02013;48&#x02005;h postbirth with verification on cranial ultrasound and/or MRI of the presence of an asymmetric brain lesion. Specific imaging protocols may be needed for diagnosis in the early phases, such as diffusion MRI to identify an acute stroke in the first hours or days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In a delayed presentation, the infant may have an initially uncomplicated perinatal course and may not show signs of stroke or asymmetric brain injury (aBI) until 3&#x02013;7&#x02005;months of age, when unilateral weakness and early hand preference start to manifest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>Currently, the most predictive tools for early diagnosis of CP are a combination of brain MRI at term and Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements (GMs) in the fidgety period (at 12&#x02005;weeks post-term).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Specifically, GMs at 1 and 3&#x02005;months post-term age are highly associated with white matter abnormalities on MRI at term age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> GMs are a well validated and reliable tool that is more sensitive at predicting CP than other motor assessments used in infancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> They are also useful for prediction of minor motor difficulties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Neuromotor assessments (such as the GMs) utilised in the neonatal period (&#x0003c;4&#x02005;months post-term) have strong validity to detect CP in infants born preterm, when correlated with criterion assessments at 12&#x02005;months; corrected age (CA; such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID III); 8). Although abnormalities in GMs are likely to be evident during the early writhing period (&#x0003c;6&#x02013;9&#x02005;weeks post-term) and the fidgety period (9&#x02013;20&#x02005;weeks post-term), asymmetries are only visible during the fidgety period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13">11&#x02013;13</xref> Asymmetries in fidgety GMs around 12&#x02005;weeks post-term can be the first definitive clinical sign of hemiplegia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Very early detection of hemiparesis frequently requires serial evaluation of subtle signs of interlimb differences or asymmetries in upper limb reaching (both spontaneous and purposeful) and grasp strength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Both bimanual and unimanual reaching with early strong hand preference at 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;months of age can be considered to be a strong sign of early hemiplegia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Studies of infants who have sustained an early perinatal stroke before 4&#x02013;7&#x02005;months CA have suggested that until reach to grasp behaviours have emerged, an asymmetry may not be clearly evident and hemiparesis not confirmed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Early intervention for infants at risk of developing congenital hemiplegia is considered to be very important; however, standard rehabilitation programmes generally start after 6&#x02005;months of age due to delayed detection. A further consideration regarding the timing of start of intervention is that important phases of brain reorganisation may have already occurred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>Current approaches to rehabilitation in congenital hemiplegia in infants focus on toy presentation and sensory stimulation of the limb to encourage spontaneous reaching and grasping; however, the challenge is to obtain active movement from the impaired limb. A new approach utilising action observation to stimulate the mirror neuron system (MNS) offers another opportunity to stimulate the damaged motor cortex before the infant has achieved volitional reach and grasp.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>MNS is comprised of &#x02018;mirror neurons&#x02019;, specialised neurons which fire when one observes another performing an action and when one executes the action, facilitating an understanding of the action and subsequent imitation of that action.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20 R21 R22">19&#x02013;22</xref> Mirror neurons were discovered initially in the premotor area (F5) of macaque monkeys and have since been identified in the rostral area of the inferior parietal lobule (PF) and the ventral premotor cortex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Direct evidence for MNS in humans is lacking and there have been no studies published which have recorded single neurons from the proposed MNS in humans.</p><p>There is a growing body of neurophysiological and brain-imaging studies providing indirect evidence for the existence of MNS in humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation studies have concluded that MNS exists in humans and it differs from MNS in monkeys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27 R28 R29">25&#x02013;29</xref> Non-purposeful and intransitive actions activate mirror neurons in humans but not in monkeys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> When humans observe actions, the temporal features of cortical excitability suggest that MNS codes for the whole action as well as the individual movements that comprise the action. In contrast, only the whole action is coded by MNS in monkeys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> These unique properties of MNS in humans suggest that humans&#x02019; capacity to imitate others&#x02019; actions is related to MNS.</p><p>Several studies have identified two cortical areas which correspond to motor function and are activated during action observation in humans: (1) the rostral area of the PF and (2) the lower area of the precental gyrus combined with the posterior area of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). It has been suggested that the activation of mirror neurons located in the IFG (otherwise known as Broca's area) in humans corresponds to activation of mirror neurons located in the PF in monkeys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> In humans, the two mirror areas receive afferent input from the superior temporal sulcus (involved in processing motion), and send efferent input to the motor cortex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>

The main mechanism for a reconnection of the motor cortex to the spinal cord consists of reorganisation within the damaged hemisphere, based on a partial sparing of the primary motor cortex (ie, ipsilesional reorganisation). When the lesion occurs at an early stage of development, a different mechanism can also be observed, whereby a significant number of monosynaptic fast-conducting ipsilateral motor projections (from the undamaged hemisphere) persist. Such projections are normally withdrawn within the first months of life. This alternative mechanism results in the undamaged hemisphere directly controlling both upper limbs, which is a pattern of reorganisation unknown to adult pathology (ie, contralesional reorganization).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></p><p>Emerging evidence in humans suggests that the pattern of SM reorganisation after early brain injury is determined during the first year of life, and possibly within the first few months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> As children with reorganisation occurring in the damaged hemisphere (which results in the undamaged hemisphere directly controlling both upper limbs) have suboptimal upper limb motor activity, this pattern appears to be maladaptive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> It has been suggested that MNS may influence cortical reorganisation associated with upper limb impairment, and could potentially be a target of very early intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Action observation and imitation</title><p>The process of observing an action (ie, action observation) leads to the activation of MNS and stimulates the corticospinal system (motor pathways) prior to imitating the action.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57 R58 R59">57&#x02013;59</xref> When the motor cortex is damaged (eg, congenital brain lesion), action observation and imitation may influence cortical reorganisation by directly restoring the damaged motor pathways or reinforcing other pathways that originally helped to perform motor actions, or both.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></p><p>In animal and human adult studies, action observation appears to activate MNS and enhance excitability of the SM cortex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> These findings suggest that the effects of an asymmetric brain lesion may be ameliorated by an infant friendly and novel upper limb rehabilitation programme based on action observation. The training programme would aim to stimulate the damaged motor pathways from the lesioned hemisphere to the impaired upper limb, which may subsequently improve later upper limb motor activity by changing the cortical reorganisation typically seen after this type of injury.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Currently available therapeutic options and limitations</title><p>Various interventions are used for improving upper limb motor function and reducing activity limitations for children with unilateral CP. A recent systematic review was conducted which evaluated all upper limb interventions for infants (&#x0003c;3&#x02005;years) with brain injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61a">61a</xref> The interventions identified included: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (classic CIMT or modified for a paediatric population mCIMT); intramuscular Botulinum toxin A injections as an adjunct to occupational therapy (OT); forced-use therapy and neurodevelopmental treatment with or without upper limb casting.</p><p>The authors concluded that current evidence for very early upper limb interventions suggested small effects on unimanual capacity, bimanual coordination and self-care skills; however, there are limited data on the safety and neural mechanisms underlying activity changes in response to these interventions. Further research is required to investigate the efficacy of upper limb interventions of this at-risk population at preschool age (&#x0003c;3&#x02005;years) and address the lack of attention to safety implications for infants.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Proposed intervention and justification: why Upper Limb Baby Early Action&#x02013;observation Training?</title><p>Action&#x02013;observation training (AOT) is a novel upper limb rehabilitation approach based on the recent discovery of mirror neurons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref> This approach has been shown to effectively improve upper limb motor function in adult patients with chronic stroke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> AOT is currently being investigated in a population of school-aged children (5&#x02013;15&#x02005;years) with unilateral CP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></p><p>AOT has not yet been investigated in a randomised clinical trial for a population of infants with congenital brain lesion. The efficacy, benefits and safety implications of this novel rehabilitation for this at-risk population are unknown. Ideally, such an intervention should begin soon after the brain injury has occurred. It is difficult, however, to achieve voluntary activation of the motor cortex during the first weeks of life, as voluntary reaching is absent or immature. The activation of the motor cortex related to action observation may represent a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention in this early period of development. As soon as voluntary reaching can be reliably elicited, very early intervention should be supplemented with standard rehabilitative approaches aimed at encouraging symmetrical reach and grasp behaviours, as well as use of the limb in developing mobility.</p><p>In adults with stroke, action observation has been shown to effectively increase cortical excitability of the SM cortex and improve upper limb motor outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> Based on the hypothesis that the same activation can be elicited in infants, we predict that action&#x02013;observation training will enhance the excitability of the SM cortex and accelerate the maturation of the corticospinal tract and the shaping of the spinal motor circuits, leading to better spontaneous use of the impaired upper limb. This could prevent the development of asymmetric reach and grasp in young infants with early asymmetric brain lesions.</p><p>Studies of the early development of infants at risk of progressing to CP, such as infants born preterm, frequently include a healthy term-born reference group to take account of typical development progression.

As the provision of Action&#x02013;Observation Training and Toy Observation Training (TOT) in the developmental period of 9&#x02013;18&#x02005;weeks post-term is considered to be low risk and developmentally appropriate training approaches, there is no risk but potentially some additional benefit for all infants. Inclusion of a cohort of healthy term born infants in a parallel randomised comparison trial will provide a typically developing comparison of training approaches to our randomised controlled trial (RCT) of infants with aBI.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Broad aim of proposed study</title><p>The broad aim of this study was to evaluate in two parallel RCTs with an identical sham control whether the novel intervention AOT is more effective than standard TOT in: (1) influencing the early development of reaching and grasping of typically developing infants (TDIs; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) and (2) improving the upper limb motor activity of infants with asymmetric brain lesions (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Two RCTs with an identical sham control will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of AOT compared with standard TOT in: (1) TDIs with a gestational age between 38 and 41&#x02005;weeks at the time of recruitment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40); and (2) infants with asymmetric brain lesions aged 0&#x02013;9 post-term weeks at the time of recruitment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32).</p><p>This study will involve an at-risk population of infants (ie, infants with asymmetric brain lesions). It would therefore be unethical to give no intervention to this population in the control arm. Standard TOT is the sham control intervention that will be used for both RCTs. It is similar to standard therapy as it involves the parents presenting toys to infants and encouraging spontaneous visual exploration, without demonstrating how to play with the toys. It does not include the active AOT component of the intervention for the treatment group.</p><p>The specific hypotheses to be tested are as follows:

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine if TDIs undergoing AOT will develop reaching and grasping earlier than those undergoing standard TOT. AOT is a novel upper limb training programme based on action observation. Evidence suggests that action observation can activate the motor cortex and reinforce the corticospinal network. We will determine through an RCT if a 4-week AOT programme (from 9 to 13 post-term weeks&#x02019; age) will influence the short-term outcomes of reaching and grasping, compared with a standard TOT programme whereby action observation is replaced with toy observation (no grasping action demonstrated).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine if infants with asymmetric brain lesions undergoing AOT will develop reaching and grasping earlier, and have greater quality and quantity of reaching and grasping, compared with those undergoing standard TOT. Recent studies suggest that an early therapeutic intervention in infants with aBI should aim to activate the impaired motor cortex. We will determine through an RCT if a 4-week AOT programme (from 9 to 13 post-term weeks&#x02019; age) will lead to cortical activation associated with action observation and influence the development of reaching and grasping in these infants and improve their short-term and long-term outcomes. AOT will again be compared with standard TOT. If we can show that this novel, very early intervention can improve short-term and long-term upper limb motor activity in infants with asymmetric brain lesions, this will guide clinical practice and enable a more efficient allocation of therapy resources in the future.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine if AOT will lead to greater equalisation of corticomotor pathways and cortical reorganisation. We will determine if the 4-week AOT programme will result in modified cortical coherence related to action observation through an EEG. If we can show that this novel, very early intervention can lead to greater equalisation of cortical motor pathways and retention of cortical motor reorganisation, this will guide clinical practice with implications for other patients (infants with bilateral/symmetric brain injury, school-aged children with unilateral CP, children with stroke). An understanding of the nature and timing of the brain lesion may indicate which infants respond better.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine if the individual differences among infants in the quality of GMs and imitative behaviour will modulate the effects of training on their development of reaching and grasping. We will investigate these using standardised measures of spontaneous motility and imitation skills in both cohorts, pretraining and post-training. If we find these correlations, we can explore the possibility of individually tailoring very early therapeutic interventions.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Assessments will be performed at 9, 12, 14, 16 and 18&#x02005;weeks.

The total dosage of intervention will be 6&#x02005;h, over a period of 28&#x02005;days. After baseline screening and randomisation, infants will receive either AOT or standard TOT.</p><p>Parents will be trained by an occupational therapist for approximately 30&#x02005;min, and they will be directly observed performing the training activities with the infant during the training. Two follow-up phone calls regarding questions on how to perform the training will be addressed over the telephone with the therapist who trained the parents. Parents will be asked to video-record the sessions each day. Parents of the AOT group will repeatedly show the infant a grasping action on a set of three toys, presented in random order. Parents of the TOT group will show the infant the same set of three toys, also presented in random order, without the grasping action. The toys are mostly cylindrical in shape and vary in appearance, colour and patterns (ie, cow, clown and musical instrument).

Video footage of each training and assessment session will be qualitatively and/or quantitatively analysed to assess treatment fidelity.</p><p>The core investigator team (RNB, JZ, AG, KP, LF and MP) will meet regularly to review the progress of training and assessments for both cohorts, and will decide when any modifications to the protocol are required. The alternate training programme (AOT and TOT) is standardised and would not be modified during the intervention period from 9 to 18&#x02005;weeks post-term. There is no scientific expectation for discontinuing or modifying either the AOT or TOT, as there is no evidence to support one method over the other. Any additional interventions (motor training by Physiotherapists or Occupational Therapists will be monitored including the dose, focus and content of concomitant training) and medications (for epilepsy) will be recorded at the next home visit and accounted for in the secondary analysis.

Post hoc analyses will be undertaken to investigate the clinical characteristics of infants who have a greater response to either intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper outlines the background and design for two parallel RCTs with an identical sham control, comparing AOT with standard TOT to: (1) influence the early development of reaching and grasping of TDIs and (2) improve the upper limb motor activity of infants with asymmetric brain lesions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly compare the two approaches for this population. Furthermore, we will be establishing validity and reliability for the newly developed outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e352" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002512.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant (DP110104292; RNB, JZ), Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) Scholarship awarded by the University of Queensland (MP), Balnaves Doctoral Grant awarded by the Research Foundation, Cerebral Palsy Alliance (MP), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Career Development Award (RNB, 1037220), Queensland Health&#x02014;Health Practitioner Research Scheme Grant (LF, IF), Mariani Foundation of Milan (Grant R 11&#x02013;86; AG).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RNB was the Australian Research Council (ARC) chief investigator A and AG was the partner investigator on the study.
