These modifications have resulted in improved mechanical, esthetic and handling properties, reduced moisture or dehydration sensitivity, decreased setting time and increased working time, while retaining the advantages of GI.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Two setting reactions are known in RMGI: A slow, classic acid-base reaction that begins upon mixing the cement and continues up to 24 h or even 1-week, and a faster polymerization reaction of incorporated monomers that is activated by visible light exposure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Resin-modified glass-ionomer, as a hybrid material between GI and resin composite, could bond to tooth structures through both ionic bonding of polyacrylic acid with hydroxyapatite and micro-mechanical interlocking of the monomeric component into a partly demineralized smear layer-free dentin surface.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Although this two-fold bonding mechanism might contribute to the greater bond strength of RMGI, chemical bonding was reported to be a major factor,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] explaining their excellent performance in a systematic review of clinical trials conducted by Peumans <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has been demonstrated that the acid-base reaction induced chemical bonding of RMGI to dentin as a main bonding mechanism.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate contained in RMGI which acts as a co-solvent for both the resin and acid components has a high wetting ability, enhancing bonding ability of RMGI.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Water serves as a reactant medium for acidic component ionization and ion transportation, and consequent acid-base reaction. However, some of water has been replaced by HEMA, resulting in a reduced/retarded acid-base reaction of RMGI.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As a consequence, polyacid has more opportunity for a longer time for chemical bonding.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the other hand, since each mentioned setting reaction depends on reactant diffusion prior to gelation, the reactions are affected by each other. During the several-minute setting time, they compete or inhibit each other.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Since the chemical bonding of RMGI depends on calcium availability on tooth surfaces,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] delayed light activation (DLA) may lead to different results when preparing tooth tissues with various pretreatment agents. Cavity conditioning plays a more important role in providing effective bonding with RMGI. Pretreatment with a diluted polyalkenoic acid conditioner is advised to remove the smear layer and partially demineralize dentin with retained smear plugs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This surface conditioning could improve the bonding of RMGI through the formation of a sub-micron hybrid layer and chemical bonding with the remaining hydroxyapatite around the exposed collagen.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Self-etch primers such as Vitremer primer are reported to modify the smear layer and improve the wettability of the dentin and monomer penetration into it.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In an attempt to maximize the chemical bonding, application of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) after cavity conditioner may be a promising procedure to provide a reactive substrate through calcium phosphate deposition.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] So far, there is no published study regarding the effect of CPP-ACP pretreatment on marginal sealing of RMGI restorations or bonding ability of RMGI to tooth structures.</p><p>Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effect of DLA on marginal sealing of a RMGI when different types of surface pretreatments were used including cavity conditioner, acid etching, Vitremer primer and CPP-ACP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, 56 human maxillary premolars extracted following orthodontic treatment without caries, cracks or previous restorations were selected.

Two standardized Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of each teeth (3 mm width, 3 mm height, and 1.5 mm depth) with occlusal margins in the enamel and gingival margins placed approximately 1 mm below the cementoenamel junction using new straight fissure burs (#835/010, TeesKavan, Iran) for every five preparations.

Powder and liquid components were dispensed at 2.3/1 ratio by weight, mixed and placed into the cavity in one increment. The restorations were immediately light-cured according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>In the second four groups (DLA) (5-8), the same surface pretreatments were applied in as groups 1-4, respectively. The RMGI was placed in the cavities, allowed to set for 3-min and light-cured according to manufacturer's instructions. The light curing was done using a halogen light-curing unit (Coltolux 75, Coltene/Whaldent AG, Alst&#x000e4;tten, Switzerland, 500 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). All preparations and restorations were performed by one operator at room temperature. During procedures, the teeth were kept moist.</p><p>After water storage of the specimens at 37&#x000b0;C, the restorations were finished with aluminum oxide discs (Sof-Lex, 3M ESPE, USA). The restored teeth were stored at 37&#x000b0;C for 1-week and then thermocycled for 1000 cycles at 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C with a 30-s dwell time. The root apices were sealed with sticky wax (Keystone Industries GmbHD &#x02014; Singen, Germany), and all the surfaces, except for the restorations and 1 mm from the margins, were coated with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were immersed in a 0.5% methylene blue solution for 24 h. They were then rinsed, blot-dried and sectioned longitudinally through the center of the restorations from the buccal to lingual surface with a water-cooled diamond saw (Leitz 1600, Wetzlar, Germany).</p><p>The sections were blindly examined for dye penetration by two independent evaluators using a stereomicroscope (Carl Ziess Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) at &#x000d7;20 magnification.

Establishment of chemical bonding on the suitable tooth substrate could play an important role in marginal integrity and stability of the adhesive bond.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Acid-base and photopolymerization setting reactions of RMGI occur in a series of overlapping stages with different speeds so that in competition between them, one reaction replaces a part of the other.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As the setting reactions are involved in bonding mechanism of RMGI to the tooth, the extent and speed of the reactions might influence the adhesive bond, depending on reactivity of dental substrate. In the current study, when RMGI was applied on cavity surfaces without any pretreatment, DLA resulted in an increased enamel and dentinal sealing. This finding may be related to polyacrylic acid and HEMA contained in RMGI. Polyacrylic acid acts as an ultra-mild self-etch.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This acid is indicated to form a nanometer sized hybrid layer[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and also additionally creates chemical bonding with the calcium ions, which present within the smear layer.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Self-etching/adhesiveness of some RMGI materials is documented using interfacial ultrastructural analysis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This self-adhesiveness is attributed to ionic bonding to hydroxyapatite around collagen; hence, improving hybridized dentin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Furthermore, the hydrophilic property of HEMA content may contribute to mild self-conditioning characteristics of RMGI.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] DLA may provide a sufficient time for penetrating and forming these reactions. This explanation could be supported by the results of Glasspoole <italic>et al</italic>. study that reported significantly higher bond strength to enamel with no pretreatment when setting of a RMGI was through self-curing reaction compared with its light curing.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>It seems that immediate light curing may restrict diffusion of polyacrylic acid to penetrate into the surfaces covered with the smear layer. Therefore, in this study, the positive effect of cavity conditioner pretreatment was confirmed in terms of marginal sealing, particularly at the enamel margin when the RMGI was cured immediately. This positive effect was insignificant compared with no pretreatment (NC) at the dentin margin. This result was in agreement with the findings of a recent study[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as a previously conducted one.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Numerous bonding/sealing studies have recommended surface pretreatment with weak acid solution such as polyalkenoic acid before RMGI application.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, the lack of any beneficial effect of using cavity conditioner on dentin bonding of RMGI was reported by Inoue <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The obtained results revealed that DLA on cavity conditioned-surface resulted in improved enamel and dentin marginal sealing; however, this improvement was only significant for dentin margin. Following the formation of the cross-linked polymer network by light curing, diffusion of acid-base reactants was limited.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, DLA could enhance ionic bonding of the carboxyl group of the polyacrylic acid with ion-leachable glass particles (setting reaction) or calcium from the partially demineralized tooth structures (chemical bonding at the adhesive interface).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In addition, an increased dentin permeability on cavity conditioned-dentin (with removal of smear layer) during DLA may provide an adequate water supply, facilitating more complete acid-base reaction.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This reaction maturation at the adhesive interface of RMGI may contribute to improved dentin marginal sealing. In a recent study, DLA decreased marginal leakage; this decrease was significant only at the enamel margin.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, our results revealed a significant decreased microleakage at the dentin margin in case of DLA. DLA resulted in a lower leakage at the enamel margin of NC group. This result may be attributed to self-etching capability of RMGI on untreated enamel during the delay time before light activation. Thomas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that DLA could produce more GI structural characteristics in the RMGI. On the other hand, this similarity was speculated to increase the chemical bonding nature,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] resulting in a stable bonding.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] It was reported that a relatively high (3%) polymerization shrinkage of RMGI during light curing[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] may overcome the weak early chemical bonding to the dentin, providing a pathway for microleakage at the adhesive interface.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] It was expected that DLA may control this shrinkage to some extent, gaining the beneficial effect of chemical bonding on marginal sealing.</p><p>The other common and easy-applying surface pretreatment prior to RMGI is self-etch primers such as Vitremer primer. This light-cured primer is capable of modifying the smear layer, resulting in a closer interaction of RMGI and dentin surface.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] When the RMGI used in this study was immediately light-cured, Vitremer primer pretreatment was beneficial in achieving significantly better sealing at the dentin margin. However, the effectiveness of this primer on enamel sealing was not significant. When the primer was used, DLA had no effect on the marginal leakage of both margins. In line with this finding, Glasspoole <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that the lack of difference between bond strength of light-cured and self-cured Vitremer RMGI to Vitremer primed-enamel may be related to a leveling effect of this light-cured primer between the two cure modes.</p><p>Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate as a remineralizing and anticariogenic agent is commonly used to treat tooth sensitivity associated with or following bleaching treatment. This material has been incorporated into mouth rinses, chewing gums, sports drinks and a commercially available paste (tooth mousse [MI past]).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] This complex creates a high concentration gradient of calcium phosphate at the tooth surface, inhibiting demineralization/promoting remineralization.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The well-established anticariogenic property of RMGI is attributed to the effective role of released fluoride in enhanced remineralization process with fluorapatite through calcium phosphate precipitation along with localization of the fluoride ion at the tooth surfaces.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, the presence of sufficient calcium phosphate ions is also necessary to remineralize the tooth structures with fluoroapatite.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] This requirement may be provided by pretreatment with CPP-ACP prior to RMGI. Previously, enhanced protective and remineralizing effects of simultaneous releasing of fluoride and CPP-ACP from CPP-ACP containing GI on the damaged and adjacent dentin during acid challenge was indicated in experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>The initial mild dentin demineralization was reported to facilitate remineralization induced by CPP-ACP.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] On the other hand, depleting the dentin surface of the total mineral content by acid etching may compromise its remineralization potential.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Based on these findings, in the current study, CPP-ACP was applied after using cavity conditioner; this procedure revealed no effect on the microleakage at both margins when light-curing was done immediately after placement of RMGI. However, in the case of DLA, CPP-ACP pretreatment resulted in a significantly improved sealing at the dentin margin with no effect on the enamel margin.</p><p>Polyacrylic acid conditioner was suggested to be capable of bonding with remnant hydroxyapatite[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and collagen[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] so that, after the rinsing step, some remaining polyacrylic molecules form a polymeric layer on conditioned-enamel[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and dentin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] As a consequence, the demineralized dentin surface layer may afford less mineral site for bonding to carboxyl group of polyacrylic acid contained in the RMGI. Following CPP-ACP application on this surface, an increased concentration of calcium and phosphate may enhance bonding between these ions and carboxyl groups of RMGI on the treated dentin surface. In the present study, during DLA, this chemical bonding on the reactive treated surface may be established, thereby an increased marginal sealing was attained at the dentin margin.</p><p>On the other hand, Es-Souni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] demonstrated that the mentioned formed polymeric layer on polyacrylic acid conditioned-enamel could enhance bond strength of GI. In the current study, CPP-ACP application on the conditioned enamel resulted in deposited calcium phosphate on the polymeric layer. This deposited layer may impede the beneficial effect of the polymeric layer on bonding of RMGI. Hence, cavity conditioner plus CPP-ACP pretreatment did not alter enamel marginal sealing in this study. Further chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy studies are required to evaluate the real interaction of this pretreatment on tooth surfaces during bonding of RMGI.</p><p>No study has been performed on CPP-ACP as an additional pretreatment step during RMGI placement in the prepared cavity. This application procedure of CPP-ACP was used only in a recent study; the resultant increased bond strength of Adper SE Plus (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) had been attributed to the increased availability of calcium phosphate on CPP-ACP treated dentin for chemical bonding to phosphoric acid ester contained in this adhesive.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>The outcome of the current study seems to support the important role of chemical bonding on dentin marginal sealing. Marginal sealing might be improved when light curing of the RMGI on ACP-CPP or cavity conditioner treated-dentin was delayed; in these situations, the enamel sealing was not altered. The lowest mean microleakage score at the dentin margin (0.5) was attained in the case of DLA for cavity conditioner plus ACP-CPP pretreatment and for cavity conditioner alone at the enamel margin (0.57). Therefore, RMGI restorations might benefit from the advantages of ACP-CPP pretreatment in the cavities, enhancing remineralization potential of RMGI.</p><p>In a study, DLA for 3-min and 15-s (working time based on the manufacturer's data), resulted in 15% reduction of photopolymerization reaction of a RMGI.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Although this reduction was speculated not to affect the material properties,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] further studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of DLA on the other interactions of various RMGIs with tooth structures in long-term periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of the current study, it may be concluded that a 3-min delay in light activation of the RMGI might yield different outcomes on enamel and dentinal marginal sealing depending on surface conditioning and structural characteristics of the treated surfaces.
