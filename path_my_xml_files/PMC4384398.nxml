They may then result in misreadings of percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) measured via pulse oximetry, although it is transient [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which provides real-time information on the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand, also uses infrared light to estimate regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is now being increasingly used to guide intraoperative optimization of cerebral oxygenation in patients undergoing procedures associated with a high risk of adverse neurologic outcomes [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, among others, methylene blue [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and indigo carmine [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] may interfere with NIRS-based cerebral oximetry readings.</p><p>Indocyanine green (ICG) is a strong near-infrared absorber having preferable fluorescent characteristics. It has been used to visualize the blood stream during neurosurgery [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], being particularly useful for observing the patency of extracranial-intracranial bypass [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], for complete aneurysm clipping [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or for the intraoperative evaluation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many new intraoperative applications of ICG and ICG angiography are emerging [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We have recently documented a constant and immediate increase in SctO<sub>2</sub> readings with the INVOS&#x000ae; device in patients undergoing neurosurgery during which an IV bolus of 12.5 mg ICG (approximately 0.25 mg/kg) was administered for videoangiography [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, two dosages of ICG (12.5 mg or 25 mg) are frequently used in clinical practice, while its recommended dose for standard diagnostic procedures ranges between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg with a maximum daily dose of 5 mg/kg [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The magnitude and the duration of SctO<sub>2</sub> misreading may vary as a function of different doses of ICG. The current study aimed to determine the oximetry readings (SctO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub>) using two different doses (12.5 mg vs. 25 mg) of ICG during CEA under general anesthesia. Cerebral oximetry and near-infrared-ICG videoangiography have been used simultaneously for many years in patients undergoing neurovascular surgeries on a routine basis in our hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After receiving the University Hospital Ethics Committee approval, written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. Twenty-six patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III scheduled for CEA under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were assigned to either the 12.5 mg group or the 25 mg group, based on a computer-generated randomization list. Exclusion criteria included liver or renal insufficiency, known iodine or ICG hypersensitivity, and ASA physical status IV or V.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg orally 60 min before being transported to the operating room. Upon arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring including electrocardiography, noninvasive measurement of systemic blood pressure, pulse oximetry, capnography, and bispectral index monitoring (BIS&#x000ae; system; Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) was applied throughout the procedure. A 20-gauge radial arterial catheter was placed in either wrist of each subject under local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine to monitor blood pressure and to take blood samples if necessary. Pulse oximetry finger probe (Ohmeda Biox 3700, Ohmeda, Louisville, CO, USA) was placed on the index finger of the hand. Two adhesive cerebral oximeter probes were applied to the forehead before induction of anesthesia to continuously measure SctO<sub>2</sub> using the INVOS&#x000ae; 5100B cerebral oximeter (INVOS&#x000ae;, Somanetics; Troy, MI, USA). SctO<sub>2</sub> values contralateral to the side of surgery were used to determine cerebral oxygenation.</p><p>After preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (1 to 2 mg/kg) and remifentanil (1 &#x000b5;g/kg), and maintained with sevoflurane (1.5 to 2.0%) and remifentanil (0.03 to 0.12 &#x000b5;g/kg/min). Rocuronium was used for initiation and maintenance of muscle relaxation. Patients were mechanically ventilated after tracheal intubation with an oxygen/air mixture at 0.5 fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension between 35 and 40 mmHg throughout the surgery.</p><p>During the surgery, near-infrared-ICG videoangiographic recording was performed before and/or after the excision of the plaque and closure of the ICA. Upon the surgeon's request, patients were given ICG (Indocyanine green&#x000ae;, Dongin-Dang Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea) intravenously by the anesthesiologist as a bolus of 12.5 mg (approximately 0.25 mg/kg dose) or 25 mg (approximately 0.5 mg/kg dose, 25 mg dose dissolved in 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl) to visualize the blood flow within the internal carotid artery.</p><p>Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, SctO<sub>2</sub>, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded by an independent investigator immediately before anesthetic induction and just before administration of ICG (baseline), and every min thereafter until the recovery of baseline SctO<sub>2</sub> value. The time from dye injection to the maximum changes (peak or nadir) and to the recovery of baseline values (duration) of SctO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub>, the highest readings of SctO<sub>2</sub> (peak) or the lowest readings of SpO<sub>2</sub> (nadir), and the magnitude of their maximum changes after ICG injection were also recorded.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the primary end-point of SctO<sub>2</sub> value after ICG injection. A power analysis suggested that a sample size of 10 patients in each group should be adequate to detect an absolute 5% difference in the highest SctO<sub>2</sub> value with a two-sided significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD (range). Both between and within group comparisons of SctO<sub>2</sub>, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and hemodynamic data were analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Scheffe post hoc test as required. Normal distribution was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Other data were compared between the groups using a paired Student's t-test. All analyses were performed using StatView software version 4.0 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA, USA). A P value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Consecutive ICG videoangiographic examinations were performed in 26 patients; 21 before and the remaining 5 after arteriotomy. The patient characteristics including the baseline SctO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub> were comparable between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). No changes in heart rate or arterial blood pressure were noted following the dye administration in either group.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> illustrates the typical changes in SctO<sub>2</sub> after a 25 mg bolus injection of ICG in a patient by replicating the INVOS monitor display. Following the administration, SctO<sub>2</sub> was significantly increased in both groups; however, the magnitude of the increase of was greater (21.6 &#x000b1; 5.8% vs. 12.6 &#x000b1; 4.1%, P &#x0003c; 0.0001) and more prolonged (28.4 &#x000b1; 9.6 min vs. 13.8 &#x000b1; 5.2 min, P &#x0003c; 0.0001) in the 25 mg group than in the 12.5 mg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). No differences were noted between the two groups in the time to reach the greatest changes in SctO<sub>2</sub> (43.0 &#x000b1; 10.9 s vs. 50.0 &#x000b1; 30.0 s, P = 0.437). Also, there were no significant differences in the degree of maximum increases in SctO<sub>2</sub> between the non-operative and operative sides in either the 12.5 mg group (12.6 &#x000b1; 4.1% vs. 12.7 &#x000b1; 3.4%, P = 0.910) or the 25 mg group (21.6 &#x000b1; 5.8% vs. 19.7 &#x000b1; 3.6%, P = 0.054).</p><p>In contrast, SpO<sub>2</sub> was significantly decreased in both groups (P &#x0003c; 0.005); the magnitude of the decrease was greater in the 25 mg group than in the 12.5 mg group (4.0 &#x000b1; 0.8% vs. 1.6 &#x000b1; 1.0%, P &#x0003c; 0.0001). There were no differences between the two groups in the time to reach the nadir SpO<sub>2</sub> (47.5.0 &#x000b1; 20.0 s vs. 57.5 &#x000b1; 37.4 s, P = 0.404) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and the time to recover to the baseline SctO<sub>2</sub> (3.6 &#x000b1; 1.6 min vs. 3.0 &#x000b1; 1.7 min, P = 0.374).</p><p>An immediate increase in SctO<sub>2</sub> was observed in all of the patients, whereas a decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> was observed in all but one patient (96.2%). Overall, the highest SctO<sub>2</sub> values were 86 and 95% and the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> values were 94 and 92% in the 12.5 and 25 mg groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrated that, when given as a single IV bolus using the INVOS cerebral oximeter, the higher dose (25 mg) of ICG led to greater and more prolonged increases in SctO<sub>2</sub> with a greater reduction in SpO<sub>2</sub>, reaching the peak or the nadir within a minute (approximately one or two circulation times). These results are contradictory to those previously obtained with methylene blue [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or indigo carmine [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where SctO<sub>2</sub> was significantly decreased. Collectively, interference with the SctO<sub>2</sub> measurement (i.e., the magnitude, duration, and direction of the changes) by the vital dyes may vary according to the dosage as well as the type of the dye.</p><p>The INVOS cerebral oximeter uses two near-infrared wavelengths (730 and 805 nm) and measures the spectral absorbance of an admixture of arterial, capillary, and venous blood (hemoglobin or cytochrome aa3) in the brain [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Regional oxygen saturation is calculated as the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to total hemoglobin determined by the differential light absorption with subsequent computer suppression of the input from superficial tissues [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Any substance that absorbs infrared light of the same wavelength produced by the light emitting diodes may affect the absorption of light as it traverses the blood and tissues.</p><p>ICG has a dose- and time-dependent effect on plasma light absorbance (range 700-850 nm) with a spectral absorption peak at 805 nm and an emission peak around 835 nm, which is within the NIR window [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], whereas indigo carmine has an absorption peak at 620 nm with a dramatic decline around 700 nm [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light at 730 nm, with the isobestic point for deoxyhemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin (wavelength at which oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin species have the same molar absorptivity) at 810 nm. Taken together, ICG would reduce the ratio of infrared light absorption at 730 nm/805 nm with a resultant increase in SctO<sub>2</sub>, while indigo carmine would increase the ratio with resultant dampening of SctO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Fluorescent lights have been shown to interfere with pulse oximetry readings [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ICG becomes strongly NIR-fluorescent after IV administration, with an absorption and an emission peak within the range of wavelengths used by the INVOS device [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this context, one may ascribe the enhanced SctO<sub>2</sub> readings to a strong fluorescence signal emitted by ICG. This is, however, unlikely because the emission detected by the INVOS device would be a reduction in oxy-hemoglobin and SctO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>ICG increased SctO<sub>2</sub>, whose peak was shown within one minute after the administration in the present study; while indigo carmine caused a nadir in 7 min (5-9 min) in a previous study [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The peak effects may be related to the highest concentration of the drug within the blood compartment in the brain tissue, since neither indigo carmine nor ICG normally penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Both dyes reach their peak concentrations in the brain within a minute when administered intravenously or intraarterially [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The discrepancy in the time to reach the peak SctO<sub>2</sub> between the two dyes cannot be readily explained. ICG may increase SctO<sub>2</sub> very rapidly (within one minute), since the wavelength of light (i.e., 805 nm) emitted by the INVOS System is very close to the absorption peak of ICG with a resultant extremely high absorbance.</p><p>Cerebral oximetry, in contrast to SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring based on transmission oximetry, uses reflectance oximetry to measure the oxygen saturation of the tissues underneath the sensor. The light passes not only through parts of the frontal brain, but also through the overlying skull and scalp, and the oximetry signal may thus be contaminated by extracranial blood sources [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One may argue if cross clamping of the carotid artery during the surgery may redistribute the blood flow between extracranial and intracranial tissues and thereby increases the extracranial blood volume where hemoglobin oxygen saturation would be higher compared to that in the intracranial blood, SctO<sub>2</sub> would be increased. However, in the present study, the changes in contralateral and ipsilateral SctO<sub>2</sub> values after ICG did not differ in either group. Moreover, videoangiography was not performed during the carotid artery occlusion, but it was performed before the occlusion and/or following the reperfusion. It is unlikely that the redistribution of blood flow contributed to the elevated SctO<sub>2</sub> reading.</p><p>ICG-induced increase in SctO<sub>2</sub> was dose-dependent by the 12.6-21.6% absolute changes (20-36% relative changes), which lasted for up to 28 minutes with the higher dose. The relative increase in SctO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 20% after carotid declamping has been associated with the onset of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome in patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas the relative decrease in SctO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 20% after carotid cross-clamping has been associated with cerebral ischemia [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As such, the elevation of SctO<sub>2</sub> readings temporarily induced by ICG may obscure the interpretation of SctO<sub>2</sub> changes during the surgery, preventing the use of proper therapeutic interventions (e.g., shunt placement or other pharmacological or physiological intervention) to correct the changes in SctO<sub>2</sub> and to improve postoperative outcomes. Moreover, administration of the dye is usually repeated in every patient because angiography is performed twice, i.e., before and after arteriotomy, in CEA procedures.</p><p>In the present study, the change in SctO<sub>2</sub> lasted longer than that in SpO<sub>2</sub>. The pulse oximeter measures hemoglobin saturation in the arterial bed using two wavelengths of light (660 and 925 nm), while ICG has an absorption peak at 805 nm. The INVOS device measures regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (i.e., venous, capillary, and arterial blood) using two near-infrared wavelengths (730 and 805 nm). Differences in blood beds evaluated by the monitors, and the employed wavelengths and the analysis methods of the two devices (i.e., pulse oximeter and cerebral oximeter) may, at least in part, account for the differences in their interaction with ICG. Consequently, cerebral oxygenation monitoring using NIRS is more sensitive to changes in ICG than pulse oximetry. A dampened SctO<sub>2</sub> reading persisted for 20-40 min with indigo carmine in a previous study [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while an elevated SctO<sub>2</sub> reading was maintained for 13.8 &#x000b1; 5.2 min with ICG 12.5 mg and 28.4 &#x000b1; 9.6 min with ICG 25 mg in the present study. We speculate that the effects of the two dyes on SctO<sub>2</sub> persist until the dyes are completely cleared up from the circulation (i.e., 5 to 6 half-lives) because of their higher sensitivity.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia, an IV bolus of 25 mg ICG for videoangiography resulted in a greater and more prolonged increase (for up to 28 min with a higher dose) in SctO<sub>2</sub> and a greater decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> than an IV bolus of 12.5 mg ICG, with no differences in the time to reach the peak SctO<sub>2</sub> or the nadir SpO<sub>2</sub>. Anesthesiologists should be alert when cerebral oximetry and IV-administered ICG are being used simultaneously.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Scheller</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Unger</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelner</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of intravenously administered dyes on pulse oximetry readings</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1986</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>550</fpage><lpage>552</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3777490</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sidi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Paulus</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rush</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Gravenstein</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Methylene blue and indocyanine green artifactually lower pulse oximetry readings of oxygen saturation.
