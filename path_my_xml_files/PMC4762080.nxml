Research from Time to Change describes the far-reaching consequences of stigma, with young people who experience mental disorders reporting that stigma had stopped them going to school (40%), socialising with friends (54%), or had led them to consider suicide (26%).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Intergroup contact theory suggests that interaction between different groups reduces conflict, prejudice and discrimination.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Contact interventions involve individuals with experience of living with a mental illness speaking about those experiences to members of the general population. Interventions may target stigma of a particular disorder (eg, depression), or may be more generic (&#x02018;mental illness&#x02019;). Contact is often combined with education programmes, but can also act as a stand-alone intervention. Griffiths <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> meta-analysis found that education interventions and contact interventions are effective in reducing stigma, but stated that there were very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which used contact. Corrigan and Penn<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> suggest a combination of contact and education may offer the best opportunity for reducing stigmatising attitudes, and contact has become a successful component in antistigma campaigns.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent meta-analysis comparing interventions which use contact alone, or contact plus education, to those which have used education alone, however, found that in adolescent populations, education alone may be a better strategy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The three studies which have <italic>directly</italic> compared contact and education with education alone, however, found contact following education significantly reduced stigma compared with education alone.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Importantly, these studies also focused on mid-to-late adolescent age ranges. Targeting younger adolescent populations has a number of potential benefits. Stigmatising attitudes begin to form in childhood and early adolescence,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> meaning that interventions targeted at these age groups may have a more preventative role than those targeted at older individuals. Similarly, stigma, and a lack of knowledge or &#x02018;mental health literacy&#x02019;,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> has also been linked to a chronic delay in help-seeking,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref> with only a minority of young people experiencing a diagnosable mental disorder accessing professional help.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As prevalence for the development of many mental disorders peaks in adolescence and early adulthood,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> targeting stigma earlier may help to reduce this delay.</p><p>Contact interventions aiming to improve stigma and literacy have not generally investigated mental health and well-being outcomes. There is emerging evidence, however, that school-based programmes which aim to reduce stigma and increase literacy may additionally improve participants&#x02019; mental health and resilience.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Resilience can be considered as factors which may protect against the development of a mental illness, such as personal disposition, family cohesion and social support.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Programmes which promote mental health and resilience tend to show greater impact than those which aim to reduce mental illness.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Mental health literacy programmes which have a focus on increasing help-seeking and understanding of resilience skills such as self-esteem, may play into this.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Contact may, additionally, help engagement with programmes, as adolescents report that they would value hearing personal experiences when being taught about mental health.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>This cluster RCT aimed, first, to test the hypothesis that contact, in addition to education, is more effective than education alone in reducing stigma, improving mental health literacy, and promoting well-being in young adolescents, and second, to assess the feasibility of conducting contact-based intervention research in an adolescent population, the ability of the facilitators to conduct the intervention with fidelity, and the acceptability of the contact element of the intervention to adolescent groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A pragmatic cluster RCT was undertaken in six secondary schools in Birmingham, UK.

Contact modules for the intervention were designed in collaboration with current and past users of mental health services. The young person with experience of mental illness, or &#x02018;Contact Volunteer&#x02019;, worked with the class throughout the morning, but did not reveal that they lived with a mental illness. Halfway through the day it was disclosed to the class that one of the people leading the intervention had experienced a mental illness. This was done so that the participants would be able to spend the morning getting to know the individuals without preconceptions based on the knowledge that they had a diagnosis. For the 20&#x02005;min Contact Session, the Contact Volunteer then discussed what it is like to live with a mental illness, and answered questions from the class. The length of time for the formal contact presentation was decided on after discussion with the Contact Volunteers. The volunteer then continued to work with the class for the rest of the day and to discuss their experiences and answer questions in a less formal manner.</p><p>The majority of Contact Volunteers were recruited via the Early Intervention in Psychosis Service.

The MAKS Cronbach's &#x003b1; is moderate at 0.65.

In accordance with CONSORT guidelines, unadjusted analysis was employed as the primary analysis. In order to account for the clustered nature of the RCT, school and condition were included as covariates, as well as baseline measure scores. The GEE was also used to accommodate the fact that data on which class each participant was in was not collected, meaning that the analysis was unable to account for this aspect of the clustering. Outcomes were transformed if skewed. Where data was ordinal an ordinal logistic GEE was used. An adjusted analysis was also employed, with gender, ethnicity, previous contact, and whether the participant reported having been diagnosed with a mental health disorder added as additional factors. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.</p><p>To assess any change in participants&#x02019; scores, preintervention to postintervention Student t tests, or marginal homogeneity tests (where data was ordinal), were employed. Cronbach's &#x003b1;s were computed for all measures. An analysis of percentage of items left unanswered for each item from each questionnaire assessed acceptability of the measures.

Similarly, an ordinal logistic GEE found that participants in the education-alone condition displayed greater improvements in their willingness to help-seek compared with participants in the contact and education condition, &#x02212;0.26, 95% CI (&#x02212;0.52 to &#x02212;0.00), p=0.05, d=0.02. Finally, resilience data was reverse-coded, and a square root transformation was used on baseline and follow-up data. The unadjusted GEE found no significant difference in improvement between conditions at follow-up, 0.19, 95% CI (&#x02212;0.15 to 0.52), p=0.3, d=0.05.</p><p>Student t tests, and marginal homogeneity tests, were employed to assess significance of change in participants&#x02019; scores preintervention to postintervention.

Similar results to these were found for the secondary outcome of resilience, with intergroup contact adding no value to education alone. For secondary outcome measures of knowledge, emotional well-being and help-seeking participants&#x02019; scores in the education-alone condition improved significantly more than those in the contact and education condition.</p><p>The results are in line with the findings of a meta-analysis from Corrigan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> which compared education-alone interventions to contact interventions, and suggested that within adolescent populations, education interventions held more promise for the reduction of stigma. On the other hand, the findings conflict with the only three previous studies which investigated education and contact compared with education alone in adolescent populations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> There are several possible reasons for the absence of gains from contact in this trial. The majority of research into the relationship between contact and stigma has been conducted within adult populations. Owing to the rapid nature of brain changes throughout adolescence<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> there may be a large discrepancy in level of maturation between adolescents who differ in age even by a year or two. Although only a few years&#x02019; age gap separates the young adolescents who took part in the present study from the slightly older adolescents of Meise <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Chan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Husek,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> this developmental difference may have had an impact on participants&#x02019; response to contact. Pinto-Foltz <italic>et al</italic>&#x02009;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> suggest that adolescents may conceptualise the term &#x02018;mental illness&#x02019; in a different way to older populations. For example, young adolescents may lack an internal reference system for mental illness, or have a framework of mental illness which is somewhat undifferentiated. If this is the case, then contact may serve more to confuse than to clarify, as mental illness in &#x02018;reality&#x02019; often does not conform neatly into diagnostic categories, and comorbidity is common.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Alternatively, adolescents may have an internal framework for mental illness, but it may be a negative or fearful framework. Adolescents&#x02019; conception of mental health may be influenced by media representations of mental illness<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> leading to a framework which encapsulates many negative extremes of mental illness. If the contact used in the intervention was successful in normalising mental illness then fear of developing an illness may have increased leading to cognitive avoidance strategies<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> in participants as a defence mechanism against anxiety. Participants may have distanced themselves from the topic of mental illness, increasing their desire for social distance, and leading to a decreased engagement in the educational elements of the intervention, and a diminished impact on outcome variables.</p><p>One further hypothesis is that the contact module with its element of surprise had an amplified impact on students, leading to this section of the intervention being recalled over and above other modules. The contact module occurred midway through the day, and may have been particularly attention-grabbing, effectively wiping much of the educational elements of the intervention. Increased engagement in the contact module may have left participants with less attentional capacity to process other information presented, leading to decreased levels of improvement on the research measures when compared with the education-alone condition. This account is in line with themes discussed in the focus groups investigating the acceptability of the intervention, in which participants reported engaging with and valuing the contact. It is possible that the introduction of the contact was too sudden, and that contact may have had a more positive impact if introduced in a different manner, for example, after more time to consolidate the educational aspect of the intervention. If correct, this would suggest that it was not the contact per se which reduced the impact of the intervention, but the timing and manner in which the contact was introduced. Rusch <italic>et al</italic>&#x02009;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> outline a number of factors which are advantageous if contact is to be successful including equal status and cooperative interaction between group members as well as institutional support. The current intervention had support from the senior management within the schools, and cooperative interaction was reached by the inclusion of group activities and discussions in which both students and &#x02018;contact volunteers&#x02019; took part. Rusch <italic>et al</italic>'s criteria of &#x02018;equal status&#x02019; was, however, not entirely possible, as the school environment naturally lends itself to a division of status between teacher and student.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Rusch <italic>et al</italic> also discuss the need for members of the stigmatised group to disconfirm stereotypes only mildly, and suggest that individuals who disconfirm a stereotype too strongly may not have the desired effect of reducing stigma.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Instead, participants may decide that the individual represents an &#x02018;exception to the rule&#x02019;. Some of the young people who shared their experiences with the students were partially recovered. This may have led participants to define them differently on a conceptual level to &#x02018;mentally ill&#x02019; and reduced the overall impact of the contact.</p><p>There are a number of implications regarding the use of intergroup contact with young adolescent populations which are important for mental health policy and antistigma campaigns. The students participating in the current research had just a single morning session of mental health education directly prior to the contact element of the intervention, with no time in between to process the information they had received. If young adolescents do lack an internal reference system for mental illness it may be that they require more extensive mental health education prior to experiencing contact compared with adults.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although contact in the present intervention followed an educational component, it may be that due to the participants&#x02019; relatively young developmental stage, the quantity of education given prior to contact (approximately 3&#x02005;h) was insufficient. Similarly, if the engaging experience of contact reduced attentional capacity for other intervention modules then contact may still prove to be an effective technique for reducing stigma in young people if additional time is given for participants to process the information they have received before the introduction of intergroup contact. Additionally, it is felt that adolescents may also need more time and discussion <italic>after</italic> the presentation of contact to consolidate and process the information they have received.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> To investigate this possibility, future research could occur over a number of sessions over several days, allowing for the consolidation of educational elements of the intervention before introducing contact elements. The current research suggests, however, that it would be premature to implement large-scale dissemination of contact as a means to reduce stigma in adolescent populations.</p><p>There is little previous research which examines the use of contact as a means to address well-being in adolescents. Where research has examined this question, it has usually been in relation to attitudes to help-seeking, with some authors reporting that the use of contact improved attitudes,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and others, that no significant improvements were observed.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> An interesting outcome of the present research is that mental health improved despite the fact that much of the intervention dealt with topics unrelated explicitly to the promotion of mental health. Previous interventions aiming to improve mental health have had some success<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> although others have reported flat results.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Mental health literacy topics have a direct relevance to the promotion of mental health, through the raising of awareness of mental health subjects, resilience or coping mechanisms,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and may prove to be a successful technique for increasing well-being in adolescents.</p><p>Previous research has been criticised for only representing specific school types (eg, fee-paying, single-gender schools).<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> For the SchoolSpace Trial, intervention schools were chosen to represent the diversity of the UK school system in order to increase generalisability. Schools, therefore, may not have represented a homogeneous group, despite being analysed in this way. It is also important to note that the acceptability of the intervention was assessed in just one school, and that these results may, therefore, not generalise to other schools which took part in the study. To maintain power, classes were randomised within schools to each condition, rather than entire schools, which may have allowed a degree of cross-contamination between conditions, and magnified intraclass correlations. This means that effect sizes between conditions may have been diluted. The analysis design accounted for clustering by including school and condition (contact and education or education alone) as covariates. Data on which class each participant was in was not collected, meaning that the analysis was unable to account for this aspect of the clustering. In addition, the sample size achieved was small to moderate, which will have impacted the power of the study. Two of the studies measures, the RIBS and the MAKS, were not validated for use with adolescent populations. The Cronbach's &#x003b1; for the RIBS in the present sample was high, and an items missing analysis found that the measure was highly acceptable to participants. The Cronbach's &#x003b1; was low for the MAKS. Lower Cronbach's &#x003b1;s have also been found with adult samples.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The authors of the MAKS suggest this is because individuals have different levels of knowledge based on the different domains that the MAKS covers. These differences are likely to be even more pronounced in adolescent samples, resulting in a low Cronbach's &#x003b1;. The items missing analysis of the MAKS found that the measure was acceptable to participants, with very few participants skipping items on the measure. It is important to acknowledge that the research investigated two aspects of stigma, intended behaviour towards individuals diagnosed with a mental illness, and stigma-based knowledge. Other aspects of stigma, such as perceptions of dangerousness, otherness, or unpredictability were not investigated, and may interact differently with the impact of contact. Fidelity of implementation of the intervention was assessed for each condition within each school; facilitators demonstrated a high level of fidelity to the intervention implementation, and similar levels of engagement were observed across conditions, representing a strength of the project.</p><p>The present research appears to demonstrate that short educational interventions provided in schools can be successful in reducing the stigma of mental illness, as well as improving mental health literacy and outcomes of well-being. Contrary to study hypothesis, intergroup contact was not seen to add value. This is important for those involved in developing mental health and educational policy aiming to reduce stigma, and increasing mental health literacy and well-being in adolescent populations, although further research into this area is certainly warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the members of the NHS and research volunteers, and in particular those who discussed their personal experiences of mental illness with students as part of the intervention day.
