Several approaches are used to measure what people eat, but each has inherent biases and limitations. Specific characteristics of populations also contribute to bias in assessing dietary intake. For instance, underreporting is common among obese and overweight individuals [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Inaccuracy in dietary assessment is compounded further by an exponential increase of food products on the market, a glut that necessitates timely upkeep of existing food and nutrient databases to prevent them from getting outdated.</p><p>An accurate assessment of dietary consumption by adolescents is particularly challenging. Youth in this age group have difficulty conceptualizing or averaging food portion sizes [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], have a limited food vocabulary, and lack the patience and perseverance to engage in food recording [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recall of routine or regularly occurring events can be relatively accurate, but adolescents tend to skip meals [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and have wide and inconsistent day-to-day variation in the frequency, composition, and timing of their meals [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; thus, their recall could be unreliable unless they record what they eat immediately after meals and snacks.</p><p>Often, social pressure or the lack of confidentiality also makes adolescents unwilling to undertake paper-based food recording; in addition, they tend to modify their intake to ease the burden associated with food recording [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although conventional methods of dietary assessment can be cumbersome for adolescents, innovations that tap into their technological skills may keep them engaged in reporting their dietary intake [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Given that the traditional paper-and-pen food recording entails detailed descriptions of foods eaten, pictures taken during eating events can potentially reduce such burden because pictures can convey those details as well.</p><p>Mobile electronic devices have made their way into most households&#x02014;approximately 78% of adolescents own mobile phones, 23% own a tablet computer [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and a large percentage are constantly occupied with technological devices (eg, computers and mobile phones) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mobile electronics are already part of the adolescent lifestyle. Digital photography used as either the main method to record intake or in conjunction with the traditional food record can provide objective information about dietary intake, reduce participant burden, and potentially decrease the need for portion size estimation [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since digital images can simplify food recording [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], use of the camera feature of mobile phones had been tested among adolescents in both monitored [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and free-living [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] settings.</p><p>While considerable work has been done in dietary assessment methods for the purpose of reducing participant and research burden, most of the work has not been completed and is still undergoing refinement or validation. Development of software and mobile phone apps for dietary assessment purposes can be exceedingly costly, extremely challenging, and may take several years to complete [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, existing mobile phone technology (eg, camera and short message service [SMS] text messaging) may be efficiently utilized to serve practically the same purpose in collecting dietary information until apps for mobile phones are made available for researchers at a reasonable cost. Adolescents were willing to use SMS text messaging when reporting their health information needs [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likewise, the use of SMS text messaging and camera features of mobile phones needs to be tried when assessing dietary intake of adolescents.</p><p>We determined the feasibility of assessing the dietary intake of free-living adolescents by using their own mobile phones to do digital image-assisted food recording. We also explored whether the quality of food records from these adolescents would differ based on the type of training and support provided during food recording. It had been suggested that automated feedback may improve intake reporting accuracy of adolescents [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Considering that the concept of automated feedback could be mimicked with real-time human monitoring, we used the latter as a proxy to test whether real-time feedback would indeed improve recording accuracy. We hypothesized that high-level intervention, which includes face-to-face training and real-time support, would promote higher-quality food records compared to low-level intervention, which includes training through telephone conversation and next-day follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participant Selection and Study Design</title><p>We recruited 12- to 18-year-old adolescents from select middle and high schools to be part of a study to determine the feasibility of using personal mobile phones in keeping food records with digital images (FRDIs). Participants were recruited via consecutive sampling in April and August 2012. Eligibility requirements included ownership of a mobile phone with a camera, unlimited texting/calling, and the ability to send SMS text messages and images to an email address. All study protocols were approved by the Loma Linda University Institutional Review Board. We obtained consent of parents and their children&#x02019;s assent prior to starting the study.</p><p>To avoid cross-contamination and for logistical reasons, this pilot study was designed such that the first group of available volunteers who met the eligibility criteria were assigned to high-level intervention while the second group who joined the study later were assigned to low-level intervention. High-level intervention was conducted in May 2012, and low-level intervention in September 2012. Participants of the high-level intervention (n=21) were instructed to watch an instructional video prior to an in-depth, one-on-one, face-to-face training session, which took place in the school. Three research assistants were assigned to do the face-to-face training. On the other hand, personal training for the participants of the low-level intervention (n=21) was delivered via a one-one-one telephone conversation by a research assistant. Each participant received illustrated instructions beforehand, which served as the training material during the telephone conversation. Instructional content was similar for both groups. After training, participants were scheduled to perform a 1-day FRDI. All the participants who joined the study (N=42) completed the training, did their 1-day FRDI, and received a US $10 iTunes gift card as incentive.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol for Food Recording With Digital Images</title><p>Each participant received a fiducial marker (FM)&#x02014;an object of known dimension from which sizes of nearby objects can be determined&#x02014;which was a two-sided, 6-inch x 2-inch piece of laminated cardboard, checkered with 0.5-inch black and white squares. Placement of the FM in the image allowed us to approximate the size of objects (eg, eating utensils and foods). The FM had the identification number (ID) of the participant and the study logo on one side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>, Side A); on the other side, it had the same identification number with the number &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; and a list of common food measurements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>, Side B). These were sent to school administrative offices for distribution to study participants. The participant ID on the marker enabled matching and proper identification of received images. It also ensured that the images were not fabrications (eg, food images from the Internet). The schools allowed participants to use their mobile phones for the study at designated places and at break/lunch times.</p><p>We set up a secure email account for the study; it served as the interface between participants and the research team. We created a specific inbox for each participant and used filters to direct incoming mail to the appropriate inboxes. Both groups were trained to send food records as SMS text messages with images of their meals to the study email address. To make sure they could do so, they were required to respond to an instructional SMS text message from the research team. It asked them to send a return message and an image of their FM to the specified email address. Participants were also told to save the email address in their contact list to facilitate correspondence with the research team. The day before filing their 1-day FRDI, each participant received an email reminder to charge his or her mobile phone, bring the FM to school the following day, and review the illustrative instructions one more time.</p><p>At every eating occasion, participants took an image of the food setting with the FM placed below the setting and parallel to the table&#x02019;s edge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>). Once finished eating, they sent the image with an SMS text message that listed the meal name, time (ie, since not all images would necessarily include metadata on the time and/or date the image was taken), foods, and corresponding amounts eaten. They repeated the process for second helpings and/or additional beverages and foods. They were required to send an after-meal image if there were leftovers. Otherwise, they could just send an SMS text message indicating that they had eaten everything in the original image. Before retiring for the night, they texted a closure message with the time and the term &#x0201c;end&#x0201d; to indicate that nothing more would be consumed after that time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref> shows a schematic diagram of this process.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fiducial marker with two sides that show the identification (ID) number of the participant and the study logo (Sides A and B), and commonly used portion size measurements (Side B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i3e91_fig1"/></fig><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Image of the food setting with the fiducial marker (FM).

The height of the mobile phone camera above the setting (~1 foot) is first determined using the ribbon on the FM. When stepping back, elbows are clipped to one's sides to maintain position of the arms. Keeping the arms steady, the mobile phone camera is tilted up or down until the whole setting can be seen on the screen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i3e91_fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Collection of Data: High-Level Versus Low-Level Intervention</title><p>Research assistants were trained in providing both real-time support and follow-up to ensure uniformity in following protocols. Both groups were sent a reminder message the day before their scheduled reporting day to ready their mobile phones and bring their FM to school the following day.</p><p>High-level intervention, characterized by real-time support, involved active synchronous monitoring. During the scheduled reporting day, trained research assistants monitored the high-level intervention participants from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. Real-time support entailed sending reminder messages or prompts, particularly when SMS text messages and images were not coming in around expected eating times, and on-the-spot instructions when they saw reporting errors (eg, blurred or missing FM). The monitors also reminded participants to send the closure &#x0201c;end&#x0201d; messages before they retired for the night.</p><p>While actively monitoring the high-level intervention participants, texted images and corresponding messages from the email inboxes were collated into PowerPoint slides. Each slide included an image and text report of a meal or food/beverage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref> shows this process. In addition, researchers logged observations and issues encountered during monitoring.</p><p>Low-level intervention only entailed next-day follow-up. No reminders or any kind of monitoring was given during the reporting day of low-level intervention participants. The following day, research assistants checked the participants&#x02019; reports and transferred the images and corresponding SMS text messages from their email inboxes to their individual food records (ie, PowerPoint slides). Observations about the messages and images were logged. Participants were informed about items that needed clarification, and their responses were entered into their PowerPoint record (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>). For both high-level and low-level interventions, the food record was a product of the participant&#x02019;s (text and image) and the research assistant&#x02019;s (interpretation and assembly of sent texts and images) contributions.</p><fig id="figure3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Diagram of the food record with digital images (FRDI) using personal mobile phones by adolescents.

Since participants were instructed to take an <italic>after</italic> image only if there were leftovers, no score was assigned to <italic>before-and-after</italic> photos. We used the quality of reports to determine adherence to instructions. The maximum score was 5 points, which was equivalent to 100% adherence to instructions.</p><p>Descriptive statistical (ie, frequencies) and comparison (ie, paired and independent <italic>t</italic> tests) analyses were used to evaluate the quality of FRDIs. All analyses were done using IBM SPSS version 22.0 for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>To determine if type of training would differentiate reported intake among these adolescents, we compared their energy intake from the 1-day FRDI with their estimated energy requirement (EER). Energy intake (EI) from food records was determined by using the Nutrition Data Systems for Research version 2012 software developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. EER was computed using the equations to calculate the Dietary Reference Intake for energy [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; physical activity level (PAL) was set at low active (PAL of 1.40-1.59), which has equivalent physical activity (PA) values of 1.13 for boys and 1.16 for girls:</p><p>EER<sub>boys</sub>,<sub>9-18 years old</sub> = 88.5-(61.9 x age [y]) + PA x {(26.7 x weight [kg]) + (903 x height [m])} + 25 (1)</p><p>EER<sub>girls</sub>,<sub>9-18 years old</sub> = 135.3-(30.8 x age [y]) + PA x {(10.0 x weight [kg]) + (934 x height [m])} + 25 (2)</p><p>Accuracy of energy reporting was determined using the EI:EER ratio.

Our study also showed that low-level intervention (ie, training via telephone conversation plus next-day follow-up) yielded higher-quality reports compared to high-level intervention (ie, face-to-face training plus real-time support during food recording).</p><p>Instructions on how to take images, place the fiducial markers, text the details of their food intake, and send the information to the email address we set up solely for the study were followed carefully by the majority of the participants. Adherence to instructions in this study of free-living adolescents was higher compared with that in a study that determined how amenable adolescents were to recording their dietary intake using a mobile phone app [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An age difference might explain this disparity&#x02014;our subjects were older (ie, 12-18 years old) than those in the previous study (ie, 11-14 years old). In-depth, one-on-one training and the short duration of the study also possibly contributed to better compliance. We found that this innovative approach of utilizing existing resources (ie, asking participants to use their own mobile phones) in reporting dietary intake is not only attainable, but could also potentially save financial resources (eg, cost of phone service fees and researcher-provided mobile phones for participants). Conducting the study in a free-living situation and during school days, which are relevant routines for school-age youth, also renders good external validity. This study also allowed us to examine if real-time feedback, albeit in a different delivery mode than automated feedback suggested by investigators [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], is an appropriate method to improve intake reporting accuracy among adolescents.</p><p>Our results indicate that it does not take a high-level intervention to get better-quality 1-day FRDIs from adolescents. Compared to the high-level intervention participants, the low-level intervention group complied better with the requirements of food recording; all of them had their FM during the day of reporting as evidenced by the appearance of FMs in all images, and a higher proportion of this group also provided images with correctly placed FMs&#x02014;an important consideration when estimating portion sizes&#x02014;good quality images, SMS text message image with FM pairs, and food records with complete information. The low-level intervention group also met more quality criteria and had higher total scores, indicating greater adherence to instructions. A possible explanation for this difference could be the reliance of the low-level intervention group on the pictorial instructions, which many in the group brought with them to school during their reporting day. Extra emphasis was given to reviewing the pictorial instructions in the food recording reminder message sent the day before to the low-level intervention group. On the other hand, the high-level intervention group was simply reminded about food recording the following day. Both groups, however, were reminded to prepare their phones and FM; despite that, two of the high-level intervention members forgot to bring their FMs to school and, thus, the FM was missing in their images. Since we assumed that participants read their reminder messages, we did not verify if the reminders were actually read.</p><p>The reported energy intake on the FRDI and proportion of underreported and plausibly reported energy intakes were similar for both groups. The agreement between the EI and EER was moderate, which indicates that the use of mobile phones in recording dietary intake assisted by digital images provided good estimates of a day&#x02019;s intake. However, energy intake based on just one day would be insufficient to determine over- or underreporting given the wide day-to-day intake variation especially among adolescents [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Also, there is evidence that adolescents tend to underreport their intake, which becomes more pronounced as weight increases [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since some of our participants skipped a meal during the day (6/42, 14%), this could partly explain why median intakes of energy for both groups were lower compared to the EER.</p><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, real-time support during food recording did not produce better outcomes. Logs during real-time monitoring consistently showed nonresponse among participants who were asked to take better images with properly placed FMs. Since we collected the 1-day FRDIs during school days, schoolwork and activities and short break times might have accounted for the nonresponse or tendency of the face-to-face participants to ignore text reminders from researchers. Although we asked school administrators to exempt study participants from the rule of not using their mobile phones while at school, classroom teachers may have enforced the rule in their classes without exception. In addition, although we did not find any issues when we pretested our email interface on different mobile phones and service carriers, delays in communication exchanges during the monitoring may have played a role as well. In another study, poor compliance was observed when adolescents were preoccupied with a more engaging activity (ie, a minor league baseball game) [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given the results of our human-mediated prompts and reminders, further investigation on how automated prompts/reminders compare to human-mediated intervention in facilitating accuracy in reporting diet among adolescents would be needed.</p><p>Better results from low-level versus high-level intervention have implications for the design of subsequent studies. Manually administered real-time support or immediate feedback was more time-consuming than next-day follow-up. To anticipate the volume of incoming messages based on the number of scheduled participants, we needed monitors on hand from the approximate times for breakfast (ie, from 5:30 AM) until late-night snacks (ie, approximately 10:00 PM). To make immediate feedback cost-effective, a proper balance between manpower needs and peak demand was necessary. On the other hand, a next-day follow-up intervention allowed time to identify issues with full reports, ask for clarifications, and then make changes as needed. We scheduled follow-up at mutually agreed-upon times, ensuring that the participant would be available when contacted. This arrangement eliminated the need for excess manpower and was, thus, more economical. Monitor time was also well-spent in collating text messages and images into PowerPoint slides. Although this process was also time-consuming, we found such follow-up to be a crucial step in ascertaining the accuracy of collected data.</p><p>Food record apps for mobile phones lessen the burden associated with the traditional paper-and-pen food recording, since subjects are required to only take quality images and to confirm or adjust their input based on a feedback loop after the automated identification and quantification of food images [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The concept we used in our method is similar: take good-quality images and provide a food report&#x02014;which is minimal, considering that only the meal name, time of intake, list of foods, and amounts eaten need to be texted&#x02014;then confirm or adjust input as needed after review by the researcher. Although digital images usually include metadata on date and time the image was taken, we cannot assume that different mobile phone brands, models, and service carriers uniformly provide such information. Thus, we asked participants to still include the time their meals were eaten in their texted reports. Technology-assisted dietary assessment using computer algorithms to estimate food intake [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] holds great promise. However, fully automated analysis of digital images from mobile phones to identify and quantify foods could become inaccurate or lead to underestimation without additional information about the foods eaten [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, an automated image analysis that fails to distinguish a veggie burger from a meat burger would lead to inaccurate dietary analysis. Incorporating other technologies, such as voice recorders [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and bar code scanners, may eventually improve the identification and quantification of food images. In the interim, human intervention is still necessary to supervise data collection, management, and analysis in ways that improve accuracy [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The incorporation of new dietary assessment technologies in mobile phone apps remains cost-prohibitive for use in large epidemiological studies. Although mobile phone food record apps are being developed and/or utilized, it will take time for the software algorithms to optimize human input. Until the full potential of these approaches are realized, our method of direct interpretation of simple texts and images can be considered feasible. However, we need to develop approaches that can speed up the transfer of texted food messages and digital images into files that can be easily encoded or linked with nutrient composition databases.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a number of limitations. Although the method we used eased some of the burdens associated with pen-and-paper food recording, data collation, management, and quality control on the part of the researcher was time-consuming and prone to human error. However, feasibility studies on mobile phone food record apps developed to assess dietary intake of adolescents [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have also demonstrated similar data management challenges. The lack of random assignment to the two intervention groups could have biased the results. The low-level intervention group had older participants, which might explain why the group had better results. However, cross-contamination between the two groups was also highly possible if the two interventions were simultaneously conducted. The two interventions were separated by 3-4 months which minimized possible cross-contamination. This arrangement also made the most logistical sense. Given that mobile phones with camera capability and unlimited phone service were necessary to conduct this study, this precluded participation of individuals who did not own mobile phones and/or high-quality phone service. Also, a 1-day food record may not provide enough information about adherence to instructions when food recording is done for more than 1 day. However, our intent in this study was to test the workability of self-reporting intake using the functions of personal mobile phones, so a 1-day food record would be considered sufficient. The email interface between participants and the researchers in the exchange of SMS text messages could be another limitation if technological glitches existed. However, we had tested this interface for different carriers and different mobile phones before the study started. Technological glitches, however, could possibly affect responsiveness of the high-level intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using personal mobile phones to report dietary intake via texting and taking digital images of foods eaten is feasible among free-living adolescents. High-level intervention involving real-time support is not a guarantee that the quality of food recording among adolescents will be more accurate. This food recording method is a prudent alternative until technology-assisted dietary assessment apps for mobile phones become widely available.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by the Soy Nutrition Institute; the sponsor had no role in the development, implementation, or findings of this study.
