We conducted a phrase III trial in which patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomized 2:1 to the mIFL [irinotecan (125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), leucovorin (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) bolus, and 5-fluorouracil intravenous infusion (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) weekly for four weeks every six weeks] plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every two weeks) group and the mIFL group, respectively. Co-primary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS) and 6-month PFS rate. In total, 214 patients were enrolled. Our results showed that addition of bevacizumab to mIFL significantly improved median PFS (4.2 months in the mIFL group vs. 8.3 months in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), 6-month PFS rate (25.0% vs. 62.6%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), median overall survival (13.4 months vs. 18.7 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.014), and response rate (17% vs. 35%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.013). Grades 3 and 4 adverse events included diarrhea (21% in the mIFL group and 26% in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group) and neutropenia (19% in the mIFL group and 33% in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group). No wound-healing complications or congestive heart failure occurred. Our results suggested that bevacizumab plus mIFL is effective and well tolerated as first-line treatment for Chinese patients with mCRC. Clinical benefit and safety profiles were consistent with those observed in pivotal phase III trials with mainly Caucasian patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bevacizumab</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>first-line treatment</kwd><kwd>Chinese patients</kwd><kwd>metastatic colorectal cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In China, colorectal cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in men and the sixth most common malignancy in women<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

After disease progression or withdrawal, patients were followed up at least every three months until death.</p><p>Tumor assessments using abdominal and pelvic spiral computed tomography (CT) with chest X-rays or CT scans were performed at baseline and every six weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks. Objective response and disease progression were determined by the investigator using RECIST. Confirmation of response was performed four weeks after it was first documented. The PFS rate at six months was defined as the proportion of patients not experiencing disease progression or death due to any cause from randomization to six months after that. Patients without tumor assessment or survival information at week 24 for any reason were not regarded as progression-free survival at six months. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documented disease progression or death due to any causes. ORR according to RECIST was the best response documented from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence. Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented complete or partial response to disease progression or death due to any cause.</p><p>Patients were evaluated for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) before each treatment cycle until treatment end. AEs were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size estimation was based on practical considerations; it had adequate power for detecting the difference in PFS based on the available results from the pivotal global study.</p><p>The primary population for all efficacy analyses, full analysis set (FAS) population, was defined as all patients enrolled into the study who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one tumor assessment after randomization.

Evaluation of the secondary efficacy endpoints showed that the addition of bevacizumab to mIFL significantly improved median OS compared to mIFL alone (18.7 months vs. 13.4 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.014), increased the ORR from 17.2% to 35.3% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013), and increased the duration of response from 3.5 months to 7.4 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.081). The improvements in PFS and OS observed following the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a clinically meaningful reduction of 56% in the risk of progression or death and a reduction of 38% in the risk of death.</p><p>The efficacy of mIFL chemotherapy alone in this study is comparable with that reported in a phase II trial involving Chinese patients with mCRC receiving mIFL chemotherapy in which the ORR was 17% and the median time to progression was six months<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the PFS and OS in both groups in the current study were numerically shorter than those observed in the pivotal study by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Besides the ethnic difference of the patients enrolled in the two studies, there are several possible explanations for these differences. First, baseline ECOG performance status was slightly less favorable in this study (48% of patients with ECOG performance status 0) compared to the study by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (57% patients with ECOG performance status 0), which suggests that the prognosis of patients in this study might be slightly worse. Also, almost 50% of the patients in this study had rectal cancer; however, only 20% patients with rectal cancer were enrolled in the study by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite the above differences between the two studies, the efficacy findings reported here show the same trend toward clinical benefit for bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in Chinese patients with mCRC as that observed by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, suggesting that Chinese patients may achieve the same clinical benefit from bevacizumab treatment as Caucasian patients.</p><p>The tolerability profile of combination of bevacizumab with mIFL was consistent with that in other studies using this or similar regimens, e.g., the studies by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and Huang <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in Chinese patients with mCRC resulted in a slightly increased incidence of AEs, especially chemotherapy-associated AEs such as neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea, compared to chemotherapy alone. The incidence of grades 3 and 4 AEs was also increased slightly from 62% to 69% with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy, but treatment discontinuations as a result of AEs were mainly the result of chemotherapy-associated toxicities. Notably, treatment duration was much longer in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group (161 days) than in the mIFL group (64 days), and cumulative doses of chemotherapy were also higher (almost twice as high) in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group than in the mIFL group. Grade 3 hypertension (4% vs. 0%), proteinuria (1% vs. 0%), arterial thromboembolic events (1% vs. 0%), and gastrointestinal perforation (1% vs. 0%) were more commonly observed in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group than in the mIFL group. No grade 3 venous thromboembolic events or wound-healing complications and episodes of congestive heart failure of any grade were observed. No new safety signals were observed with bevacizumab, and the addition of this biological agent to mIFL was well tolerated against a background of irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>The clinical benefits of adding bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy for mCRC have been observed across a range of different chemotherapy regimens<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The bevacizumab regimens (investigation of treatment effects and safety, BRiTE) observational study showed that patients with mCRC who continued bevacizumab treatment after first progression had superior median survival beyond progression and median OS (19.2 and 31.8 months, respectively) than did those in whom bevacizumab was discontinued after progression (9.5 and 19.9 months, respectively)<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, indicating that second-line bevacizumab is beneficial even in patients who received this agent in the first-line setting. A separate observational cohort study examined the role of bevacizumab after disease progression in patients who did or did not received first-line bevacizumab and showed a trend towards longer OS in patients who had first- and second-line bevacizumab exposure (median OS, 21.7 months) than in patients who only received bevacizumab after progression (median OS, 17.5 months)<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The second-line PFS was similar in both groups (7.6 vs. 8.0 months, respectively)<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Those findings, together with the results of the present study, support the use of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with mCRC.</p><p>In summary, this phase III ARTIST trial suggested that the addition of bevacizumab to mIFL chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of Chinese patients with mCRC resulted in a significantly increased PFS rate at six months and improved PFS, OS, and ORR. This clinical benefit was accompanied by a low rate of additional AEs. Furthermore, the clinical benefit and safety profiles of bevacizumab in Chinese patients were consistent with those observed in pivotal phase III multi-national trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
