Thus, metabolic acidosis abolished the early post-exercise increase of PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA and the mRNA of downstream mitochondrial and glucose-regulating proteins. These findings indicate that metabolic acidosis may affect mitochondrial biogenesis, with divergent responses in resting and post-exercise skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the Massey University Research Fund.

Understanding the control of this gene expression would therefore seem important to understand the mechanisms responsible for adaptations to exercise training. One factor that has been reported to affect the activity-induced transcription of metabolic genes associated with substrate utilization, such as mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], is the intracellular environment (e.g., low muscle glycogen content). A yet-to-be-explored hypothesis, raised by our previous research [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is that intracellular pH (pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) may also affect the exercise-induced transcription of genes that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that acidosis can affect molecular signalling. For example, basal insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity has been reported to be suppressed following a small chronic decrease in the blood pH (0.11 of a pH unit) of rats [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with a subsequent increase in mRNAs encoding ubiquitin and protease subunits [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) ingestion decreases the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in rat kidneys [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given that MAPK is involved in one of the main signalling pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, this result provides support for the hypothesis that acidosis may affect the transcription of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. This would be consistent with the observation that the addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) to C2C12 myotubes promotes the up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) and some of its downstream targets (COX-II, COX-IV and cytochrome c) [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, while the effects of acidosis on kidney function and acute changes in gene expression in mammalian tissue have received much attention, little is known about the effects of manipulating pH on activity-induced gene expression in skeletal muscle.</p><p>It has previously been reported that ingesting NaHCO<sub>3</sub> prior to high-intensity exercise training promotes greater improvements in endurance performance [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was hypothesized that this may be due to the negative effects of a decrease in pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> on exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial function, as measured by mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It was subsequently reported that rats ingesting NaHCO<sub>3</sub> before physical activity (so as to reduce the activity-induced decrease in muscle pH) had significantly greater adaptations to five weeks of exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This included greater mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] compared with both a control group (no training) and a placebo group (identical exercise, but ingesting sodium chloride before each session). These results raise the intriguing possibility that pH may affect skeletal muscle gene expression associated with mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to manipulate intra- and extracellular pH, via an acute acid load (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion), and to determine the effects on both basal mRNA levels and the exercise-induced mRNA responses of important regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2;, and downstream target proteins such as citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c (CYT-C). We also investigated the effects of an acute acid load on basal mRNA levels and the exercise-induced mRNA responses of proteins associated with acute and chronic metabolic regulation such as glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), hexokinase (HKII), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). We hypothesized that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion would exacerbate the exercise-induced acidosis and be associated with a decrease in the exercise-induced mRNA response of these important regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight moderately-trained males (age 25 &#x000b1; 6 y, body mass 83.7 &#x000b1; 9.0, <inline-formula id="pone.0141317.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0141317.e002.jpg" id="pone.0141317.e002g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mtext>peak</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> 47.6 &#x000b1; 7.6 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) volunteered to participate in this study.

For the first time, we have shown that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion alters basal and exercise-induced changes in the mRNA content of PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA and other mitochondrial/metabolic proteins in human skeletal muscle. At rest, the mRNA content of PGC-1&#x003b1; and its downstream targets, such as CS and CYT-C, was greater in ACID versus PLA. However, only in the PLA condition was the post-exercise mRNA content of mitochondrial- and glucose-regulating proteins greater than resting values (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In contrast, the post-exercise mRNA contents of PGC-1&#x003b1;, CS, CYT-C, FOXO1, GLUT4, and HKII mRNA levels were not different from resting levels in the ACID condition (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore, our results show that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion increases the mRNA content of some genes in skeletal muscle at rest, but reduces the exercise-induced response of these same genes. Hence, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion appears to have different effects on the resting and post-exercise mRNA content of PGC-1&#x003b1; and its downstream targets.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Efficacy of ingestion protocol</title><p>Administration of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl has widely been used to induce extracellular acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. NH<sub>4</sub>Cl uptake by the liver results in the formation of urea and the net release of HCl, which is not completely buffered by extracellular bicarbonate. As a consequence, there was a significant decrease in resting values for both venous bicarbonate and blood pH (<xref rid="pone.0141317.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Despite the large decrease in resting extracellular pH, there was no change in resting muscle pH. This is consistent with previous human [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and <italic>in-vivo</italic> rat studies [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and has been suggested to be attributed to the actions of intracellular buffers (e.g., protein-bound histidine residues, imidazole-containing dipeptides and phosphates within the muscle; [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) that act to maintain pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. This indicates that the response of intact animals to a decrease in extracellular pH is more complex than in cultured cells where pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> typically decreases in parallel with extracellular pH.</p><p>In contrast to the resting condition, and similar to previous results [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the lower post-exercise extracellular pH following NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion was associated with a significantly lower pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Consistent with previous research in humans [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion also resulted in significantly lower post-exercise plasma pH and blood lactate values (<xref rid="pone.0141317.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The lower post-exercise blood pH can be attributed to the reduced extracellular buffer capacity, while the lower blood lactate concentration can be attributed to both inhibition of glycolysis and reduced lactate transport out of muscle cells when the extracellular pH is increased [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>The effects of metabolic acidosis on resting mRNA content</title><p>At rest, PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA, and the mRNA content of some of its downstream targets, such as CS and CYT-C, was elevated following NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion (<xref rid="pone.0141317.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Indeed, the resting levels of these genes were elevated to a similar degree to that observed immediately post-exercise during the PLA condition. While this is the first study to determine the effects of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion on the mRNA content of mitochondrial proteins in skeletal muscle, it has previously been reported that a decrease in blood pH of 0.14 pH units increases the expression of a range of genes in mice kidneys, including citrate synthase [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results suggest that extracellular acidosis is associated with increased resting mitochondrial gene expression in a range of tissues.</p><p>In contrast to the effects of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion on mitochondrial mRNA content, there was no significant increase in the resting mRNA content of glucose-regulating genes (i.e., HKII and GLUT4; <xref rid="pone.0141317.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). There was however, a significant increase in FOXO1 mRNA content (<xref rid="pone.0141317.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that in muscle atrophying due to uremia, there is an increase in FOXO1 mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, acute metabolic acidosis has been reported to increase protein breakdown in rat skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], via an increase in mRNAs encoding ubiquitin and protease subunits [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Extracellular acidosis has also been reported to affect the IRS/PI3-K cascade [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Specifically, extracellular acidosis was associated with an increase in the amount of PI3-K p85 subunit protein which decreased IRS-1-associated PI3-K activity, resulting in a reduction in the phosphorylation (i.e., activation) of Akt (protein kinase B) [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As phosporylated Akt suppresses the activity of the FOXO1 class of transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt could help to explain the increase in FOXO1 mRNA content that was observed at rest in the ACID condition in the present study. These results suggest that extracellular acidosis is a powerful stimulus up-regulating multiple pathways associated with an increase in protein degradation.</p><p>Potential mechanisms for the altered resting mRNA levels in the present study require further investigation. Nonetheless, as NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion did not alter resting pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, it appears likely the mechanism(s) is related to the observed decrease in extracellular pH (and/or bicarbonate). There are a number of receptors and pathways that are thought to be affected by extracellular acidosis. For example, both the system A neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT2) [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] are thought to be sensitive to extracellular acidosis. Activation of GPCRs may explain why p38 MAPK has been reported to be activated by a decrease in extracellular pH [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Relevant to our findings, p38MAPK phosphorylates PGC-1&#x003b1;. This increases the stability of this protein, and promotes the release of PGC-1&#x003b1; repressors, which improves the transcription of mitochondrial genes [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Intracellular free calcium concentrations also rise in whole animals and intact cells in response to ammonium chloride treatment [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, ammonia induces an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ROS and intracellular free calcium are known messengers in the p38MAPK and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) pathways, and have also been suggested to regulate PGC-1&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further research is required to investigate the role of p38 MAPK and CaMK in responding to extracellular pH changes and increasing the expression of mitochondrial genes in human skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>The effects of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion on post-exercise mRNA content</title><p>During the PLA trial there was a significant post-exercise increase in most of the genes that were measured (2&#x02013;20 fold; Figs <xref rid="pone.0141317.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141317.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These activity-induced increases in mRNA content are consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, extracellular acidosis was associated with an attenuated exercise-induced expression of these genes, such that only PGC-1&#x003b2; was elevated 2 h post-exercise (compared with rest) during the ACID trial. Furthermore, PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA content 2 h post-exercise in the ACID trial was 3-fold lower than in the PLA trial (<xref rid="pone.0141317.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). These results indicate that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion reduces the normal post-exercise increase in mRNAs for proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose regulation.</p><p>It has previously been reported that the intracellular environment (e.g., low muscle glycogen) affects the activity-induced transcription of metabolic genes associated with substrate utilization, such as mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We provide new information that pH may also affect the exercise-induced mRNA responses of proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis (and glucose regulation). This blunting of the mRNA response may be due to the already elevated resting mRNA level of PGC-1&#x003b1; and other metabolic proteins and/or the effects of altered metabolite levels on signaling cascades when intense muscle contraction is accompanied by ammonium-chloride-induced acidosis.</p><p>Previous research has shown that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion reduces muscle AMP, ADP and lactate content following intense exercise [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is well known that changes in phosphorylation potential (e.g., AMP:ATP ratio) initiate numerous downstream molecular events in skeletal muscle, at least in part via AMPK activation [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By sensing the energy status of the muscle cell, AMPK has been suggested to be a critical regulator involved in initiating mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, muscle lactate has also been proposed to be an important signaling molecule that affects transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, smaller exercise-induced changes in muscle AMP and lactate accumulation may contribute to our observations of smaller exercise-induced increases in mRNA content following NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion. However, further research is required to identify the mechanisms by which NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion blunted the normal exercised-induced increase in mRNA content in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Exercise versus rest&#x02014;why the difference?</title><p>An interesting and novel finding from the present study is that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion enhanced resting mRNA content, but blunted the exercise-induced increase in mRNA content. These contrasting effects may be attributable to the different effects of intracellular and extracellular pH changes. As discussed earlier, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion was associated with a decrease in both intracellular and extracellular pH post exercise, but a decrease in resting extracellular pH only. It may therefore be hypothesized that the increase in resting mRNA content was due to membrane components sensitive to extracellular acidosis (e.g., GPCRs; [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) or the system A neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT2) [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas the mechanisms explaining the blunted post-exercise mRNA response are related to changes in pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. It is also possible that whether gene expression is up or down regulated depends on the magnitude of the pH change. It has previously been reported that the rate of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription was increased in cells at a pH of 7.1, compared with 7.4, but decreased at a pH of 6.9 [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Further research is required to investigate both of these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitations</title><p>While administration of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is a commonly-used used model of acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is possible that our results can be attributable to a specific effect of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (e.g., urea production), rather than changes in pH. However, similar decreases in protein synthesis have been observed following administration of either NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or a cation-exchange resin [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; the resin induces acidosis by releasing hydrogen ions in exchange for other cations in the gastrointestinal tract, thus lowering the systemic pH. While further research, using different substances to alter pH is required, these findings suggest that the altered mRNA levels in the present study are unlikely to be specific to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl ingestion.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results suggest that disturbances to acid-base homeostasis have the potential to alter both resting and post-exercise mRNA content of proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose regulation. The changes in the mRNA content of mitochondrial-related proteins are consistent with our previous research demonstrating that increasing extracellular pH prior to training is associated with significantly greater improvements in endurance performance in humans [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and mitochondrial respiration in rats [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While further research is required, these results have potential implications for populations who experience a greater decrease in pH at rest (e.g., chronic renal failure patients [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) or during physical activity (e.g., diabetics [<xref rid="pone.0141317.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141317.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Raw data for individual participants.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0141317.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the essential role of Dr Johann Edge in performing this research.
