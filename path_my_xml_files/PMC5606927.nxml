Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard treatment for term newborns after perinatal hypoxic ischemic injury (HI). Despite this, TH does not provide complete neuroprotection. Allopurinol seems to be a good neuroprotector in several animal studies, but it has never been tested in combination with hypothermia.</p><p>Clinical findings show that male infants with (HI) fare more poorly than matched females in cognitive outcomes. However, there are few studies about neuroprotection taking gender into account in the results.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential additive neuroprotective effect of allopurinol when administrated in association with TH in a rodent model of moderate HI. Gender differences in neuroprotection were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>P10 male and female rat pups were subjected to HI (Vannucci model) and randomized into five groups: sham intervention (Control), no treatment (HI), hypothermia (HIH), allopurinol (HIA), and dual therapy (hypothermia and allopurinol) (HIHA). To evaluate a treatment&#x02019;s neuroprotective efficiency, 24 hours after the HI event caspase3 activation was measured. Damaged area and hippocampal volume were also measured 72 hours after the HI event. Negative geotaxis test was performed to evaluate early neurobehavioral reflexes. Learning and spatial memory were assessed via Morris Water Maze (MWM) test at 25 days of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Damaged area and hippocampal volume were different among treatment groups (p = 0.001). The largest tissue lesion was observed in the HI group, followed by HIA. There were no differences between control, HIH, and HIHA. When learning process was analyzed, no differences were found.

It is associated with high mortality and long-term neurological sequelae [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its global incidence is around 1&#x02013;3 per 1000 term births in developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with a mortality rate between 10&#x02013;15% in those infants with moderate to severe disease. Among the survivors, at least 36% will present severe neurodevelopmental disabilities and a larger proportion (30%) will present significant problems including global developmental delay, cognitive problems, deafness, and epilepsy [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been the only proven treatment for term newborns after perinatal HIE injury [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying hypothermia neuroprotection are multifactorial. Suppression of excitotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], decreasing oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] modulation of intracellular signaling and programmed cell death [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] seem to be some of the most important. Although several randomized controlled trials have shown that TH reduces mortality and improves neurodevelopmental outcome among survivors [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], this therapy does not provide complete neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches to reduce brain injury are necessary. After an HI event, there is a considerable increase in free radical production, lending support to the idea that oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathology of secondary brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Taking all the foregoing into account, it seems reasonable to try to reduce this secondary damage using antioxidant therapies [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in combination with hypothermia [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Some of the most important sources of oxygen free radicals are xanthine oxidase products.</p><p>Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, one of the main prooxidant pathways after HI that inhibits the conversion of hypoxanthine into xanthine and uric acid, thereby limiting the toxic overproduction of ROS. It prevents adenosine degradation and oxygen radical formation, and preserves NMDA receptor integrity, so as a consequence it may reduce brain injury in HIE through several mechanisms of action which are independent of the proven beneficial effect of hypothermic treatment in cellular energy metabolism. In high concentrations, it is also a direct scavenger of the toxic hydroxyl free radical and a chelator of non-protein-bound iron [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The first reports of the neuroprotective effects of allopurinol in animal models were published in the early 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Initial histology and molecular data showed promising results [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and when allopurinol was tested in humans some beneficial effects were demonstrated on free radical formation, cerebral perfusion, and electrical brain activity, without toxic side effects [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite this, Benders and colleagues, who only included severely asphyxiated infants, concluded that no beneficial effects were detected in the short-term clinical evaluation regardless of its higher safety profile [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, when the long-term neurological outcome of these patients was evaluated, those with moderate HIE treated with allopurinol presented better cognition results, suggesting that neonatal allopurinol treatment may improve long-term results in moderate HIE newborns [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Along the same line, a randomized controlled trial focusing on prenatal administration of the drug (NCT001189007) demonstrated that maternal treatment with allopurinol during fetal hypoxia did not significantly lower neuronal damage markers in cord blood. Nonetheless, the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis revealed a potential beneficial effect in girls [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence of sex differences in HI outcomes, with males exhibiting more severe neurological deficits relative to matched females [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, it has been demonstrated that mechanisms of cell death and brain lesion have different sex injury pathways [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184643.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Taking all this into account, it is reasonable to make examine sex-specific treatment effects.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of combining hypothermia and allopurinol in an animal model of HI brain injury.

Despite the implementation of TH as a standard of care in many clinical units for HIE [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it does not provide complete neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], making further investigation into additional therapies to improve neurological outcomes necessary. Xenon [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Epo [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and cannabidiol [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are some of the drugs that have been tested in experimental models to potentiate the effects of TH. Historically, one of the first strategies evaluated for HIE treatment was allopurinol, an antioxidant molecule reported to act as a mild neuroprotective agent [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is involved in HI injury physiopathology [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The neonatal brain handles oxidative stress poorly, with antioxidant activity less than half of adult levels [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One of the most important pro-oxidant pathways of free radical production is xanthine oxidase (XO) [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. XO enzyme plays a key role in the high-energy phosphate system [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In physiological conditions, it coexists with xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Many investigators agree that XDH activity is converted by sulfhydryl oxidation or limited proteolysis to an oxidase that produces superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. It is worth noting, nevertheless, that both XO and XDH can oxidize NADH, with concomitant formation of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Physiologically, XO and XDH participate in a variety of biochemical reactions including the hydroxylation of various purines, pterins, and aromatic heterocycles, thereby contributing to the detoxification or activation of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. One of XOR&#x02019;s primary roles is the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, acts by interrupting the conversion of hypoxanthine into xanthine and uric acid, limiting the production of toxic reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, allopurinol is a chelator of non-bound protein iron (NBPI) and a direct scavenger of hydroxyl free radicals [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. All these properties suggest it should be useful as a neuroprotective agent. Palmer and collegues demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in P7 rats after HI [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When it was tested in humans, short-term outcome improvement could not be confirmed [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Apparently, no advantage from neonatal treatment was seen when the interval of treatment initiation was very long. Despite this, some years later, when long-term outcome was evaluated (at 4&#x02013;8 years) in those babies [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], moderately asphyxiated infants treated with allopurinol presented a reduction in the risk of death or severe disability [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>As has been pointed out in many studies, the major drawback to postasphyxial hypothermia or pharmacological treatment is the small therapeutic window in which treatment must be initiated. This is even truer if the aim is to avoid or reduce free radical stress. The optimal point in time to start antioxidative treatment is at birth or even before birth. Trying to simulate this condition, many authors have suggested that antenatal administration, during labor, could amplify its effects. Torrance and colleagues reported a decrease in p-100B in plasma leves in those fetuses that had received antenatal allopurinol when an HI situation was suspected [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Some years later, a randomised controlled trial suggested that allopurinol had a potential neuroprotective effect in girls as indicated by lower S100&#x003b2; and neuroketal values in the treatment group [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Our study reveals that the combination of hypothermia + allopurinol after moderate focal HI in P10 rats decreases infarct and improves residual brain volumes at 72 h, although in males it does not provide more neuroprotection than hypothermia alone. Infarct volume at 72 h was reduced from 33.60% in the untreated group to 13.41% in HIA, 5.1% in HIH, and 3.8% in HIHA. These results are in accordance with the first reports on hypothermia in which the infarct area was reduced to about 50% when compared with the vehicle [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In those initial papers, no sex differences were reported.</p><p>In the same line, in our study, the hippocampal volume was better preserved in HIA, HIH, and HIHA females than in HI. Interestingly, allopurinol administration seemed to increase the neuroprotective effect in females, not only in those that received combined therapy (HIHA), but also in those females that received it without TH (HIA) when compared to HI. It is important to point out that in our study allopurnol administration was very early, less than 15 minutes after the HI injury, in order to avoid radical production, thereby simulating the situation that seems to happen when it is administered during labor ([<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These results are also in accordance with what Nie and colleages reported with another antioxidant therapy, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suggesting that antioxidants may provide less neuroprotection in males [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Sex differences have been reported in neonatal models of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Additionally, in humans, male infants are more vulnerable to perinatal insult, suffering worse long-term cognitive deficits compared to females with equivalent injury [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that mechanisms of cell death vary depending on sex [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>After an HI event, morphological features of three different cell death types can be observed: necrotic, apoptotic, and autophagic cell death [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The best known cell death forms are necrosis and apoptosis, even though the importance of auhophagy-mediated cell death has recently become a field of interest [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Apoptosis has been well described as a programmed delayed cell death mechanism with different intracellular signaling pathways. Complete understanding of this process represents a potential target for neuroprotective interventions.</p><p>Although there are multiple pathways to programmed cell death, caspase-3 is the final &#x02018;executioner,&#x02019; and thus caspase-3 activation may be used as a reasonable marker of apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that hypothermia reduces caspase-3 expression in newborn rats [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In our animals, caspase-3 was increased in HI animals 24h post-injury when compared to the other groups, as has previously been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Supporting histological results, there was also a decrease in caspase-3 activity in females that received allopurinol (HIHA, HIA). Oxidant reagents can lead to the activation of caspases, triggering apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our results suggest that allopurinol administration alone or in combination with hypothermia may reduce free radical liberation, decreasing caspase activation and consequently reducing brain injury. This process, as explained above, seems to be more pronounced in females. This is in accordance with a recently published hypothesis suggesting that programmed cell death in females depends mainly on caspase activation [<xref rid="pone.0184643.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as well as on their greater sensitivity to redox status.</p><p>Regarding functional performance, we found the same tendency in histological, molecular, and learning and memory tests. Treated animals (HIA, HIH, HIHA) had better results in WMT. When this was analysed taking gender into account, female allopurinol-treated (alone or in combination with hypothermia) animals achieved better results than males, again. The functional recovery was almost complete.</p><p>Despite these data, we found no consistent results to support the idea that hypothermia + allopurinol was better than hypothermia alone. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the effect of both treatments independently was very significant, and therefore it is quite difficult to gain even more neuroprotection, especially with so few animals.</p><p>Dual therapy has a good neuroprotection spectrum.

Our results also support this notion and, together with other published data, invite the reasonable conclusion that gender plays an important role in the effectiveness of each therapy. Those therapies that act by inhibiting the caspase-dependent pathway would have better results in females, and even more so if they were antioxidant therapies.
