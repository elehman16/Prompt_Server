Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) reduces the weaning period and increases the likelihood of successful weaning in some patients. However, it is not known how this training affects the residual inspiratory muscle fatigability following successful weaning nor patients' quality of life or functional outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This dual centre study includes two concurrent randomised controlled trials of IMT in adult patients who are either currently ventilator-dependent (&#x0003e;7&#x02005;days) (n=70) or have been recently weaned from mechanical ventilation (&#x0003e;7&#x02005;days) in the past week (n=70). Subjects will be stable, alert and able to actively participate and provide consent. There will be concealed allocation to either treatment (IMT) or usual physiotherapy (including deep breathing exercises without a resistance device). Primary outcomes are inspiratory muscle fatigue resistance and maximum inspiratory pressures. Secondary outcomes are quality of life (Short Form-36v2, EQ-5D), functional status (Acute Care Index of Function), rate of perceived exertion (Borg Scale), intensive care length of stay (days), post intensive care length of stay (days), rate of reintubation (%) and duration of ventilation (days).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been obtained from relevant institutions, and results will be published with a view to influencing physiotherapy practice in the management of long-term ventilator-dependent patients to accelerate weaning and optimise rehabilitation outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12610001089022.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Article summary</title><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mechanical ventilation (MV) is known to cause inspiratory muscle weakness, which may contribute to both difficulty weaning and poor recovery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Can IMT hasten weaning and enhance recovery from MV if commenced while still ventilated?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Can IMT enhance recovery if commenced following weaning from MV?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This protocol outlines two concurrent randomised controlled trials that investigate the effects of IMT as a component of early rehabilitation in an Australian intensive care unit.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is designed to capture both physiological measures as well as patient-centred measures of function and quality of life.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study is the first of its kind to focus on patient-centred measures and longer term outcomes beyond the period of ventilatory weaning.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results of this study will not be generalisable to some intensive care units, which generally keep patients sedated, as patient alertness is a requirement of IMT.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mechanical ventilation (MV) used in intensive care units (ICUs), while often essential in the management of respiratory failure, can result in respiratory dysfunction and inspiratory muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Even patients who can successfully wean from MV may suffer impaired fatigue resistance of the inspiratory muscles following successful weaning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Inspiratory muscle weakness has been associated with difficulty weaning from MV,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and the degree of weakness is correlated with the duration of ventilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> One case&#x02013;control study demonstrated that MV results in increased proteolysis and atrophy in the diaphragm muscle, while other skeletal muscles are spared.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Clearly, inspiratory muscle weakness is likely to be at least one of the factors that could contribute to difficult and prolonged weaning from MV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></p><p>Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with a threshold device has been used in patients with chronic lung disease for many years, resulting in not just increased inspiratory muscle strength but also increased inspiratory muscle endurance, reduced dyspnoea and increased exercise tolerance and quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> Since 2002, case reports of IMT in ventilator-dependent patients have suggested that IMT is associated with favourable weaning outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7 b8 b9">7&#x02013;9</xref> More recently, two randomised trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> using different training strategies have demonstrated benefits of IMT for ventilated patients, including statistically significant increases in inspiratory muscle strength,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> reduced weaning time by a mean of 1.7&#x02005;days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and a higher rate of successful weaning at day 28 (71% compared to 47%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> However, the generalisability of these results is limited by the subgroups studied (aged older than 70&#x02005;years,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> failed to wean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) as well as the sedation and rehabilitation approaches used in the investigating centres units. It is not yet known whether similar results would apply to a more heterogeneous group of ICU patients in an Australian ICU context. For example, an approach of minimal sedation and early active rehabilitation may result in different training effects and relative benefits of IMT. It is also not known which training parameters are optimal.</p><p>In an analysis of 195 IMT treatments in ventilated patients, IMT was found to be safe with zero adverse outcomes and stable physiological parameters in response to training (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> However, the mechanisms of improvement with IMT in ventilated patients have not been investigated. It is theoretically feasible that a high-intensity training protocol could provide an adequate training stimulus to halt or reverse diaphragmatic atrophy and proteolysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> As has been shown in athletes, IMT could also attenuate a sympathetically mediated metaboreflex, resulting in enhanced limb muscle perfusion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> This improved limb perfusion could facilitate early mobilisation, resulting in enhanced functional capacity or quality of life.</p><p>The following protocol outlines the process by which we intend to answer some of these questions with regard to IMT in a heterogeneous group of patients who have been ventilator-dependent for 7&#x02005;days or longer in our Australian ICU setting.

Noseclips are not required. The patient is coached to ensure adequate lip seal around the mouth piece and achieve maximum voluntary effort, and the effort is repeated until at least three measurements have &#x0003c;20% variability between them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p><p>The device used to perform MIP testing is a portable MicroRPM Respiratory Pressure meter (CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA) (Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration approval 166760).

This level of resistance that has been selected as the preliminary trials by Chang and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> indicated that resistance equivalent to 50% of MIP resulted in severe dyspnoea. If the subject is not able to inspire at 30% of their MIP, no resistance is applied. MIP measurements are repeated at 2&#x02005;min. During the loading task, the testing will be ceased if the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is &#x02265;7, pulse oximetric saturation falls &#x0003e;10% from initial values or to &#x0003c;90% or the heart rate increases by &#x0003e;30 beats per minute.

The outcomes of this trial will be analysed in relation to the findings of Chang and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> that prolonged MV results in increased fatigability of inspiratory muscles following successful weaning from MV. Given that postweaning outcomes are often poor for patients undergoing prolonged MV,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> evaluation of IMT as a method to ameliorate residual weakness, and thus accelerate rehabilitation, appears warranted. This trial was registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 13 December 2010 (ACTRN12610001089022).</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>RCT2 aims to answer the following questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does postweaning IMT affect residual inspiratory muscle strength or fatigability in patients ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does postweaning IMT affect dyspnoea levels, quality of life or functional recovery in patients ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does postweaning IMT result in lower rates of reintubation, readmission to ICU or duration of post-ICU hospital stay, in patients who have been ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The hypotheses are that postweaning IMT will improve inspiratory muscle strength, reduce inspiratory muscle fatigability and dyspnoea and improve quality of life and functional measures in this population. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that IMT will result in a lower rate of reintubation and shorter post-ICU length of hospital stay in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>RCT2 is a RCT with concealed allocation, blinded outcome assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. Refer to the second arm of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref> regarding anticipated flow of patients through RCT2.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects will be recruited from both Canberra Hospital and Calvary Hospital ICUs (both in Canberra, Australia). Patients who have recently weaned from MV in ICU (within previous 7&#x02005;days, where the duration of ventilation was 7 or more days) will be recruited to RCT2, with automatic exclusion of patients included in RCT1. Suitable patients will be randomised (computer-generated randomisation sequence) to receive either IMT (in addition to usual physiotherapy care) or usual physiotherapy care only for 2&#x02005;weeks postweaning. Usual physiotherapy care typically includes deep breathing exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (without a resistance device), assisted mobilisation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> secretion clearance techniques and upper and lower limb exercises as indicated. Treatment will occur in both ICU and ward environments.</p><p>A total of 70 subjects will be required for RCT2. On the basis of data extrapolated from previous case series, this provides a power estimate for expected differences in FRI between the groups of 0.8, if &#x003b1;=0.05. Again, sample sizes have been inflated 15% to account for the known mortality of this population (12.8%) (Canberra Hospital ICU Audit data 2009).</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All patients recently mechanically ventilated who:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>were ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer and weaned from MV in the previous 7&#x02005;days;</p></list-item><list-item><p>are aged &#x02265;16&#x02005;years;</p></list-item><list-item><p>are alert and able to co-operate with training (Riker score of 4);</p></list-item><list-item><p>are able to provide informed consent.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients will be excluded from RCT2 if they are:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>aged&#x0003c;16&#x02005;years;</p></list-item><list-item><p>unwilling or unable to provide informed consent;</p></list-item><list-item><p>previously included in RCT1;</p></list-item><list-item><p>pregnant;</p></list-item><list-item><p>mechanically ventilated &#x0003c;7&#x02005;days;</p></list-item><list-item><p>not alert or able to co-operate with training (Riker score of &#x0003c;4 or &#x0003e;4);</p></list-item><list-item><p>experiencing significant pain that interferes with breathing capacity (eg, fractured ribs): IMT could be reconsidered when pain is controlled and patient is able to participate;</p></list-item><list-item><p>medically unstable or deemed suitable for palliation.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the outcome measures used in RCT2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions, samples and assays</title><p>Refer to RCT1 for details of the Threshold IMT device and training parameters. The only difference for RCT2 is that there will be no return to MV between sets, rather the patient is rested (either on room air or oxygen) as appropriate. As per the previous description, the training session will be directly supervised by the physiotherapist and should take &#x0003c;10&#x02005;min/day. Training will occur on weekdays from enrolment until 2&#x02005;weeks later. All other outcome measures will be conducted as previously described in the time frames outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Termination criteria</title><p>An individual would be withdrawn from the study in the case of death, withdrawal of consent or ability to participate actively. Should a patient in the view of the treating physician not tolerate the intervention, for whatever reason, the patient may be withdrawn from the study; however, follow-up data including FRI would still be collected and all data collected will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse outcomes are not anticipated, due to the demonstrated safety of the technique in our own pilot data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and the lack of documented adverse sequelae in other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></p><p>According to a recent multisite study on the safety of physiotherapy intervention in ICU,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> the following criteria would cause the treating therapist to cease the intervention immediately and alert on-site medical attention (ie, senior ICU registrar): alteration in blood pressure &#x0003e; or &#x0003c;20% resting, alteration in heart rate &#x0003c; or &#x0003e;20% resting, new arrhythmia, oxygen desaturation &#x0003e;10%, pulmonary artery pressure (systolic) &#x0003e;60&#x02005;mm&#x02002;Hg, suspected pneumothorax and agitation risking detachment of equipment or lines or requiring increase sedation. Should such an episode occur, the participant's suitability for remaining in the trial would be reviewed by the chief investigator, in consultation with senior ICU medical staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimising bias</title><p>Outcome measures will be taken by blinded assessors; however, therapists providing the intervention cannot be blinded.</p><p>Patients will be informed that the study is investigating different types of &#x02018;breathing exercises&#x02019;, without reference to a device, thus allowing blinding of the patients. Although a sham comparison would be ideal, most sham interventions with the threshold device have used low training pressures (eg, 9&#x02013;11&#x02005;cmH<sub>2</sub>O). The concern is that for the weakest patients, this level of training can be challenging. In our pilot case series,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> several subjects trained for several sessions with pressures below 15&#x02005;cmH<sub>2</sub>O pressure, generating RPE scores of &#x0003e;7. Our observations are also substantiated by the work of De Jonghe <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> who were able to quantify the median MIP for ventilated patients who have returned to consciousness as only 30&#x02005;cmH<sub>2</sub>O. That is, a mere 9&#x02005;cmH<sub>2</sub>O training pressure would equate to 30% of MIP, and 30% intensity has shown training benefits in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34 b35 b36">34&#x02013;36</xref> Thus, it would be difficult to use a true sham without risking inadvertent &#x02018;training&#x02019; of the weakest patients. As an alternative to a true &#x02018;sham&#x02019; comparison, the control subjects will receive daily coached breathing exercises (deep breathing or demand ventilation exercises without a threshold device) to minimise the potential Hawthorne effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Proposed methods of data analysis</title><p>Data will be analysed using both an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis with a carry forward analysis for missing data. Mean changes scores, SDs and 95% CIs will be calculated between groups for preintervention and postintervention. It is anticipated that the analysis will use a combination of t tests, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests and repeated measures analysis of variance (or non-parametric equivalents) as appropriate. If missing data is a problem, a mixed model may be used. There will be a baseline comparison of age, gender, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, highest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and length of stay. There will be a priori stratification of those subjects with known neuromuscular disease (eg, Guillain&#x02013;Barre, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis).</p><sec><title>Predictive modelling</title><p>A substudy of RCT1 will analyse the correlation between IMT pressures (cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and duration of weaning (hours off ventilator in a 24&#x02005;h period). If possible a mathematical model linking these two variables will be described.</p></sec><sec><title>Contingencies</title><p>Should subject recruitment prove slow to reach the required sample size for this study, the study duration may be increased by 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;months as required, pending ongoing ethics approval.</p></sec><sec><title>Data management</title><p>A custom-designed database will store deidentified patient data in a secure password-protected file accessible only to designated research office staff.

Any intervention that can hasten weaning from MV, or recovery following ICU stay, is highly likely to reduce overall length of stay and may reduce associated morbidity and mortality. In addition to the individual patient benefits that this will produce, there is a potential for a substantial community economic benefit due to reduced hospital costs.</p><p>If efficacy of IMT can be demonstrated, this could lead to a change in intensive care practice internationally across disciplines, including physiotherapy, respiratory therapy, nursing and intensive care medicine. Ultimately, the people most likely to benefit from this study are the patients, with improved understanding of methods to optimise treatment and minimise the complications of prolonged MV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d33e166" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-000813.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e167" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-000813.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Bissett BM, Leditschke IA, Paratz JD, <italic>et al</italic>.
