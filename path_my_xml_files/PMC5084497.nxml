However, postoperative inflammation continues to be a cause of patient discomfort, delayed recovery, and in some cases, suboptimal visual results. Left untreated, this inflammation might interfere with patients' rehabilitation and/or contribute to the development of another complication such as cystoid macular edema (CME). Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid are commonly used in the management and prevention of noninfectious ocular inflammation following cataract surgery. Clinical evidence suggests that the combined use of NSAIDs and steroids is synergistic.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>While the anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are in part from inhibition of phospholipase A2 preventing the release of arachidonic acid from membrane-bound phospholipids, NSAIDs act more downstream in the cascade and directly inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The purpose of this study is to review the use of steroids and NSAIDs in the treatment of postsurgical inflammation following cataract surgery.</p><p>This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of prednisolone acetate 1%, nepafenac 0.1%, bromfenac 0.09%, and ketorolac 0.5% for the prevention and treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized study has been conducted on 200 patients attending the ophthalmology OPD of a tertiary care hospital with a clinical diagnosis of ocular cataract requiring surgical removal with 50 cases in each group. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee, and the authors did not have any financial interest in the products used in the study. All patients who had undergone phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation have been randomized to receive NSAIDs drops or steroid drops.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria were carriers of senile cataract (&#x0003e;40 years of age) with an indication for cataract extraction with implantation of the intraocular lens and uncomplicated cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Exclusion criteria were topical/inhaled/systemic steroid 14 days before surgery, topical/inhaled/systemic NSAIDs within 7 days of surgery, eyes with cells and flare and ocular pain in preoperative baseline examination, corneal opacity, suspected hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease, diabetic patient, severe dry eye patient, cases in which there is intraoperative complications, glaucoma patient, patient having macular pathology.</p><p>A detailed history of patients was taken and was asked for a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or coronary artery disease, or any other systemic illness.

Patients were considered cured if the sum of their aqueous cells and flare ratings was 0 (i.e., 0&#x02013;5 cells and clear media) at the current and all subsequent study visits. Clinical success was defined as an aqueous cells rating of 0 (&#x0003c;5) or 1 (5&#x02013;10 cells) and an aqueous flare rating of 0 (none) at the current and all subsequent study visits. All the cases were implanted with a single-make lens to maintain uniformity.
