Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies may bridge important rodent findings to the clinical realm since NHP-depression shares significant homology with human depression and kinetics of primate neurogenesis differ from those in rodents. After demonstrating that antidepressants can stimulate neurogenesis in NHPs, our present study examines whether neurogenesis is required for antidepressant efficacy in NHPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials/Methodology</title><p>Adult female bonnets were randomized to three social pens (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6 each). Pen-1 subjects were exposed to control-conditions for 15 weeks with half receiving the antidepressant fluoxetine and the rest receiving saline-placebo. Pen-2 subjects were exposed to 15 weeks of separation-stress with half receiving fluoxetine and half receiving placebo. Pen-3 subjects 2 weeks of irradiation (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4) or sham-irradiation (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2) and then exposed to 15 weeks of stress and fluoxetine. Dependent measures were weekly behavioral observations and postmortem neurogenesis levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposing NHPs to repeated separation stress resulted in depression-like behaviors (anhedonia and subordinance) accompanied by reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. Treatment with fluoxetine stimulated neurogenesis and prevented the emergence of depression-like behaviors. Ablation of neurogenesis with irradiation abolished the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. Non-stressed controls had normative behaviors although the fluoxetine-treated controls had higher neurogenesis rates. Across all groups, depression-like behaviors were associated with decreased rates of neurogenesis but this inverse correlation was only significant for new neurons in the anterior dentate gyrus that were at the threshold of completing maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide evidence that induction of neurogenesis is integral to the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine in NHPs. Given the similarity between monkeys and humans, hippocampal neurogenesis likely plays a similar role in the treatment of clinical depression. Future studies will examine several outstanding questions such as whether neuro-suppression is sufficient for producing depression and whether therapeutic neuroplastic effects of fluoxetine are specific to antidepressants.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depression is consistently associated with decreased hippocampal volumes and deficits in hippocampus-dependent cognition <xref rid="pone.0017600-Sheline1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Bremner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Some of these deficits may reflect structural changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In preclinical studies, factors that predispose to depression, such as social stress <xref rid="pone.0017600-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Czeh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, maternal neglect <xref rid="pone.0017600-Mirescu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and drug abuse <xref rid="pone.0017600-Eisch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> decrease rates of new neuron formation (neurogenesis) in the dentate gyrus and cause cell atrophy and death in the CA1/CA3 region of the adult rodent hippocampus. Interventions that ameliorate major depression, including antidepressant medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) <xref rid="pone.0017600-Malberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, exercise, and environmental enrichment <xref rid="pone.0017600-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> stimulate dentate gyrus neurogenesis. These findings led to the hypotheses that suppression of neurogenesis leads to depression, and that stimulation of neurogenesis is required for treating depression <xref rid="pone.0017600-Duman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Perera1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite generating widespread interest, this hypothesis is based mainly on indirect evidence derived mostly from rodents. A major limitation of rodent studies is that the phenomenological complexities of major depression are not evident in lower mammals. In addition, the speed and extent of neuronal maturation and the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the primate hippocampus is almost 10-fold less than in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Kornack1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since there are no established methods of non-invasively detecting neurogenesis in humans, terminal studies of nonhuman primates are the best available options to examine the clinical relevance of these findings. Macaque monkeys are available for research in larger numbers than apes, and they display a richer repertoire of affective behaviors than New World monkeys. Bonnet macaques, in particular, form strong peer attachments that can be disrupted to produce plausible, core symptoms of depression <xref rid="pone.0017600-Coplan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Rosenblum1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In the two previous studies related to neurogenesis in primates, hippocampal neurogenesis was suppressed in both adult marmoset monkeys exposed to acute intruder stress <xref rid="pone.0017600-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and in juvenile rhesus macaques exposed to acute prenatal stress <xref rid="pone.0017600-Coe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We reported that treatment with electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the pre-clinical equivalent of antidepressant electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), stimulated hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis in adult bonnet macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Perera2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the current study, we examined whether the therapeutic behavioral effects of antidepressant treatment required the induction of neurogenesis in adult bonnet macaques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work has been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. In accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, &#x0201c;The use of non-human primates in research.&#x0201d; the following statement to this effect has been included to document the details of animal welfare and steps taken to ameliorate suffering in all work involving non-human primates: This work was conducted at the Nonhuman Primate Facility of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center with permission from its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) The protocol number is 01-217-04, approved on 12/16/04. The welfare of the animals conformed to the requirements of <italic>National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH)</italic>. All animals were housed in pens exceeding the stipulated sizes requirements. Animals were maintained in large group houses under 12-hour dark and light cycles, and were given access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were engaged with a variety of psychologically enriching tasks. No animal was physically harmed or knowingly exposed to potential infection.</p><p>Subjects and interventions: Adult female bonnet macaques were matched based on age, weight, social rank, and timing of menstruation, and randomized to a Control pen (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) or a Stress pen (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6). Using the chronic stress paradigm developed in rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Higley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we exposed subjects in the Stress pen to social isolation for two days followed by social reunion on the remaining 5 days, repeated for a total duration of 15-weeks. The monkeys in the Control pen remained in social housing for those 15-weeks. During this period, half the subjects in each pen (Control-Drug and Stress-Drug groups) were treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine. In order to minimize the stress of administration, we used Prozac-weekly preparation (Eli Lilly Corp.), at a dose of 13.5 mg/kg infused via nasogastric tube (NGT) under sedation (ketamine 5 mg/kg and xylazine 1 mg/kg), once per week for 15-weeks. This dose was equivalent to a daily dose of 2 mg/kg of the drug. The remaining half (Control-Placebo and Stress-Placebo) received the same treatment with saline placebo via NGT. All groups were injected with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (100 mg/kg/day, I.V.) under ketamine/xylazine sedation for 5 days during week-7 of interventions (Stress/Control&#x0002b;Drug/Placebo) and then sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion with normal saline (500 ml/kg) followed by 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde (500 mg/kg) under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital (15 mg/kg, I.V.) on week-16 of interventions.</p><p>In a follow-up study, a social group of female bonnet macaques (Radiation-Stress-Drug group) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, and given bilateral temporal lobe irradiation at a dose of 20Gy (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2) or 30Gy (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2) fractionated into 10 treatments over 2-weeks. This regimen was based on rodent studies, where irradiation effectively suppressed neurogenesis without causing significant necrosis or behavioral side effects <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Holick1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A control group received &#x02018;sham&#x02019; irradiation (anesthesia only) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2). A Philips RT250 X-ray machine provided an X-irradiation beam (250 kVp, 15 mA, 0.4 cm Thoreau's filter, HVL&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3 mm<sup>3</sup>, 50 cm FSD (Focal Spot to Skin Distance). A customized shield made of cerabend (a lead alloy) was placed to cover the head with a large exterior 3.7 cm&#x000d7;1.8 cm rectangular hole (with rounded edges) that was collimated into a small internal field 2 cm in diameter. The X-ray beam was intended to target the entire hippocampus while sparing adjacent temporal lobe structures and the optic chiasm. Before starting irradiation, a plain film X-ray image was taken to confirm the positioning of the beam. After 2-weeks of irradiation or sham treatment, the subjects rested for 3-weeks to allow the acute effects of irradiation to dissipate as per previous rodent research <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Next, these monkeys were exposed to 15-weeks of repeated separation stress and concurrent antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine, injected with BrdU on week-7 and sacrificed on week-16, using the same methods described above.</p><p>
<underline>Note:</underline> Since high- and low-dose irradiation had equivalent effects, the four irradiated animals were collapsed into one Radiated-Stress-Drug group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4). Similarly, the sham-irradiated animals were collapsed into the Stress-Drug group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) because they were exposed to similar experimental conditions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017600-t001">Table 1</xref> presents a schematic diagram of the study design.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0017600-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0017600.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Study Design: Schematic illustrating study design and schedule.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0017600-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0017600.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1">Study Design</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 wks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 wks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 wks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sacrifice</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Histology</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Baseline</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control &#x00026; Placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control &#x00026; Drug (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Baseline</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stress &#x00026; Placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stress &#x00026; Drug (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">XRT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rest</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stress &#x00026; Drug (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Behavioral Ratings</title><p>Home-cage behaviors were quantified through one-way mirrors by trained raters (inter-rater correlation coefficient, ICC&#x0003e;0.96) for 3-days a week.

Ablating neurogenesis with temporal lobe irradiation abolished the salutary effects of the antidepressant and led to depression-like behavior in response to chronic stress. Together, these results provide the first evidence that hippocampal neurogenesis may play a role in the treatment of depression in NHPs similar to previous findings in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>By using a nonhuman primate paradigm, we had the opportunity to more effectively replicate depression-related behaviors. The bonnet macaques exposed to repeated social separation stress displayed increases in anhedonia that involved a cluster of symptoms typically seen in depressive monkeys <xref rid="pone.0017600-Shively1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, including macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Suomi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Critically, this behavioral profile possesses significant face validity as an analog of clinical anhedonia, a core symptom of major depression <xref rid="pone.0017600-Clewell1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The increases in the anhedonia scores were accompanied by decreases in hierarchy scores. Social subordinance is a hallmark of both chronic anxiety and depression in monkeys <xref rid="pone.0017600-Shively1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Raleigh1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This behavior of the NHPs in the setting of repeated social separation stress parallels clinical depression, as interpersonal loss is the predominant trigger of depression in humans <xref rid="pone.0017600-Clewell1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and chronic stress is a major epidemiological risk factor for major depression and chronic anxiety disorders <xref rid="pone.0017600-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>The animals treated with fluoxetine did not demonstrate anhedonia-related behaviors. This is consistent with its therapeutic effect and with previous findings that sertraline, another SSRI, ameliorated anxiety-related behaviors and alcohol abuse in rhesus macaques that were exposed to repeated separation stress <xref rid="pone.0017600-Higley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The therapeutic effects of fluoxetine in the stressed animals could not be explained by medication side effects because behavioral ratings in drug- and placebo-treated non-stressed controls did not differ. These behavioral changes did not result from emotional indifference, a potential side effect of fluoxetine treatment <xref rid="pone.0017600-Hoehnsaric1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, because the drug-treated animals showed the same level of distress, in the form of affiliation, as placebo-treated subjects at the time of social reunion. Affiliation, an indicator of acute anxiety in bonnet macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Rosenblum1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, increased not only during reunions but also during acute intruder stress. In summary, fluoxetine treatment specifically prevented stress-induced depressive behavior (anhedonia) and chronic anxiety behavior (subordinance), but had no impact on acute anxiety (affiliation). These behavioral effects of the medication are consistent with its therapeutic profile in humans <xref rid="pone.0017600-Trivedi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Fluoxetine treatment had a profound effect on neurogenesis: non-irradiated fluoxetine-treated animals showed high rates of newly formed neurons at all stages of maturation in both the anterior and posterior dentate gyrus compared to their placebo-treated and irradiated counterparts. Fluoxetine treatment seems to have induced neurogenesis by increasing the speed of neuronal maturation, similar to its effects in mice <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, without increasing precursor cell survival (BrdU-labeled cells) or proliferation (Ki67-expressing cells). This is in contrast to the significant increase in proliferation and 600&#x00025; increase in neurogenesis seen after ECT <xref rid="pone.0017600-Perera2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and parallels the more robust clinical efficacy of ECT in treating depression compared to pharmacological agents such as fluoxetine <xref rid="pone.0017600-Segman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Moreover, in the present study, chronic stress suppressed neurogenesis and cell proliferation in general, a pattern previously reported in adult rodents and tree shrews exposed to chronic stress <xref rid="pone.0017600-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Czeh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is in contrast with recent evidence in rodents that chronic stress reduces the level of neuronal differentiation without decreasing proliferation rates <xref rid="pone.0017600-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Despite dramatic increases in new neurons following fluoxetine treatment, only a subpopulation of these, the Stage 3 DCX-expressing cells located in the anterior dentate gyrus, correlated with behavioral changes (anhedonia and hierarchy). The anatomic location of these new neurons in the anterior dentate gyrus is intriguing in light of the evidence that the anterior (ventral or temporal in rodents) hippocampus specifically mediates limbic behavior <xref rid="pone.0017600-Banasr1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> via anatomic connections with the amygdala and prefrontal subregions <xref rid="pone.0017600-Pothuizen1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and supports the hypothesis that the antidepressant effect is linked with neurogenesis only in the anterior region of the dentate gyrus <xref rid="pone.0017600-Boldrini1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Likewise, neurogenesis rates in the posterior dentate gyrus failed to correlate with depressive behavior, consistent with the notion that the posterior hippocampus (dorsal or septal in rodents) mainly mediates spatial memory <xref rid="pone.0017600-Ambrogini1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>The specific association between depressive behavior and Stage 3 neurons was surprising, however. Although these cells had mature dendrites, they expressed immature neuronal markers (DCX and TUC-4), but not NeuN. They also failed to express c-Fos, suggesting that they did not participate in activation of synaptic circuitry, as well as the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. These findings suggest that the Stage 3 granule cells had not entered the hyperplastic stage of neuronal maturation described in the adult mouse hippocampus. During this stage, at 4&#x02013;6 weeks of age, differentiating granule cells enter a period of enhanced synaptic plasticity associated with NR2B expression and a lower threshold for LTP <xref rid="pone.0017600-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. External stimuli preferentially activate these hyperplastic new neurons over less excitable mature granule cells <xref rid="pone.0017600-Ge2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although presumed to be 6&#x02013;7 weeks old, the Stage 3 neurons in the bonnet macaque seemed be less mature than the hyperplastic cells described in the mouse <xref rid="pone.0017600-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and resembled younger, 3-week-old, mouse granule cells <xref rid="pone.0017600-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, reflecting the fact that duration of neuronal maturation in monkeys is 2&#x02013;3 fold longer than in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Kornack1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Nonetheless, the fact that granule cells that were presumably 6&#x02013;7 weeks old displayed an immature histological profile is surprising because in our previous study approximately 50&#x00025; of 4-week old granule cells expressed NeuN following ECS treatment <xref rid="pone.0017600-Perera2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and this rate of maturation is consistent with several other studies in nonhuman primates <xref rid="pone.0017600-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Tonchev1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Gould2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Koketsu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It is possible that primate neuronal maturation takes many months because TUC-4-BrdU co-labeling has been detected &#x0223c;100 days post-BrdU injection <xref rid="pone.0017600-Ngwenya1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. On the other hand, it has been shown that TUC-4 can occasionally persist in mature neurons in the monkey brain <xref rid="pone.0017600-Tonchev1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>The fact that behavioral changes correlated with the density of newly-formed Stage 3 neurons that had not yet entered the hyperplastic stage suggest that any role in mood regulation would have to involve indirect mechanisms. This role may involve reducing nonspecific activation in the dentate gyrus, since the rate of biochemical synaptic activation (c-Fos expression) of mature granule cells in the anterior dentate gyrus was reduced in bonnet macaques with high rates of neurogenesis and positively correlated with increases in depressive behavior (anhedonia ratings). This potential role is supported by a study where depressive behavior produced by bulbectomy in rats was associated with increased hippocampal c-Fos expression, while the reduction of depression with fluoxetine treatment decreased hippocampal c-Fos expression <xref rid="pone.0017600-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Neurogenesis may also play a role in reducing interference of older memories, thereby facilitating the acquisition of novel experiences, as it has been proposed to occur in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wiskott1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The reduction of synaptic excitability of mature granule cells by immature neurons provides a putative mechanism by which this reduction of interference may occur.</p><p>In the irradiation group, the animals showed increases in anhedonia and decreases in hierarchical behaviors despite antidepressant treatment, similar to the Stress-Placebo group. Although irradiation was administered at the beginning of the study, these animals did not display sustained increases in depressive behaviors until they were exposed to several weeks of stress. There was, however, a transient increase in anhedonia scores immediately following irradiation prior to the initiation of separation stress. These symptoms appear to have resulted from sedation or side effects of irradiation because the symptoms increased acutely (not gradually), were unaccompanied by hierarchical changes, and dissipated within 3-weeks, which is the typical duration of acute behavioral side effects of irradiation in mice <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The depressive behavior seen in the irradiated animals was associated with depressed levels of neurogenesis and altered maturational fate (the majority of the BrdU-labeled cells differentiated into microglia rather than neurons). The neurosuppressive effect of irradiation was subtler in the monkeys than in mice, where irradiation abolished all possibility of neurogenesis for months <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our subjects, cell proliferation resumed by weeks 13&#x02013;16. Cell proliferation rates in the irradiated monkeys were normal by the time of sacrifice, with a majority of newly formed cells expressing Iba-1 and displaying microglial morphology. The total number of microglia, however, remained unchanged. Cell proliferation probably resumed over the 19 weeks between irradiation and sacrifice, likely potentiated by fluoxetine treatment in the interim. Irradiation may have reduced neuronal differentiation of mitotic stem cells, as shown by Steele and Lange <xref rid="pone.0017600-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, possibly by delaying the commitment of precursor cells to neuronal fate, as recently reported by our collaborators (Dranovsky, Hen et al., Science, <italic>in press</italic>). The predominance of microglia in this population raises the question of whether these mitotic cells represented an inflammatory reaction to irradiation, as has been reported in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Monje1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Reduced neurogenesis accompanied by microglial proliferation has also been reported in mice <xref rid="pone.0017600-Rola1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Tonchev1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> exposed to brain injury. That these cells represent an inflammatory reaction is unlikely since both H &#x00026; E staining and Hoechst staining failed to show evidence of increased astrocytosis, apoptosis, or necrosis in the irradiated hippocampi, and the total number of microglia was unaffected. This suggests that even if inflammatory macrophagic extravasation took place, and gave way to proliferation and differentiation into new microglial cells as late as weeks 7&#x02013;8 (time of BrdU injection), then the stimulating inflammation response must have resolved by the time of sacrifice (week 15).</p><p>Because the method of ablation used in this study was relatively nonspecific, it was important to ascertain that the depressive behavior detected in the Radiated-Stress-Drug group did not result from delayed complications of irradiation such as inflammation and necrosis <xref rid="pone.0017600-Monje1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Raber1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. To this end, we verified that the salient behavioral differences in the bonnet macaques occurred immediately prior to the time of sacrifice (week 13&#x02013;15), at which point there was no evidence of inflammation or necrosis in the irradiated hippocampi despite extensive histopathological inspection. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of antidepressant efficacy in the irradiated monkeys most likely resulted from the reduction of neurogenesis.</p><p>In addition to reducing neurogenesis rates, chronic stress also reduced hippocampal granule cell layer (GCL) volume by 22&#x00025; in the Stress-Placebo group and by 25&#x00025; in the Radiation-Stress-Drug group, as compared with the Control-Placebo group. This is in agreement with previous research in rats <xref rid="pone.0017600-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Jayatissa1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and tree shrews <xref rid="pone.0017600-Czeh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Only one primate study has examined GCL volume after prenatal stress and found significant reductions in juvenile rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0017600-Coe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Fluoxetine, on the other hand, may have prevented stress-induced reduction in GCL volume, as GCL dimensions in the Stress-Drug group did not differ from those of Control-Placebo subjects. This finding is in agreement with the prevention of stress-related shrinkage in GCL volume in tree shrews treated with the antidepressant tianeptine <xref rid="pone.0017600-Czeh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Temporal lobe irradiation abolished any protective effect of fluoxetine and decreased GCL volume in the Radiation-Stress-Drug group. This was not surprising because irradiation has been shown to decrease brain volume in fetal rhesus monkeys <xref rid="pone.0017600-Schindler1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p><p>The interpretation of these data needs to be tempered by the small sample size. This is an unavoidable problem intrinsic to nonhuman primate research because of the limited availability of subjects. Nevertheless, conducting this experiment in monkeys revealed subtleties in the association between hippocampal neurogenesis and limbic behavior that not could not be detected in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, for instance, that the regulation of neurogenesis was associated with changes only in depressive (anhedonia) and chronic-anxiety (subordinance) symptoms and was unrelated to changes in acute anxiety phenomena (affiliation and vigilance). Using NHPs also allowed us to localize and stage the population of new neurons correlated to behavioral changes in the primate brain, which differs in both anatomy and cellular kinetics to that of the rodent.</p><p>An outstanding question that warrants investigation is whether suppression of neurogenesis was sufficient to produce depressive behavior in the absence of stress. Although neurogenesis was acutely suppressed in the irradiated group, appearance of depressive behavior was delayed by several weeks. This suggests that neuro-suppression <italic>per se</italic> was not sufficient for producing depression in the irradiated monkeys and that exposure to several weeks of chronic stress was also needed. This view is supported by studies in which chronic uncontrollable stress consistently suppresses neurogenesis in rats <xref rid="pone.0017600-Shors1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, but only a fraction of these animals developed learned helplessness <xref rid="pone.0017600-Vollmayr1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Although suppression of neurogenesis seemed insufficient to produce acute depression-like behavior in the irradiated animals, the later appearance of these behaviors despite fluoxetine treatment demonstrate that stimulating neurogenesis was necessary for mediating antidepressant efficacy. This has also been reported in mouse studies, in which ablating hippocampal neurogenesis did not produce behavioral abnormalities at baseline (in the absence of treatment), but abolished the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatment in the setting of stressful conditions <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017600-Santarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Another outstanding issue, highlighted previously by Wang et al. <xref rid="pone.0017600-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> that future studies must address is whether neurogenesis plays a similar role in the treatment of preexisting depressive symptoms (similar to its clinical application), as it does in the prevention of depression during chronic stress. While the mechanisms needed to prevent depression are likely similar to those critical for reversing depression, it will be necessary to confirm this with a specifically-tailored study design. Future studies should also examine whether the timing of antidepressant response correlates with induction of neurogenesis. From our data, we assume that Stage 3 neurons take 6&#x02013;7 weeks to develop in monkeys and maybe longer (perhaps 8&#x02013;9 weeks) in humans. This implies that antidepressants would need at least 2-months to up-regulate this population in depressed patients. This speed of induction is too long to explain initial <italic>response</italic> to antidepressants, but is more consistent with the 8&#x02013;10 weeks needed for complete <italic>remission</italic> of clinical depression <xref rid="pone.0017600-Trivedi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. There is some evidence that clinical remission is signaled by cognitive improvements that appear weeks after the initial response <xref rid="pone.0017600-Deuschle1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Interestingly, blocking hippocampal neurogenesis disrupts analogous cognitive function in rodents <xref rid="pone.0017600-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> several weeks after ablation <xref rid="pone.0017600-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Therefore, it is conceivable that hippocampal neurogenesis mediates delayed cognitive improvements associated with remission of depression but has no role in initial affective response to treatment (see review by Perera et al. <xref rid="pone.0017600-Perera3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>).</p><p>This study provides strong support for a link between the treatment of depression and the regulation of a specific population of new hippocampal neurons. The fact that this relationship was demonstrated in a plausible model of depression in anthropoid monkeys lends strong support for a similar role for neurogenesis in humans. Future studies are needed to confirm and expand these findings. If they do, new hippocampal neurons may serve as a marker of risk for depression and provide a tangible target for developing more effective and tolerable antidepressants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0017600.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>a.
