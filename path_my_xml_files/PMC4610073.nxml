The majority of studies treat laryngoscopy and intubation as a single stimulus, which manifestly they are not. The mechanism of hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation is proposed to be by somato-viseral reflexes. Stimulation of proprioceptors at the base of the tongue during laryngoscopy induces impulse dependent increases of systemic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamine concentrations. Subsequent orotracheal intubation recruits additional receptors that elicit augmented hemodynamic and epinephrine responses as well as some vagal inhibition of the heart.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The C-Trach laryngeal mask airway (LMA) assembly, a secure airway in its own right, facilitates view of the laryngeal opening and guiding of the endotracheal tube under vision into the trachea without moving the patient's head and neck, while maintaining the ventilation of the patient. It has an anatomically curved rigid airway tube, an integrated guiding handle, an epiglottis elevating bar and a fiberoptic bundle, which provides direct view of the larynx on a cable free light weight portable viewer [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Photograph 1</xref>]. Trials made to assess, analyze and compare the sympathetic and hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation using DL and intubating LMA (ILMA) reported a significantly diminished response, while intubating through ILMA compared to endotracheal intubation using DL. We decided to study the autonomic response to endotracheal intubation facilitated under vision through C-Trach assembly and compare it to the hemodynamic response to intubation with DL.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Photograph 1</label><caption><p>Intubation using C-Trach assembly</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-343-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in the Department of Anesthesia at JLN Hospital and Research Center, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India. Approval was obtained from the institutional scientific and ethical committee. After written informed consent, 100 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I, of either sex, in the age group 14-65 years, posted for planned surgery were enrolled in the trial. The sample size calculation was based on a previous study,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which indicated that at least 35 patients in each group will be required to compare means of difference between groups by confidence interval &#x02212;95% and study power 80%. Patients with anticipated difficult airway were not included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups using the sealed opaque envelope technique:</p><p>

Anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol 2.5 mg/kg. This was followed by muscle paralysis with 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium bromide. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was instituted with oxygen in nitrous oxide (1:1) during the period of apnea.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 3 min after administration of propofol and values were labeled as P3. IPPV was continued for 3 min after injection of vecuronium bromide when DL and orotracheal intubation was performed with 7.5 mm and 8.0 mm reinforced endotracheal tubes in female and male patients in Group I, respectively, whereas LMA C-Trach of appropriate size was introduced in patients of Group II. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded following the insertion of C-Trach LMA and labeled as LMA1. Chandy's maneuver, if required, was then used to achieve a direct central view of the vocal cords and orotracheal intubation was performed through the LMA under direct vision.</p><p>Correct placement of the endotracheal tube was confirmed in both groups by capnography. The C-Trach LMA was removed with the help stabilizing obturator rod. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded every minute up to 5 min after intubation in both groups and labeled as ET1, ET2, ET3, ET4 and ET5 respectively. All intubations were performed by the first author who has &#x0003e;10 years of anesthesia experience. SpO<sub>2</sub> and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were continuously monitored throughout the study period and any event of cardiac arrhythmia was recorded. At the end of 5 min after endotracheal intubation, inhalational anesthetic agent and/or intravenous propofol infusion was supplemented to the N<sub>2</sub> O in O<sub>2</sub> (2:1) and surgery was allowed to commence.

DL exerting a pressure over the base of the tongue by the laryngoscope blade stimulates proprioceptors, resulting in a significant proportionate increase in catecholamine and hemodynamic parameters. Passage of the tube through the trachea further exaggerates this response by somato-visceral reflex followed by rapid regression of SBP and heart rate whereas plasma catecholamine concentrations regress more slowly. Studies showing this enhanced sympathetic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation following induction with thiopentone or propofol and relaxation with succinylcholine or nondepolarisers, and its alteration, have been published time and again. Insertion of LMA generating lower sympathetic response has been reported by Akbar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Wood MLB and Forrest ETS.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Reports of hemodynamic response following intubation with ILMA vary from minimal cardiovascular response[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to no different from intubation with DL[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Li <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared the hemodynamic response to orotracheal intubation with LMA C-Trach and direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia in 60 adult patients scheduled for elective gynecological surgery. Their observations revealed that blood pressure and heart rate at and after intubation were not significantly different from basal values in C-Trach group whereas in laryngoscopy group only heart rate increased significantly at and after intubation.</p><p>In our study we used C-Trach assembly to intubate under vision, record the hemodynamic response to intubation and compare it to the response seen after intubation with direct laryngoscopy. Minimal or no clinical rise in SBP (1.8%), a modest rise in DBP (10.6%) was recorded, while intubating with the help of C-Trach. In comparison, statistically and clinically significant increases were recorded in systolic and DBP (20.3% and 21.4%) after intubation using DL. The rise recorded in systemic blood pressure was more sustained in DL group than CTrach group. However the heart rate increase recorded in the two groups (22.8% in Group I and 22.4% in Group II) was statistically and clinically significant and of equal magnitude. Higher findings of percentage rise in rate pressure product derived in Group I postintubation imply a greater hemodynamic stress and enhanced myocardial oxygen demand following intubation with DL.</p><p>Stimulation of supraglottic region by tissue tension is the major cause of sympathoadrenal response to tracheal intubation and placement of tube through cords contributes little additional stimulation. Laryngoscopy produces a balanced stimulation of vagal and cardiac accelerator fibers, whereas intubation produces less vagal stimulation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our study reveals that intubation using C-Trach generates low sympathetic stress response because the propioceptors at the base of the tongue are not stimulated. The response to the passage of tube through the trachea resulted in sympathetic stimulation, precipitating a profound increase in heart rate in both C-Trach and DL group. Easy insertion, secure airway and minimal side-effects are other benefits of C-Trach assembly. The subdued response could be more helpful in hypertensive patients where the variations of blood pressure are wide and thus may result in higher morbidity. The fact that no drug was used to suppress the stress response is an added advantage. Thus, we conclude that CTrach assembly is a useful technique of intubation as it generates low hemodynamic response.</p><p>However, further trials will help to assess the hemodynamic effects of intubation through CTrach assembly in patients with hypertension and cardiac disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>el-Sharkawy</surname><given-names>TY</given-names></name><name><surname>Renck</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Mansour</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Fouda</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hemodynamic and catecholamine responses to laryngoscopy with vs. without endotracheal intubation</article-title><source>Acta Anesthesiol Scand</source><year>1991</year><volume>35</volume><fpage>442</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tabari</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Alipour</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmadi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hemodynamic changes occurring with tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy compared with intubating laryngeal mask airway in adults &#x02013;
