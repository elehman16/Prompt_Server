The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of muscle relaxers on pain control following breast reconstruction with prosthesis in addition to the use of oral opioids prescribed post operatively following hospital discharge.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> Randomized controlled trial comparing pain control following alloplastic breast reconstruction with muscle relaxer Cyclobenzaprine (intervention group) versus pain control following alloplastic breast reconstruction without muscle relaxer (control group). Patients met inclusion criteria and agreed to participate were included. Consent forms in both English and French languages were provided. The patients were randomly assigned to either group. Total of thirty patients participated in the study, fifteen patients in each group. Outcomes measured include, patient reported visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores day 1, 2 and 3, and the total number of narcotic pills taken within the 1<sup>st</sup>three days at home following discharge from the hospital were recorded and subjected to the mean and standard deviation. Student T test was used for comparison; multiple and single linear regression was used to assess different factors on the outcome. A p value &#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> No significant difference has been noted. For the intervention group, mean pain score for 3 days after discharge was 5.67 (SD 6.89), while the control group had a mean of 6.73 (SD 3.99) (p = 0.61). As for the number of pills, for the intervention group mean was 8.00 (SD 4.74), while the control group had a mean of 9.33 (SD 7.05) (p = 0.55).</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> There is no significance in pain score and number of narcotic pills when using the muscle relaxer cyclobenzaprine as an adjunct for pain control following alloplastic breast reconstruction.</p></body></article>
