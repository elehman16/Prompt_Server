increasing evidence that tight blood glucose (BG) control improves outcomes in critically ill adults. Children show similar hyperglycaemic responses to surgery or critical illness. However it is not known whether tight control will benefit children given maturational differences and different disease spectrum.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is an randomised open trial with two parallel groups to assess whether, for children undergoing intensive care in the UK aged &#x02264; 16 years who are ventilated, have an arterial line in-situ and are receiving vasoactive support following injury, major surgery or in association with critical illness in whom it is anticipated such treatment will be required to continue for at least 12 hours, tight control will increase the numbers of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 30 days, and lead to improvement in a range of complications associated with intensive care treatment and be cost effective.</p><p>Children in the tight control group will receive insulin by intravenous infusion titrated to maintain BG between 4 and 7.0 mmol/l. Children in the control group will be treated according to a standard current approach to BG management.</p><p>Children will be followed up to determine vital status and healthcare resources usage between discharge and 12 months post-randomisation. Information regarding overall health status, global neurological outcome, attention and behavioural status will be sought from a subgroup with traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p><p>A difference of 2 days in the number of ventilator-free days within the first 30 days post-randomisation is considered clinically important. Conservatively assuming a standard deviation of a week across both trial arms, a type I error of 1% (2-sided test), and allowing for non-compliance, a total sample size of 1000 patients would have 90% power to detect this difference. To detect effect differences between cardiac and non-cardiac patients, a target sample size of 1500 is required. An economic evaluation will assess whether the costs of achieving tight BG control are justified by subsequent reductions in hospitalisation costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The relevance of tight glycaemic control in this population needs to be assessed formally before being accepted into standard practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN61735247</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ability to control blood sugar is known to be impaired in patients subjected to the stress of major surgery or critical illness resulting in high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This may in part result from insulin resistance, as insulin-dependent glucose uptake has been shown to be reduced in various organs and tissues during critical illness. Glucose uptake is however increased in non-insulin dependent tissues such as brain, red blood cells and wounds. This imbalance of glucose metabolism has previously been interpreted as the body's plea for tolerating moderately high levels of glucose during critical illness and injury and treatment of 'stress-induced' hyperglycaemia has typically only been initiated if BG levels are persistently and substantially elevated.</p><sec><title>Hyperglycaemia in Critically Ill Adults</title><p>Over recent years several studies have associated hyperglycaemia with adverse outcomes during acute illness in adults:</p><sec><title>Myocardial infarction</title><p>In a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], patients with acute myocardial infarction without diabetes who had glucose concentrations more than or equal to range 6.1-8.0 mmol/L had a 3.9-fold (95% CI 2.9-5.4) higher risk of death than patients without diabetes who had lower glucose concentrations. Glucose concentrations higher than values in the range of 8.0-10.0 mmol/L on admission were associated with increased risk of congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock in patients without diabetes. Stress hyperglycaemia with myocardial infarction is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and increased risk of congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock in patients without diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Stroke</title><p>Capes et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature relating acute post stroke glucose levels to the subsequent course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A comprehensive literature search was done for cohort studies reporting mortality and/or functional recovery after stroke in relation to admission glucose level. Thirty-two studies were identified for which pre-defined outcomes could be analysed in 26. After stroke, the unadjusted relative risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with admission glucose level &#x0003e;6 to 8 mmol/L was 3.07 (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.79) in non-diabetic patients and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.49 to 3.43) in diabetic patients. Non-diabetic stroke survivors whose admission glucose level was &#x0003e;6.7 to 8 mmol/L also had a greater risk of poor functional recovery (relative risk = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.73).</p></sec><sec><title>Head injury and multi-system trauma</title><p>Hyperglycaemia has been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in adult patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and children with head injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and multiple trauma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function</title><p>Hyperglycaemia has been shown to be associated with diminished pulmonary function in adults even in the absence of diabetes mellitus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and a range of other effects with potential to injure the lung[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Gastrointestinal effects</title><p>Hyperglycaemia has been shown to be associated with delayed gastric emptying[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], decreased small bowel motility and to increase sensation and cerebral evoked potentials to a range of gastrointestinal stimuli in adult volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Infections</title><p><italic>In vitro </italic>responsiveness of leukocytes stimulated by inflammatory mediators is inversely correlated with glycaemic control[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

In a prospective study of 2,467 consecutive diabetic patients who underwent open heart surgical procedures, patients were classified into two sequential groups. A control group included 968 patients treated with sliding-scale-guided intermittent subcutaneous insulin injections. A study group included 1,499 patients treated with a continuous intravenous insulin infusion in an attempt to maintain a BG level of less than 11.1 mmol/l. Compared with subcutaneous insulin injections, continuous intravenous insulin infusion induced a significant reduction in perioperative BG levels, which led to a significant reduction in the incidence of deep sternal wound infection in the continuous intravenous insulin infusion group (0.8% [12 of 1,499]) versus the intermittent subcutaneous insulin injection group (2.0% [19 of 968], p = 0.01). The use of perioperative continuous intravenous insulin infusion in diabetic patients undergoing open heart surgical procedures appears to significantly reduce the incidence of major infections.</p><p>Malmberg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] randomly allocated patients with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction to intensive insulin therapy (n = 306) or standard treatment (controls, n = 314). The mean (range) follow up was 3.4 (1.6-5.6) years. There were 102 (33%) deaths in the treatment group compared with 138 (44%) deaths in the control group (relative risk (95% confidence interval) 0.72 (0.55 to 0.92); p = 0.011). The effect was most pronounced among the predefined group that included 272 patients without previous insulin treatment and at a low cardiovascular risk (0.49 (0.30 to 0.80); p = 0.004). Intensive insulin therapy improved survival in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction. The effect seen at one year continued for at least 3.5 years, with an absolute reduction in mortality of 11%.</p><p>In 2001 Van den Berghe and colleagues from Leuven, Belgium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reported the results of a randomised trial in adults undergoing intensive care following surgical procedures. This trial showed that the use of insulin to tightly control BG led to a reduction in mortality (32%), mean length of intensive care stay (22%), and significantly lower occurrence of a range of complications of critical illness such as renal failure, infection, inflammation, anaemia and polyneuropathy. Duration of intensive care stay was 3.4 days shorter in the insulin group.</p><p>Recently the Leuven group[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have reported that, in addition to adult surgical intensive care patients, intensive insulin therapy reduces morbidity in adults who require intensive care for treatment of medical conditions. In this prospective randomised controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned to a regime of strict normalisation of BG (4.4-6.1 mmol/l) with use of insulin, or conventional therapy where insulin is administered only when BG levels exceeded 12 mmol/l, with the infusion tapered when the level fell below 10 mmol/l. In the intention to treat analysis of the 1200 patients included, ICU and in-hospital mortality were not significantly altered by intensive insulin therapy, however for those patients requiring more than 3 days intensive care, mortality was significantly reduced from 52.5 to 43% (p = 0.009). Morbidity was significantly reduced by intensive insulin therapy with a lower incidence of renal injury and shorter length of mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay noted. Beyond the fifth day of intensive insulin therapy, all morbidity endpoints were beneficially affected, whereas for those patients staying less than 3 days, none of the morbidity end-points were significantly different between the two treatment groups.</p><p>On the basis of these studies, several groups have recommended that tight glycaemic control with intensive insulin therapy become a standard of care for the critically ill adult patients. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JACHO) recently proposed tight glucose control for the critically ill as a core quality of care measure for all U.S. hospitals that participate in the Medicare program[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement, together with an international initiative by several professional societies including the American Thoracic Society, is promoting a care "bundle" for severe sepsis that also includes intensive glycaemic control for critically ill adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both the Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have incorporated TGC into their recently publicised 'Surviving Sepsis' guidelines. These initiatives represent important attempts to translate research findings into improved care at the bedside[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The possible mechanisms by which different glucose control strategies might influence clinical outcomes are yet to be fully elucidated. There is a substantial body of published research which points to an association between hyperglycaemia and organ/tissue dysfunction. In models of both focal and global cerebral ischaemia, hyperglycaemia has been shown to be associated with exacerbation of intracellular acidosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], accumulation of extracellular glutamate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], cerebral oedema formation and disruption[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]of the blood-brain barrier[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In ischaemic brain injury, hyperglycaemia may worsen injury by promoting anaerobic metabolism and consequent intracellular acidosis. In the rat myocardium, hyperglycaemia leads to up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, resulting ultimately in an increase in production of superoxide, a condition favouring the production of the powerful pro-oxidant peroxynitrite. This highly reactive free radical has the power to cause direct oxidant damage to myocardial cells or to induce myocardial cell apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Similar adverse mechanisms have been shown to exist in hyperglycaemic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Improved clinical outcomes may arise not necessarily solely as a result of control of BG. Insulin lowers free fatty acids and normalises endothelial function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], is associated with anabolic effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and to have cardio-protective effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], all of which may contribute independently to better outcomes in critical illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyperglycaemia in Critically Ill Children</title><p>Over 10,000 children are admitted to intensive care units in England and Wales each year[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Hyperglycaemia, defined as BG &#x0003e; 7 mmol/l, occurs frequently during critical illness or after major surgery in children, with a reported incidence of up to 86%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. As in adults, the occurrence of hyperglycaemia has been shown to be associated with poorer outcomes including death, sepsis, and longer length of intensive care stay in critically ill children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Non-randomised research in children includes a number of reports from general[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and cardiac PICUs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] showing that high BG levels occur frequently in critically ill children and that BG levels are significantly higher in children who die than in children who survive.</p><p>Srinivasan[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] studied the association of timing, duration, and intensity of hyperglycaemia with PICU mortality in critically ill children. The study was a retrospective, cohort design and included 152 critically ill children receiving vasoactive infusions or mechanical ventilation. Peak BG of &#x0003e; 7 mmol/L occurred in 86% of patients. Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher peak BG (17.3 mmol/L +/- 6.4 vs. 11.4 +/- 4.4 mmol/L, p &#x0003c;.001). Non-survivors had more intense hyperglycaemia during the first 48 hrs in the PICU (7 +/-2.1 mmol/L) vs. survivors (6.4 +/- 1.9 mmol/L, p &#x0003c;.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that peak BG and the duration and intensity of hyperglycaemia were each associated with PICU mortality (p &#x0003c;.05). Multivariate modelling controlling for age and Paediatric Risk of Mortality scores showed independent association of peak BG and duration of hyperglycaemia with PICU mortality (p &#x0003c;.05). This study demonstrated that hyperglycaemia is common among critically ill children. Peak BG and duration of hyperglycaemia appear to be independently associated with mortality. The study was limited by its retrospective design, its single-centre location and the absence of cardiac surgical cases, a group which make up approximately 40% of paediatric intensive care (PICU) admissions in the UK.</p><p>Halverson-Steele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] has recently shown in a retrospective study, that hyperglycaemia was associated with poor outcomes in 526 children following cardiac surgery. Nineteen patients (3.6%) died postoperatively (median 11 days, range 1-17 days). Peak plasma glucose concentrations in survivors (mean 10.7 mmol/l, SD 3.7) was significantly lower than the peak value recorded in non-survivors (mean 14.3 mmol/l, SD 4.2; p = 0.0017). The 147 patients who were discharged from ICU within 24 hours had lower plasma glucose concentrations on admission (mean 7.5 mmol/l, SD 2.3) and peak plasma glucose concentrations (mean 9.2 mmol/l, SD 2.3) than the remaining patients staying longer than 24 hours (mean 8.1 mmol/l, SD 4.0; p = 003 and mean 11.3 mmol/l, SD 3.9; p &#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively). Peak plasma glucose concentrations were also lower in 387 patients admitted for up to 5 days (mean 10.1 mmol/l, SD 2.9) when compared with those patients with ICU stays of &#x0003e; 5 days (mean 12.7 mmol/l/, SD 4.6; p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>Hall[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] investigated the incidence of hyperglycaemia in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and the relationship between glucose levels and outcome in these infants. Glucose measurements (n = 6508) in 95 neonates with confirmed NEC admitted to the surgical intensive care unit were reviewed. Glucose levels ranged from 0.5 to 35.0 mmol/L. 69% of infants became hyperglycaemic (&#x0003e;8 mmol/L) during their admission. Thirty-two infants died. Mortality rate tended to be higher in infants when maximal glucose concentration exceeded 11.9 mmol/L compared with those with maximum glucose concentrations of less than 11.9 mmol/L, and late (&#x0003e;10 days admission) mortality rate was significantly higher in these infants (29% v, 2%; p = .0009). Linear regression analysis indicated that maximum glucose concentration was significantly related to length of stay (p &#x0003c;.0001).</p><p>Branco[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] showed that there is an association between hyperglycaemia and increased mortality in children with septic shock. They prospectively studied all children admitted to a regional PICU with septic shock refractory to fluid therapy over a period of 32 months. The peak glucose level in those with septic shock was 11.9 +/- 5.4 mmol/L (mean +/- SD), and the mortality rate was 49.1% (28/57). In non-survivors, the peak glucose level was 14.5 +/- 6.1 mmol/L, which was higher (p &#x0003c;.01) than that found in survivors (9.3 +/- 3.0 mmol/L). The relative risk of death in patients with peak glucose levels of &#x02265; 9.9 mmol/L was 2.59 (range, 1.37-4.88).</p><p>Faustino[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] demonstrated that hyperglycaemia occurs frequently among critically ill non-diabetic children and is associated with higher mortality and longer lengths of stay. They performed a retrospective cohort study of 942 non-diabetic patients admitted to a PICU over a 3 year period. The prevalence of hyperglycaemia was based on initial PICU glucose measurement, highest value within 24 hours, and highest value measured during PICU stay up to 10 days after the first measurement. Through the use of three cut-off values (6.7 mmol/L, 8.3 mmol/L, and 11.1 mmol/L), the prevalence of hyperglycaemia was 16.7% to 75.0%. The relative risk (RR) for dying increased for maximum glucose within 24 hours &#x0003e;8.3 mmol/L (RR, 2.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26 to 4.93) and highest glucose within 10 days &#x0003e;6.7 mmol/L (RR, 5.68; 95% CI, 1.38 to 23.47).</p><p>Pham[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] have recently reported their experience of adopting a policy of 'intensive' insulin therapy to achieve BG levels 5 mmol/L to 6.7 mmol/L. They reviewed the records of children with &#x02265; 30% total body surface area burn injury admitted over a 3 year period. The first cohort of 31 children received 'conventional insulin therapy', whilst the subsequent cohort of 33 children received 'intensive insulin therapy'. The demographic characteristics and injury severity were similar between the groups. Intensive insulin therapy was positively associated with survival and a reduced incidence of infections. The authors therefore concluded that intensive insulin therapy to maintain normoglycaemia in severely burned children could be safely and effectively implemented in a paediatric burns unit and that this therapy seemed to lower infection rates and improve survival.</p><p>There is therefore mounting evidence to suggest that a policy of TGC may be beneficial to neonates and children undergoing neonatal and paediatric intensive care, but none of this evidence is from large rigorous randomized controlled trials. The aim of the present study is to determine whether a policy of strictly controlling BG using insulin in children admitted to paediatric intensive care reduces mortality, morbidity and is cost-effective.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study is an individually randomised controlled open trial with two parallel groups.

Death is obviously an important outcome. Mechanical ventilation can be seen as a measure of disease severity, defining the need for complex intensive care. The concept of ventilator free days (VFDs) brings together these two outcomes. Schoenfeld[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] define VFDs as: VFD = 0 if the child dies before 30 days; VDF = (30-x) if the child is successfully weaned from ventilator within 30 days (where &#x000d7; is the number of days on ventilator); or VFD = 0 if the child is ventilated for 30 days or more. The use of organ failure free days to determine patient-related morbidity surrogate end-points in paediatric trials has been supported by influential paediatric trialists in the current low mortality paediatric critical care environment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Death within 30 days after trial entry (or before discharge from hospital if duration is greater than 30 days)</p><p>Death within 12 months of trial entry</p><p>Number of days in PICU</p><p>Duration of mechanical ventilation</p><p>Duration of vasoactive drug usage (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, or Phoshopdiesterase type III [PDEIII] inhibitors or vasopressors)</p><p>Need for renal replacement therapy</p><p>Blood stream infection (positive cultures associated with two or more features of systemic inflammation or any positive blood culture for bacteria or fungi)</p><p>Use of antibiotics &#x0003e;10 days</p><p>Number of red cell transfusions</p><p>Number of hypoglycaemic episodes moderate (&#x02264; 2.5 mmol/L), severe (&#x02264; 2.0 mmol/L)</p><p>Occurrence of seizures (clinical seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy)</p><p>Paediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>],</p><p>Hospital length of stay</p><p>Number of children readmitted to PICU within 30 days of trial entry</p></sec><sec><title>Cost and cost-effectiveness measures</title><p>Hospital costs within 30 days of trial entry</p><p>Cost per life year (based on 30 days costs and survival)</p><p>Hospital and community health service costs within 12 months of trial entry</p><p>Cost per life year (based on 12 month costs and survival for all cases)</p><p>Cost per disability-free survivor (based on 12 month cost and outcome data for sub group with traumatic brain injury)</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up at 12 months</title><p>If parents give their consent, all children surviving to hospital discharge will be followed up to 12 months post-randomisation to determine mortality using the NHS Central Register of the Office of National Statistics (ONS).

The principal measure to avoid clinically important hypoglycaemia will be hourly measurement of BG when insulin is first administered. The insulin administration protocols aim to achieve glucose control with the lowest possible incidence of hypoglycaemia and the avoidance of neuroglycopaenia.

The PICANet dataset includes most of the items being used in the trial and these data will be transmitted from the participating centres to the Data Co-ordinating Centre electronically using strong encryption. The remaining short term data items will be collected locally by the research nurses, and those for the longer term follow-up will be collected separately by telephone and postal questionnaires. These data will be double entered onto electronic database storage systems at the Data Co-ordinating Centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Cost-consequence and cost-effectiveness analyses will be undertaken as part of the proposed study. These economic evaluations will assess whether the costs of achieving tight BG control are justified by subsequent reductions in hospitalisation costs and/or by improvements in patient outcomes. The evaluations will be conducted in two phases, in the first phase all hospital costs at 30 days post randomisation will be compared across treatment groups alongside 30-day outcomes, in the second phase cost and outcomes at 12-months will be compared across the groups.</p><p>For the first phase evaluations, detailed resource use data will be collected for each patient enrolled in CHIP using the Paediatric Critical Care Minimum Dataset (PCCMDS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] which will be collected by each PICANet unit. Where information on resource use required in CHIP is not available from these sources datasheets similar to those developed as part of the INNOVO study will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Information will also be collected on the resources required to achieve tight BG control, in particular all medication use and the staff time involved in monitoring the patients and managing adverse events (e.g. hypoglycaemia) will be noted.</p><p>Unit costs for hospital services will be taken from the NHS 'payment by results' database[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Where more detailed unit costs are required, for example those associated with staff time and the use of insulin infusion, these will be collected on site visits to centres. Hospital costs up to 30 days will be estimated by valuing each resource use item by the appropriate unit cost.</p><p>In the second phase of the study the time horizon of the economic evaluation will be extended to 12 months, and resource use data for hospital re-admissions, outpatient visits and the use of community health services will be collected for all cases. For the sub-sample of patients diagnosed as having traumatic brain injury at study entry, information on the patient's disability at one-year will be collected during telephone interviews with the patients' relatives based on previously developed interview schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. All community service use will be valued using national unit costs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Total costs for each patient will be calculated by summing the costs of all hospital and community health services used.</p><p>All the economic analyses will be based on the treatment groups as randomly allocated ('intention to treat'). The initial analysis will include a cost-consequence analysis and will report mean differences (95% CI) between treatment groups in resource use (e.g. length of hospital stay) and total hospital costs per patient, alongside the primary clinical endpoint. The initial analysis will also combine costs and outcomes at 30 days post-randomisation in a cost-effectiveness analysis, which will report cost per death averted and cost per adverse event averted. The subsequent analysis will use 12-month cost and outcome data to report the cost per death averted for all patients. For the sub-sample of patients diagnosed as having brain injury at study entry, the cost-effectiveness analysis will also report the cost per death or disabled case averted.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis will test whether the results are robust to key assumptions made, for example to the choice of unit costs and the time horizon of the analysis. The cost and outcome data collected at one-year will be used to project the impact of the intervention on longer-term costs and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A difference of 2 days in the number of ventilator-free days (VFD) within the first 30 days post-randomisation between the two groups has been chosen as the primary outcome measure for the trial. Information from PICANet using data from UK PICUs for 2003-4 estimates that the mean number of VFDs in cardiac patients is 26.7, with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.2. Corresponding figures for non-cardiac patients are a mean of 22.7 days, with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.8 days. As the SD is estimated with error, to be conservative we have assumed the SD is nearer 5.5 days for the cardiac and 8 days for the non-cardiac patients. There are likely to be more non-cardiac than cardiac patients eligible for the trial. We have therefore assumed an overall SD across both cardiac and non-cardiac strata of 7 days. Assuming this is the same in both trial arms, and taking a type I error of 1% (with a 2-sided test), a total sample size of 750 patients would have 90% power to detect this difference. Whereas we can assume minimal loss to follow up to 30 days, there may be some non-compliance (some patients allocated to tight control not receiving this, and some allocated to usual care being managed with tight control). The target size will therefore be inflated to 1000 to take account of possible dilution of effect.</p><p>As information from PICANet indicates that there are differences in outcome between cardiac and non-cardiac patients not merely in VFDs but also in 30 day mortality rate (3.4% vs. 20%) and mean duration of time on a ventilator (3.7 vs. 8.0 days, survivors and non-survivors combined), we also wish to be able to detect whether any effect of tight glucose control differs between the cardiac and non-cardiac strata. To have 80% power for an interaction test to be able to detect a difference of two days in the effect of intervention between the strata at the 5% level of statistical significance, we would need to increase the sample size to 1500. If the interaction test was positive this size would allow us to assess the effect of tight glucose control separately in the two strata.</p><sec><title>Recruitment rate</title><p>There are approximately 1300 cardiac and 1550 non-cardiac eligible patients per year in the collaborating PICUs. If half of those eligible are recruited into the trial, it should be feasible to recruit the overall total sample size of 1500 within the 24 months recruitment period.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Type of analysis</title><p>Analysis will be by intention to treat.

The local investigator will be required to demonstrate knowledge of the trial protocol and procedures and Good Clinical Practice. The accessibility of the site file to trial staff and its contents will be checked to ensure all trial records are being properly maintained. Adherence to local requirements for consent will be examined.</p><p>If the site has full compliance the Site Visit Form will be signed by the Trial Manager. In the event of non-compliance the Data Coordinating Centre will address the specific issues to ensure that relevant training and instruction is given.</p></sec><sec><title>Termination of the study</title><p>At the termination of planned recruitment the Data Co-coordinating Centre will contact all sites by telephone, email or fax in order to terminate all patient recruitment as quickly as possible. If the study is terminated prematurely by the Steering Committee all sites will be informed immediately. When all recruited patients have been followed until 30 days post randomisation (or hospital discharge if stay longer than 30 days) a declaration of the end of trial form will be sent to EurdraCT and the MREC. The following documents: original consent forms, original data forms, trial related documents and correspondence will be archived in each Site File and kept for at least five years. At the end of the analysis and reporting phase, the Trial Master Files at the Clinical and Data Co-coordinating Centres will be archived for 15 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Indemnity</title><p>If there is negligent harm during the clinical trial when the NHS body owes a duty of care to the person harmed, NHS Indemnity covers NHS staff, medical academic staff with honorary contracts, and those conducting the trial. NHS Indemnity does not offer no-fault compensation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Data from level 2 trials have driven the adult intensive care clinicians to adopt treatment regimes that favour tight glycaemic control. Equipoise presently exists in the paediatric intensive care community and this allows us a very important opportunity to conduct an adequately powered randomised controlled trial in this setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse Event; AR: Adverse Reaction; BG: Blood glucose; CBCL: Child Behavioural Check List; CHiP: Control of Hyperglycaemia in Paediatric
