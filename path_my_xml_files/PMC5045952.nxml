<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Hospitalization in neonatal intensive care
unit may leads to many stresses for premature infants. Since premature infants cannot
properly process stressors, identifying interventions that reduce the stress level for
them is seems necessary. The aim of present study was to compare the effects of Field
massage and Gentle Human Touch (GHT) techniques on the urine level of cortisol, as an
indicator of stress in preterm infants. </p><p>
<bold><italic> Methods:</italic></bold> This randomized, controlled clinical trial was
carried out in Al-Zahra hospital, Tabriz. A total of 84 premature infants were randomly
assigned into three groups. First groups were touched by their mothers three times a day
(15 minutes in each session) for 5 days by GHT technique. The second group was received 15
minutes Field massage with sunflower oil three times a day by their mothers for 5 days.
The third group received routine care. In all groups, 24-hours urine samples were
collected in the first and sixth day after the intervention and analyzed for cortisol
level. Data were analyzed by SPSS software.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> There were significant differences between mean of
changes in cortisol level between GHT and control groups and Field massage and control
groups (0.026). </p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Although the massage with Field technique
resulted in a significant reduction in blood cortisol level, but the GHT technique have
also a similar effect. So, both methods are recommended for decreasing of stress in
preterm infants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Infant, premature</kwd><kwd>Massage</kwd><kwd>Neonatal intensive care unit</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p> Please cite this paper as: Asadollahi M, Jabraeili M, Mahallei M, Asgari Jafarabadi M,

was around 11.1% that is equivalent with 14.9 million births annually.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Vazirinejad et al., reported that the rate of
low birth weight (birth weights less than 2500 grams) was 9.6% in a referral hospital in
Iran.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p> Due to recent advances in prenatal and neonatal care the survival rate of premature infant
has been significantly increased.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It
should be noted that this increased survival is not associated with decrease in
complications such as low birth weight and survived infants are more susceptible for
problems such as severe disability, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and vision and
hearing problems.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> So, the purpose of
providing care for premature infants has changed from survival and prevention of major
disabilities to normal brain development.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> Despite the vital importance of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in survival of
preterm infants, being hospitalized in these wards would cause stress for these infants,
which ultimately leads to disruption of their development.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These stressful experiences are including sleep deprivation,
high levels of light and noise, loss of human interaction and pain.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Moreover, stressful experiences in infants are
associated with the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline and may lead
to dangerous side effects such as fear, irritability, sleep disturbances, alterations in the
response of immune system, and impaired emotional relationship.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> When infant attempts to adjust with stressful situations, hypothalamic - pituitary-adrenal
axis is activated and changes in plasma levels of cortisol and beta-endorphins reaches to
its maximum level.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Long-term
complications of high concentrations of cortisol were including insulin resistance,
hyperlipidemia, immunodeficiency and destructive changes in hippocampus.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Since premature infants cannot properly adjust
with environmental stressors, interventions is needed to improve their autonomic nervous
system performance.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Applying thr
supportive care can be used as an approach to enhance the development of infants and
mitigate the complications caused by prematurity.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This approach is composed of a wide range of interventions including
additional stimulus control (such as visual, hearing, and equilibriumand tactile stimulus),
cluster care, family-centered care, behavioral or supportive techniques (such as Kangaroo
mother care, positioning, non-nutritive sucking), and positive stimuli such as music and
gentle touch. The purpose of these techniques is to improve the quality of life of premature
infants.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p> In the past, it was recommended that the unnecessary touch of preterm infants may have
many negative impacts on their hemodynamic status and should be avoided.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> But, recent evidence suggests that the lack of
sensory stimuli in premature infants may act as a stressor and may cause developmental and
neurological delays.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Many studies have
been carried out on the effects of massage therapy on preterm infants and have shown many
positive consequences&#x000a0;such as: wieght gain, decreased of duration of hospitalization, the
increase in the incidence of late infection, and activation of behavioral and brain
development.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>&#x000a0;Stress in preterm
infants can be measured by assessing the hormonal and behavioral indicators, so the effects
of interventions for stress reduction have been examined on the levels of stress hormones
level.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Since premature infants cannot
properly process stressors, identification of interventions that reduce the stress level for
them is seems necessary.</p><p> Jay used the concept of Gentle Human Touch (GHT) to show a soft touch delivered by human
agents.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a study by Harrison et
al., the effects of GHT on six premature infants at 32-27 weeks of gestation were
investigated.</p><p> The results showed that during GHT intervention the experimental group had lower levels of
cortisol, more weight gain, reduced need for oxygen, as well as decreased motor
activity.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Results of another study
by Acolet et al., showed that the cortisol level of 11 premature infants in 29 weeks of
gestation was reduced after massage therapy.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A few studies have&#x000a0;examined&#x000a0;the impact of touch interventions on preterm
infant&#x02019;s stress&#x000a0; and most studies in this field has limitations in methodology, including
small sample size, the use of invasive procedures to determine the level of stress and
using&#x000a0;the observation tool, that&#x000a0; all could &#x000a0;impact on the&#x000a0; results.&#x000a0;Therefore, this study
aimed to compare the effects of Field massage and Gentle Human Touch (GHT) techniques on the
urine level of cortisol in preterm infants, as an indicator of stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial that conducted from September to
December 2014. The setting for the study was the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#x0200f; in
Al-Zahra hospital affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical sciences, Tabriz, Iran. The
samples composed of 84 preterm infants with gestational age between 30 and 36 weeks. Other
inclusion criteria for these infants were including: passing 7 to 10 days from birth, no
need for artificial ventilation, having no medical order for intravenous or intramuscular
injections, absence of congenital anomalies, mother willingness to cooperate in the study,
and no feeding of infant for half an hour before the massage. In this study, infants who
were discharged from the hospital until within the sixth day of the study or were critically
ill newborn whom received severe invasive procedures within five days of intervention or
their mothers did not completely adhere to the study protocol were excluded from the
study.</p><p> Eligible infants who were available were selected. Then through the 6 block they were
randomly allocated into three groups. Random numbers to select these infant was determined
using RAS statistical software. Opaque sealed envelopes with sequentially numbered were used
for allocation concealment. The sample size was calculated based on the mean and standard
deviation of changes in cortisol levels (Yakson group 3.0(0.6), GHT group 3.1(0.6), control
group 3.2(0.7) obtained from a previous study.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p> Considering 95% confidence interval and power test of 0.80, the minimum sample size was
estimated to be 21 infants in each group by using G-Power software. By estimation of 30%
attrition rate, the final sample of each group was increased to 28 infants.</p><p> In this study, a checklist was used to record information regarding mother and neonates
characteristics. The content validity of this checklist was approved by 10 academic staff
from Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.</p><p> The study had the approval from local ethic committees of Tabriz University of Medical
Sciences, Iran and registered with code number 201407275168N5 in Iranian Registry of
Clinical Trials (IRCT) site. Before data collection, an informed consent was signed by all
potential parents and the study protocol was approved by two neonatologists. Then, infants
were randomly allocated into three groups by random blocking method (GHT Group, Field
massage, and control group). GHT Group infants were touched by their mothers three times a
day (15 minutes) for 5 days. In this group, the mothers disinfected their hand with
anti-microbial solutions and warm them under the warmers. Then they touched the forehead of
their premature infants with their palm for 15 minutes when put the fingertips over the
eyebrows. Also, they put their other hand on the lower abdomen to support the infants' back
and buttocks. The second group, received 15 minutes Field massage periods for 5 days three
times a day by their mothers by using sunflower oil. This technique was consisted of three
5-minute massage phases which in the first and final phases the infant was lying on the
abdomen. This massage is done with the smooth parts of the fingers of both hands with a
medium pressure. In these two phases, the following areas was massaged respectively: 12
massage movement (every 5 seconds) from the head to the neck on the way of two sides of the
face and vice versa; 12 massage movements (every 5 seconds) from the back of the neck to
shoulders and vice versa; 12 massage movements (every 5 seconds) from the upper back to
lower back and waist and vice versa; 12 massage movements (every 5 seconds) from the thighs
down to the ankles and vice versa; and 12 massage movements (every 5 seconds) from the
shoulders to wrists and vice versa. In the middle phase, Infants was lying flat on their
back and six passive flexion - extension movements (every 10 seconds) were given to the
following areas: right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg, and both feet. The third group
was the control group whom received routine care including Kangaroo mother care (KMC),
massage without any technical received.</p><p> In all three groups, 24-hours&#x000a0;urine&#x000a0;samples were collected using urine bag and measured
for Cortisol level in the first and sixth day after the intervention. Collected urine
immediately transferred to the accredited laboratory in Tabriz and the cortisol level
measured by using radio-immunoassay method by LIAISON device and was reported as &#x000b5;g in
24h.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>The reliability of the LIAISON
device with multiple calibrated during the study was approved by a lab technician.</p><p> Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 13 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Statistical significance was considered as meaningful for P- value less than 0.05.
Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, frequency and percentage were
calculated for all variables. The normality of collected data was evaluated using the
Kolmogorov - Smirnov test. An independent samples t-test was used for statistical
comparisons of cortisol level before and after intervention within each group and one-way
ANOVA test was used for comparison the cortisol levels between three groups. Confounding
variables were controlled by general linear model with repeated measures ANOVA.</p><p> All participants signed the consent form of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="jcs-5-187-g001"/><statement><p>Consort flow diagram</p></statement></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> Overall, 84 preterm infants (28 infants in each groups) were participated in this study.
One infant in each GHT and Field massage group and 4 infants in control group were excluded
from the study because of early discharge or dissatisfaction for taking urine sample in
6<sup>th</sup> day. So, the result of 78 premature infants was included in the final
analysis.The demographic characteristics of preterm infants in three groups are reported in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. The results of chi-square and one-way
ANOVA tests showed that there were no statistical differences between three groups in regard
with these characteristics. Some demographic characteristics of mother of infants were as
followings: age were 28.6 (5.4) years; most of them were educated less than diploma (39.3%);
were housewife (86.9%); and had a moderate economic status (75%).</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the comparisons of the mean of stress

massage as a moderate touch on the urine level of cortisol in preterm infants. There are
many stressors for premature infants in NICU and it is important for a nurse to identify
interventions that would reduce the impact of stress in these infants. Results of this study
indicated that, in comparison with control group, GHT and Field massage groups showed
decrease in urine levels of cortisol.</p><p> Although there are concerns about the effects of sensory stimulation of premature infants,
but several studies have confirmed the positive effects of GHT for premature infants. This
finding is in line with the findings of Bahman Bijari et al., who investigated the effects
of GHT and Yakson touch on behavioral reactions of preterm infants. The behavioral reactions
of infants were assessed before and 5 days after the intervention by using Anderson
Behavioral State Scale. In the interventional groups (GHT and Yakson groups) the score of
sleep state was increased and the score of wake and fussy states were decreased. These
results reflect the positive effects of both methods in sedation of preterm
infants.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> Although premature infants may appear very weak, but a grade of pressure is needed for
effective massage theraphy.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Field et
al.,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> conducted a study to examine
the effects of moderate versus light pressure massage herapy on weight gain in preterm
infants with average gestational age of 30 weeks. In their study preterm infants were
received 15 massages sessions with tactile and kinesthetic stimulations three times per day
for 5 days.</p><p> Results showed that infants in moderate pressure massage group gained significantly more
weight per day. This group also showed significantly change on stress behaviors such as: 1-
decrease in deep sleep, agitation, and heart rate; 2- increase in active sleep and gross
moment. Finally, results showed that massage with moderate pressure therapy with tactile and
kinesthetic stimulations was more effective than light&#x000a0;pressure&#x000a0;massage.</p><p> Our study also supports this finding which showed that the level of stress hormone in
Field massage group was significantly lower than other two groups. Kuhn et al., examined the
effects of massage on sympathetic system and adrenal cortex and reported that massage may
increase the catecholamine and cortisol secretions. Increase in secretion of catecholamine
is associated with increased stress and raise concerns about the impact of massage on stress
level in preterm infants.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Hernandez-Reif
et al.,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> suggested that massage reduces the
stress of preterm infants and secretion of catecholamine which helps the desirable
development and awakes.</p><p> Most of previous studies have many methodological limitations such as using invasive
method for determining the stress level<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
and using observational methods of measurement.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>These limitations may impact on the validity and generalizability of
findings of previous studies. In this regard, in the present study a non-invasive and
reliable method of measurement, urine level of cortisol, was used to determine the stress
level of preterm infant.</p><p> Finally, according to the findings of this study, it is suggested that Field massage
therapy should be considered a complementary approach for preterm infants.</p><p> Implementation of this procedure requires the attention of health policy makers and health
care providers regarding the benefits of this procedure.</p><p> This study has some limitations. The main limitation was the difficulty in collecting
24-hour urine with urine bag. In addition, lick of urine especially in female infants is
likely to influence the findings. Due to problems in measurements of urinary cortisol,
another study with measurement of salivary cortisol is suggested to determine the stress
level of infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> The results of present study showed that both GHT and Field massage&#x000a0;therapy techniques
reduces the stress hormone levels of preterm infants. The results of this study, in line
with previous studies, confirmed the importance and safety of massage for preterm infants.
Using these procedures can result in reducing stress hormone levels and reduces their
negative effects on preterm infants.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> Thanks for all mothers and nurses who agreed to participate in this study. Also, we
