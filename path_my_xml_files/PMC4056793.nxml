acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is controversial. We compared the
efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a
liberal transfusion strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Objective:</italic> The objective was to prove that the restrictive
threshold for red blood cell transfusion in patients with acute upper GI
bleeding (UGIB) was safer and more effective than a liberal transfusion
strategy.</p><p><italic>Design:</italic> A single-center, randomized controlled trial was
conducted.</p><p><italic>Setting:</italic> Patients with GI bleeding were admitted to the de la Santa
Creu i Sant Pau hospital in Barcelona, Spain.</p><p><italic>Subjects:</italic> The subjects were adult intensive care unit patients
admitted with high clinical suspicion of UGIB (hematomemesis, melena, or
both). Patients were excluded if they had massive exsanguinating bleeding,
acute coronary syndrome, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease,
stroke/transient ischemic attack, transfusion within the previous 90 days,
recent trauma or surgery, lower GI bleeding, or a clinical Rockall score of
0 with hemoglobin higher than 12 g/dL.</p><p><italic>Intervention:</italic> A total of 921 patients with severe acute UGIB were
enrolled. Of these, 461 were randomly assigned to a restrictive strategy
(transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell to below 7 g/dL) and 460 to a
liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell to below 9 g/dL).
Random assignment was stratified according to the presence or absence of
liver cirrhosis.</p><p><italic>Outcomes:</italic> The primary outcome was rate of death from any cause
within the first 45 days. Secondary outcomes were further bleeding, defined
as hematemesis or melena with hemodynamic instability or hemoglobin decrease
of 2 g/dL or more, and in-hospital complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%) and 65
assigned to the liberal strategy (15%) did not receive transfusions
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). The probability of survival at 6 weeks was
higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group
(95% versus 91%; hazard ratio (HR) for death with restrictive strategy,
0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Further
bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group
and in 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (<italic>P</italic> =
0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% and 48%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>
= 0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the
restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of
patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (HR 0.70, 95% CI
0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with
cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85)
but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (HR 1.04, 95%
CI 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient
increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive
strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy
significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute UGIB.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Commentary</title><p>The annual incidence of hospitalization for acute UGIB is 1 in 1,000 people in North
America, translating to 300,000 admissions yearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and a total annual expenditure of $2.5 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mortality from UGIB is approximately 10% and may reach 35% in
patients hospitalized with another medical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In the critically ill, a more restrictive strategy has been used for blood
transfusion on the basis of a growing body of data indicating worse outcomes with
red blood cell transfusions in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the threshold for blood transfusion in patients with UGIB has
been controversial since hemoglobin values may underestimate the blood loss. Over
the past decade, consensus guidelines suggested using a more conservative approach
based on experimental studies, trials in other populations, and physiologic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A prospective observational study in patients with UGIB showed that
blood transfusion in the first 12 hours in patients presenting with hemoglobin of
more than 8 g/dL increased mortality and rebleeding rates in comparison with
patients not receiving blood transfusion in the first 12 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
examining red blood cell transfusion for the management of UGIB found only three
trials and showed higher mortality and rebleeding rates for a liberal transfusion
strategy. However, these studies had design flaws and were underpowered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Transfusion Strategies for Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is a randomized controlled trial testing liberal and conservative
strategies for patients with UGIB. The authors hypothesized that a restrictive
threshold for red blood cell transfusion (transfusion when hemoglobin was below 7
g/dL with a goal of 7 to 9 g/dL) was safer and more effective than a liberal
transfusion strategy (transfusion when hemoglobin was below 9 g/dL with a goal of 9
to 11 g/dL). Patients with low mortality and low risk of rebleeding were excluded by
using the Rockall score, which is based on age, presence or absence of shock,
comorbidities, reason for bleeding, and major stigmata of recent hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality rate at 45 days. Secondary
outcomes were rebleeding rate and adverse events. The random assignment was
stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Twenty-eight percent in the
restrictive group and 31% in the liberal group were in shock upon enrollment. The
restrictive-strategy group had a lower mortality rate than the liberal group (5%
versus 9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) at 45 days, and the relative-risk reduction was 45%
and the number needed to treat was 25 patients for the restrictive strategy
intervention. In addition, the liberal-strategy group had higher frequency of
rebleeding, interventions (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for
variceal bleeding and surgery in non-variceal bleeding), and cardiac and pulmonary
adverse effects.</p><p>The study had several strengths. First, it used a randomized controlled design and a
patient-centered outcome with an adequate number of patients. The protocol was well
devised for hemoglobin checks and management of complications. The study also had a
few concerns. The protocol allowed the physicians to transfuse in the presence of
signs and symptoms of anemia in case of a massive bleed and if a surgical
intervention was planned. However, protocol violations in transfusing blood occurred
in both arms, and more violations occurred in the restrictive group (9% versus
3%).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been suggested by previous animal and physiologic studies to
explain the increased mortality and morbidity with a liberal transfusion strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These include clot rupture, coagulopathy, changes in stored red blood
cells (the storage lesion), and immunomodulation. The duration of storage of red
blood cells was similar in the two groups, and the coagulation laboratory test
results were also similar in the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], suggesting that these pathways may not solely explain differences in
outcomes.</p><p>Although this study was conducted only in patients with UGIB, a similar restrictive
approach should be considered by physicians caring for critically ill patients
presenting with other acute bleeding episodes, such as lower GI bleeding and
retroperitoneal bleeding. However, physicians should be careful about extrapolating
these results to patients with massive bleeding or those with bleeding and acute
coronary syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>A restrictive strategy for blood transfusions should be used for UGIB. The results of
this study reinforce the growing notion that ?less is more? for a blood transfusion
strategy in the critically ill.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CI: Confidence interval; GI: Gastrointestinal bleeding; HR: Hazard ratio; UGIB: Upper
