One of the key drivers of maternal mortality in Ethiopia is the very low coverage of Skilled Birth attendance (SBA) in rural Ethiopia. This cluster randomized trial piloted an innovative approach of deploying trained community reproductive nurses (CORN) to hard to reach/unreachable rural Ethiopia to improve the coverage of SBA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used a three-arm cluster randomized trial to test the effect of deploying CORN in rural communities in South Ethiopia to improve SBA and other maternal health indicators. A total of 282 villages/clusters (94 from each arm) were randomly selected in the three districts of the zone for the study. The intervention was implemented in four consecutive phases that aimed at of provision of essential maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) services mainly focusing on SBA. The CORN were trained and deployed in health centres (arm 1) and in the community/health posts (arm2). A third arm (arm 3) consisting control villages without the intervention. A baseline and end line assessment was conducted to compare the difference in the proportion of SBA and other MNCH service uptake across the three arms Data was entered into computer, edited, cleaned, and analyzed using Epi-data statistical software. The presentation followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement guidelines for cluster-randomized trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is designed to test the impact of an innovative and newly designed means of distribution for the national health extension program strategy with additional service package with no change to the target population. The focus is on effect of CORN in revitalizing the Health Extension Program (HEP) through improving SBA service uptake and other maternal health service uptake indicators. The study findings may guide national policy to strengthen and shape the already existing HEP that has certain limitations to improve maternal health indicators. The competency based training methodology could provide feedback for health science colleges to improve the national nursing or midwifery training curriculum.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinicaltrails.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02501252">NCT02501252</ext-link> dated on July 14, 2015.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cluster randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Skilled birth attendance</kwd><kwd>CORN</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The study received funding from the WHO Implementation Research platform (IRP) </institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Motherhood in many parts of the world remains unsafe even 25&#x000a0;years after the launch of Safe Motherhood Initiative in Nairobi, Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. About 287,000 maternal and 3.1 million neonatal avoidable deaths occur annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The rate of death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium has shown its divergence in the poor and the rich countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Particularly, there has been less than satisfactory progress in sub-Saharan Africa, towards the global child and maternal mortality targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Ethiopia has shown remarkable progress in the reduction of maternal and child mortality rates during the past 25&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, maternal mortality rates is still high in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The risk factors of maternal mortality in Ethiopia are complex and interwoven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the key factors attributable for the death of mothers are related to low facility-based deliveries, poor competence of providers, and poor quality of care and referral system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In rural parts of Ethiopia, which accounts for 85% of the national population, delivery attended by qualified health professionals (SBA) is only 16% and 84% of deliveries occur at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Ethiopia has implemented an innovative community-based health service delivery called HEP since 2003 to improve access to health care services particularly for mothers and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. HEP involves trained and salaried female health cadres who provide basic primary health care services at community level. Two Health Extension Workers (HEWs) are assigned per health post for about 5000 population at <italic>Kebele</italic> (lowest administrative unit) level. The HEP includes 16 essential health packages under four major program areas: hygiene and environmental sanitation, disease prevention and control, and family health services and health promotion and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The HEP has contributed substantially to the improvement in women&#x02019;s utilization of family planning, antenatal care (ANC) and HIV testing. However, its contribution to improve health facility delivery, postnatal care and use of iodized salt has been insignificant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The HEW are overwhelmed with several preventive activities including family planning, vaccination, sanitation and treatment and referral of malaria and other diseases and have very limited time and skills to improve SBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. HEW is expected to identify, counsel and refer high-risk pregnancies. However, an evaluation report of the HEP showed that less than 50% of the HEW knew signs of obstructed labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Thus, to end with these alarming and potential limitations of the national HEP, an innovative and culturally sensitive strategy at community level is needed. Therefore, we conducted a cluster randomized trial to pilot the effect of deploying trained CORN to provide SBA and other maternity care service in rural Ethiopia. In this paper, we report the result of the trial in detail.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives of the trial</title><p>The trial aims to test the effect and acceptability of CORN on maternal and neonatal health service uptake in rural south Ethiopia.

In the preparatory phase, sensitization workshop with relevant stakeholders such as community representatives, ministry of health (MOH) and regional health bureau (RHB) experts in reproductive health and other were conducted. During this phase, 16 CORN were recruited through nationwide advertisement and entrance exams. The CORNS were trained based on the core competencies of the intervention. Diploma nurses or midwives (10&#x02009;+&#x02009;3 graduates) who had at least 48&#x000a0;h theoretical and 72&#x000a0;h practical sessions on reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in the pre-service training (college) were eligible for CORN. The CORN were trained for 4&#x000a0;months at Dilla University hospital based on competency model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The training focuses on key components such as practical skills, problem solving, critical thinking and decision-making skills. The 4&#x000a0;months training topics include basic concepts of maternal and newborn health; rapid initial assessment and managing emergency; pregnancy care; childbirth care and postnatal maternal care. In addition, they were trained for an additional month on family planning, HIV counselling and testing and community mobilization skills. In general, the training aimed to achieve the following goals: promotion of health and prevention of diseases; detection of existing diseases and treatment; early detection and management of complication and birth preparedness and complication readiness. Finally, baseline survey in all arms was conducted to assess the coverage SBA and other maternal indicators during the preparatory phase.</p><p>After the completion of all the preparatory activities, the CORN were randomly deployed to the interventions villages, either at the health centre (arm1) or community/health post level (arm 2) for ten months. The intervention algorism is described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The CORN at the community level visits each household every two weeks and provides essential services to pregnant women including counselling, birth preparedness and complication readiness and referral to the health post or health centres. The CORN at the health centres provide reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child (RMNCH) services at the centres on a daily outreach basis. One mentor (experienced midwife from Dilla University) was assigned for three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] CORN to mentor their activities and provide feedback.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CORN Activities (Intervention) Algorithm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_2041_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>During the interventions period, data on maternity service uptake such as deliveries, family planning, postnatal care and, HIV counselling and testing were collected at the health facilities or communities by assigned experts. In the control villages, routine activities were done by HEW as per the Ethiopia national guideline procedure. The HEW were also doing their routine activities in the intervention arms. Monthly coordination meeting between the CORN, supervisors, investigators and HEW were also done to monitor program performance and provide feedback.

The data collectors, local supervisors and data monitoring coordinator checked the completeness and consistence of collected quantitative data. Then the principal investigator and research team analyzed the final dataset. Additionally, data collector guaranteed quality via systematic observations of data collection and confirmation was done from the participant's record file at the health facilities.

The low coverage of SBA is the main driver of maternal mortality in Ethiopia. With this low coverage of SBA, Ethiopia will face tremendous challenge to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The flagship HEP in Ethiopia uses a Family Folder that is a low-cost and high impact health management information system at <italic>Kebele</italic> level to make health services accessible to the poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This program has been successful in reducing the burden of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and improving the coverage of ANC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the coverage of SBA remains low in the last ten years despite the presence of HEW in the community. This calls for an innovative approach to improve SBA nationally. This cluster randomized trial aims to assess the impact of such an innovative approach of deploying CORN to rural Ethiopia on the coverage of SBA. The findings and lesson learnt from this trial will guide national policy to design need-based and relevant alternative interventions to improve SBA in rural Ethiopia. The study may also guide policy makers how to scale up other maternal interventions such as the Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) during the SDGs era. The study findings would also highlight the effectiveness of such an innovative approach on maternal health indictors. More importantly, the lesson learnt from this study may provide feedback to Universities to improve the curriculum of nurses and midwives nationally.</p><p>The study used a rigorous study design to answer the research question. Buffer <italic>Kebeles</italic> were also left to reduce contamination of the intervention. However, contamination of information may not be controlled totally. Furthermore, as the study is innovative by nature whereby nurses deployed to work in rural villages where there is little or no infrastructure including food, there is a possibility of in and out stay on job. The nurses usually travel to nearby towns to fetch water and bring food that might affect full implementation of the interventions throughout the project stay. Another possible limitation is through agreed to support and were smoothly working with the project staff, there is still a possibility of discouraging home based skilled delivery as it is not a reportable activity and fear of community's experience with home based skilled delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study design is relevant and rigorous to assess the impact of deploying CORN on coverage of SBA in rural Ethiopia. The study findings may guide national policy to implement relevant interventions to meet the SDG goals. The competency based training methodology could be helpful to improve the national nursing and midwifery training curriculum.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANC</term><def><p>Antenatal care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CORN</term><def><p>Community reproductive nurse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEP</term><def><p>Health extension program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEW</term><def><p>Health extension workers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMR</term><def><p>Maternal mortality rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMTCT</term><def><p>Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBA</term><def><p>Skilled birth attendance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDG</term><def><p>Sustainable development goals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNNP</term><def><p>Southern, Nations, Nationalities People Region</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the study community and local authorities and health workers for the invaluable support during the implementation of the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study received funding from the WHO Implementation Research platform (IRP).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets analyzed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TAZ &#x00026; HT conceived and designed the study.
