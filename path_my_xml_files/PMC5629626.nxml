Frailty, as an entity, is a risk factor of increased morbidity and mortality. It is also associated with a longer time to discharge. This trial is undertaken to determine if a novel prehabilitation protocol (10-day bundle of interventions&#x02014;physiotherapy, nutritional supplementation and cognitive training) can reduce the postoperative length of stay of frail patients who are undergoing elective abdominal surgery, compared with standard care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. 62 patients who are frail and undergoing elective abdominal surgery will be recruited and randomised to receive either a novel prehabilitation protocol or standard care. Participants will receive telephone reminders preoperatively to encourage protocol compliance. Data will be collected for up to 30 days postoperatively. The primary outcome of the trial will be the postoperative length of stay and the secondary outcomes are the postoperative complications and functional recovery during the hospital admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Singapore General Hospital Institutional Review Board (CIRB Ref: 2016/2584). The study is also listed on ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial number: NCT02921932). All participants will sign an informed consent form before randomisation and translators will be made available to non-English speaking patients. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals as well as national and international conferences.

</p><p>The population is ageing rapidly worldwide. In 2004, 461&#x02009;million people in the world were above the age of 65. By 2050, it is estimated that 2&#x02009;billion people will be above the age of 65.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> As such, it may be anticipated that a large number of frail patients will be requiring surgery in the future. Currently, there is no clear intervention that has been shown to modify the syndrome or its impact on postoperative outcomes. Therefore, it is important to clinician-researchers to develop strategies aimed at improving the outcomes of this high-risk population undergoing surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Background</title><p>It has been recognised that frailty is a dynamic process. A prospective observational study of 754 community-living elderly subjects by Gill <italic>et al</italic> showed that over a 18-month period, 43% participants became more frail while 23% became less frail.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the non-surgical population, it has been demonstrated that frailty can be modified through interventions such as exercise therapy, dietary interventions and drug therapy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>
</p><p>After major surgery, there is an immediate and substantial decline in a patient's functional status, followed by recovery in the postoperative period.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> While a fit individual is likely to regain his pre-hospitalisation level of functioning, a frail individual may not be able to respond as well, resulting in delayed recovery, increased hospital length of stay and operative mortality.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17</xref> There is initial evidence that prehabilitation may be used to reduce morbidity and mortality in frail patients. Notably, Harari <italic>et al</italic> found that the introduction of a comprehensive geriatric assessment service resulted in a clinically significant decrease in medical complications and hospital length of stay.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, at present, most recent guidelines are unable to conclusively support the use of prehabilitation as standard practice.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>The primary objective of the study is to determine if prehabilitation with a bundle of interventions (physiotherapy, nutritional support and cognitive exercises) initiated preoperatively in frail patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery will result in shorter hospital length of stay. The secondary objectives are to determine if prehabilitation will decrease postoperative complications and improve functional recovery following surgery.</p><p>Frailty is a condition that affects multiple organ systems.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As such, the use of a combination of interventions is likely to yield better results than a single intervention. For this reason, the intervention in this study consists of a bundle of interventions rather than a single intervention. Sarcopenia, anorexia and exhaustion are key features of frailty.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Current understanding of frailty is that it is a modifiable syndrome.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As such, physiotherapy (inspiratory muscle training (IMT)) and nutritional supplementation may be able to modify the syndrome preoperatively and improve postoperative outcomes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref> Postoperative delirium is also common in frail patients and may result in delayed discharge from hospital.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Prior studies have demonstrated that cognitive training may have a positive impact on postoperative delirium.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, cognitive training is also included in the prehabilitation bundle.</p><p>IMT and aerobic exercise training are the most common physiotherapy interventions used to optimise patients preoperatively.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> At present, there are no head-to-head studies that compare the effects of IMT and aerobic training. A Cochrane article published in 2015 examined whether IMT had an impact on the recovery of adults after surgery and concluded that compared with usual care, preoperative IMT was associated with a reduction in postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia. It also resulted in a reduced hospital length of stay. In comparison, studies on aerobic exercise training have yield mixed results.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref> For this reason, IMT was chosen over aerobic exercise training as the physiotherapy intervention in our prehabilitation bundle.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study design</title><p>This trial is a prospective, randomised controlled trial conducted at a tertiary hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital (SGH)).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients aged 65 years who are diagnosed as frail (Fried Criteria Score of 3 or more) are enrolled in the study if they are seen at least 11 days prior to their elective major abdominal surgery and are able to understand and follow the prescribed cognitive and physical exercises.

Currently, there is no consensus about the duration of prehabilitation that is required for optimising surgical patients.

A recent study from our centre found that frail patients had a longer median POLOS compared with non-frail patients&#x02014;13.5 days compared with 8 days. As such, we considered an absolute reduction of 2 days of POLOS to be clinically significant.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Due to non-parametric distribution of the POLOS, we used the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test to estimate the sample size. Using a type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%, the sample size needed was 56. To account for a 10% dropout rate, a total recruitment size of 62 participants was obtained. As this sample size was calculated for the primary outcome measure, any conclusion derived from the secondary outcome measures may be underpowered and may require further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Potential participants will be identified from the appointment list for attendees of the preoperative evaluation clinic at SGH.

Quality of recovery from surgery will be measure by the PQRS score. The PQRS consists of five recovery domains (physiologic, emotive, nociceptive, activities of daily living, and cognition), and one self-assessment domain, including satisfaction. Pain scores are measures using a visual faces chart with a 1 to 5 scale, with scores of 3 or greater representing moderate to severe pain. Data will be reported as the proportion of patients recovered at each time point. Differences between groups over days 1 to 7 will be analysed using the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test. Continuous data such as the days of ICU stay and ventilation days will be analysed using Student's t-test.</p><p>To ascertain the robustness of the test results, a per protocol analysis for the primary outcome, based on 75% compliance from the activity log, will be done.

This study has been approved by the Singapore General Hospital Institutional Review Board (SGH IRB) (CIRB Ref: 2016/2584) and is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (Identified: NCT02921932). In the event of any important protocol modifications, all investigators, SGH IRB and trial participants will be notified. The results of this study will be presented at international conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. The data collected will also be made available in a public data repository.</p><p>All eligible participants will be approached by the research assistant during their visit to the preoperative evaluation clinic. They will be given an explanation about the study, a patient information sheet and a consent form. They will then be given an ample time to consider if they would like to participate in the study. They will also be allowed to ask questions freely. If the participant expresses an interest to participate in the study, a written consent will be obtained. The consent forms are in English. However, participants from non-English speaking backgrounds will be provided a translator. For illiterate participants, an accompanying family member will be approached to verify and witness the consent process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this protocol, we describe our randomised controlled trial looking at the impact of a novel prehabilitation bundle on a frail patient's postoperative length of stay. This study also examines the secondary outcome measures of functional recovery and in-hospital complications. The strengths of this study are that it is novel, randomised-controlled trial design and uses cheap and easily available interventions to decrease hospital length of stay. If this bundle is successful in reducing a frail patient's POLOS, it will have significant impact as it will decrease resource use&#x000a0;and free up resources for other patients.</p><p>The limitations of this study are its single-centre and open-label design. In order to ameliorate these limitations, care was taken to ensure that the researchers do not have any role to play in the determining the patients&#x02019; POLOS. The study team will have very limited or no contact with the clinical team, therefore, minimising the risk that a treating physician's knowledge of the patient's group assignment will lead to a bias in decision making. In addition, the secondary outcomes were objectively defined to minimise subjectivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e261" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016815.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e262" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016815.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> HRA: designed and conceptualised study, prepared draft manuscript, revised draft manuscript, approved final manuscript for submission, statistical calculations.
