Arthroscopic acromioplasty is popular even though its efficacy is unknown. In this study, we analyzed stage-II shoulder impingement patients in subgroups to identify those who would benefit from the operation.</p><p><bold>Patients and methods &#x02014;</bold> In a previous randomized study, 140 patients were either treated with a supervised exercise program or with arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a similar exercise program. The patients were followed up at 2 and 5 years after randomization. Self-reported pain was used as the primary outcome measure.</p><p><bold>Results &#x02014;</bold> Both treatment groups had less pain at 2 and 5 years, and this was similar in both groups. Duration of symptoms, marital status (single), long periods of sick leave, and lack of professional education appeared to increase the risk of persistent pain despite the treatment. Patients with impingement with radiological acromioclavicular (AC) joint degeneration also had more pain. The patients in the exercise group who later wanted operative treatment and had it did not get better after the operation.</p><p><bold>Interpretation &#x02014;</bold> The natural course probably plays a substantial role in the outcome. Based on our findings, it is difficult to recommend arthroscopic acromioplasty for any specific subgroup. Regarding operative treatment, however, a concomitant AC joint resection might be recommended if there are signs of AC joint degeneration. Even more challenging for the development of a treatment algorithm is the finding that patients who do not recover after nonoperative treatment should not be operated either.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Shoulder impingement syndrome has traditionally been divided into 3 progressive stages: (1) edema and hemorrhage (stage I), (2) fibrosis and tendinitis (stage II), and (3) tears of the rotator cuff, biceps ruptures, and bone changes (stage III) (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C14">Neer 1983</xref>). Nowadays, the term impingement syndrome is used to refer to a full range of rotator cuff abnormalities, being still a diagnosis based on physical examination (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C15">Papadonikolakis et al. 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C6">Diercks et al. (2014)</xref> highlighted the need for a combination of clinical tests in the diagnosis, and suggested the use of an imaging test after prolonged symptoms (of more than 6 weeks) to rule out rotator cuff tears. Shoulder impingement is a common cause of shoulder pain (van der <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C22">Windt et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C21">Urwin et al. 1998</xref>). Tendinopathy is considered to have a multifarious etiology: intrinsic mechanisms may be more important than extrinsic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C8">Factor and Dale 2014</xref>).</p><p>Both nonoperative treatment and operative treatment have been used to treat this syndrome (Coghlan et al. 2008, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C7">Dorrestijn et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C13">Kromer et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C3">Chaudhury et al. 2010</xref>). It has been shown that arthroscopic acromioplasty is not superior to a supervised exercise program (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Ketola et al. 2009</xref>, 2013, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C15">Papadonikolakis et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C6">Diercks et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C19">Saltychev et al. 2015</xref>). However, arthroscopic acromioplasty has been increasingly used during the last decade (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C16">Paloneva et al. 2015</xref>). Similar results have been obtained with open and arthroscopic acromioplasty (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C5">Davis et al. 2010</xref>). It is unclear whether a specific subgroup of patients who would benefit from arthroscopic acromioplasty can be identified. In most studies, the inclusion criterion has simply been failure of nonoperative treatment (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C2">Brox et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C10">Henkus et al. 2009</xref>). We have already done a cost-effectiveness study that suggested that arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a structural exercise program is less cost-effective than exercise treatment alone (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Ketola et al. 2009</xref>), and this was confirmed by <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C19">Saltychev et al. (2015)</xref>. We have now analyzed the 140 impingement patients from our previous study (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Ketola et al. 2009</xref>) in subgroups to find out whether there is a subgroup of patients who would really benefit from arthroscopic acromioplasty. Secondly, we wanted to determine whether there is a subgroup in which the procedure should be avoided.</p><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S0001"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The original study design was a controlled randomized trial. 140 patients (18&#x02013;60 years old) were included in the study if history and clinical tests indicated impingement syndrome (52 men and 88 women, mean age 47 years). All patients were collected from the Kanta-H&#x000e4;me Health Care District in Finland, which at the time of the inclusion had a population of 165,000. The study started in June 2001, and by the end of July 2004 we had recruited 140 patients&#x02014;as planned from a power calculation. The dropout rate was 6 of 140 at 2 years and 31 of 140 at 5 years. It was therefore possible to analyze 134 of the 140 randomized patients at 2 years and 109 of the 140 at 5 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). MRI of the shoulder was performed before randomization, as a supplementary tool to exclude other shoulder pathologies such as full-thickness rotator cuff lesions. All the radiographs were evaluated by 2 independent radiologists and their consensus values were used in the analyses. For inclusion, the symptoms had to be resistant to previous attempts to treat them nonoperatively during the previous 3 months. None of the patients had had previous shoulder surgery. The inclusion and exclusion criteria and the precise study protocol are described in the report of the 2-year results (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Ketola et al. 2009</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="iort-86-641.01"/></fig><p>The 2 treatment groups were (1) arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a supervised and structured exercise treatment program (the combined treatment group), and (2) a similarly supervised and structured exercise treatment program alone without any surgery (the exercise treatment group). The only difference between treatments in these 2 study groups was the operation. For those patients who were randomized to the combined treatment group, an arthroscopic decompression was first performed. All the operations were performed under regional anesthesia by the same experienced orthopedic surgeon. After the diagnostic part of the procedure, debridement and decompression were done by shaver and/or vaporizer. If the coracoacromial ligament felt tight or thick, it was released. Acromioplasty was then performed with a burr drill. After that, these patients were also given a similar schedule of physiotherapy and training sessions.</p><p>The main follow-up points were at 2 and 5 years after randomization. A physiotherapist, who was blind regarding which patients were in the treatment group, performed all the assessments (with the patients in T-shirts) and was not otherwise involved in the study, treatment, or rehabilitation.</p><p>Self-reported pain on a 0&#x02013;10 visual analog scale (VAS) was used as the primary health outcome measure, and values at 2 and 5 years were also used in this ad hoc subgroup analysis. The proportion of pain-free patients was also used, with patients being considered free of pain if they reported pain at a level between 0 and 3 on VAS.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures were disability, working ability, pain at night (VAS values), shoulder disability questionnaire (SDQ) score, and reported painful days during the 3 months preceding the follow-up visit.

The fact that the diagnosis is merely clinical also makes comparison of different studies difficult. In a recent review and meta-analysis, the evidence on effectiveness of operative or nonoperative treatment was found to be limited (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C19">Saltychev et al. 2015</xref>). This is in keeping with the Cochrane Collaboration report (Coghlan et al. 2008) and 2 previous reviews (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C7">Dorrestijn et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C9">Gebremariam et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Subgroup analyses are important if treatments with statistically similar outcomes show extensive heterogeneity of the treatment effect in individual patients (perhaps related to the diversity of the pathophysiology of the underlying disease). This may help to create more individualized indications and contraindications for the treatments of interest. Subgroup analyses must be predefined, carefully justified, and limited to a few clinically important questions (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C18">Rothwell 2005</xref>), because otherwise they could be misleading. We feel that the prospective nature of this carefully selected patient material justified a subgroup analysis.</p><p>In this study, we tried to determine whether the treatment works better in some subgroups than in others, acknowledging the risks of statistical problems and misinterpretations. In the subgroup analyses, we focused on differences from the average overall treatment effect and limited the questions to only a few clear and well-defined variables. Participation in intervention as intended, i.e. analysis according to the ITT principle or the PP principle, did not have any statistically significant effect on the results. Our study indicates that using self-reported pain (by VAS) or secondary outcome measures at 2 or 5 years for analysis, the effects of combined treatment did not differ significantly from the effects of treatment with supervised exercise alone. In this study we did not compare the overall effects of these 2 modes of treatment, but specifically analyzed the eventual additional value provided by the operation over and beyond the effect obtained using a structured and supervised exercise program alone (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Ketola et al. 2009</xref> and 2013).</p><sec disp-level="2" id="S0008"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The dropout rate was small; it was possible to analyze 134 of the 140 randomized patients at 2 years and 109 of them at 5 years. The selection bias was low at the actual entry to the study, because at baseline all suitable subjects were willing to participate in the study. However, it is possible that some patients living in the hospital catchment area with similar pain-related complaints did not come to the hospital outpatient department, thus creating potential bias. The groups were similar at baseline. All arthroscopic acromioplasties were performed by one experienced surgeon who was considered to have reached the top of the learning curve, which contributed to the uniform quality of the operative care. Control visits/follow-up examinations were done by an independent and blinded physiotherapist who did not otherwise participate in the study. Due to multiple variables, the subgroup sizes became small, which would increase the risk of type-II error. In addition, there have been no reports and there is no common consensus on how shoulder impingement syndrome evolves over a long time. There may always be some patients who recover spontaneously and some others who are not cured despite the treatment given.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0009"><title>The natural course of the treated disease</title><p>The results at 2 and 5 years were similar between treatment groups and they seemed to continue to improve in a similar way in both groups after the first 2 years (to the 5-year follow-up). The effects of both procedures appeared to be long-lasting and to continue to improve over time (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C12">Ketola et al. 2013</xref>). Do these good results reflect the therapeutic intervention, or the natural long-term course of this syndrome?</p><p>The age limits for this study were 18 and 60 years. It has been shown that there are changes in acromial morphology with age. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic cuff tears increase with age (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C25">Yamamoto et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>18 patients were not pleased with the results of the exercise treatment alone, and they were therefore operated later on. However, these patients did not do any better after the operation. We believe that there was a similar group of patients in the combined group as well, who would not respond to surgery either. So it appears that almost one-third of all patients with this diagnosis do not respond to any sort of treatment. The remaining two-thirds will get better irrespective of the nature of the treatment. It might well be that the natural course of the shoulder impingement syndrome contributes substantially to the improvement of those patients who are &#x0201c;healed&#x0201d; after treatment, during the 5-year follow-up.</p><p>It appears that patients who do not get better with nonoperative treatment do not get better with operative treatment either, although this may also partly depend on the duration of the symptoms before initiation of the treatment. This in any case challenges the previous guidelines of offering surgery to patients who &#x0201c;fail&#x0201d; with nonoperative treatment. Longer follow-up periods in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome are needed to learn more about the natural course of the disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0010"><title>Factors affecting the results of the treatment</title><p>A longer duration of symptoms appeared to be predictive of worse results in both groups. This probably reflects the possibility that impingement heals spontaneously if the condition has lasted less than 1 year. In this study, after this checkpoint the number of non-responders increased substantially. The same consideration probably explains the worse results in patients who had longer and more frequent periods of sick leave, which is in line with previous studies (Bot et al. 2005, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C20">Thomas et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C17">Reilingh et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>There was a negative correlation between satisfaction at work and the perception of pain. The more demanding the work was, according to the patient&#x02019;s own assessment, the worse was the prognosis for recovery. Similarly, lack of a higher education was associated with poor treatment results. Patients living alone had more pain, which might be explained by the lack of disease-related support. There are similar reports involving other orthopedic conditions where psychological factors have affected the perception of pain (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C24">Wahlman et al. 2014</xref>). Also, in shoulder complaints several psychological factors have been related to outcome (Bot et al. 2005). If the condition is refractory or the symptoms become bilateral, the overall prognosis is negatively affected. This is probably explained by the previously mentioned third of the patients who have a more difficult disease. This is the group that does not recover from the initial symptoms, which appears to happen to most of the patients who are treated more than 1 year after the onset of symptoms.</p><p>Only 1 radiological feature was significantly associated with pain perception after the treatment. If the patients had AC osteoarthritis, they had more pain than patients with normal AC joint radiology. The incidence of arthroscopic acromioplasty has been increasing, but has probably now reached a plateau (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C23">Vitale et al. 2010</xref>, Yu et al. 2010). Based on this material, we cannot justify the performance of this procedure to any single subgroup of impingement patients. However, if the patient is to be operated, a concomitant AC resection is only recommended if there are signs of AC joint degeneration.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are no simple criteria to predict the natural course of the disease in patients suffering from shoulder impingement syndrome. This condition behaves somewhat differently from usual in some patient subgroups, which can be explained by the nature of the condition rather than the demographic properties of the patients. Regardless of the treatment chosen, most of the patients get better. If the patients do not recover by nonoperative means, it appears that they do not benefit from the operative treatment either.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0012"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Tables 1, 3, and 4, are available at Acta&#x02019;s website (www.actaorthop.org), identification number 8071.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Supplementary Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="iort-86-641S1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>All the authors participated in the conception and conduction of the study, and contributed to the final manuscript.
