These efforts typically generate lists of potential markers in small sample sets that are suggested as worthy candidates for further research, based on p-values &#x0003c; 0.05 from comparison of survival curves using the log rank test (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method) or the likelihood ratio test (Cox proportional hazards model).

Rather than rely upon Kaplan&#x02013;Meier-derived statistical significance (p-values &#x0003c; 0.05), a more stringent performance assessment that incorporates sensitivity and specificity characteristics should be considered. To test this hypothesis, sensitivity and specificity characteristics of the three statistically significant biomarkers reported in the biomarker analysis from the Renal EFFECT Trial (circulating Ang-2 and MMP-2, and tumor HIF-1&#x003b1;) were evaluated with a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) model in order to determine whether these biomarkers have any clinical utility as potential patient selection markers. In general, the development of any clinical grade laboratory test [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] requires such an approach. Note that for the continuous data set of a range of tumor protein expression data or soluble protein concentrations assessed in this study, an ROC approach is appropriate. For other biomarker data type where the outputs are dichotomous (yes or no), assessment of clinical utility would be simpler with outputs of only sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0001"><title>Patients &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="S0002"><title>&#x02022;&#x02002;Study design &#x00026; treatment</title><p>Data for this analysis were obtained from a multicenter, randomized Phase II study (n = 292) in which adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced RCC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either sunitinib 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off; n = 146) or 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule (n = 146) as first-line therapy [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Randomization was stratified by risk factors based on published Memorial Sloan&#x02013;Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) data [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Patients continued treatment up to 2 years or until disease progression, significant toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary end point was comparison of time to tumor progression between patients on the two schedules.</p><p>The study was run in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, and was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee of each center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00267748). All patients gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>&#x02022;&#x02002;ROC analysis</title><p>An ROC (curve) analysis is an approach that assesses both the sensitivity and specificity performance of a biomarker test signal according to the percentage of true positives identified by the test (sensitivity) <italic>and</italic> percentage of true negatives identified by the test (specificity). The ROC approach can help to identify optimal &#x02018;cut-points&#x02019; for a given analyte for prospective follow-up for diagnostic use [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A test with no false positives and no false negatives would have a perfect performance.</p><p>Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate) measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of cancer patients with progressive disease who are correctly identified as having progressive disease). Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of cancer patients who are correctly identified as not having progressive disease, sometimes called the true negative rate). In an ROC curve, the true positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted as a function of the false-positive rate (1 - specificity) for different cut-off points of a parameter, such as numeric assessments of proteins in tumor tissue or blood from cancer patients. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. ROC analysis generates an area under the curve (AUC), which is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups (those with progressive disease/those without progressive disease), where a value of 1 shows perfect performance (sensitivity rises from 0 to 1.0 at 1 - specificity of 0, and specificity rises from 0 to 1.0 at sensitivity of 1.0 on a ROC plot), and where an AUC of 0.5 has the performance equivalent of a coin toss (represented by a 45&#x000ba; line on a ROC plot). Although extensive literature is absent on acceptable cut-offs for companion diagnostics for patient use, an AUC value &#x0003c;0.8 is viewed by the authors not to have predictive value. However, around or above 0.8, there is no literature agreement as to what an acceptable value would be for patient selection utility and must be put into context of diagnostic [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or companion diagnostic use [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the authors acknowledge that refinement of the AUC value from the 0.8 value is probable following validation of patient selection markers for RCC patients receiving targeted therapies.</p><p>ROC curves with censored data have an additional complication. If one waits until the end of the study, then every subject has a binary outcome, and one ROC curve and AUC is produced. However, if one wishes to evaluate the outcome at another (earlier) time point, a time point is selected and subjects are classified as having the event or are censored. The choice of time point is important, as it can influence the conclusions. When a specific time point is not clear, one may choose several time points, present the results, and select the curve with the largest AUC [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Using the previously derived biomarker datasets from the randomized, Phase II sunitinib study (Renal EFFECT Trial) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], circulating Ang-2 and MMP-2, and HIF-1&#x003b1; percent of tumor expression were assessed for sensitivity and specificity characteristics using the ROC method. The serum soluble protein dataset comprised 74 baseline biospecimens (and 26 end-of-treatment/withdrawal biospecimens with associated paired baseline values) randomly selected from patients on schedule 4/2 only (the approved regimen for advanced RCC). Ang-2 and MMP-2 were identified by two distinct analysis platforms from a common list of 37 analytes. The IHC dataset comprised tumor biospecimens from 149 evaluable patients in both schedules combined. Clinical outcomes in patients comprising these biospecimen sets were representative of those from the entire study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0004"><title>Results</title><p>In the previously reported biomarker analysis for the Renal EFFECT Trial [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which utilized a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, three biomarkers emerged with p-values less than 0.05: baseline concentrations of circulating Ang-2 and MMP-2, and HIF-1&#x003b1; percent of tumor expression. Statistical analysis for the circulating soluble proteins in patients in the Schedule 4/2 arm was conducted using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare serum concentrations in responders versus nonresponders, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

This improvement was a statistically significant observation based upon a hazard ratio of 1.99 and a p-value of 0.02.

However, based on a threshold AUC of 0.8 by ROC analysis, neither HIF-1&#x003b1; percent of tumor expression (AUC = 0.65) nor baseline circulating Ang-2 (0.67) and MMP-2 (0.65) have true potential as patient selection markers.</p><p>Additional <italic>ad-hoc</italic> ROC analyses of other examples of potential biomarkers were conducted for further assessment of previously generated data. The circulating soluble protein VEGFR-3 and VEGF-C data from a previous publication [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showing &#x02018;promising&#x02019; statistically significant associations with efficacy (p &#x0003c; 0.01) also generated AUC values (0.44 and 0.75, respectively) below the minimal 0.8 threshold (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together, these results are consistent with our assertion that p-values &#x0003c; 0.05 that separate Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves do not necessarily translate into sensitivity and specificity characteristics needed for a clinically <italic>useful</italic> patient selection diagnostic. It is commonly observed by the authors that traditional group-versus-group comparison approaches are most commonly driven by small numbers of subjects that influence the overall group performance. Therefore, Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses and other similar approaches using arbitrarily predefined p-values of 0.10, 0.05, or even 0.01, in isolation, are unable to provide insight into false-positive and false-negative rates, which contribute to the overall key features of a patient selection biomarker.</p><p>Resistance to antiangiogenic agents can be innate and/or acquired [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is important to recognize that angiogenesis biology is complex and that multiple indirect mechanisms of resistance contribute to the challenge in identifying and validating a single baseline predictive test for patient selection for antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced RCC [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Upregulation of these mechanisms can be assessed in patients receiving treatment, including enumeration and characterization of infiltrating myeloid suppressor cells, or measurement of tumor or circulating proangiogenic proteins (e.g., FGF) or upregulation of invasion/resistance proteins such as hepatocyte growth factor receptor. However, such complexity does not mean that predictive biomarkers do not exist. Larger hypothesis-generating studies, powered to adjust for multiple comparisons, may be helpful in this regard. Of note, the ROC model can be applied equally well for a single candidate biomarker or for a composite biomarker, obtained from a multivariate analysis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although we strongly support the inclusion of sensitivity and specificity assessments, including ROC, for potential biomarkers of antiangiogenic agents, there are limitations to the outputs described in this manuscript. These include nonmandatory biospecimen collection, small sample size and absence of prospective testing. In future clinical trials, routine biospecimens collection and analysis, as well as statistical analysis, will help address clinical utility of biomarkers simultaneously with the clinical results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0007"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, an ROC analysis should be the next step in evaluating the clinical utility of &#x02018;promising&#x02019; patient selection biomarkers rather than increasing sample size and repeating studies or meta-analysis of multiple studies. The later approaches may demonstrate a lower p-value, but the ROC characteristics of the biomarkers under evaluation are unlikely to change. This sequential approach can be expected to help the clinician separate truly promising markers from those that, realistically, have no chance of helping patient selection for a given therapeutic agent in RCC or any other indication. While there is no consensus on a specific AUC value for good predictive purposes, there have been literature recommendations of an AUC &#x0003e;0.8 for a predictive marker with potential clinical utility, which we support. Finally, for identification and validation of baseline predictive markers for antiangiogenic agents, the complexity of angiogenesis biology and existence of multiple mechanisms of resistance should also be taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="S0008"><title>Future perspective</title><p>Promising biomarkers for use in advanced RCC and other tumor types, in particular for antiangiogenic agents, will continue to be preliminarily identified via Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis. However, in the future, ROC analysis will increasingly be used for continuous biomarker data in a step-wise fashion to distinguish those biomarkers for antiangiogenic agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors and other targeted agents with true clinical utility for patient selection, rather than validating results with larger studies or meta-analysis of multiple studies.</p><boxed-text id="BB1" position="float"><caption><title>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of data from a randomized, Phase II study of first-line sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n = 292) identified circulating soluble Ang-2 and MMP-2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; percentage of tumor expression as potential pretreatment biomarkers of sunitinib.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The methodological approach for identifying &#x02018;promising&#x02019; patient selection biomarkers should be reconsidered for targeted therapies, in particular for antiangiogenic agents.
