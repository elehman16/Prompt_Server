The current study identified women showing consistently low or high satiety responses to standardised servings of food across four separate days and compared them on behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors for overeating and future weight gain. In a crossover design, 30 female participants (age: 28.0 &#x000b1; 10.6; body mass index (BMI): 23.1 &#x000b1; 3.0) recorded sensations of hunger in the post-prandial period following four graded energy level breakfasts. Satiety quotients were calculated to compare individuals on satiety responsiveness across conditions. Body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), energy intake, food reward and craving, and eating behaviour traits were assessed under controlled laboratory conditions. A distinct low satiety phenotype (LSP) was identified with good consistency across separate study days. These individuals had a higher RMR, greater levels of disinhibition and reported feeling lower control over food cravings. Further, they consumed more energy and exhibited greater wanting for high-fat food. The inverse pattern of characteristics was observed in those exhibiting a consistently high satiety phenotype (HSP). Weak satiety responsiveness is a reliable trait identifiable using the satiety quotient. The LSP was characterised by distinct behavioural and psychological characteristics indicating a risk for overeating, compared to HSP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>satiety responsiveness</kwd><kwd>satiety quotient</kwd><kwd>energy intake</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-07-05345"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Weight gain leading to obesity is a multi-factorial problem that arises when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure over a prolonged period of time. However, the relationship between energy that is taken in and energy that is expended is not a simple one but rather involves a complex set of interactions from genetic, behavioural, physiological, social and environmental factors. Impairment in appetite control has been identified as an important contributor to overconsumption and weight gain [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with one potential marker of susceptibility to overeating and obesity being a weakened satiety response to food [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, evidence based on clinical observations suggest some obese patients report a poor relationship between their eating patterns and their sensations of hunger and fullness, suggesting that some individuals may experience an altered or weakened recognition and response to these internal signals [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Research examining individual differences in satiety responsiveness has demonstrated that obese individuals who report no relationship between their eating behaviour and appetite sensations exhibited a weaker satiety response during a test meal compared to obese individuals who reported that their eating behaviour was related to their appetite sensations [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interestingly, obese individuals with weak satiety responsiveness had higher scores on the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) subscales of Disinhibition and Hunger compared to controls [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are eating behaviour traits associated with overconsumption, a higher body mass index (BMI) and when high scores on these traits are combined, opportunistic eating [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Weak satiety responsiveness is not limited to obese individuals, indeed, research led by Drapeau and colleagues have found evidence for individual variability in satiety responsiveness among both obese and normal weight individuals and have identified a &#x0201c;low satiety phenotype&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In these studies, the authors used the satiety quotient (SQ) [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as a psychological marker of the satiating efficiency of food (changes in sensations of hunger relative to ingested caloric load over time) to identify individuals as high or low in satiety responsiveness. The SQ represents a change in recorded appetite sensations in response to a standardised meal and is expressed per unit of intake (e.g., kcal). A low SQ in response to a fixed-energy meal has been shown to be associated with greater subsequent <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake measured under both laboratory [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and free-living conditions [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SQ has been used in a wide range of research and has been shown to have value in studies examining acute [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and long term human appetite control [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in research examining the effects of drugs on appetite [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using the SQ, research has demonstrated that the low satiety phenotype is characterised by greater levels of state anxiety and night eating symptoms, an external locus of hunger, and a blunted cortisol response to a standard test meal, suggesting the low satiety phenotype may experience some level of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity dysregulation [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these findings show that weak satiety responsiveness can be objectively measured using the SQ and that a weakened recognition and response to satiety signals could promote overconsumption, which over time (and in conjunction with other contributory factors) may be associated with an increase in body weight. However, previous research has only characterised individuals as low or high in satiety responsiveness using a single standardised meal consumed on one occasion. It is therefore not currently known how reliable such measures of satiety responsiveness are, or whether the low satiety phenotype is a consistent and enduring trait in response to different energy loads. In addition, it would be predicted that individuals with a weak response to internal signals would be at greater risk of overeating for hedonic reasons from external cues. However, studies have not examined whether the low satiety phenotype is associated with hedonic risk factors such as increased liking and wanting for food, and greater levels of food craving. Therefore, the first aim of the current study was to determine the consistency of the SQ to categorise women as low or high in satiety responsiveness across different energy loads. In addition, the current study sought to extend previous findings by characterising the behavioural (<italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake), psychological (liking and wanting, food craving, eating behaviour traits) and physiological (body composition, resting metabolic rate) risk profile for overeating of the low satiety phenotype in a sample of normal and overweight women.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-07-05345"><title>2.

Participants were selected from an initial screening process to exclude those who were taking medication known to affect appetite, currently dieting to lose or gain weight, not regular breakfast consumers, reported a history of eating disorders, or were unfamiliar with or disliked the study foods. Informed written consent was obtained prior to the study. Participants received &#x000a3;30 for their participation.

Design</title><p>The study followed a counterbalanced, crossover within subjects design with subjects being randomised to condition order. Participants attended the research unit on five occasions: one screening visit and four experimental visits. Each visit was scheduled at least seven days apart. For all visits, participants were asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything besides water from 10 pm the evening before to ensure a standardised fasted state In addition, participants were required to refrain from engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity and from drinking alcohol 24-h prior to the experimental test sessions. Compliance with these instructions was assessed at the beginning of each test session by self-report. During the experimental visits, participants were permitted to leave the research unit in the period between breakfast and lunch. During the time spent outside of the research unit participants were instructed not to eat or drink anything besides water. In addition, participants were asked not to engage in moderate or vigorous physical activity at any point during the test day, but this was not objectively monitored (<italic>i.e.</italic>, with physical activity monitors). Ratings of subjective appetite were taken every 30 min using a validated, hand-held Electronic Appetite Ratings System (EARS II; HP&#x000ae; iPAQ) [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which provided a time stamp for each entry so that compliance with this measure could be monitored. To determine whether participants were reliably low or high in satiety responsiveness changes in subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were recorded before and following consumption of four, fixed energy breakfasts. Each breakfast was individually calibrated to provide participants with graded levels of their measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), specifically, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35%.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-07-05345"><title>2.3.

Participants were asked to remain awake but motionless in a supine position for 45 min, with RMR calculated from respiratory data averaged over the final 30 min of assessment. Oxygen uptake and maximal CO<sub>2</sub> were calculated from O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in inspired and expired air diluted in a constant airflow of ~40 L/min (individually calibrated for each participant) and averaged over 30 s intervals.

Discussion</title><p>The failure of some individuals to generate or detect adequate signals to stop eating has frequently been reported in clinical contexts. The current research aimed to determine the reliability of the low satiety phenotype and the consistency of the SQ under different energy loads, and secondly to examine a behavioural, psychological and physiological risk profile for overeating in normal and overweight women systematically identified as being low or high in satiety responsiveness. The current study found that a low SQ was associated with a higher resting metabolic rate, a greater implicit wanting for high fat foods and higher scores on the TFEQ Disinhibition subscale. Using the SQ as a categorical variable, the findings of the current study indicated that it is possible to identify women who reliably experience weak or strong satiating efficiency under controlled laboratory conditions. The current study did not find that low satiety responsiveness was associated with a higher BMI. It may be that weakened satiety responsiveness becomes more important for weight gain later in life, something that should be investigated in future research. It is important to note that out of the thirty participants who completed the study, twelve could not be reliably categorised suggesting that it may be beneficial for future research to identify the low satiety phenotype based on more than one assessment of satiety responsiveness. When these twelve individuals were included in the analysis they were not statistically distinguishable from the low or high satiety phenotypes but responded in a manner more similar to that of the high rather than the low satiety phenotype. Therefore, it appears that women who exhibit consistently low satiety responsiveness are of particular interest for further investigation as a group at increased risk of overeating and potential future weight gain.</p><p>Specifically, we found that the low satiety phenotype had greater TFEQ disinhibition scores compared to the high satiety phenotype. Disinhibition reflects the tendency to eat opportunistically [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and greater levels of disinhibition have been consistently associated with increased <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and increased propensity for weight gain [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition and consistent with our findings, several studies have found that disinhibition is associated with weak satiety responsiveness [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, Finlayson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated that higher levels of disinhibition were associated with lower satiating efficiency of sweet and savoury preloads.</p><p>Further to this, we demonstrated that the low satiety phenotype consumed significantly more energy in the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch test meal. This finding is consistent with previous research that has shown a low SQ in response to a standardised test meal is negatively associated with energy intake under laboratory and free-living conditions [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A possible explanation for this higher energy intake may be that the low satiety phenotype also had a higher resting metabolic rate (and a higher fat free mass, the largest contributor to resting metabolic rate) compared to the high satiety phenotype. The notion of energy expenditure as a metabolic driver of energy intake while not a new concept in the study of energy balance and appetite control [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has recently been reconsidered with the suggestion that resting metabolic rate may be a functionally relevant biological signal for energy need and therefore act as a regulator of appetite control and food intake [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the greater resting metabolic rate observed in the low satiety phenotype may reflect a greater biologically based drive to eat. However, it is important to note that the four fixed energy breakfasts were calibrated individually for each subject based on their own measured energy requirements. Therefore, the weak satiety response to the breakfast meals exhibited by the low satiety phenotype was not simply a function of their relative energy needs not being accounted for.</p><p>Despite this increase in energy intake we did not find that the low satiety phenotype reported greater levels of hunger, desire to eat, prospective consumption or lower levels of fullness across the test day. Interestingly, however we found that the low satiety phenotype consistently reported lower levels of fasting hunger, desire to eat and prospective consumption. All subjects in the current study were regular breakfast consumers and based on the findings from energy intake it may be anticipated that the low satiety phenotype would have higher levels of baseline hunger, desire to eat and prospective consumption. It may be that following a period of fasting the low satiety phenotype are relatively poor at detecting their true appetite sensations, which is consistent with the findings of Barkeling <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, it is important to note that habitual breakfast consumption was not assessed so it is not possible to discern whether the low satiety phenotype were habitually small breakfast consumers which may account for the lower level of fasting hunger.</p><p>To measure hedonic risk factors for overeating in the low satiety phenotype, we examined liking and wanting appeal bias for high fat <italic>versus</italic> low fat foods. We found that compared to the high satiety phenotype, the low satiety phenotype consistently exhibited a greater wanting appeal bias for high-fat foods (<italic>i.e.</italic>, they chose high-fat foods more frequently and faster than they chose low-fat foods) across all conditions. Previous research has shown that increased wanting for high-fat food is associated with greater compensatory eating behaviours following exercise, greater binge eating tendencies, and greater overall energy intake [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, the high satiety phenotype had a greater appeal bias for low-fat foods, a preference that may be protective against creating a positive energy balance. Indeed, research has demonstrated that a greater preference for low-fat foods is negatively associated with energy intake under laboratory and free-living conditions (assessed using 24-h dietary recall) [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, the low satiety phenotype reported experiencing lower control over their cravings over the previous seven days. The tendency to experience greater food cravings has been associated with greater BMI [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These findings are the first to suggest that the low satiety phenotype may be characterised by hedonic risk factors for overconsumption.</p><p>Although the present study carried a number of strengths there are some limitations to consider. The repeated characterisation of the low and high satiety phenotypes, while a strength of the current study, resulted in the sample size to be small and therefore the novel findings of the current study stand to be replicated in a larger sample. However, it is important to note that the findings of the current study were very consistent with that of previous work and the effect sizes reported were medium to large which supports the strength of the findings. One methodological limitation of the present study was the energy density of the food items provided in the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch. The energy density of some of the food items provided was quite high (~1.4&#x02013;2 kcal/g), which resulted in unusually high <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch intakes.</p><p>The energy density of the meal provided is an important consideration for future research. As the current study only examined satiety responsiveness in female subjects the findings may not be generalisable to males. In addition, the cross sectional nature of the current study makes it difficult to infer the specific causes behind the low satiety phenotype. For instance, it is not known whether eating behaviour traits such as Disinhibition lead to weakened satiety, or whether weak satiety signaling leads to altered eating behaviour traits like more opportunistic eating such as snacking. While participants were asked to not engage in physical activity for 24-h prior to each experimental session, participants&#x02019; habitual physical activity levels were not assessed and so it is not known whether the low satiety phenotype were more or less physically active than the high satiety phenotype. If the low satiety phenotype expend more or less energy in structure and non-structured physical activity this may have an impact on the degree of satiety achieved from a given meal size. This limitation should be addressed in future work. The current study identified the low satiety phenotype based on the response to four fixed energy breakfasts that differed in their energy load, energy density (the higher RMR conditions were more energy dense) and macronutrient content (the 25%, 30% and 35% RMR breakfasts would have had a higher fat and protein content because of the greater almond content). This could be improved upon by holding the macronutrient content of the fixed energy breakfast constant. While it is beyond the scope of the current paper, future work could manipulate macronutrient composition to examine whether the low satiety phenotype exhibit a weakened satiety response to meals that have been designed to have a high satiating impact such as those high protein or low in fat (see [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]), which may present as an effective nutritional strategy for such individuals. Finally, while previous research has reported that the low satiety phenotype are characterised by an attenuated cortisol response to a test meal [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05345" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], future work should explore the possibility of further potential biomarkers that may underlie the low satiety phenotype&#x02019;s weakened satiety response.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-07-05345"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, the current study repeatedly identified individuals as high or low in satiety responsiveness and examined their behavioural, psychological and physiological risk profile for overeating and obesity. It was confirmed that the SQ could be used to identify a proportion of individuals who exhibited reliably weak satiating efficiency, and that these individuals display traits and preferences that would increase their susceptibility to overeating and future weight gain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Michelle Dalton was supported by the EU FP7 project &#x0201c;Satin&#x0201d; (Grant agreement number 289800 KBBE.2011.2.3-04) and Sophie Hollingworth was supported by the Almond Board of California.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Michelle Dalton, John Blundell, and Graham Finlayson, designed the study.
