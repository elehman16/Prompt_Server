However, the administration of even a single dose has been associated with hyperglycemia. This is the first study that evaluates the effect of two low-doses of dexamethasone (4 and 8 mg) on blood glucose concentrations among diabetics and nondiabetics in patients who have received spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>After obtaining ethical clearance and patient consent, 180 American Society of Anesthesiologists 1&#x02013;3 patients undergoing the elective infraumbilical surgeries under spinal anesthesia aged between 18 and 70 years were included in this study. Ninety diabetic patients were allotted to the diabetic group (DM), and ninety nondiabetic patients were allotted to the nondiabetic group (ND). Group DM was divided into three subgroups DM0, DM4, and DM8. Group ND was divided into three subgroups ND0, ND4, and ND8. The patients in groups DM0 and ND0 served as controls. The patients in groups DM4 and ND4 received 4 mg dexamethasone. The patients in groups DM8 and ND8 received 8 mg dexamethasone. The blood glucose concentrations were monitored at 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 h after giving the drug.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The baseline blood glucose values were higher in diabetics compared to nondiabetics (128.57 &#x000b1; 22.26 vs 94.99 &#x000b1; 12.82 mg/dL).

Buprenorphine offers the advantage of providing good analgesia while allowing early ambulation of the patient by sparing sympathetic and motor nerves.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The use of buprenorphine has been associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting the incidence of which has been found to be as high as 34%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. It has been found to have additional analgesic and antiemetic action which is useful anesthetic practice. The Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) recommends a prophylactic dose of 4&#x02013;5 mg for patients at high-risk of PONV regardless of the surgical procedure.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] For PONV prophylaxis, dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous (IV) has been found to be as efficacious as ondansetron 4 mg IV and droperidol 1.25 mg IV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] There are some recent studies that have found that a dose of dexamethasone 8 mg IV rather than a dose of 4 mg is more beneficial for PONV prophylaxis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Preoperative dexamethasone 8 mg has been found to have additional benefits like it improves the postdischarge quality of recovery in addition to reducing nausea, pain, and fatigue.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>A single-dose of dexamethasone is however known to increase the blood glucose levels in the perioperative period. Hyperglycemia in the perioperative period can cause dehydration, fluid shifts, electrolyte abnormalities, predisposition to infection, impaired wound healing, ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar states. Hence, although dexamethasone is proven effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of PONV, clinicians have some reluctance to use it due to the fear of hyperglycemia. The literature with respect to the use of dexamethasone in diabetic patients is limited.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>This is the first study that looks into the blood glucose variations in the first 8 h after administration of dexamethasone in diabetics and nondiabetics undergoing surgeries under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 180 patients of either sex undergoing elective lower extremity and infraumbilical surgeries. The patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade 1&#x02013;3 aged between 18 and 70 years were included in the study. Patients who had recent parenteral or oral steroid therapy or those who had received a dose of steroid within last 48 h, allergy to dexamethasone, and intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia were excluded from the study. The patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected by random number table during the study from the operation theater register on a daily basis. Institutional ethical clearance was obtained, and the study was registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India with registration number CTRI/2017/03/008150. After obtaining a written informed consent, ninety type 2 diabetes patients were allotted to the diabetic group (DM) and ninety nondiabetic patients to the nondiabetic group (ND). Further, patients in each group were allotted into one of the three subgroups of thirty each by a sealed envelope, the subgroups being DM 0, DM 4, and DM 8 in the DM group and ND 0, ND 4, and ND 8, in ND group. The patients in groups DM 0 and ND 0 were the control groups that received 5 ml normal saline. The patients in groups DM 4 and ND 4 received 4 mg dexamethasone. The patients in groups DM 8 and ND 8 received 8 mg dexamethasone.</p><p>All the patients received oral pantoprazole 40 mg as premedication on the night before and on the day of the surgery. Perioperative monitoring included electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximetry. An 18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted, and normal saline infusion was instituted. Midazolam 1 mg was administered following placement of IV line. The test drugs were diluted with normal saline to achieve a volume of 5 ml and were administered over 30 s intravenously immediately before performing spinal anesthesia. An independent investigator prepared and administered the study drugs. Patients, anesthesiologists involved in intraoperative care, and investigators collecting postoperative data were blinded to patient group allocation.</p><p>A standardized anesthetic technique was followed. Spinal anesthesia was administered in the sitting position. Using an aseptic technique, a 25-gauge Quincke needle was inserted through a midline approach into the L2&#x02013;L3 or L3&#x02013;L4 interspace. Anesthesia was established with a single bolus of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 15 mg and buprenorphine 60 mcg. The level of sensory blockade was assessed regularly by the level of touch sensation before surgical incision (T6&#x02013;T8 was considered adequate). Additional midazolam 1&#x02013;2 mg IV was administered for intraoperative sedation on attending anesthesiologist's discretion. Supplemental oxygen 5 L/min through a face mask was administered during the surgery. Estimated fluid requirement and maintenance fluid were replaced with Ringer's lactate or 0.9% normal saline. A standard postoperative analgesic regimen of paracetamol 1 g IV infusion 6<sup>th</sup> hourly and tramadol 50 mg IM as required was prescribed for postoperative pain relief.</p><p>Finger-prick capillary blood glucose was measured immediately before dexamethasone administration (T0) and at 60 (T1), 120 (T2), 180 (T3), 240 (T4), 300 (T5), 360 (T6), and 480 (T8) min thereafter using a glucometer. Glucose level measurements were made by a finger-prick capillary blood sample using an Accu-Chek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Active (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) glucometer that was calibrated daily. Postoperatively, patients were administered dextrose-free IV fluids at 2 ml/kg/h till the study ended 8 h after dexamethasone administration. No dextrose-containing solution was administrated during the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Based on the previous study, it was found that the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) change from preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration was 63 &#x000b1; 66 mg/dL in diabetics and 86 &#x000b1; 41 mg/dL in nondiabetics.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study, expecting mean glucose change as 23 mg/dl between the two groups with an effect size of 0.4 and an alpha error of 5% with power of 80% the sample size was estimated to be ninety in DM and ninety in ND.</p><p>Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis has been carried out in the study.

The patient demographic data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. In the DM group there were older patients, with a greater body weight, more comorbid diseases, and with higher preoperative blood glucose concentrations which were statistically significant. This was expected as majority of diabetic patients are older, overweight, and have multiple comorbidities. The duration of surgery was similar in both the groups. Throughout the study period, blood glucose was significantly higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients. All patients in the study who received dexamethasone had significantly higher blood glucose levels subsequently [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>]. The nondiabetic patients who received 8 mg of dexamethasone had significantly earlier rise of blood glucose levels (at T3) compared to placebo, and blood glucose was higher than those who received 4 mg after 6 h [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Although there was a significant rise in blood glucose in the diabetic patients who received both doses of dexamethasone compared to placebo, the DM8 group did not have higher blood glucose values than DM4 group during the study.

The magnitude of increase was not very different between the diabetic and the nondiabetic patients.</p><p>Hans <italic>et al</italic>. in their study analyzed blood glucose levels in the first 6 h postoperatively in nondiabetics, and patients with type 2 diabetes receiving IV dexamethasone 10 mg for PONV prophylaxis, they found that blood glucose concentration profile although parallel, was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic than in nondiabetic patients and peaked 120 min after injection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, their study did not have a control group that did not receive dexamethasone, to differentiate if the hyperglycemic response was secondary to the administration of dexamethasone or to the surgical stress response. In our study, we found that the hyperglycemic response in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients who did not receive dexamethasone was in the range of 10&#x02013;15 mg/dl. However, patients who received dexamethasone had significant rise in blood glucose in the range of 40&#x02013;43 mg/dl which peaked between 4 and 6 h postdexamethasone administration. These findings are similar to that of Nazar <italic>et al</italic>. where thirty obese patients who received 8 mg dexamethasone had higher maximum blood glucose concentrations (187 mg/dl) compared with controls (158 mg/dL).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, a drawback of that study is that they have infused glucose-containing IV fluids during the study.</p><p>There have only been a few studies that investigated the hyperglycemic effects of dexamethasone in the postoperative period in patients with type 2 diabetes, in all the studies general anesthesia has been used.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Ours is the only study where spinal anesthesia has been used to study the hyperglycemic response to dexamethasone. Spinal anesthesia has been proved to be more effective than general anesthesia in suppressing stress and glycemic response in elective surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The addition of buprenorphine has been found to prolong the duration of spinal analgesia to 7.44 &#x000b1; 1.69 h.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The control groups in our study had a blunted hyperglycemic response during the study, but the groups that received dexamethasone had a significant hyperglycemic response.</p><p>Similar to our findings, Nazar <italic>et al</italic>. in another study demonstrated that diabetic patients did not show higher susceptibility than nondiabetics to develop postoperative hyperglycemia after the use of prophylactic dexamethasone 8 mg for PONV.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Contrary to our study where both groups had a hyperglycemic response, the findings of another study found that there was no dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemic effect for diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients showed a greater increase in blood glucose level.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Low <italic>et al</italic>. in a retrospective database study found that dexamethasone 8&#x02013;10 mg was associated with a significantly greater perioperative increase in blood glucose compared with a 4 mg dose.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Tien <italic>et al</italic>. showed that PONV prophylaxis with IV dexamethasone (8 mg) significantly increases postoperative blood glucose values compared with ondansetron (4 mg).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This effect was comparable between nondiabetic and diabetic patients, regardless of baseline blood glucose levels. Our study also had similar findings where 4 and 8 mg of dexamethasone increased the blood glucose levels in both diabetics and nondiabetics. Nondiabetics who received 8 mg of dexamethasone had significantly higher rise in blood glucose levels compared to diabetics who received the same dose at 8 h.</p><p>Our study has a few limitations the diabetic patients were older and had more comorbidities, and we have not selected the matched controls. Second, the blood glucose measurements were performed using a portable point-of-care glucometer. Third, we have monitored blood glucose levels for first 8 h, and after this, any increase in blood glucose levels might have been missed. Furthermore, patients undergoing different types of surgery were included, and postoperative stress response may be varied following different types of surgery. In our study, 8 mg of dexamethasone caused a greater magnitude of hyperglycemic response in nondiabetics when compared with diabetics. The reason for this cannot be explained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>That PONV prophylaxis with IV dexamethasone 4 or 8 mg significantly increases blood glucose values compared to placebo. Dexamethasone 8 mg causes a greater hyperglycemic response in nondiabetics compared to diabetic patients at 8 h postadministration.

However, the maximum rise in blood glucose was in the range of 40&#x02013;43 mg/dl in patients who received dexamethasone 4/8 mg, and the clinician should use his clinical judgment before
