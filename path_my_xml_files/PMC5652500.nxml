</p><p>Ear and hearing problems can cause life-long difficulties. They may have profound effect on the ability of individuals to communicate with others, on their education and on their ability to obtain and keep employment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, hearing loss also impacts negatively on social relationships and may lead to stigmatisation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Consequently, ear and hearing problems are likely to produce substantial economic burdens on individuals, communities and countries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>The high prevalence of ear diseases and hearing loss in sub-Saharan Africa is at least partly due to the severe shortage of health workers including audiologists and of resources for hearing aid provision, support and aural rehabilitation programmes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Educating community health workers (CHWs) about ear disease and hearing loss can help to fill these gaps in settings with a scarcity of specialist health workers. CHWs are members of the communities where they work, selected by the communities, answerable to the communities for their activities and have shorter training than specialist health workers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>The role of CHWs may be particularly important in controlling ear and hearing problems. Effective interventions against ear and hearing problems include ear wax removal, treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media and provision of hearing aids. These interventions can be implemented at the primary level by trained CHWs and have the potential for a major impact on the burden of ear disease and hearing loss when used on a&#x000a0;large scale.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> However, most low-income and middle-income countries do not have CHWs trained in primary ear and hearing care (PEHC).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Malawi is a setting where CHWs can potentially make an important contribution to controlling ear and hearing problems. There are only 2 ear, nose and throat&#x000a0;(ENT) surgeons for a population of &#x0003e;17&#x02009;million, and only 25 ENT clinical officers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Data are limited, but a study among children showed a high prevalence of hearing loss, with an estimated 1800 children per million population with hearing impairment from avoidable causes that could be treated through provision of basic primary-level ear and hearing care, in particular wax and middle ear disease.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of training CHWs to provide primary-level ear and hearing care, including: identification of patients with ear and hearing disorders, referral of patients to services and treatment of simple ear conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval was provided by the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee in Malawi.

Thyolo is a tea-growing district with a population of approximately 460 000, mainly Lomwe people. It is situated about 30&#x02009;km away from Blantyre, where the only dedicated ENT Unit in Malawi is located. The district hospital is one of eight district hospitals which has an ENT clinical officer, who has been working in Thyolo for 2&#x02009;years. Within this district there are 33 health centres. Each health centre is supported by about 10 CHWs and serves a catchment area of approximately 14 000 people.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Subjects</title><p>CHWs were selected among Malawian Health Surveillance Assistants, which is the formal cadre of CHWs in Malawi. These form a cadre of 10&#x02009;500 frontline health workers employed by the Ministry of Health and comprise 30% of the health workforce in Malawi.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Each health surveillance assistant in Malawi is assigned to a catchment area of approximately 1000 inhabitants and its associated health facility, covering a radius of 8 km except in district-defined hard-to-reach catchment areas. They track pregnancies, births and deaths using their village health registers, conduct health talks and vaccinations. Each receives 12 weeks of training and has important roles in providing care, promoting community participation in healthcare activities and in promoting disease surveillance services at the community level. Prior to this study, they had not received any training in PEHC.</p><p>A list of all the 33 health centres together with all the names of the CHWs in Thyolo district was compiled with the help of the District Health Environmental Office in Thyolo district. Using a random number generator, we selected 10 health centres for inclusion in the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>); we then randomly allocated 5 health centres to the intervention group and 5 health centres to the control group. Using the random number generator, we selected 6 CHWs (out of approximately 10 CHWs) per&#x000a0;health centre. Consequently, a total of 30 intervention CHWs and 30 control CHWs were selected.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016457f01"/></fig><sec id="s4a"><title>Consent and pretest</title><p>The selected CHWs were called up for a briefing at a central location, with intervention and control groups meeting separately. They were briefed on the study and written consent was taken from them to be part of the study after they had received details of what participation involved. Data collected from the CHWs included age, sex and years of formal education. They were administered a pretest questionnaire containing the questions from the first six modules of the intermediate-level WHO Primary Ear and Hearing Care Trainer&#x02019;s Manual (10 questions per module).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The participants in the control group were assured of the training after 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Training for intervention group</title><p>The training lasted 3&#x02009;days and was undertaken by an ENT surgeon and two ENT clinical officers. The two ENT clinical officers each had 18 months of training in ENT and had participated in a PEHC course. A training curriculum and manual was developed in English by local experts (one audiologist, three audiological officers, three ENT clinical officers and one ENT surgeon). The training manual was based on both the Basic and Intermediate Manual of WHO Primary Ear and Hearing Care Training Resources.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p><p>The first part of the training focused on knowledge about ear and hearing disorders. Training emphasised the structure and function of the ear, causes of hearing impairment and their management and levels of hearing impairment. Next, the training focused on skills training, including: (1) history taking in patient with ear and hearing disorders, (2) ear examination, (3) steps in doing otoscopy, (4) steps in doing voice tests&#x000a0;and (5) assessment of hearing in children. Training methods included lectures, posters of ear and hearing disorders, flip charts, demonstrations, practical of voice tests, discussion and group work. Training was done both in English and Chichewa&#x000a0;(national language of Malawi). At the end of the training, each CHW was given a training manual that contained the key points of training and which could be referred to when needed. They were also given Arclight otoscopes (WJW Ltd, Liverpool, UK), to allow ear examination.</p><p>The participants were given a posttest questionnaire on the third day of training, using the same questionnaire as in pretest. The participants were also asked how their opinions about the length of training and whether or not they felt comfortable in identifying people with ear and hearing disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Mobilisation of patients by community health workers</title><p>After training, each CHW in the intervention group was given 1&#x02009;month to identify, list and refer patients with suspected ear and hearing disorders from their own village to their corresponding health centre. First, the CHW met with the village headman, village development committee members and village health committee members to explain in detail about the programme. Next, the CHW met with the community members to explain about the programme and to schedule dates for screening of the community members. CHWs were asked to use multiple methods in their identification (door to door, school screenings, health education&#x000a0;and church/mosque announcements). CHWs took history, did otoscopy and voice tests as a way of identifying community members with ear and hearing disorders. CHWs created a list of patients they suspected of having ear and hearing disorders in their community.</p><p>Identified patients with suspected ear disorder or hearing loss were asked to come to the scheduled screening camps, which took place at the five health centres of Bvumbwe, Chimaliro, Chisoka, Changata and Gombe.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Screening camps</title><p>The listed patients were asked to come to the health centre in their catchment area together with their CHW. A team of six people (1 ENT surgeon, 1 ENT clinical officer, 2&#x000a0;Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) audiological officers and 2 research assistants) from the ENT Department at QECH in Blantyre travelled to all the five health centres in Thyolo to conduct the screening camps.</p><p>All patients underwent otoscopy, pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and tympanometry performed by one of two audiological officers.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Otoscopy was performed on all patients using the Heine Mini 2000 (HEINE Optotechnik, Herrsching, Germany).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Audiometry was performed in all patients aged&#x000a0;&#x0003e;4 years who were able to cooperate in a quiet room using the KUDUwave 5000 audiometer (eMoyoDotnet (Pty) Ltd, Randburg, South Africa). Thresholds were obtained at frequencies of. 5, 1, 2 and 4&#x02009;kHz according to WHO recommendations. Pure tone average (PTA) was calculated based on these four frequencies.

There were a total of 17 CHWs (9 women and 8 men) who participated in the three FGDs, each including 5&#x02013;6 participants. The female research assistant was not involved in quantitative data collection or analysis to reduce the possibility of bias. We conducted the FGDs using semistructured interview guide. The guided discussions asked CHWs about their impressions on training, and challenges faced when identifying people with ear and hearing disorders. Each FGDs took approximately 45&#x02009;min.

The trained CHW demonstrated their ability to identify patients with ear and hearing disorders, both through outreach and as part of routine practice. They identified 1739 people with potential ear or hearing disorders of whom 860 attended a screening, and almost half (400) had significant hearing loss and a further 115 had unilateral hearing loss. There was little change, however, in the patients with ear and hearing disorders recorded at the health centres after the intervention. The trainees perceived that the intervention was feasible and acceptable. Although the number of CHWs who were trained per health centre was small, these positive findings are encouraging as it can be scaled up. Furthermore, the training was relatively cheap ($189 per CHW trained) and well received by the participants.</p><p>Successful integration of ear and hearing care into primary healthcare requires resources, to raise awareness, train CHWs and provide equipment and medications at the health centre. Important lessons can also be learnt from the study and the existing literature in considering whether and how to scale up the primary ear and hearing training.</p><sec id="s10a"><title>Were CHW the appropriate target for training?</title><p>This study showed that trained CHWs proved to be a valuable resource in mobilising patients with ear and hearing disorders. This is in contrast to what Kalua <italic>et al</italic> showed that other community key informants (eg, village volunteers) were much better at identifying blind children than CHWs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In that study, CHWs reported lack of time as a major constraint in identifying blind children, and it is well known that CHWs are often overloaded with many competing tasks. Although, we did not compare with other cadres of community like village volunteers, we found that the number of patients with potential hearing loss identified by CHWs were still large.</p></sec><sec id="s10b"><title>Was the content of the training appropriate?</title><p>There was an improvement in the knowledge of ear and hearing disorders among CHWs overall showing that the training was appropriate. However, there was no improvement in knowledge about the middle ear or assessing hearing and counselling. Further improvement of these modules is needed to ensure that the material is at the right level for CHWs. About 22% of the patients examined at the screening camps did not have an ear and hearing disorder. We consider this to be a relatively low false-positive rate showing that the CHWs were reasonably competent at identifying people with hearing loss. There is still room for improvement, however, and a further emphasis on future training should focus on normal ear anatomy and more practical sessions on normal ears. The CHWs were trained in otoscopy, but their practical skills were not assessed. The primary aim was to enable them to identify common pathologies like wax and discharge. However, in a possible higher level course in the future, it would be a good idea to test both manual and diagnostic skills.</p></sec><sec id="s10c"><title>Was the length of training sufficient?</title><p>Most of the CHWs were happy with the length of the training while few would like it to have been extended. The cost of training of our training was an average of $189 per health worker. Kyabayinze <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> in Uganda showed that the average cost per health worker of the 1-day training was $101 (range $92&#x02013;112) with the main cost drivers being trainee travel and per diems.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> One of the ways of reducing the cost of training is to reduce the length of the training, which would require further testing. In mental health and blindness, they have successfully conducted 1-day training sessions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, reducing the length of training was against the expressed wishes of the CHWs.</p></sec><sec id="s10d"><title>Were the CHW able to identify people with ear and hearing disorders?</title><p>CHWs were able to identify people with ear and hearing disorders both within the community and in the clinics. However, the accuracy of diagnosis made by CHWs compared with that of ENT specialist was not measured, which is a limitation.</p><p>Although the CHWs were able to identify about 1739 patients, only 860 patients appeared for screening. The major reason given for non-attendance was that most clients went to receive free fertiliser coupons. Other barriers in ear and hearing care need to be explored in more detail and could include difficulties in accessing care, limited engagement of communities and inadequate support from health systems.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic> reported that of the 84 trained village health workers in primary eye care, only 13 (15%) brought patients to the health centres and the main reason suggested for the difference was lack of motivation among village health workers.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>Resources may be required to pay for transport reimbursements for patients to travel from their villages to the health centre as there is clearly a large unmet need for services among people in the communities.</p></sec><sec id="s10e"><title>Were the CHWs appropriately equipped?</title><p>Equipping CHWs with a tool like an Arclight otoscopes may have improved the diagnostic accuracy especially for impacted wax and chronic suppurative otitis media.</p><p>There is need to do more research on the provision of diagnostic and therapeutic PEHC services by CHWs and general health workers at frontline health facilities. With the advent of a lot of software applications for audiometry,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> there is need to look at the feasibility of equipping the CHWs with the tool. Furthermore, research is needed as to which therapeutic approaches are appropriate at the&#x000a0;primary level. For instance, primary healthcare workers are often taught to do dry mopping for wet perforations. Among our patients with wet perforations, a number of them had dead house flies in the ears which may have been difficult to remove with dry mopping alone. Evidence is also needed as to whether or not ear syringing may be useful for these sort of conditions.</p><p>In summary, in line with the Malawi Government guidelines on task shifting to CHWs,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the following tasks in ear and hearing care are recommended for CHWs. There are (1)&#x000a0;information, education and communication on ear and hearing disorders; (2) identification of cases for referral, (3) follow-up of cases for treatment adherence; (4) support and counselling of families on ear and hearing disorders. All these tasks are based on the assumption that the CHWs have been trained in ear and hearing care and that equipment like otoscopes are made available to them.</p><p>There are important strengths to the study. It used a structured framework to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to train CHW in PEHC. The training and screening camps were led by an ENT surgeon, and drew on tools prepared by the WHO. There are also limitations to consider. It was not possible to explore in detail why people did not attend at the screening camp. We only conducted FGDs with CHWs. In-depth interviews with people who did not attend the screening camps could have provided more information. Furthermore, the impact of training CHW in PEHC on their routine clinical activities was not fully evaluated, nor the impact on the number of diagnoses and referrals made of ear and hearing disorders at the primary care level on reducing the burden at the secondary and tertiary levels. We are aware that roles and responsibilities of CHWs is different in different countries. Therefore generalisation of these findings to other settings must be done with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s10f" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The training was effective in improving the knowledge of CHW in ear and hearing care in Malawi and allowing them to identify people in the community requiring ENT services. Based on the success of this study, training of CHWs and their identification of patients with ear and hearing disorders could be scaled up in Malawi and tested in other low-income and middle-income countries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e183" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016457.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e184" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016457.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>None</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> WM, HK and FKG: designed the study.
