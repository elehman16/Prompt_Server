Our objective was to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive

One participant was lost to follow-up and one withdrew consent.
Complete data were obtained for 98% of eligible patients at two
weeks, 83% at six months, and 73% at one year (the remainder with
partial data or pending queries). In total, 18 participants missed
at least one dose of antibiotics or placebo post-operatively, but

with lower extremity bone sarcomas is limb salvage surgery, which
typically involves tumour resection, followed by functional limb
reconstruction with modular metallic and polyethylene endoprosthetic
implants.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Owing to the complexity
and length of these procedures, as well as the immunocompromised
nature of patients treated with chemotherapy, the risk for post-operative surgical
site infection (SSI) is high.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Post-operative endoprosthetic SSIs often require staged revision
surgery and long-term intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Even
following this management, repeat infection and ultimate amputation
are common.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Patient
function and quality of life can be dramatically impacted, as can
healthcare costs owing to extended hospital stays and multiple re-operations.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The most effective post-operative
regimen of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent SSIs following endoprosthetic
reconstruction for lower extremity bone tumours is unknown, and
current practice among orthopaedic oncological surgeons is highly
varied.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Bone sarcomas are rare forms of cancer, and clinical studies
of patients with bone sarcomas have been challenged by insufficient
numbers at individual centres to draw valid conclusions.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Sarcomas represent
&#x0003c; 1% of all malignancies, and bone sarcomas affect just four
to five patients per million persons each year.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> High-quality collaborative
research that can guide clinical practice for patients with bone
sarcomas has lagged behind other orthopaedic surgery subspecialties,
and there have been no multi-centre randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) previously conducted in the field of orthopaedic oncological surgery.</p><p>Our earlier work has demonstrated high rates of SSI following
the treatment of long bone tumours by surgical excision and endoprosthetic
reconstruction;<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> highly
varied opinion and practice among orthopaedic oncologists regarding
prophylactic antibiotic regimens;<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> an
absence of applicable RCT evidence;<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and
extensive support from investigators for a definitive RCT to evaluate
a five-day regimen of post-operative antibiotics in comparison with
a 24-hour regimen of post-operative antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In this pilot study, our primary objective was to assess the
feasibility of conducting a definitive multi-centre RCT to determine
whether a five-day regimen of post-operative antibiotics, in comparison
with a 24-hour regimen of post-operative antibiotics, decreases
the rate of SSI within one year in patients undergoing endoprosthetic
reconstruction for lower extremity primary bone tumours. Our secondary
objective was to determine the overall rate of SSI within one year
of follow-up in patients undergoing wide resection and endoprosthetic
reconstruction for lower extremity primary bone tumours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Study design and setting</title><p>We performed a pilot international multi-centre blinded parallel
two-arm RCT. Each participating site obtained local institutional
research ethics board approval and all patients provided informed consent.
This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01479283) and
is reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) statement and recommendations for pilot studies.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We have previously reported our
study protocol in further detail.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Participants/study subjects</title><p>We included patients who were 12 years of age or older and had
lower extremity primary bone malignancies, benign aggressive tumours,
or soft-tissue sarcomas which had invaded bone and required surgical
excision and endoprosthetic reconstruction. </p><p>We excluded patients if they had any of the following: </p><p>- Known methicillin-resistant<italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or vancomycin-resistant<italic> enterococcus</italic> skin
colonisation; </p><p>- Documented anaphylaxis or angioedema to cefazolin or penicillin; </p><p>- Prior surgery within the surgical field (excluding a biopsy); </p><p>- Prior local infection within the surgical field; </p><p>- Known immunologically-deficient conditions of disease such
as HIV (not including recent chemotherapy); </p><p>- Known renal insufficiency with estimated creatinine clearance
(eGRF) of &#x0003c; 54 mL/min; </p><p>- Reconstruction planned to include allograft (bone transplant); </p><p>- Likely problems, according to the judgment of the investigators,
with maintaining follow-up; </p><p>- Unable to provide consent. </p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Randomisation</title><p>An unblinded pharmacist at each site randomised participants
during surgery to either five days or 24 hours of post-operative
prophylactic cefazolin. We used a central internet-based computer-generated randomisation
system that concealed allocation. Our randomisation protocol included
randomly permuted blocks of two or four and was stratified by location
of tumour (femur <italic>vs</italic> tibia) and study centre.</p><p>The participants, surgeons, healthcare providers other than the
pharmacists, data collectors, outcome assessors, data analysts,
and those interpreting the results, were blinded to treatment allocation.
Sites that used pre-mixed antibiotic bags kept them shrouded as
there was a visible difference between pre-mixed bags and saline.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Interventions</title><p>Our protocol instructed that all participants would receive 2
g of IV cefazolin pre-operatively within 60 minutes of their procedures,
and 2 g of IV cefazolin every three to four hours intra-operatively.
Post-operatively, participants received either five days or 24 hours
of cefazolin according to their randomised treatment assignments:</p><p>- Participants in the five-day arm received 2 g of IV cefazolin
post-operatively every eight hours for five days. </p><p>- Participants in the 24-hour arm received 2 g of IV cefazolin
post-operatively every eight hours for 24 hours, followed by sham
doses of IV saline (placebo) for an additional four days.</p><p>- Paediatric participants received doses of cefazolin or sham
that were based on 100 mg/kg/day doses, but were otherwise identical
to the adult regimens. </p><p>Surgical excision and endoprosthetic reconstruction were performed
according to the standard practice of the participating surgeons,
which typically involved a wide extensile exposure, isolation and
protection of major neurovascular structures, and resection of the
segment of bone affected by tumour with a 2 cm to 3 cm bone margin.
Decisions about implant selection, surgical techniques, soft-tissue
reconstruction, or post-operative care other than antibiotic therapy,
were left at the discretion of the treating surgeons, but were recorded
in our Case Report Forms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>We followed participants at two and six weeks; three, six, and
nine months; and one year post-operatively. Trained research personnel
collected all data prospectively according to standardised procedures,
and the Case Report Forms were transmitted to a central Methods
Center using a secure electronic data capture system (iDataFax,
Clinical DataFax Systems Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Other
communication with individual sites was conducted via email, written
letters, telephone conversations, and meetings in person.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Outcome measures</title><p>In order to evaluate feasibility, we measured patient screening
and enrolment, completeness of follow-up at each time point, and
protocol deviations for the pre-, intra-, and post-operative antibiotic regimens.</p><p>The treating surgeons, study coordinators, and/or their delegates
at each site identified potentially eligible patients at presentation
and classified them as eligible and included, eligible but missed,
or excluded. Completeness of follow-up was calculated relative to
the number of patients eligible for follow-up at each time point. </p><p>We recorded protocol deviations whenever a pre-, intra-, or post-operative
dose was missed, given incorrectly, or supplemented with additional
non-study antibiotics. When patients were discharged before five
days after surgery, we discontinued their study treatments early,
recorded a protocol deviation for the missed doses, and no further
antibiotics were given.</p><p>We pre-specified our criteria for success of the pilot as enrolment
of our pilot sample within two years, 70% or greater protocol adherence,
and 95% or greater completeness to follow-up. </p><p>To evaluate SSI rates, the participating surgeons diagnosed superficial,
deep, or organ/space SSI according to the definition of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which specifies that at
least of one or the following criteria be met within one year after
surgery:<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>- Purulent drainage from the incision; </p><p>- Organisms isolated from an aseptically-obtained culture of
fluid or tissue from the incision; </p><p>- Incision deliberately opened by surgeon and culture positive;</p><p>- Incision deliberately opened by surgeon or designee and not
cultured, but<italic/>the patient has at least one of:
pain, tenderness, localised swelling, redness, or heat; </p><p>- Diagnosis of a superficial/deep/organ space incisional SSI
by surgeon. </p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Monitoring</title><p>Before the start of patient screening and enrolment at each site,
the Methods Center collected and reviewed the following documents:</p><p>- Site Principal Investigator&#x02019;s current Curriculum Vitae;</p><p>- Physician&#x02019;s Clinical Trial Application;</p><p>- Confirmation of ethics approval from the local institutional
ethics committee;</p><p>- Approved informed consent form(s);</p><p>- Site delegation and signature log;</p><p>- Qualified Investigator Undertaking Form, if applicable;</p><p>- Research Ethics Board Attestation Form, if applicable;</p><p>Thereafter, the Methods Center ensured that the Site Principal
Investigator, Research Coordinator, and Pharmacy Designee had received
appropriate study-specific training, which may have included review
of the training presentation during a teleconference call, independent review
of the training presentation by the site personnel, or attendance
at an Investigator/Coordinator meeting.</p><p>During the participant follow-up and clinical data collection
phase of the study, the Methods Center remotely conducted the following
ongoing monitoring activities:</p><p>- Review quality control reports from the iDataFax system to
identify sites with unacceptable amounts of missing data or unresolved
queries;</p><p>- Review enrolment reports to identify sites which have not been
submitting screening data;</p><p>- Review the tracking database to identify any inconsistencies
between the randomisation system and the submitted Case Report Forms
with respect to treatment allocation;</p><p>- Review site-specific reports on study completion and loss to follow-up;</p><p>- Conduct periodic reviews of the site regulatory binders for
missing and incomplete documentation;</p><p>- Review pharmacy logs.</p><p>After all subject follow-ups were completed at a clinical site,
the Methods Center conducted the following remote closeout monitoring
activities:</p><p>- Ensure that any missing data have been submitted (if available)
and that all remaining data queries have been resolved;</p><p>- Ensure that all required adjudication materials have been submitted;</p><p>- Review the site regulatory file for completion and request
any outstanding documentation;</p><p>- Review pharmacy logs;</p><p>- Request that the site close out the study with the local ethics
board and submit a copy of the confirmation from the ethics committee
to Chief Executive Officer for the site regulatory file</p><p>An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised
of three orthopaedic surgeons and a statistician monitored participant
safety. The DSMB reviewed adverse events and serious adverse events
data on a quarterly basis, met via teleconference at least once a
year, and was governed by a DSMB charter with terms of reference
and functions.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Statistical analysis and study size</title><p>Baseline characteristics, feasibility data, and SSI rates are
summarised as means with standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) or medians
with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and counts
(%) for categorical variables. All analyses were conducted centrally
at the Methods Center. Data analysis did not occur at any of the
participating sites.</p><p>We enrolled a convenience sample of 60 participants to evaluate
feasibility and we considered our pilot study completed when the
last enrolled participant had achieved at least three months of
follow-up. We estimated that 60 patients would represent approximately 5%
to 10% of the definitive RCT sample size (600 to 1200 patients),
based on a pairwise comparison with an alpha of 0.05, a beta of
0.20 (80% power), a relative risk reduction of 50%,<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and a range of plausible
SSI rates.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We planned <italic>a

United States, Australia, and Argentina between November 2012 and
October 2014. Of these, 60 were eligible and included, none were
eligible but missed, and 36 were excluded (Fig. 1). The number of participants
enrolled at each site in this period ranged from zero (six sites)
to 18 (one site), but the initiation of screening and enrolment
was staggered across the participating sites because of variability
in the time required to obtain ethics approval and negotiate institutional
contracts (Table I). In total, 20 of the sites reported having a dedicated
research nurse or research coordinator available to assist with
the conduct of the trial, and 14 reported prior institutional research
experience for clinical trials. Notwithstanding our inclusion and
exclusion criteria, the mean estimated number of endoprosthestic reconstructions
performed at each site per month was 1.8 (<sc>sd</sc> 1.7).</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participants in

is necessary in order to power surgical trials adequately in orthopaedic
oncology. There is no precedent for conducting large-scale surgical
trials in this field, however, and this pilot RCT represents the first
ever multi-centre RCT in sarcoma surgery.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Pilot studies are often essential
before embarking on large clinical trials because they can demonstrate
feasibility, help manage resources, and build a collaborative network.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In this study,
we established the feasibility of conducting a definitive large
multi-centre RCT by enrolling of our pilot sample within two years,
and demonstrating high protocol adherence with minimal losses to
follow-up.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Limitations</title><p>We required 24 months to enrol 60 patients across 21 sites from
four countries. After accounting for variability in the timing of
start-up at the clinical sites, our mean enrolment rate was 2.13
participants per site per year. Our screening data suggest that
every eligible patient was enrolled (no patients were missed), but
it is also possible that some eligible patients were not screened
at all. For example, the most common type of tumour in our study
was osteosarcoma, and the United States Cancer Statistics Working
Group reported nearly equivalent incidence rates of osteosarcoma
in men and women (5.0 per million <italic>vs</italic> 5.1 per million,
respectively),<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> however,
we enrolled more men than women in our study, which raises the possibility
of selection bias at the participating sites. Data from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results database, however, suggested higher
incidence of osteosarcoma in men (5.4 per million <italic>vs</italic> 4.0
per million, respectively).<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
</p><p>Nevertheless, the most likely factor leading to the imbalance
of male <italic>versus</italic> female participants is our small sample
size and the subsequent likelihood of chance alone leading to the
uneven gender distribution.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This factor
further highlights the critical importance of conducting large randomised
trials as they ensure a balance of both known and unknown prognostic
variables through the randomisation process.</p><p>Our recruitment data suggest that the most critical factor for
the success of our definitive trial will be further expansion of
our collaborative network. At the time of manuscript submission,
the PARITY network consisted of 66 sites: 28 sites are open to enrolment,
30 sites are in various stages of ethics review or contracts negotiation,
and eight further sites have expressed interest. With the addition
of these sites to the collaborative network, we anticipate that
the pace of enrolment will continue to accelerate. </p><p>The primary outcome for our definitive trial will be the rate
of SSIs in each arm within one year after surgery, an endpoint that
relies heavily on subjective clinical judgments.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although the surgeons
in our pilot were blinded, it is possible our pilot event rate could
be biased towards under reporting, given their involvement in the cases
or that there could have been variability in the way that the CDC
criteria were applied. In order to minimise bias and variability
in the definitive PARITY trial, the definitive trial will implement
a blinded Central Adjudication Committee in order to evaluate all
potential SSIs according to pre-defined criteria.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Feasibility</title><p>Sarcoma patients require intense oncological follow-up to monitor
for disease relapse, and we anticipated only minimal losses to follow-up
in our pilot sample, but we also implemented several procedures
in order to minimise losses.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Although
only 73% of the patients eligible for one-year follow-up had complete
data available, we consider that our data support feasibility because
there were only three patients with outstanding queries at 12 months,
and a further 17% of eligible patients had at least partial data
available. Given that some of the pilot patients are still within
their one-year follow-up period, we expect to resolve most or all
of these outstanding queries and missing data. Only one patient was
lost to follow-up, although one additional patient withdrew consent
on the first day after surgery. With respect to data quality in
relation to participating site characteristics, we believe that
in the pilot phase of this trial there was a learning curve for
all sites, and reporting of data quality by site at this stage would
be premature. </p><p>More than half of the participants experienced minor protocol
deviations related to their peri-operative antibiotics, but the
importance of these deviations to the validity and feasibility of
a definitive trial is doubtful. Ten participants did not receive
the correct regimens of pre- and intra-operative antibiotics, but
it is implausible that these errors could introduce systematic bias,
because allocation was concealed. Three participants received additional
antibiotics pre-operatively according to local institutional protocols,
but stratification should randomly distribute these deviations evenly
between groups. Trials with protocol deviations can be considered
within a &#x02018;mechanistic-practical&#x02019; framework of design and interpretation,
whereby mechanistic<italic/>trials address the impact of interventions
administered under ideal testing circumstances, and practical<italic/>trials
address the impact of interventions administered in &#x02018;real world&#x02019;
clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Given
that most of the protocol deviations in our study reflected typical
clinical practice, and that 93% of all post-operative doses were
administered per protocol, these protocol deviations are unlikely
to compromise the practical applicability of our results. </p><p>Furthermore, many previous trials in orthopaedic surgery have
not adequately reported protocol deviations.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, we reported according to
the CONSORT statement and recommendations for pilot studies in order
to improve the design and conduct of a subsequent large definitive
trial.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The
doses missed because of pharmacy, nursing, or randomisation errors
will be used as feedback to guide our future standard operating
procedures. </p><p>We coordinated an expert panel of six orthopaedic oncology surgeons
and three infectious disease specialists in preparation for this
study.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Based on our survey data, expert
opinion, and standard of care, we determined that the most appropriate
antibiotic for this study was cefazolin. Our choice of five days
as the long duration reflects consensus that an even longer duration would
increase the risk for resistant organisms without providing further
antimicrobial effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We
standardised the pre- and intra-operative antibiotic regimens in
order to limit differential co-interventions.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Rates of SSI</title><p>In total, 15% of the participants in this study experienced a
SSI. This rate exceeds the weighted mean of 9.5% identified in our
systematic review (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.1 to 11.0), but
this finding is not surprising, because most of the studies in our
systematic review were retrospective case series at risk for selection
bias or under reporting, owing to outcomes assessment bias. Prior
studies have also used widely varying diagnostic criteria, and only
two reported use of the CDC criteria.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>The minimum follow-up in this pilot was just three months, but
others have<italic/>reported a median interval from implantation
to infection of 8.5 months.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore,
it is possible that we could have detected an absolute risk of infection
higher than 15% if all patients were followed up to one year. To
the extent that this is true, a sample size calculation based on
our pilot data might conservatively over power our definitive PARITY
RCT, which would reduce the likelihood of reporting a spuriously
negative result. Our pilot data support the idea that minimal or
no adjustments to the definitive sample size calculation are required
for losses to follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, it is feasible to conduct a definitive multi-centre
RCT of post-operative antibiotic regimens in patients with bone
sarcomas, but further expansion of our collaborative network will
be critical for study completion. We have demonstrated an ability
to coordinate in multiple countries, enrol participants, maintain
protocol adherence, and minimise losses to follow-up. The overall
goal of PARITY is to provide high-quality evidence that can be used
in the development of clinical guidelines. This pilot study has established
a successful network and will support the rigorous design, organisation,
and execution of a definitive RCT.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="bjr-block"><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>ICMJE Conflict of Interest:</bold>None declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Acknowlegements:</bold></p><p>The PARITY Investigators - the following persons participated
