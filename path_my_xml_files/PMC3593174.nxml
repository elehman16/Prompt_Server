To become literate, children must develop the ability to decode print fluently and the skills to understand what they read; whereas decoding skills depend on phoneme awareness and letter knowledge, broader language skills are required for successful reading comprehension (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Catts, Fey, Zhang, &#x00026; Tomblin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Muter, Hulme, Snowling, &#x00026; Stevenson, 2004</xref>). Moreover, oral language is a developmental precursor of phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Burgess &#x00026; Lonigan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Carroll, Snowling, Hulme, &#x00026; Stevenson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Storch &#x00026; Whitehurst, 2002</xref>). A corollary of this is that children with language difficulties typically have difficulties with literacy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pennington &#x00026; Bishop, 2009</xref>, for review) and are at high risk of educational underachievement.</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence-based interventions for children with literacy difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Fletcher, Reid Lyon, Fuchs, &#x00026; Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Snowling &#x00026; Hulme, 2011</xref>; for reviews). These studies show that training in the alphabetic principle (letter-sound knowledge and phoneme awareness) combined with text reading are effective in improving word-level decoding difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hatcher, Hulme, &#x00026; Snowling, 2004</xref>). However, there is variability in response to intervention with poor response being associated with severe phonological impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nelson, Benner, &#x00026; Gonzalez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Torgesen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>) or broader oral language difficulties, including poor vocabulary skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Al Otaiba &#x00026; Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Duff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Vadasy, Sanders, &#x00026; Abbott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Whiteley, Smith, &#x00026; Connors, 2007</xref>). Relatively few studies have targeted reading comprehension, but vocabulary instruction is known to benefit struggling readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Elleman, Lindo, Morphy, &#x00026; Compton, 2009</xref>) and broader oral language intervention has been shown to be effective for &#x02018;poor comprehenders&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Clarke, Snowling, Truelove, &#x00026; Hulme, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Together the findings of these studies provide a rationale for interventions that promote oral language skills to build a secure foundation for literacy, but there is a dearth of evidence concerning their impact (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bernhardt &#x00026; Major, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hindson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nancollis, Lawrie, &#x00026; Dodd, 2005</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Munro, Lee, and Baker (2008)</xref> demonstrated improvements in phonological awareness, vocabulary and oral narrative following a hybrid language intervention targeting vocabulary knowledge and phonological awareness for 5-year-old children, but the lack of a control group limits the conclusions that can be drawn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Pollard-Durodola et al. (2011)</xref> randomly assigned 125 children to either receive shared book reading or practice as usual. Significant effects were found in favour of shared book reading, but these were restricted to experimental measures of vocabulary with no transfer to standardized measures, and there was no consideration of the impact of the intervention on literacy development.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bowyer-Crane et al. (2008)</xref> identified children at school entry with poorly developed spoken language skills and provided these children with either an oral language intervention focusing on vocabulary and narrative skills, or a phonology with reading intervention focusing on letter-sound knowledge, phonological awareness and book reading. As expected, the phonology with reading intervention produced improvements in word-level reading skills. In contrast, the oral language intervention produced improvements in vocabulary knowledge and expressive grammar.</p><p>Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bianco et al. (2010)</xref> who compared three training programmes; one targeting components of language comprehension (e.g. monitoring, inference making), another targeting language comprehension skills implicitly via storybook reading and a phonological awareness programme. The programme training explicit comprehension skills produced significant improvements in spoken language comprehension, but not in phonological awareness skills, whereas phonological awareness training significantly improved children&#x02019;s phonological skills, but not their comprehension. However, group allocation was not randomized, and no measure of transfer of gains to literacy development was included.</p><p>In summary, although it appears clear that language intervention can be implemented successfully with young children prior to, or at, school entry with positive results, the evidence-base for the effectiveness of oral language intervention starting in preschool is limited and the impact of such interventions on later literacy development remains unclear. The current study evaluated a 30-week language intervention programme delivered in the final term in Nursery school and the first two terms in Reception class. The intervention programme comprised activities targeting spoken language skills for the first 20 weeks, supplemented for the final 10 weeks with training in two critical components of the alphabetic principle, letter-sound knowledge and phoneme awareness. We predicted that children receiving the intervention programme would outperform an untreated control group on measures of language immediately after the intervention and there would be transfer to literacy skills, fostered by the work on phoneme awareness and letter-sound knowledge. We also followed the progress of a representative group of age-peers to compare progress of the intervention group against age norms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Following screening in 19 preschool settings to identify children with weak oral language skills, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in which children were allocated to either an oral language intervention or a waiting control group. Children allocated to the intervention group received support additional to &#x02018;mainstream&#x02019; activities in a 30-week oral language programme beginning in Nursery in the term prior to formal school entry (10 weeks) and continuing in the Reception classroom for 20 weeks [The early education system in England is divided into Nursery (ages 3&#x02013;4) and Primary school (ages 4&#x02013;11; Reception and Years 1&#x02013;6). The Early Years Foundation Stage (Nursery and Reception; with the Reception year being pre-Year 1) became part of the National Curriculum in 2002. By law, full-time education is compulsory for all children aged 5&#x02013;16 and children begin full-time primary education in England by attending a Reception class in the school year they turn 5]. The &#x02018;waiting&#x02019; group received no additional teaching during that time. Children&#x02019;s performance was assessed at screening (t0) and pretest (t1) and progress was monitored throughout the intervention (t2&#x02013;t5) and at a 6-month follow-up (t6). Herein, we report data from screening (t0), pretest (t1), immediate post-test (t5) and delayed follow-up (t6). The primary outcome measures were language and spoken narrative skills; the secondary outcomes were phoneme awareness and literacy skills. As a control measure, we also assessed gains in number skills, which were not targeted by the intervention. The timeline for assessments is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Time line of 30 weeks intervention and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0054-0280-f1"/></fig><p>Ethical permission for the study was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology, University of York.

Nineteen Nursery schools in Yorkshire (England) were involved at the outset of the study. In these Nursery schools, all children who were due to enter school (Reception) in the following academic year were screened (t0). Following screening, one school withdrew from the study, two schools were deemed unsuitable for continued involvement due to insufficient numbers of children, and one school was excluded due to relatively high performance of their children on language measures.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing details of selection and allocation of participants and flow through study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0054-0280-f2"/></fig><p>In each of the remaining 15 nursery schools, approximately 15 children with the lowest mean verbal composite score were selected as possible participants in the trial.

generalized improvements on tests assessing primary outcomes in the domains of language, and narrative skills and on secondary outcomes, phoneme awareness and literacy skills (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To assess these effects we constructed latent variable models in which the four constructs (Language, Narrative, Phoneme Awareness, Literacy) were defined at pretest (<italic>t1</italic>) immediate post-test (<italic>t5</italic>) and maintenance follow-up (<italic>t6</italic>) by multiple measures. The measures used to define each construct at each point in time are shown in the Path diagrams representing these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). The effects of these analyses were remarkably clear. At immediate and delayed post-test, there were significant effects of the intervention on Language (immediate post-test <italic>d</italic> = .80, <italic>z</italic> = 6.57, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001; maintenance test <italic>d</italic> = .83, <italic>z</italic> = 2.41, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001), Narrative (immediate post-test <italic>d</italic> = .39, <italic>z</italic> = 2.97; <italic>p</italic> = .003 maintenance test <italic>d</italic> = .30, <italic>z</italic> = 2.04, <italic>p</italic> = .041) and Phoneme Awareness (immediate post-test <italic>d</italic> = .49, <italic>z</italic> = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> = .031; maintenance test <italic>d</italic> = .49, <italic>z</italic> = 2.58; <italic>p</italic> = .01). The effects on Literacy were not significant (immediate post-test <italic>d</italic> = .31; <italic>z</italic> = 1.81; <italic>p</italic> = .07; maintenance test <italic>d</italic> = .14, <italic>z</italic> = .93, <italic>p</italic> = .354).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Models showing the effects of the intervention on Language (A), Narrative (B), Phonological Awareness (C) and Literacy (D) skills at immediate post-test (t5)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0054-0280-f3"/></fig><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Models showing the effects of the intervention on Language (A), Narrative (B), Phonological Awareness (C) and Literacy (D) skills at delayed maintenance test (t6)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0054-0280-f4"/></fig><p>Finally, it is important to note that the intervention group showed higher scores on a reading comprehension test that was first administered at maintenance follow-up. With baseline word-reading skill as the covariate, in a hierarchical linear model with school as a fixed effect, there was a highly reliable effect of the intervention (marginal mean group difference = 0.97, 95% CI 0.40&#x02013;1.54, <italic>z</italic> = 3.32, <italic>p</italic> = .001). It should also be noted that this effect remained essentially unchanged when reading accuracy on the reading comprehension test at maintenance test was an additional covariate (marginal mean group difference = 0.91, 95% CI 0.42&#x02013;1.41, <italic>z</italic> = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Thus, the effect of the intervention on reading comprehension is not accounted for by differences in reading accuracy, but appears to be a generalized effect from the improvements in language comprehension skill brought about by the intervention.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we ran a mediation model in which the effect of intervention group on reading comprehension outcome at t6 was the product of improvements in language comprehension abilities at t5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). In this model, there is complete mediation, with the effect of intervention group on reading comprehension scores being accounted for entirely by the indirect pathway (intervention group &#x02192; language comprehension t5 &#x02192; reading comprehension t6). Dropping the direct pathway (intervention group &#x02192; reading comprehension t6) had no significant effect on the fit of the model (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> difference = 0.37, df = 1, NS). The compound path for the indirect effect (intervention group &#x02192; language comprehension t5 &#x02192; reading comprehension t6) is highly significant (<italic>z</italic> = 23.68, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mediation model showing the effect of intervention on reading comprehension outcome at t6 as product of improvements in oral language abilities at t5</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0054-0280-f5"/></fig><p>To check for possible &#x02018;Hawthorne&#x02019; or expectancy effects, arithmetic performance using the BAS Number Concept subtest before and after the intervention was assessed. In a hierarchical linear model with school as a fixed effect, there was no trace of any effect of the intervention on this measure (marginal mean group difference = 0.23, 95% CI &#x02212;0.45 to 0.90, <italic>z</italic> = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> = .511).</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> reports data comparing the children in the intervention and waiting control group to the peer comparison group at immediate post-test and maintenance test. These figures allow assessment of the extent to which the intervention had improved language skills to levels comparable to a representative sample of peer controls from the same classrooms.

It is clear that where the same measures were reassessed following the intervention, the corresponding group differences have reduced in size substantially (<italic>d</italic>s range from .23 to .53) For the remaining tests, for which baseline data are not available, the peer comparison group always show higher scores, but with small-to-medium effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>s range from .72 to .01). Overall looking at the standard scores and scaled scores shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> it is clear that the intervention group are showing essentially normal scores (similar to those of the peer comparison group) on some measures (<italic>CELF Expressive Vocabulary</italic>, <italic>Letter knowledge</italic>), whereas on some other measures (<italic>CELF Sentence Structure</italic> and <italic>Early Word Reading</italic>) both the intervention and waiting list control group appear to continue to lag behind the peer comparison group.</p><p>Hierarchical linear models showed that on a number of tests the intervention group did not differ significantly from peer controls following intervention (<italic>t6 APT information</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;1.28, 95% CI &#x02212;2.58 to 0.02, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.93, <italic>p</italic> = .053; <italic>t6 APT grammar</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;1.06, 95% CI &#x02212;2.45 to 0.33, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.50, <italic>p</italic> = .134; <italic>t5 letter knowledge</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;.48, 95% CI &#x02212;1.47 to 0.51, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;0.95, <italic>p</italic> = .342; <italic>t6 letter knowledge</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;0.89, 95% CI &#x02212;2.39 to 0.61, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.17, <italic>p</italic> = .243; <italic>t6 listening comprehension</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;0.79, 95% CI &#x02212;1.60 to 0.01, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.94, <italic>p</italic> = .052; <italic>t5 narrative NW</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;0.46, 95% CI &#x02212;13.45 to 12.52, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .944; <italic>t5 narrative NDW</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;1.49, 95% CI &#x02212;4.30 to 1.32, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.04, <italic>p</italic> = .299; <italic>t6 reading comprehension</italic>: marginal mean group difference = &#x02212;0.28, 95% CI &#x02212;0.88 to 0.32, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;0.91, <italic>p</italic> = .364).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve the oral language and early literacy skills of children identified in preschool as having poorly developed language. Participating children were randomly assigned to an oral language intervention or a waiting control group. The intervention programme focused primarily on vocabulary, narrative and listening skills, with additional work on letter-sound knowledge and phoneme awareness introduced in the final 10 weeks. The intervention programme was effective in improving oral language and spoken narrative skills immediately following the intervention, and these effects were each maintained 6 months later.</p><p>There was evidence that the two preliteracy skills directly taught (letter-sound knowledge and phoneme awareness) benefitted from the intervention. However, these effects did not generalize to measures of word-level literacy skills. This may not be surprising given that these preliteracy skills were only introduced in the last 10 weeks of the programme, and such forms of training are known to be more effective when combined with reading instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hatcher, Hulme, &#x00026; Ellis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">NRP, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding the absence of statistically reliable effects of the intervention on word-level literacy skills, a very encouraging outcome was the significant impact of the intervention on reading comprehension measured some 6 months after the intervention had ceased. It is also notable that this effect was statistically independent of any concurrent effects on prose reading accuracy, and the results of a mediation model support the conclusion that this effect is a product of the improved language comprehension skills that were fostered by the intervention (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the intervention group was performing at a comparable level to their peers in reading comprehension after receiving the intervention. Arguably, therefore the programme had secured a foundation for reading comprehension in its recipients. More generally, the findings suggest that oral language intervention can make educationally significant improvements to the language skills of children who are &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; of failure and it is encouraging that, on the majority of measures, the intervention group had &#x02018;closed the gap&#x02019; between themselves and the peer control group after the intervention was completed.</p><p>Together the findings of the current trial are very encouraging because the direct effects of the training the children received transferred to standardized measures (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Pollard-Durodola et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Elleman et al. (2009)</xref> suggested in their meta-analysis of the impact of vocabulary instruction on reading comprehension that standardized measures are often insensitive to vocabulary growth, in this study, its effects were observed in spoken narrative as well as on formal vocabulary measures. However, our data also suggest that the success of vocabulary instruction might depend upon the age at which it is given or the amount of training received: there was no evidence that vocabulary instruction in preschool was effective, although the small effect sizes need to be interpreted cautiously given that exposure to new vocabulary was limited to three sessions per week in the first 10 weeks, compared with daily sessions in the second 20 weeks of the programme when the children were in school. In addition, all teaching in the Nursery part of the programme was in group sessions. It is plausible that the combination of group and individual sessions received during Reception may have been more effective, giving teaching assistants the opportunity to tailor their vocabulary instruction to meet the needs of individual children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study has shown that oral language skills can be promoted during the early school years and that this produces effects that generalize to standardized tests of oral language skills and reading comprehension. The study is one of the first to deliver language intervention during the transition from preschool to primary school; a limitation of the design is that it is not possible to evaluate the advantage of starting early (as compared with at school entry) and the optimal timing for and duration of such interventions remain unknown. Nonetheless, the study provides further evidence that school-based oral language interventions can be successfully delivered by trained and supported school staff, a vital step towards developing evidence-based, cost-effective interventions that can be applied effectively in everyday school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Savage, Carless, &#x00026; Erten, 2009</xref>). Research is badly needed to extend the current study to evaluate the efficacy of longer term intervention programmes for children with persisting language learning impairments.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Key points</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children who enter school with poorly developed language skills are at high risk of educational failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data from an RCT show that a 30-week intervention delivered in the last 10 weeks of preschool and continuing for 20 weeks through the transition into primary education can improve oral language, vocabulary and narrative skills.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Supplementing the language work with training in letter-sound knowledge and phoneme awareness for the final 10 weeks brings about gains in these skills.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Children who received the intervention showed gains in reading comprehension mediated by gains in oral language (and not by gains in word-level reading skills).</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research was funded by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation.
