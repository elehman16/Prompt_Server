However, current chemical drugs do not achieve good curative effects. In the present study we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a Chinese herbal medicine, Xiangsha Liujunzi granules, in the treatment of patients with FD. We found that Xiangsha Liujunzi granules offered significant symptomatic improvement in patients with FD without adverse effects.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional dyspepsia (FD), one of the most frequently encountered disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, is defined as the presence of symptoms originated in the epigastrium in the absence of any systemic, organic, or metabolic disease that is likely to explain the symptoms and is characterized by symptoms of meal-induced postprandial fullness or early satiety and upper abdominal discomfort or pain[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that the prevalence of FD varies considerably among different population-based studies, with percentages ranging from to 11% to 29%[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FD has symptoms similar to those of other conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux. The two diagnostic categories of FD are (1) postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), which is characterized by the presence of meal-related early satiety and fullness; and (2) epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), which is characterized by the prominent symptom of epigastric pain that is generally not meal-related. However, evidence of their degree of overlap is mixed. Although its pathogenesis has not yet been fully clarified, abnormalities in gastric motor and sensory function and, more recently, low-grade duodenal inflammation have been identified[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The major pathophysiological mechanism underlying symptoms of FD is disorders of gastrointestinal motility[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Motility disorders lead to impaired gastric accommodation, myoelectric activity abnormalities and delayed gastric emptying (GE). Therefore, a prokinetic treatment approach is preferred in PDS. Recent evidence suggests that the subtypes of FD correlated with unhealthy dietary behaviors, especially skipping meals, eating extra meals and a preference to gas-producing food and sweet food[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was recently found that the nutritional habits of FD patients are also a major factor in the production of discomfort symptoms. Carbonated drinks and fatty and spicy foods were the most common triggering food items in FD patients. Carbonated drinks and legumes were more likely to cause a symptom in PDS[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the exact pathogenesis of FD has not yet been fully clarified, therapeutic drugs to relieve symptoms have thus not yet been established.</p><p>Symptomatic management of FD depends on the predominant symptoms and remains a substantial challenge. Treatment can include dietary modifications, antiemetics, antispasmodics, prokinetics, antidepressants and analgesics, as well as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the emergence of acotiamide in Japan[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which has given hope to some FD patients, it does not benefit more patients. Therefore, the limited effectiveness of chemical drugs and the side effects of synthetic drugs make assessments of herbal preparations an appealing prospect[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the role of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of FD. Approaches based on complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of FD have a long history, and several modalities have been investigated with some promising results[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A considerable amount of literature reported that at least 44 different herbal products have been recommended alone or in combination for the treatment of dyspeptic symptoms[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Complementary and alternative medicine consists of traditional Persian medicine (TPM), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and so on. Jollab, a TPM, appeared to be more effective than the placebo in patients with FD[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Adjuvant supplementation of honey-based formulation of <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> and the association between ginger and artichoke leaf extracts can cause significant symptomatic improvement in patients with FD[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since Liujunzi decoction was proved to be effective against FD by a randomized controlled trial for the first time, a considerable amount of literature has been published on the treatment of FD with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM)[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To date, as the good efficacy of CHM for the relief of symptoms of FD, many dyspeptic patients chose CHM. Clinically, CHM is used in combination with Western medications or alone in China. The essence of TCM is treatment based on syndrome differentiation, which is based on the different conditions of each patient. At present, the phenomenon of the same drug treatment for the same disease with the same medicine is applied. Based on TCM theory, PDS can be categorized as &#x0201c;stuffiness and fullness&#x0201d;, and the most related organ is the &#x0201c;spleen&#x0201d;. A previous study has already demonstrated that the syndrome of &#x0201c;spleen-deficiency and Qi-stagnation&#x0201d; was the most common syndrome type in FD patients[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Based on these findings, the herbal preparation Xiangsha Liujunzi granules, a classical TCM formula, was designed and utilized in treating FD patients with &#x0201c;spleen-deficiency and Qi-stagnation&#x0201d; syndrome.</p><p>Despite ongoing clinical use, uncertainty remains regarding clinical efficacy and safety of CHM in the treatment of FD. The aim of this multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was to assess whether 4 wk of therapy with CHM was more efficacious than placebo in the relief of FD dyspeptic symptom and in improving quality of life[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We hoped to find strong evidence to support the use of CHM in PDS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two arms to examine the safety and efficacy of Xiangsha Liujunzi granules in the treatment of PDS patients. Participants were randomized into Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio. Since assigning an equal number of ill subjects to the ineffective placebo treatment was unethical, the 2:1 randomization plan was chosen to protect the rights of the subjects. The protocol was developed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] , Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The CHM group received Xiangsha Liujunzi granules, and the placebo group received a placebo. Then, all participants underwent a 4-wk treatment, followed by a 4-wk follow-up period. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese medical sciences, Wuhan Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital, and Guangdong Province TCM Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study design is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

The total severity score ranged from 0 to 12. The frequency scoring used the following scale: 0, absent (less than once per month); 1, rarely (less than once per week); 2, occasionally (less than three times per week); and 3, often (more than or three times per week). The total frequency score ranged from 0 to 12.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Changes in the clinical global impression (CGI) scale score, TCM symptom score (SS), MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) score, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) score, and GE were considered secondary outcomes.</p><p><bold>CGI scale:</bold> The CGI scale[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] comprises two parts: CGI-severity (CGI-S) and CGI-improvement (CGI-I). The former evaluates the severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7, and the latter assesses the change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale. In CGI-S, clinical investigators need to answer one question: &#x0201c;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&#x0201d;, which is rated on the seven-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill while 7 = the most extremely ill. Similarly, in CGI-I, clinical investigators need to answer another question: &#x0201c;Compared to the patient&#x02019;s condition at admission to the project, how is this patient&#x02019;s condition?&#x0201d; which is also rated on a seven-point scale: 1 = very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 4 = no change from baseline; 7 = very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</p><p><bold>TCM SS:</bold> TCM SS is a scale utilized to evaluate the participant&#x02019;s discomfort of PDS based on TCM theory. SS contains 15 items of TCM terminology, which are used to assess the presence (yes/no) and severity of physical discomfort (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe).</p><p><bold>SF-36:</bold> SF-36, the most commonly used tool to assess quality of life that contains 36 items in eight dimensions, was used to assess the effect of experimental medication. The eight dimensions consist of general health (GH), physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), role emotional (RE), social functioning (SF), bodily pain (BP), vitality (VT) and mental health (MH)[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p><bold>HADS:</bold> The HADS, first developed by Snaith and Zigmond in 1983, was usually used to identify cases (possible and probable) of anxiety disorders and depression among patients in non-psychiatric hospitals[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The scale consists of 14 items, 7 related to anxiety (HADS-A) and 7 related to depression (HADS-D), each scored between 0 and 3. The authors of this scale recommended that if an individual had a score of 8, he/she should be regarded as a possible case. It was found that this threshold was optimal for HADS-A and HADS-D in both the general population and patients with somatic symptoms.</p><p><bold>GE:</bold> GE was observed using gastric ultrasound[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Participants were asked to fast overnight before the ultrasonography. A 1120 mL esculent liquid was used as the test meal and was prepared by mixing 50 g of nutrient Cola Cao (enteral nutritional solid beverage, chocolate; Tianjin Cola Cao Food Co., LTD, Tanjin, China) and 100 g of milk powder (Nestle whole milk powder; Shuangcheng Nestle Co., Ltd, Heilongjiang, China) with 1100 mL of warm water, and the entire test meal volume was 1120 mL. This esculent liquid contained 26.5 g of protein, 29.1 g of fat and 75.5 g of carbohydrate (840 kcal). This mixed liquid meal consisted of 13% proteins, 48% carbohydrates and 39% lipids and was used at a caloric density of 0.75 kcal/mL. The liquid test meal was administered orally as tolerated at a fixed rate of 50 mL/min, and all participants were allowed to sit stationary on a chair for approximately 5 min while drinking this test meal. The subjects were scanned in a half-sitting position, sitting on an examining chair and leaning back at an angle of approximately 120&#x000b0;. Subjects were instructed not to move and to hold their breath at the end of expiration to permit diaphragmatic rising and restoration of the gastric configuration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Gastric ultrasonography.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WJG-23-5589-g002"/></fig><p>The proximal stomach and distal stomach volumes of each subject were scanned at six time points, which were fasting, maximum satiety, and 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min after beginning ingestion.</p><p>GE rate was calculated as follows: (Amax - A)/Amax &#x000d7; 100 (%), where Amax is the volume of maximum satiety after the meal in the proximal stomach or distal stomach, and A is the volume at other time points after the meal in the proximal stomach or distal stomach.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety monitoring</title><p>To assess the safety of the 4 wk treatment, routine tests of blood, urine and stool samples, as well as an electrocardiogram and blood biochemical tests (ALT, AST, BUN, Scr) were conducted before randomization and immediately after the completed treatment.

Demographic, clinical, and outcome variables were described using mean &#x000b1; SD for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. First, the baseline characteristics of both groups were compared, including gender, age, and level of education. Second, the efficacy of CHM and placebo was compared, including the primary outcome and all secondary outcomes. All analyses in this study were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Missing values were recorded by the last-observation-carried-forward method, and this analysis imputes the last measured value of the endpoint to all subsequent scheduled but missing evaluations. The baseline characteristics were compared using either <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> or the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests.

The prevalence of FD is 20%-25% in Western countries and 8%-23% in Asia[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In China, approximately 10% of general outpatients have dyspepsia, which account for 50% of digestive internal medicine clinic services. FD involves various pathophysiological disturbances and many pathogenic factors, including impaired accommodation, delayed GE, and hypersensitivity to gastric distention. Several studies have reported that visceral hypersensitivity is the mechanism of postprandial abdominal bloating and distension. The normal abdominal accommodation is altered by an abnormal viscerosomatic response to meal ingestion[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Patients with PDS have the characteristics of fasting and postprandial hypersensitivity, while patients with EPS have the characteristics of a reduction in gastric compliance[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. There are multiple drug options in clinical practice, including PPIs, prokinetic agents, anti-<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> drugs, antidepressant drugs and mucosal protective agents. Because the pathophysiology of FD involves several physiological systems and a variety of treatment classes are available, health care providers face uncertainty in selecting therapies for patients with FD. Furthermore, these chemical drugs are not satisfactory or effective. Therefore, many patients with FD seek treatment with complementary and alternative medicine[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. TCM, as an important component of complementary and alternative medicine, has attracted increasing attention in the world, especially in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal diseases.</p><p>Based on TCM theory, the &#x0201c;spleen&#x0201d; governs movement and transformation of food and fluid. Emotional injury, food or drink, and congenital defects are main pathogenic factors of a functional disorder of the &#x0201c;spleen&#x0201d;, which can lead to the stagnation of Qi and dampness and then result in &#x0201c;stuffiness and fullness&#x0201d;. As spleen deficiency is the essence of these three types of syndrome, invigorating the spleen is the critical principle of treatment[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This pathogenic factor causes abnormal function of the upper abdomen, spleen and stomach, resulting in the presence of abdominal distension, appetite disorder, loose stools, and lassitude. The TCM pathogenesis of FD is spleen deficiency and Qi-stagnation. Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction is a classical formula based on invigorating the spleen and has been used by TCM doctors for hundreds of years. In the past two decades, a considerable number of clinical trials have proved the efficacy and safety of this decoction in the treatment of FD[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Currently, no patient-reported outcome instrument is available for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in PDS, which makes the evaluation of treatment effects in FD difficult. To improve the evaluation criteria of this study, we chose the PDSS, CGI, SS, SF-36, and HADS. CGI instrument, an established outcome measure in psychopharmacology research, is a reliable measure of fatigue[<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Symptoms of fatigue are often part of the clinical presentation of spleen deficiency. Mental and psychological disorders are one of the pathogenic factors for FD. Clinically, we found many FD patients with anxiety and depression symptoms. One of the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; to assess the efficacy of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications is the Hamilton rating scale. Another scale to assess the efficacy of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications is the CGI, which has similar effect sizes to the HAM rating scale[<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, CGI instrument has been used in clinical practice as well as research. Zigmond and Snaith devised the HADS, which has the advantages of simplicity, fastness and ease of use, to assess anxiety and depression in a general medical population 33 years ago[<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This scale has recently been used to assess FD patients with anxiety and depression. The remarkable placebo response is the most difficulty in clinical trials on FD patients. In order to ensure that the participants could not be able to make a distinction between placebo and active treatment, we tried our best to make the drugs in the two groups indistinguishable for the participants. The placebo granules were made from 80% dextrin, 15% rice, 5% bitter principle and coloring matter to ensure that the color, smell, taste and texture were similar to those of Xiangsha Liujunzi granules. In this clinical study, we found that Xiangsha Liujunzi granules can relieve the postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain symptoms in PDS patients, but the improvement in the epigastric burning sensation was not superior to that achieved by the placebo. This result may be because the inhibition of gastric acid secretion by CHM was not better than that of PPIs. The SF-36 scale was used to evaluate the improvement in quality life of patients. Our results showed the advantage of the CHM compared to placebo, with a significant improvement of 8 subscale scores of GH, PF, RP, RE, SF, BP, VT, MH on the SF-36 at 2 wk and 4 wk. These results persisted until the end of the study (8 wk). The pathophysiology of FD is diverse and its symptoms are non-specific; the pathogenesis of FD is also related to mental and psychological factors. Therefore, some antidepressants have been used to treat FD, such as mirtazapine[<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to our results, the HADA and HADD scores were both reduced in the CHM group compared to the placebo group at 4 wk and 8 wk, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. The CHM treatment had significant improvement in gastrointestinal-specific anxiety and depression. This study also showed that TCM symptom scores significantly improved from 2 wk to 4 wk with CHM treatment, and the result persisted to the follow-up time (8 wk). This finding shows that TCM treatment can reduce the recurrence of FD symptoms. Finally, after 4 wk of CHM treatment, the number of participants with very much improved and much improved scores on the CGI scale, compared to placebo, was significantly higher at 4 wk.</p><p>FD is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases, accounting for up to 5% of outpatients in gastroenterology department[<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. GE of patients with FD is usually delayed in 30%-50%[<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], including both liquid emptying[<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and solid emptying[<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Food ingestion can directly aggravate dyspeptic symptoms of patients with FD. Data from questionnaires revealed that 75% of patients with FD had experience of aggravation of dyspeptic symptoms after ingestion of a meal. Previous studies had reported that 90% of patients with FD had aggravation of dyspeptic symptoms after ingestion of a standardized 250-kcal meal, and maximum symptom severity occurred between 45 and 90 min after meal[<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this study, we calculated the GERPG and GERDG at 4 time points and found that the GERDG of the CHM group at 30 min after a meal was negative. As we know, the proximal stomach functions as a reservoir, and the liquid food flows into the distal stomach and enlarges the volume of the distal stomach over time. This factor caused an illusion that the GERDG of the CHM group was decreased. Compared with those of the placebo group, the GERPG and GERDG of the CHM group were increased at 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min after the meal. The results of this study suggest that the curative effect of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction can promote GE of patients with PDS. Furthermore, throughout the course of the experiment, participants were not found to have any adverse events.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of the Xiangsha Liujunzi granules to improve the symptomatic symptoms of patients with FD. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, Xiangsha Liujunzi granules was shown to be effective in the management of FD, especially in patients with postprandial fullness and bloating, early satiety, and epigastric pain. This treatment will provide a new option for clinicians in treating PDS. However, the mechanism of action for CHM to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms is still unknown, and further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanisms of action.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Functional dyspepsia (FD), one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders, has two diagnostic categories that are postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome. Its prevalence ranges from 11% to 29%, and it seriously affects the quality of life of patients. However, current chemical drugs do not achieve good curative effect, and it is therefore necessary to find a new therapy for FD.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>The major pathophysiological mechanism of PDS is gastric motility disorder, therefore, searching for a kind of effective treatment for PDS is the current research hotspot. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the advantage of treating PDS. Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction is a classical formula based on invigorating the spleen and has been used in clinical practice for hundreds of years. Gastric ultrasound is usually used to observe the gastric emptying (GE), but its value in assessing the promoting effect of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) on gastric motility has not yet been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>Although in the past two decades, a considerable number of clinical trials have proved the efficacy and safety of this decoction in the treatment of FD, there are still some disadvantages in assessing its efficacy. The authors use gastric ultrasound to observe proximal and distal GE rates. The advantages of the technique include being non-invasive, accurate, and reliable.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>The authors provide strong evidence to support the use of CHM in PDS patients. This treatment will provide a new option for clinicians in treating PDS in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology</title><p>TCM, an independent medical system well known in China, has four ways of diagnosis that are look, listen, question and feel the pulse. It takes Yin-Yang and five elements as the theoretical basis, which holds that the human body is regarded as the unity of Qi, form and spirit. The basic principle of understanding and treating diseases for TCM is syndrome differentiation. CHMs are natural medicines that consist of plant medicine (root, stem, leaf and fruit), animal medicine (viscera, skin, bone, organ, <italic>etc</italic>.) and mineral medicine. The use of CHMs is conducted under the guidance of the theory of TCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer-review</title><p>This paper describes a new method for treating PDS. The authors designed a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two arms to examine the safety and efficacy of Xiangsha Liujunzi granules in the treatment of PDS patients. They assessed PDS symptoms using the change in PDSS, clinical global impression scale, TCM symptom scores, MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and hospital anxiety and depression scale. Further, they assessed proximal and distal GE rates by gastric ultrasound, which is non-invasive, accurate, and reliable. This clinical trial study provides strong evidence to support the use of CHM in PDS patients. This treatment will provide a new option for clinicians in treating PDS in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Manuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript</p></fn><fn><p>Specialty type: Gastroenterology and hepatology</p></fn><fn><p>Country of origin: China</p></fn><fn><p>Peer-review report classification</p></fn><fn><p>Grade A (Excellent): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade B (Very good): B</p></fn><fn><p>Grade C (Good): C</p></fn><fn><p>Grade D (Fair): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade E (Poor): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Institutional review board statement: The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethic Committee of Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn><p>Informed consent statement: All study participants, or their legal guardian, provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment.</p></fn><fn><p>Clinical trial registration statement: This study was registered at www.chictr.org.cn, and the registration identification number is ChiCTR-TRC-13003200.
