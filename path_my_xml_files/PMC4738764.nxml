Over half of mental illness is attributable to depression and anxiety disorders, both of which have known treatments. While the scarcity of mental health care providers is recognized as a major contributor to the magnitude of untreated disorders in LMICs, studies in LMICs find that evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety disorders, such as brief, structured psychotherapies, are feasible, acceptable and have strong efficacy when delivered by local non-specialist personnel. However, most mental health treatment studies using non-specialist providers in LMICs deploy traditional efficacy designs (T1) without the benefit of integrated mental health treatment models shown to succeed over vertical interventions or methods derived from new implementation science to speed policy change. Here, we describe an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study that evaluates non-specialist delivery of mental health treatment within an HIV clinic for HIV-positive (HIV+) women affected by gender- based violence (GBV) (HIV+ GBV+) in the Nyanza region of Kenya.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design, 200 HIV+ women with major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who are receiving care at a Family AIDS Care Education and Services (FACES)-supported clinic in Kisumu, Kenya will be randomized to: (1) interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)&#x02009;+&#x02009;treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) TAU, both delivered within the HIV clinic. IPT will consist of 12 weekly 60-minute individual IPT sessions, delivered by non-specialists trained to provide IPT. Primary effectiveness outcomes will include MDD and PTSD diagnosis on the Mini International Diagnostic Interview (MINI). Primary implementation outcomes will include treatment cost-benefit, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity of the IPT delivery within an HIV clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial leverages newly defined effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs to gather data on mental health treatment implementation within an HIV care clinic, while testing the effectiveness of an evidence-based treatment for use with a large underserved population (HIV+ GBV+ women) in Kenya.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">NCT02320799</ext-link>, registered on 9 September 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gender-based violence</kwd><kwd>Interpersonal psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>Posttraumatic stress disorder</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K23MH098767-01A1</award-id><award-id>K23MH098767-01A1S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meffert</surname><given-names>Susan M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Global mental health treatment gap in in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and effectiveness-implementation hybrid trials</title><p>The mental health care gap in LMICs is well-established &#x02013; 75&#x000a0;% of those with serious mental disorders never receive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The majority of those in need of care suffer from depression and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], illnesses for which treatments with strong efficacy have existed for decades and are widely used in high income countries (HICs). Over the past decade, efficacy studies have shown that non-specialists can deliver many evidence-based psychotherapies for common mental disorders in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], thereby addressing workforce barriers related to the scarcity of mental health professionals. Yet, for the most part, the field has not moved beyond the first (T1) stage of translational research (testing the clinical efficacy of treatments in new settings) to address treatment effectiveness with general populations and implementation strategies. Given the large and growing global magnitude of disability related to mental disorders (a 45&#x000a0;% increase over the past 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], such research is not only the next logical step for translation, but is required to meet the need for services. In order to move efficiently toward scale-up and implementation of mental health care, we will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design which has the potential to inform scale-up and implementation of mental health care. As described by Curran and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs blend clinical effectiveness and implementation research, and are composed of three categories which shift from an emphasis on effectiveness (type I) to an emphasis on implementation (type III). Type I designs prioritize evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention, including participant-level randomization, while allowing for data collection on implementation parameters. For example, a type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid design might test the clinical effectiveness of delivering a mental health treatment in a primary care setting and include a multi-stakeholder qualitative process evaluation of the delivery of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>HIV, GBV and women: mental health care needs</title><p>HIV+ women suffer extraordinarily high rates of gender-based violence (GBV) (GBV&#x02009;+&#x02009;HIV+), particularly child abuse and intimate partner violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mental disorders affect most GBV survivors, typically manifesting as anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the attention received by the HIV-GBV syndemic and awareness that depression and PTSD have a significant negative impact on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], few mental health treatment studies assess HIV outcomes. HIV+ GBV+ women in LMICs represent a large subpopulation of those in the mental health treatment gap, who have particularly urgent needs &#x02013; not only do HIV+ GBV+ women bear a disproportionately heavy mental disorder burden, but the association between mental disorders and ART default creates an urgent mental health treatment need in order to avert HIV-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The preponderance of the world&#x02019;s HIV-infected populations live in sub-Saharan Africa, where women make up the majority of those infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sub-Saharan Africa is also a region with a high lifetime prevalence of GBV, ranging from 56&#x02013;71&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our study site is the Family AIDS Care and Education Services (FACES) HIV Care and Clinical Research clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. FACES is a President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-funded 12-year collaboration between the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) serving more than 140,000 HIV+ individuals in the Nyanza region of Kenya. This region has the country&#x02019;s highest national prevalence of HIV (19.3&#x000a0;%) and physical violence against women (57&#x000a0;% of women aged 15&#x02013;49) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In 2013, we conducted a qualitative mental health care needs assessment of HIV+ GBV+ women served by the FACES linic in Kisumu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While the goal of qualitative studies is not to determine prevalence, but rather to investigate local perceptions within their social context, we found that the majority of interviewees reported that physical violence (79&#x000a0;%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), emotional abuse (82&#x000a0;%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) and sexual violence (76&#x000a0;%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) against HIV+ women were common in the region. Mental health problems among HIV+ GBV+ women included depressive, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Participants opined that emotional distress from GBV caused HIV treatment default, and led to poor HIV health outcomes even if adherent to an ART regimen. Respondents agreed that mental health treatment was needed for HIV+ GBV+ women and most agreed that the best treatment modality was individual counseling delivered weekly at the HIV clinic. Based on these data, we selected and adapted Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) delivered by local non-mental health specialists within the HIV clinic for treatment of depression and trauma symptoms among female HIV+ GBV+ clinic attendees.</p><p>IPT is a time-limited (10&#x02013;12 weekly sessions) diagnosis-focused psychotherapy, developed in the 1980s by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman to address interpersonal issues in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. IPT is now a first-line treatment for depression, has the best results in the only face-to-face RCT for depressed HIV+ patients, and is known to be non-inferior to traditional exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. IPT intervenes in social functioning with consequent benefits for symptom experience. It helps patients solve an interpersonal crisis characterized as grief, a role dispute, or a role transition, by building social skills and gathering social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design/Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims</title><p>We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I study of IPT&#x02009;+&#x02009;treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone for major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among HIV+ GBV+ women receiving HIV care at FACES in Kisumu. IPT will be offered to the TAU group after the conclusion of the 12-week IPT. We will assess the effectiveness of IPT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU versus TAU alone for reduction of depression and PTSD symptoms, HIV viral load and improvement of ART adherence and neurocognitive functioning. We will also assess implementation parameters, including cost-benefit analyses of delivering IPT integrated within HIV clinics using non-specialist providers, fidelity and adoption of the intervention. We hypothesize that IPT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU will be more effective than TAU alone for remission of MDD and PTSD and that implementation analyses will show that it is delivered with high fidelity and adoption and that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be conducted at the FACES HIV Clinic in Kisumu.

IPT will be provided by non-specialists trained to deliver IPT in the HIV clinic setting. The TAU group will be offered IPT treatment following the initial 12-week trial. Thus, all study subjects will receive TAU throughout the study and they will all receive IPT in either the first or second half of the study. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and weeks 12, 24 and 36 by a study evaluator who is blind to group assignment.

At week 12, TAU participants will complete their second assessment and will then be offered the same IPT treatment received by participants in the IPV&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU arm.

Therapists will then complete the run-in phase of the study, during which they will be assigned a pilot IPT case. During the pilot phase and throughout the study, each therapist will receive weekly telephone supervision from one of two psychiatrists who are experts in IPT (study principal investigator (PI) and co-investigator), at which time they will be scored on 10 key aspects of delivering IPT, according to the IPT phase in which they are working and using a 10-point Likert scale for each response.

Viral load testing will be used as a biological measure of adherence. Blood draws will be performed by a trained phlebotomist at the FACES HIV clinic. Samples will be tested using the Roche TaqMan HIV viral load platform at the KEMRI Center for Disease Control (CDC) HIV-R laboratory. The lowest limit of detection for the TaqMan platform is 20 copies/ml. Therefore, if the VL is below the detection limit, the result will be less than 20 copies/ml and coded as &#x0201c;undetectable.&#x0201d; All other results will have numerical values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Implementation outcomes</title><sec id="FPar4"><title>Acceptability and appropriateness</title><p>The acceptability and appropriateness of IPT for treatment of MDD and PTSD in HIV+ GBV+ women will be assessed through semi-structured closing interviews and focus groups with participants, IPT therapists, clinic personnel and members of the FACES Community Advisory Group (CAG).</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Domains of interest</title><p><italic>Participants</italic> will be asked: (1) to identify positive and negative aspects of IPT, including content, delivery, logistics; (2) if they would refer other people to the treatment and why; (3) to identify suggestions for improvements. <italic>IPT therapists</italic> will be asked: (1) if they believed IPT benefitted participants and why; (2) whether they would like to continue providing IPT; and (3) what suggestions they have to improve the intervention. <italic>Clinic personnel and members of the clinic</italic>&#x02019;<italic>s CAG</italic> will be asked: (1) to identify positive and negative aspects of IPT, including delivery, logistics; (2) to identify positive and negative impacts of treatment on the HIV clinic and community; (3) whether or not they would like continuation of IPT treatment for MDD and PTSD for HIV+ GBV+ women in their clinic/community and why/why not; (4) suggestions for improvement of either treatment. Four focus groups will be conducted with five participants each (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20).

The instrument assesses both formal (e.g., salaries, wages) and informal (e.g., crops, animals) income in order to accurately capture economic activity in the target population.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size</title><p>As an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I, the primary goal of this study is to assess effectiveness, while also collecting data on implementation parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In our prior work using a similar treatment with a traumatized, low-resource population, we observed a Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> effect size of 0.79 for depression symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Using the depression Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> would suggest that a sample size of at least 50 is necessary for a two-group design with power of 50 and probability level of 0.05. However, given cultural differences between studies, and that this study requires participants to complete four assessments across 36&#x000a0;weeks, with substantial time investment at each assessment, we have made a conservative sample size estimate, allowing for approximately 20&#x000a0;% general attrition at each assessment point, a sample size of 100 was selected. Given the multiple blood draws required of participants and the evidence suggesting that fear of blood draw can lead to attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], we will further increase our sample size to 200 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data management</title><p>Data collection will be done with paper and tablets. Informed consent will be in paper format, allowing participants to either sign or use a thumbprint to acknowledge receipt of information. Eligibility screening and measures will be collected on Android tablets using an electronic data capture, CommCare Open Data Kit (ODK). ODK is widely used in low- resources setting, is user-friendly and allows users to input data offline, then upload through a secure server. In addition, all screening and therapy sessions will be audiotaped and uploading into REDCap. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: (1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for importing data from external sources. Audio sessions will be randomly selected for review by an independent rater for external validity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Effectiveness</title><p>The main analysis will consist of comparing the change from baseline to post-treatment (12&#x000a0;weeks) between the two treatment conditions. The two primary outcome measures of PTSD and MDD diagnosis will be analyzed by estimating and testing a statistical model of each dichotomous measure with a binomial distribution and log link using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of participants by therapist (therapist effect) and the repeated assessments.

Dedoose software will be used to analyze the resulting text using grounded theory. Grounded theory sorts data in three ways: through concepts, categories and propositions. Concepts are identified by seeking conceptual similarities among focus groups/interviews. These concepts are grouped to develop categories of concepts. Categories are then compared and grouped to develop propositions or theoretical constructs about the phenomena of interest. Dedoose software facilitates coding of observations to work toward the theoretical construct.

This trial will leverage newly defined effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to gather data on treatment implementation within an HIV care clinic, while testing the effectiveness of an evidence-based treatment for use with a large underserved population (HIV+ GBV+ women) in Kenya. This trial is likely to yield findings that will be generalizable beyond the study population and, if effective, could be scaled up for treatment of HIV+ women in Kenyan HIV clinics and perhaps other countries in sub-Saharan Africa facing a similar HIV-GBV syndemic among women.</p><p>Despite awareness of the relationships between GBV, mental disorders and HIV outcomes, this is the first study of which we are aware that intervenes on mental disorders among HIV+ GBV+ women and also collects data on HIV and neurocognitive outcomes. We expect these secondary outcomes to inform women&#x02019;s HIV care in the region and to shed light on the mechanisms of ART deficits and re-victimization commonly observed among HIV+ GBV+ women.</p><p>We recognize a number of limitations in this study. First, generalizability may be limited given that this is a single center study; future multi-center studies will be needed. Another limitation of this study is the TAU control. While TAU includes access to mental health care services, data bearing on the particular efficacy of IPT would be stronger if an active control with similar meeting schedule was included (e.g., weekly, individual supportive therapy). However, given that this study is not intended to test the efficacy of IPT, which has already been established across diverse populations and disorders, but rather to evaluate its effectiveness with a more general and diverse population (HIV+ GBV+ women with MDD and/or PTSD) when implemented by non-specialists within an HIV clinic, we have elected to focus resources on data that will inform scale-up of care.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is actively recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p>antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVLT</term><def><p>Auditory Verbal Learning Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI</term><def><p>Beck Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BVMT</term><def><p>Brief Visual Memory Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAG</term><def><p>Community Advisory Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>Center for Disease Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTS2</term><def><p>Conflict Tactics Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAST</term><def><p>Drug Abuse Screening Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACES</term><def><p>Family AIDS Care Education and Services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GBV</term><def><p>gender-based violence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HICs</term><def><p>high income countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPT</term><def><p>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KEMRI</term><def><p>Kenya Medical Research Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMICs</term><def><p>low and middle income countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDD</term><def><p>major Depressive Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MINI</term><def><p>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ODK</term><def><p>CommCare Open Data Kit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCL-C</term><def><p>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAS</term><def><p>Social Adjustment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEARCH</term><def><p>Sustainable East Africa Research on Community Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>THS</term><def><p>Trauma History Screen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCLA</term><def><p>University of California, Los Angeles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCSF</term><def><p>University of California, San Francisco</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual Analog Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHODAS</term><def><p>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHOQOL-BREF</term><def><p>World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Investigators have no competing interest to declare.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CO assisted the study launch and drafted the manuscript.
