Although significant advances in staging and treatment of patients have recently been seen, this malignancy is still lethal for the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for non-surgery patients with oesophageal cancer, and the use of cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most common chemotherapy regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, after definitive chemoradiation therapy, 5-year survival rates are poor (26%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, 20% of patients who received chemoradiation experienced life-threatening side effects, and chemotherapy could not be completed in &#x0003e;40% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, more sensitive, less toxic chemotherapy regimens are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par6">Paclitaxel is a promising agent in oesophageal cancer, with response rates of approximately 32% with single-drug treatment in locally advanced and metastatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that blocks cells in the G2M phase of the cell cycle, the most radiosensitive phase, with a sensitising enhancement ratio of 1.48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The investigation of a paclitaxel-based regimen and administration route is important for improving survival and reducing side effects. Effective and well-tolerated chemotherapy can prolong overall survival and improve quality of life.</p><p id="Par7">The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) with concurrent radiotherapy has been tested in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In several of these studies, the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin was given weekly with concurrent radiotherapy, followed by two or four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. The overall response rate varied from 71 and 79%. The major toxicity was oesophagitis: in 10&#x02013;46% of the patients a grade 3 or 4 oesophagitis was found. Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy can be given on an outpatient basis, which is advantageous. Furthermore, this regimen is probably less toxic than cisplatin-based therapy. Van Meerten et al. reported a phase 2 study of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) consisting of weekly administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The regimen was associated with a low rate of serious toxic effects, and a complete resection with no tumor within 1&#x000a0;mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in all patients who underwent resection. In the CROSS study, which included 366 patients with esophageal and gastro-oesophageal junctional tumors, the complete resection rate was increased from 69% with surgery alone to 92% with the combined therapy, with no increase in the preoperative mortality rate. Ultimately, the nCRT in this trial&#x02019;s population provided a highly significant 34% reduction of the risk of death, as well as a significant 42% reduction of the risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In comparison with cisplatin, carboplatin has a lower incidence of neurotoxicity, and is easier to administer in outpatients. Pharmacokinetic studies of paclitaxel administered with carboplatin demonstrate that area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing can be accurately predicted by the Calvert formula. On the basis of these data, we began a phase II feasibility study to evaluate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicities in advanced oesophageal cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient selection</title><p id="Par9">The eligibility criteria for the study were as follows: (1) age &#x02264;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;years; (2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0&#x02013;2; (3) cytologically or histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer; and (4) locally advanced, newly diagnosed patients with T2-4NxM0-1a or TxNxM1b (supraclavicular lymph node metastases for middle and lower thoracic oesophageal cancer or mediastinal lymph node metastases for cervical oesophageal cancer; without organ metastases according to the 6th edition of UICC) or postoperative local regional lymph node metastasis patients who did not receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p><p id="Par10">Patients were required to meet the following laboratory criteria: adequate bone marrow function (neutrophil count &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L, white blood cell count&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;4.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count &#x0003e;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L), normal renal function and normal liver function.

Planning was performed using a Megavoltage simulator with a photon energy of 6&#x000a0;MV. For previously untreated diagnosed patients and recurrent patients, the gross tumour volume (GTV) was defined as the volume of the primary tumour observed on oesophageal barium exam, upper digestive endoscopy and CT. Metastatic lymph nodes were defined as lymph nodes &#x02265;1&#x000a0;cm in the shortest axis and &#x02265;5&#x000a0;mm in the tracheo-oesophageal groove. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined by adding 3-cm margins of proximally and distally uninvolved oesophagus without including lateral margins and lymph nodes. The planning target volume (PTV) was calculated by adding 1-cm margins around the CTV, but the margins were reduced when the PTV covered the spinal cord. All patients were treated with a total dose of either 61.2&#x000a0;Gy in 34 fractions or 50.4&#x000a0;Gy in 28 fractions. The lower dose was used when patients had abdominal lymph node metastasis or tumour in excess of the limitations of normal organs, such as the lungs, spiral cord and intestines.</p><p id="Par14">Plan optimisation was as follows: (1) 99% of the PTV was covered by 95% of the prescribed dose; (2) 95% of the PTV volume was covered by the prescribed dose; (3) the maximum dose did not exceed 110% of the prescribed dose in a continuous volume of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup> in the PTV; and (4) the maximum dose of the PTV did not exceed 110% of the prescribed dose in a continuous volume of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>.

Adverse reactions to chemoradiotherapy were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 (NCI-CTC 4.0).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par16">The primary end point of this study was OS. Secondary end points comprised assessment of safety and compliance, PFS and local control (LC). Local failure was defined as recurrence or persistence within the radiation therapy PTV. Recurrence outside the treatment volume was defined as distant. OS was calculated from the first day of chemoradiation therapy to the time of the last follow-up or death. PFS was defined as the time from chemoradiotherapy day 1 to progression, death or last follow-up. We hypothesised that the addition of paclitaxel and carboplatin would increase the 1-year overall survival rate. A sample size of 59 was required to detect an increase in the 1-year survival rate from 57 to 73% with a power of 80% and &#x003b1; error (two-sided test) of 0.05. A 10% adjustment for drop-outs resulted in a sample size of 65 patients. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat population.

Toxicities of grade 3 or higher were 27.6% (18/65). The common adverse reactions were bone marrow suppression, oesophagitis and fatigue. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 73.7 and 42.0%, respectively. The median OS time was 21.7&#x000a0;months. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 50.6% and 31.1%, respectively.</p><p id="Par23">Compared to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) with concurrent radiotherapy in RTOG 85-01 and RTOG 94-05, the regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin produced less toxicity and increased OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the RTOG 85-01 study, the median survival duration was 14.1&#x000a0;months with a 5-year survival rate of 26% in the chemoradiotherapy treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse reactions occurred in 46% of the patients. In the RTOG94-05 study, patients were treated with radiotherapy doses of 64.8 and 50.4&#x000a0;Gy with PF, and the median survival times were 13.0 and 18.1&#x000a0;months, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The incidences of grade 3&#x02013;5 acute toxicity in the high-dose and low-dose groups were 76 and 71%, respectively. In our study, the median OS was 21.7&#x000a0;months, and all patients had unresectable or recurrent oesophageal cancer, including 22/34 (64.7%) previously untreated patients diagnosed in stage IV.</p><p id="Par24">Paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) regimens are the most commonly reported paclitaxel-based regimens. Compared with&#x000a0;cisplatin, the administration of carboplatin is convenient and does not require planned hydration and considerably shortens the duration of outpatient attendance. Adelstein et al. reported the use of TP in a phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The median survival was 15&#x000a0;months for patients with stage T3, N1 or M1 (nodal) oesophageal cancer, lower than that observed in our study. Neutropenia (95%) and nausea (95%) were the most frequent grade III/IV toxicities, and 16 patients (40%) experienced neutropenic fever, which must be addressed. This toxicity is significant and was higher than that in our study. Lawrence et al. reported a phase II study of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with weekly dose TP compared with irinotecan plus cisplatin for resectable oesophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The median OS survival time in the TP group was 21&#x000a0;months; however, acute toxicities grade 3&#x02013;4 occurred in 65.2%, with relatively higher haematological toxicity. In the RTOG 0113 study, one group was treated with paclitaxel plus cisplatin and a radiotherapy dose of 50.4&#x000a0;Gy, and grades 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 43 and 40% of the patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The TP regimen might have higher haematological toxicity, similar to the results of our previous phase II study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with inoperative oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our study, the grade &#x02265;3 haematological toxicity rate was 27.6%, lower than the results reported in a TP-based group study. The median OS was 21.7&#x000a0;months, which was comparable with the TP regimen studies reported.</p><p id="Par25">The CROSS study showed that neoadjuvant chemoradiation combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel concurrent with radiation significantly prolonged OS, and did not increase surgery-related mortality compared with surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, preoperative chemoradiotherapy with TC regimen is considered to be a standard of care among patients with resectable oesophageal cancer. Meerten et al. reported a phase 2 study of definitive chemoradiotherapy with weekly dose paclitaxel (50&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and carboplatin (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The median OS was 17&#x000a0;months. The grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (16%), oesophagitis (12%), fatigue (8%) and pneumonitis (2%). Honing et al. retrospectively compared definitive chemoradiotherapy with TC to PF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The median OS and PFS were 13.8 and 9.7&#x000a0;months, respectively. A higher percentage of patients with TC completed treatment compared with the PF group (82% vs 57%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.010). Van Ruler et al. retrospectively reviewed 66 patients treated with chemoradiation therapy with TC regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The median OS was 13.1&#x000a0;months. 91 and 82% of patients, respectively, completed the full course of radiotherapy and 5 courses. In our study, the concurrent chemoradiotherapy completed was 90.7%, and the median OS was 21.7&#x000a0;months. Our results are comparable in terms of completed treatment and survival using the same chemoradiotherapy regimens.</p><p id="Par26">Few studies have evaluated definitive chemoradiation therapy that included 3 cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Miyazaki et al. reported a phase II study of definitive chemoradiation therapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) in advanced oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The 2-year OS rate and median survival time were 52.9% and 24.7&#x000a0;months, respectively. However, the incidence of leukopenia and neutropenia was 91.9 and 75.7%, respectively. The KDOG 0501-P2 trial reported the use of DCF in a phase II study; the median survival was 29.0&#x000a0;months with a survival rate of 43.9% at 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Grade 3 or higher major toxicity consisted of leukopenia (71.4%), neutropenia (57.2%) and oesophagitis (28.6%). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate ranged from 54.1 to 52.4%. The DCF regimen appears to be highly active and to have relatively higher toxicity.</p><p id="Par27">The SCOPE1 trial was a phase 2/3 study assessing the benefits of adding cetuximab to definitive chemoradiation therapy (capecitabine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cisplatin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;radiation) to treat patients with localised oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The 2-year survival was 41.3% in the CRT plus cetuximab group and 56.0% in the CRT only group. The CRT plus cetuximab group also had shorter median OS (22.1 vs 25.4&#x000a0;months, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.035) and more non-haematological grade 3 or 4 toxicities (79% vs 63%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). In our study, adverse events such as myelosuppression and oesophagitis were relatively mild.</p><p id="Par28">Toxicity rates for TC in our study were comparable with the rates in the paclitaxel-based trial. The grade &#x02265;3 haematological toxicity rates of TP with concurrent radiotherapy were 47&#x02013;95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In our study, 27.6% of patients experienced grade 3&#x02013;4 hematological toxicities and 12.3% non-hematological toxicities, which was lower than that of the TP regimen. In our previous phase II study of paclitaxel and fluorouracil (TF) with concurrent radiotherapy, the occurrence of grade &#x02265;3 or higher severe events was 32% and that of haematological events was 16.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, 8 patients experienced fever and 2 patients died from radiation pneumonitis in the TF regimen. Long-term continuously infused 5-FU might lead to higher incidence of oesophagitis and fever.</p><p id="Par29">The limitations of our study are as follows. (1) The homogeneity of the patients in the group was poor; there were patients in phases II&#x02013;III and IV, and there was postoperative recurrence. (2) The radiation dose was not uniform. Although the standard radiotherapy dose is 50.4&#x000a0;Gy in Europe and the United States, the radiotherapy dose for oesophageal cancer in China is often &#x02265;60&#x000a0;Gy. Only normal tissue could not tolerate the use of 50.4&#x000a0;Gy in our study. Wang et al. reported that patients who received a radiation dose of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;Gy had a better outcome than those who received &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;Gy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, there was no statistical difference in the survival rates of patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, probably because the number of patients with adenocarcinoma was too small.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, our study indicates that weekly infused paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by 2-cycle consolidation chemotherapy, is a promising regimen with good tolerability for patients with oesophageal cancer. The limitation of our study is the small sample size. A randomised phase III trial (NCT02459457) with larger sample sizes is currently examining the efficacy of paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, carboplatin or 5-fluorouracil concurrent with radiotherapy is on-going at our hospital.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Yi Xia and Yun-hai Li share first authorship.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Research, China (Grant No. 21172043 and No. 21441010) and Natural Science Foundation of Minhang District, Shanghai (Grant No. 2014MHZ080).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par31">The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cancer statistics, 2017</article-title><source>CA Cancer J Clin</source><year>2017</year><volume>67</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3322/caac.21387</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28055103</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pennathur</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Jobe</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Oesophageal carcinoma</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2013</year><volume>381</volume><fpage>400</fpage><lpage>412</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60643-6</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23374478</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Herskovic</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced esophageal cancer: long-term follow-up of a prospective randomized trial (RTOG 85-01).
