Tinnitus is experienced as ringing, roaring, or buzzing in the ears. They all originate, in one way or the other, from inside the head, and they are all known as tinnitus. In some cases, tinnitus exists because there is actually a source of acoustic energy located somewhere in the head and neck area &#x02013; vascular anomalies, myoclonus, a clicking jaw, respiratory or cochlear otoacoustic emission, etc., &#x02013; that can also be heard by a second person, with or without the aid of special devices. However, true tinnitus is a phantom auditory perception arising from a source or trigger in the cochlea, brainstem, or at higher centers and have no detectable acoustic generator. Tinnitus is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary tinnitus is used to describe tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with sensorineural deafness. Secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural deafness) or an identifiable organic condition. It is a symptom of a range of auditory and nonauditory system disorders that include simple cerumen impaction of the external auditory canal; middle ear diseases such as otosclerosis or Eustachian tube dysfunction; cochlear abnormalities such as Meniere's disease; and auditory nerve pathology such as vestibular schwannoma.</p><p>Although the exact mechanism of tinnitus still eludes us, the most accepted is the famous neurophysiological model of Jastreboff, which stresses that tinnitus, is a subcortical perception and results from the processing of weak neural activity in the periphery. The tinnitus-related neural activity occurring usually near the periphery of the system undergoes processing in subcortical auditory pathways and finally perceived at a conscious level as sound. The loudness and pitch of tinnitus depend on the strengths and pattern of electrical activity arriving at the cortex of the temporal lobe after subcortical signal detection, and pattern matching has occurred, the process being the same as for any neural activity generated by the external sounds by the cochlea.</p><p>There has been no promising treatment for tinnitus until date mainly because the etiology of tinnitus is still not clear. The generation of tinnitus has been attributed to the auditory system and neighboring anatomical regions, but at present, no test can identify these regions accurately.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Current consensus is that tinnitus results from aberrant neural activity in the auditory system, generally of excitatory nature.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] New drugs have been emerging frequently which claim to play a role in managing tinnitus. Shemesh <italic>et al</italic>. in the year 1993 found Vitamin B12 deficiency in tinnitus patients, and its supplementation was found to help these patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The aim of this study is to determine the role of Vitamin B12 in the treatment of tinnitus. One of the mechanisms believed to be at play in Vitamin B12 deficiency neuropathy is hypomethylation in the central nervous system. Cochlear function is dependent on adequate vascular supply and the normal functioning of nerve tissue. B12 deficiency is associated with axonal degeneration, demyelination, and subsequent apoptotic neuronal death. Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause the demyelination of neurons in the cochlear nerve, resulting in hearing loss.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition, low levels of Vitamin B12 and folate are associated with the destruction of the microvasculature of the stria vascularis, which might result in decreased endocochlear potential and in hearing loss and tinnitus.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency in chronic subjective tinnitus patients in Indian population and therapeutic effect of Vitamin B12 injection on tinnitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This pilot study was conducted at Era's Lucknow Medical College from August 2012 to August 2013.

</p><p>This being a randomized, double-blind pilot study, total 40 patients were enrolled, of which 20 were in Group A (cases) and 20 in Group B (control). Group A patients (20) enrolled randomly received parenteral intramuscular therapy of 1 ml Vitamin B12 (2500 mcg) weekly for a period of 6 weeks. Group B (20) patients were given placebo isotonic saline 1 ml intramuscular in a similar manner for 6 weeks. The patient and the examiner were blinded about the treatment given. The observations were recorded by the examiner. The investigator analyzed the observations.</p><p>Patients with chronic subjective tinnitus more than 6 months duration underwent audiometry, tinnitus matching (pitch and loudness), Vitamin B12 assay (premedication and postmedication) by chemiluminescence method and a self-report by tinnitus severity index questionnaire[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] after detailed history and examination. The patients were followed for a period of 1 month after 6 weeks of interventional therapy. They were again subjected to tinnitus severity index testing, Vitamin B12 assay, tinnitus matching, Vitamin B12 assay, pure tone audiometry, and a self-report on tinnitus questionnaire.</p><p>Statistical analyses of data were conducted using the SPSS version 21.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and MS EXCEL version 7. Proportion was calculated for a categorical variable, whereas mean and standard deviation was calculated for continuous variables. Chi-square test was used to check the association between categorical variables and the student <italic>t</italic>-test was used to check the significance difference for continuous variables. The <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. The statistical model used considered gender (male, female), age group (Group 1: 17-29, Group 2: 30-49, Group 3: 50-66 age), tinnitus status (tinnitus present/no tinnitus, normal), response to treatment (yes/no), tinnitus duration, Vitamin B12 level (low/normal), and frequency.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients suffering from tinnitus was 38.37 (&#x000b1;12.40) years and the male to female ratio was 2:3. The mean duration of the complaints of tinnitus was 1.36 (&#x000b1;1.3) years [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Tinnitus presented in both ears in 27.5% and unilaterally in 72.5% (right ear in 32.5% and left in 40% cases). Of the total patients of tinnitus, 17 were Vitamin B12 deficient that is 42.5% showed deficiency when the normal levels were considered to be 250 pg/ml. This is significantly high prevalence. In Group A patients, prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency was 50%, and Group B patients, it was 35% [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test showed that in Group A, patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency showed improvement in mean tinnitus severity index score after Vitamin B12 therapy which was significant (<italic>t</italic> = 2.64, <italic>P</italic> = 0.016, df = 18). However, there was no significant improvement in severity index scores of Group A patients without B12 deficiency and Group B patients receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Furthermore, Group A patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency had a mean visual analog scale (VAS) of 3.34 &#x000b1; 0.84 before therapy and 2.89 &#x000b1; 0.47 posttherapy. The VAS showed a significant improvement with respect to tinnitus loudness (<italic>t</italic> = 2.13, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04, df = 18) after therapy. The results show favorable and encouraging outcome of Vitamin B12 therapy in vitamin deficient subjects. There was no significant improvement in other groups posttherapy. Subjective improvement was seen in six patients (30%) of Group A and four patients (20%) of Group B. The subjective improvement in tinnitus between the two groups was not statistically significant. The mean pitch (kHz) of tinnitus in patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency was 5.9 &#x000b1; 2.3 (kHz) and in normal Vitamin B12 levels was 5.6 &#x000b1; 2.7 (kHz). The mean loudness levels of tinnitus in Vitamin B12 deficiency patients were 4.2 &#x000b1; 3.1 (db SL) and in normal B12 levels is 5.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 (db SL) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. There was no significant difference in the pitch and loudness levels of two groups asserting the insignificant role of Vitamin B12 levels on pitch and loudness. It was also observed that the mean hearing thresholds of Group A and Group B were almost similar [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05]. Rest of the routine hemogram was normal in all patients. In the tinnitus severity questionnaire, patients reported maximum difficulty due to tinnitus in a quiet room, going to sleep, and difficulty in ignoring tinnitus.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Personal characteristics of the study subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 40</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (in years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.37&#x000b1;12.40</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tinnitus duration (in years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.36&#x000b1;1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (yes/no)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17/23</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of patients in Groups A and B</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Without B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group A (injection B<sub>12</sub>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group B (injection NS)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>= 0.92, <italic>P</italic> = 0.33 and df = 1, df = Degree of freedom, NS = Normal saline</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Tinnitus severity scores of patient's pre- and post-therapy with Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="top" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Mean tinnitus severity index score</th><th align="center" rowspan="3" valign="top" colspan="1">Significance <italic>t</italic>, <italic>P</italic> and df</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pretherapy</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Posttherapy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group A (injection B<sub>12</sub>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;With B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.50&#x000b1;7.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.30&#x000b1;6.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=2.64, <italic>P</italic>=0.016*, df=18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Without B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.16&#x000b1;12.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.23&#x000b1;11.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.17, <italic>P</italic>=0.85, df=18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group B (injection NS)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;With B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.80&#x000b1;8.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.30&#x000b1;8.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.11, <italic>P</italic>=0.91, df=12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Without B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.01&#x000b1;7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.10&#x000b1;7.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.38, <italic>P</italic>=0.70, df=24</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Significant as <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;

Berkiten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported 43% of the patients and 57% of the patients had bilateral and single-sided tinnitus, respectively. However, in this study, tinnitus presented more unilaterally in 72.5% (right ear in 32.5% and left in 40% cases) and in both ears in 27.5%.Though tinnitus severity was highest in Group A with normal cobalamin levels, the improvement in tinnitus severity levels were significant in cobalamin-deficient group. Tinnitus pitch and loudness levels were not found to bear any correlation with serum cobalamin levels.</p><p>Multiple theories have been put forward to account for tinnitus related to disturbances of the peripheral auditory system, the auditory nerve, and cochlea.</p><p>One of the mechanisms believed to be at play in Vitamin B12 deficiency neuropathy is hypomethylation in the central nervous system. Inhibition of the B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase results in a fall in the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the resultant deficiency in SAM impairs methylation reactions in the myelin sheath. The methylation of homocysteine to methionine requires both methylcobalamin (an active form of Vitamin B12) and the active form of folic acid (5-methyltetrahydrofolate).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Deficiency of Vitamin B12 leads to accumulation of homocysteine which is a neurotoxin and vascular toxin. Cochlear function is dependent on adequate vascular supply and the normal functioning of nerve tissue. B12 deficiency is associated with axonal degeneration, demyelination, and subsequent apoptotic neuronal death. Hcy has been implicated as a risk factor for vascular disease as well as brain atrophy.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Concentrations of Hcy above 11.9 &#x003bc;mol/L were associated with approximately 3-fold higher risk for white matter damage when compared to concentrations below 8.6 &#x003bc;mol/L.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause the demyelination of neurons in the cochlear nerve, resulting in hearing loss and tinnitus.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition, low levels of Vitamin B12 and folate are associated with the destruction of the microvasculature of the stria vascularis, which might result in decreased endocochlear potential and in hearing loss and tinnitus.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Mart&#x003bd;nez-Vega <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in their study, demonstrated, for the first time, that the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia induced by folate deficiency and premature hearing loss involves impairment of cochlear homocysteine metabolism and associated oxidative stress.</p><p>The high prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency could be attributed to dietary habits such as vegetarianism, poor intake of milk and milk products, socioeconomic factors, and high prevalence of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>. Cobalamin deficiency can manifest as neurological and hematological disorders. In view of the findings of this study, cobalamin deficiency could also present with tinnitus only in the absence of other manifestations and the authors suggest serum cobalamin determination in chronic tinnitus patients.</p><p>Just as myriad the etiology of tinnitus is equally expansive is the canvas of treatments for tinnitus ranging from different medications such as antipsychotics, vasodilators, herbs, neurotonics, cerebral cognition enhancers to tinnitus retraining therapy, psychophysiology treatment,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In the ever growing noisy world of fast life and poor dietary habits, it is imperative to seek the pathophysiology of tinnitus and find means to overcome this annoying malady. The results suggest role of evaluating serum Vitamin B12 levels in patients of chronic tinnitus in view of the significant prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in North Indian population. This pilot study sheds light on the relationship of deficient B12 levels and tinnitus and its supplementation playing a therapeutic role in tinnitus though more studies with larger groups are required to corroborate and establish a direct relationship.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Era's Educational Trust, Era's Lucknow Medical College, Lucknow, Uttar
