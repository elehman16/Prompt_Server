can influence those risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The subjects were 326 pilots
of the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; airline company in Korea whose total cholesterol values were over 220&#x02005;mg/dl on
their regular physical examinations from April 2006 to December 2008. They were divided
into two groups, one who had diet consultation (an intervention group) and a control
group. The physical examination components used to each group were body mass index (BMI),
total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and
triglyceride (TG). The behavioral, anthropometric and biomedical measurements were
collected at each visit. This study compares and investigates the changes of serum
cholesterol and also the health-behavior at each physical examination. Within the
intervention group significant improvements were observed for total cholesterol, BMI (body
mass index) and HDL (high density lipoprotein). The normalizing rates for cholesterol
level to decrease down to lower than 200&#x02005;mg/dl were 17.7% in intervention group and 8.7%
in control group, which is statistically significantly higher among the intervention
group. The odds ratio of diet consultation was 2.80 (95% CI=1.35&#x02013;5.79), which indicates
that it is a significantly contributing factor to normalize the serum cholesterol value
down to lower than 200&#x02005;mg/dl. Based on result, it is recommended to have regular physical
examination and intensive management with diet and exercise consultation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Physical examination</kwd><kwd>Diet consultation</kwd><kwd>Serum cholesterol</kwd><kwd>Health-behavior</kwd><kwd>Airline pilot</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among air crews in aviation industry, pilots particularly are responsible for transporting
the passengers and the safety of flight and, therefore, must not only have sufficient flight
experience and capability of controlling the aircraft but also maintain physical conditions
appropriate for flight duties. In order to evaluate the physical aptitude of the air pilots
for flight duties, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established a
standard for physical examination of air crews which was recommended to every
country<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the
regulation stipulated in this standard, each country is responsible to monitor the physical
conditions of pilots and issue physical examinations certificates. In conformity with this
regulation, Korea has designated specialized doctors for physical examinations of air pilots
who regularly performs physical examinations of air pilots in accordance with the physical
examinations standard and evaluate the aptitude of pilots for flight duties<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, this standard specifies only the minimum requirements for the safety of aviation.
Private airline companies are applying stricter regulations in physical examinations
spending more than fifty thousand dollars per pilot for examinations as well as
comprehensive health care in order to ensure that they maintain optimal health throughout
their service time for the safety of hundreds of passengers<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those airline companies with in-house medical
centers using it for systematic health control, in fact, show low
inaptitude-for-flight-duties rate of compared with other airliners who are, therefore,
applying their own health control standards to ensure that air pilots are kept in finest
health conditions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
United States, implementation of effective health control programs by airliners did reduce
medical inaptitude-for-flight-duties rate to one third of previous rate resulting in annual
saving of 6 million dollars<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease has been universally known as the most common cause of temporary
non-flight duty (duty not involving flight) and permanent grounding of air pilots. A study
on permanent grounding cases of air pilots in Korea for the past 21&#x02005;yr (1970&#x02212;1990) revealed
that cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumors were the most significant medical reasons
for permanent grounding covering 27% of overall cases<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and cardiovascular diseases was reported as the most
frequent cause (50%) of permanent groundings of pilots over the age of 45 in the airliners
in the United States<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Cardiovascular diseases are indeed the medical conditions that most seriously threaten the
safety of aviation because they can cause sudden pilot incapacitation or death during
flight<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, smoking, high
cholesterols blood, lack of physical exercise, obesity, diabetes are known to be corrigible
by many studies carried out since the Framingham Heart Study which is a long-term, ongoing
cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These various risk factors for
cardiovascular diseases can be treated with good dietary habit, regular exercise,
non-smoking, moderation in drinking and weight control<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dietetic therapy, in particular, is very important in
preventing and treating the cardiovascular diseases<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, it is very important to control hyperlipidemia an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, and reduce the related risk factors in order to maintain the
cardiovascular health of pilots whose duties have such vocational requirements that can
cause irregular mealtime due to personal flight schedule, mental stress about the safety of
flight and imbalance of biorhythm due to long light and time difference. There have been
some studies on risk factors relating to the blood concentration of lipid, but virtually no
analytic study on the management of blood cholesterol or preventive intervention against
cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to provide basic data for future development of cardiovascular
diseases prevention program for air pilots by analyzing the possibility of regular physical
examinations and dietary counseling in the correction of the risk factors of cardiovascular
diseases in pilots of the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; airline company who have high risk of hyperlipidemia with more
than 200&#x02005;mg/dl of total blood content of cholesterol. The objective of this study is to
identify the factors that can affect the change and normalization of total blood content of
cholesterol and to examine the effects of physical examinations and dietary counseling on
blood content of lipid and health behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Just over 1,800 pilots were employed at the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; airline company in April, 2006. Among
pilots of the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; airline company who took regular physical examinations during the period
from April 16, 2006 until December 31, 2008, total 326 pilots who found to have more blood
content of total cholesterol of over 220&#x02005;mg/dl and to have no experience of dietary
counseling were selected as the subjects of this study. Among them, 130 pilots received
dietary counseling for the first time as prescribed by the doctor and other 196 pilots did
not. Those who resigned during the study period or were taking drugs which would affect
this study results or have history of hypertension, diabetes and thyroid disease were
excluded. All the pilots who participated in this study were voluntary and their written
informed consents were obtained prior to study initiation. The experimental protocol
related to this study was approved by the ethics committee of Yonsei University, Republic
of Korea.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Personal records and computer data on regular physical examinations performed in the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d;
airline company were used as the base data for this study. The subjects, who have over
220&#x02005;mg/dl of total blood content of cholesterol and are at the risk of hyperlipidemia,
were divided into two groups, &#x0201c;the intervention group&#x0201d; who have received dietary
counseling for the first time and &#x0201c;the control group&#x0201d; who did not receive any dietary

analyzed with the results of the next physical examinations and health behavior after
counseling and prescription conducted for one year since the 1<sup>st</sup> physical
examination. The rates of normalization of total cholesterol content to below 200&#x02005;mg/dl in
the intervention and control group were compared and the factors that independently affect
the changes in blood content of lipid were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Method of investigation and measurement</title><sec><title>Investigation</title><p>On each physical examination date, physical measurements of height, weight and body
mass index (BMI) were taken for each subject as well as measurements of total
cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and
triglyceride (TG). Personal data about age, title, work period, smoking, drinking and
exercise activities were provided by the subject as guided by the investigator. For
intervention group, data about nutrition counseling education and prescription were also
collected from each subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement</title><p>Measurements of height and weight were taken using an automatic height/weight measuring
instrument when the subject is wearing thin cotton trousers and a gown without shoes.
BMI was measured as an obesity index calculated from the equation, weight (kg)/height
(m) square and obesity was defined for the measurement value of over 25, overweight for
over 23 but less than 25 and normal for below 23.</p><p>Blood tests were performed at the clinical laboratory of the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; airline company using
the blood samples taken from antecubital vein after fasting for more than 8&#x02005;h.
Biochemical measurements (TC, HDL, LDL and TG) from blood samples were taken using
automatic analyzer of HITACHI model 7170 from April 2008.</p><p>For the collection of health behavior data, subjects were divided into non-smokers,
abstinent smokers and smokers and the amount of smoking was recorded for the smokers and
abstinent smokers. For drinking behavior, subjects were divided into drinkers and
non-drinkers and the frequency and the amount of drinking were recorded for the
drinkers. Exercise activities were recorded in the frequency and the duration of
exercise for those who regularly perform exercises.</p><p>The doctor specialized in aviation health performed nutrition counseling and evaluated
the general results of biochemical tests (TC, HDL, LDL and TG), BMI and individual
health behavior to provide nutrition prescription on the physical examination day. After
physical examination, nutrition counseling was carried out at the nutrition counseling
room by a clinical dietitian who performed 1:1 counseling and provided dietary
prescription. The contents of educational counseling consisted of survey on individual
nutritional intake, evaluation of dietary habit, identification of dietetic problems,
education on dietetic therapy related to hyperlipidemia and provision of individual
dietetic prescription and leaflets about related diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis method</title><p>In this study, the subjects who were at the risk of hyperlipidemia with TC of over
220&#x02005;mg/dl were divided into the nutrition intervention group and the control group. After
evaluating the homogeneity of the two groups using <italic>t</italic>-test and
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test, BMI, blood lipid profile and health behavior at the time of the
first and the second physical examinations were analyzed using paired
<italic>t</italic>-test and McNemar test. The rates of normalization of TC to below
220&#x02005;mg/dl were then compared between the intervention group and the control group using
exact test. In order to examine the contribution of nutrition counseling to the
normalization of TC, the subjects were divided into sub-groups of those who experienced
normalization of TC to below 200&#x02005;mg/dl and those who did not at the second physical
examination and these groups were then subjected to a logistic regression analysis
controlling for age, position and work period. Multiple regression analysis was used to
examine the effects of each factor on the changes in TC. The analysis of all the data was
performed using SPSS 13.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>General characteristics</title><p>All the subjects were males of whom 38.0% was in their 40s, 34.4% in 30s and 27.6% in

Participants who undertook the

reasons.</p><p>The activities of medical section in an airline company are different in each airline and
in each country, but the prolongation of useful pilot life is the common purpose of health
management in private aviation companies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cardiovascular disease is one of the common causes of
permanent grounding or transfer to the duty not involving flight of air pilots and is also
the most serious threat to the safety of flight<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. As these diseases result in serious disabilities and
aftereffects once they occur, preventive intervention against cardiovascular diseases has
been considered as a very important issue. All the non-medication methods used to control
these diseases are related to &#x02018;life style modification&#x02019; which indicates that appropriate
life style is an effective treatment value and the term emphasizes the importance of putting
appropriate life style into practice<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The composition of the subjects of this study who are at risk of hyperlipidemia consisted
of 38% in their 40s and 34.2% in 30s indicating high risk in the ages below 50. Such a
characteristic is considered to have been the result of rapid increase in blood content of
cholesterol and intake of fatty foods for the past 20&#x02005;yr. This trend is more announced in
younger ages that have increased proportion of individuals at the risk of
hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Comparison of physical examination results between the intervention group and the control
group performed for the analysis of the effects of regular physical examinations and
nutrition counseling revealed significant change in blood content of lipids in both groups.
Blood content of total cholesterol and BMI decreased significantly in the intervention group
while blood content of total cholesterol and LDL-C decreased significantly in the control
group. HDL-C showed statistically significant decrease in both groups. In a study on the
effects of regular medical checkups on the correction of health risk factors in general
public who were the patients of university hospitals<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> showed similar results as those of this study in that
abnormalities in the measurements of clinical factors including cholesterol, blood pressure
and uric acid generally showed significant decrease. As the results of physical examinations
is directly related to the issuance of physical examination certificate and the safety of
flight under the specific circumstances of vocational characteristics of the study subjects
who participated in lifetime health program, the subjects in this study have relatively
higher interest in their health and are well motivated for disease control, particularly as
all the subjects in both the intervention group and the control group are at risk of
hyperlipidemia. Therefore, the subjects are thought to have been more aware of the necessity
of practicing the hyperlipidemia control activities.</p><p>The commercial airline pilots have regular physical examination at least over once per one
year according to international regulation and cannot perform airline operation duty if they
are below the body standard based on physical examination result. Thus, they strive to pass
the body standard by doing exercise and dietary management. There was significant difference
of TC, LDL and HDL in the control group between 1st and 2nd physical examination although
there is no dietary intervention by dietitian, which implies that pilots who received
hyperlipidemia judgment by doctor try to do personal management prior to 2nd physical
examination. Based on the result, physical examination is necessary for sustaining health
condition of pilots.</p><p>The changes in drinking, smoking and physical exercise behaviors in the intervention group
and the control group measured at the second physical examination did not show significant
difference between the two groups indicating low long-term conformity with the change of
life style. Many studies have been carried out as the efforts to reduce the health risks on
the introduction of health checkup system, strengthening of health education and improvement
of conformity with the recommendations to individuals by the doctor. However, the effects of
these programs on the changes in life style are limited and usually short-term and decrease
as the elapse of time, according to the reports<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study by Kellerman <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> on the subjects who participated
in lifetime health program also reported that voluntary participation in the program tended
to have the effect of decreasing the risk factors in smoking, drinking, exercising and
wearing safety belt but without statistic significance. In other words, changes are less
realized where voluntary efforts are necessary, indicating that systematic programs are
necessary to promote individual recognition of the requirements for health.</p><p>Some of the studies noted that individualized, specific intervention and recommendation,
rather than health campaign targeting general public which tend to be unsuccessful, is more
necessary for behavioral changes for the correction of risk factors in life style including
dietary habit<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nutrition
counseling performed in this study consisted of 1:1 individual intervention and education by
clinical dietitian who performed individual investigation and analysis of food intake,
evaluation of dietary habit and provision of dietary prescription. This intervention is
considered to have contributed to the normalization of blood content of total cholesterol in
the subjects who are at risk of hyperlipidemia.</p><p>The results of categorical regression analysis using the change in total cholesterol level
as an independent variable indicated statistically significant effect of increased exercise
on the decrease of total cholesterol. Exercise generally promotes metabolism of sugar and
its use by muscles and accelerates the use of fat in muscular tissues contributing the
correction of factors for hyperlipidemia<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, whilst appropriate amount is obviously know to be
beneficial, prescription of the amount and the types of exercise is still to be studied
further.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, medical records on the evaluation of
dietary habits of the subjects in the control group were not sufficient for the analysis of
the effects of nutrition counseling, so detailed evaluation of risk factors in dietary
habits and measures for improvement for the intervention group and the control group were
not possible. Second, a prescription by doctor was determined based on biochemical test
results (TC, LDL, TG and FBS), BMI and personal health behavior of subjects. However, two
groups (intervention and control) were not selected with identical criteria because there is
respective difference of prescription among doctors. Additionally the subjects&#x02019;
participation interests in dietary consultation were not reflected perfectively to this
study. They were voluntary and interested in the counseling and therefore perhaps more
likely to listen to the counseling. Third, questionnaires were filled in by air pilots
themselves and collected without personal confirmation procedure. Therefore, we had a
limitation that some of the answers may have been manipulated to avoid individual
disadvantage. Fourth, although nutrition counseling was given on 1:1 basis, long-term
intervention was not possible due to vocational characteristics of the air pilots including
different personal schedules. Therefore, voluntary participation in changed behavior was
difficult with only short-term intervention. Additionally it is suggested that the further
studies which can match intervention and control group based on age, position and work
period should be performed henceforth to overcome the their differences at baseline between
two groups. Furthermore, because the other factors, which were not measured in this study,
to affect the level of TC are diet factors (fat, salt, sugar and caffeine intake) and flight
time of aircrew, the further study regarding this subject should be performed in the future.
Fifth, baseline adjustments of TC between intervention group and control group were not
applied to these results. As a result, it should be considered that baseline differences of
TC between intervention group and control group may be swaying the results obtained from
this study. Finally, our finding that all the pilots investigated in this study were at high
risk could be due to regression to the mean, which would be derived from that the baseline
differences were our greatest limitation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study on the effects of physical examinations and nutrition counseling
is considered meaningful in that it analyzed the risk factors related to cardiovascular
diseases and guided the subjects of high risk to the improvement of life style that can lead
to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular disease prevention program for
air pilots in the future would be better employing the comprehensive, continuous preventive
approach encompassing all the risk factors in one program instead of implementing separate
risk factor reducing programs for individual risk factor (smoking, diet, exercise, etc).
Such program should be structured based on health behavior theory employing, for instance,
health recognition models. Also, in order to overcome the limitation posed by vocational
characteristics of air pilots&#x02019; duties, method of providing health education programs
overcoming the limitation of time and space should be developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results obtained from this study were as follows:</p><p>First, results from the consecutive two physical examinations revealed statistically
