Evidence suggests that women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have normal or higher bone mineral density (BMD) but approximately double the overall risk of skeletal fractures when compared with non-diabetic subjects.<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In the Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative Observational Cohort, BMD was significantly higher at the spine and hip in diabetic women compared with control subjects. The overall risk of fractures was higher than in non-diabetics, after controlling for multiple factors, including frequency of falls. The risk of fracture of the hip/pelvis/upper leg was also increased. In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, older women with diabetes were found to have 30% higher risk of non-vertebral fractures in comparison with non-diabetics. Information in different populations corroborates T2DM in women as an independent risk factor for fractures.<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The actions of pharmacologic treatments for T2DM on fracture risk in postmenopausal women are poorly defined. In one study, metformin (MET) was associated with decreased fracture risk, whereas in another, the use of MET was not associated with any effects.<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) rosiglitazone (RSG) and pioglitazone (PIO) have been associated with an increased risk of skeletal fractures. In ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial), a post-hoc analysis indicated that postmenopausal women treated with RSG experienced an increased risk of fractures in comparison with patients receiving MET or glyburide, with the majority of fractures reported in the upper extremity and foot.<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiovascular Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes) study, this finding was confirmed with the analysis of self-reported adverse events.<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Similarly, increased incidence of distal extremity fractures in women receiving long-term treatments with PIO for T2DM was reported in a post-hoc analysis of the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) trial.<sup><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose of this study was to understand the underlying mechanisms that could account for the increased fracture risk in T2DM subjects taking RSG as these fractures are not typically seen in osteoporotic, postmenopausal women. In addition, the loss of bone mass demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies does not explain the increase in fracture at these atypical sites. Since understanding the clinical significance of this apparent increase in fracture risk remains incomplete, the need for additional data to elucidate mechanisms by which RSG may affect bone health is necessary.</p><p>The complexity of the study with multiple types of image acquisitions, the use of a novel digitized hip X-ray radiographic technique and the examination of QCT images by quadrant justifies this separate report of the study design and baseline characteristics so these important details can be adequately described.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0007-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, multinational, active-controlled trial, was divided into 3 phases: screening, 52-week double-blind treatment with RSG or MET, and a 24-week open-label follow-up with all subjects receiving MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).

</p><p>Investigational Review Board approval was obtained and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to any trial assessments being performed. The primary end point was percentage change in BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck from baseline to Week 52 in the RSG treatment group. Additional determinations made at the lumbar spine, total hip and trochanter from baseline to Weeks 16, 28, 52 and 76 within the RSG treatment groups will be analyzed. Additional assessments include drug effects on trabecular and cortical BMD and structural analysis by quantitative computed tomography (QCT), radiographic anatomy by digitized hip radiography (HXR), and micro- and macro-architecture by wrist high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (hrMRI) within and between the RSG and MET groups. Changes in serum markers of bone remodeling, namely, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX) and procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) are being measured. In addition, serum calcium (Ca), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum total and free testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were monitored. Secondary and tertiary objectives include the evaluation, within and between the treatment groups, of change from baseline in BMD by DXA and QCT, HXR and hrMRI, at select time points and anatomical sites, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin, serum biomarkers of bone remodeling, calcium homeostasis and select sex hormone changes over time.</p></sec><sec id="S0007-S2002" disp-level="2"><title>Participants</title><p>Women from 55 to 80 years of age, &#x0003e;5 years postmenopausal, with a diagnosis of T2DM and prior antidiabetic therapy with diet and exercise alone (drug-naive) or prior monotherapy (non-TZD) for more than 2 weeks in the past 12 weeks were eligible for enrolment in the study. Furthermore, subjects had to weigh less than 136.4&#x02009;kg, and have a BMD T-score &#x0003e;&#x02212;2.5 at the femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine. At screening, HbA1c had to be &#x02264;9% for drug-naive subjects; &#x02264;8.5% for those on submaximal doses of oral antidiabetic agents and &#x02264;7.0% for subjects on maximal doses.</p><p>The main exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, uncontrolled hypertension, cancer in the past 5 years (except previously selected treated skin cancers), drug or alcohol abuse, simultaneous treatment with &#x02265;2 antidiabetic agents in the past 12 weeks, significant renal or hepatic diseases, severe edema associated with TZD use, heart failure, anemia, macular edema, and active coronary heart disease. Skeletal and mineral metabolism exclusion criteria included bilateral hip replacements, diseases affecting bone metabolism, active nephrolithiasis, and abnormal serum calcium level. Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids and previous treatment with bone active drugs, contraindications to therapy with calcium or vitamin D, MET or RSG, were exclusionary.</p><p>To obtain similar glycemic control between treatment groups, a titration algorithm of study medications was used and the study was controlled for concomitant antidiabetic medications used after randomization. At baseline, subjects on prior monotherapy were switched to study medication. RSG was started at a total daily dose of 4&#x02009;mg and force-titrated to 8&#x02009;mg. MET was begun at 1000&#x02009;mg and force-titrated to 2000&#x02009;mg. From Weeks 8 to 16, subjects with mean daily glucose (MDG) &#x0003e;110&#x02009;mg/dl at the maximum tolerated doses of blinded RSG or MET received open label sulfonylurea (SU). After 4 months of double-blind treatment, subjects with HbA1c &#x0003e;7.5% at the maximum dose of double-blind study medication could up-titrate or add open-label SU therapy at the discretion of the investigator. After 52 weeks, subjects were force-titrated to a total daily dose of 2000&#x02009;mg MET in an open-label manner. Subjects with poor glycemic control at the maximum tolerated dose of MET were up-titrated to additional open-label SU at the discretion of the investigator. Precautions to attenuate the risk of fractures during the study included: exclusion of patients with a history of osteoporosis; providing all subjects with daily supplementation of calcium (500&#x02013;1000&#x02009;mg) and vitamin D (at least 400&#x02009;IU daily); and central monitoring of BMD by DXA. If there was a BMD decrease of &#x0003e;6.0% at the lumbar spine or total hip or &#x0003e;7.0% at the femoral neck at the 7- and 12-month intervals, a confirmatory DXA scan was acquired; if the results confirmed the initial findings, the results were provided to the investigator to be discussed with the subject for appropriate management.</p></sec><sec id="S0007-S2003" disp-level="2"><title>Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry</title><p>Areal BMD was measured by DXA instruments manufactured by Hologic Inc.

At screening, subjects had DXA scans of the left femoral neck, total hip and posterior-anterior L1-L4 lumbar spine. A minimum of 3 evaluable vertebrae were required at baseline. Each subject was measured on the same DXA instrument throughout the study. Standardized procedures for evaluating monthly instrument quality control, including qualifying instrument quality control to ensure stable instrument calibration prior to enrolling subjects were conducted. Cross-calibration of the scanners was evaluated using the Bona Fide Phantom (BioClinica Inc., Newtown, Pennsylvania, United States) which was further used for calculation of any shifts in instrument calibration.

Specific measurements include regional areas, bone mineral content (BMC), BMD, T-scores and Z-scores, cortical areas, hip axis length. HSA cross-sectional dimensions were used to analyze the geometry of three femoral regions providing buckling ratio, modulus Z, neck shaft angle, cortex thickness, cross sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), cross-sectional areas (CSA), and endocortical width. The mechanical strength of the hip was estimated based on comparisons of geometric effects between the proximal femur shaft, assumed a purely cortical structure, and the narrow-neck and intertrochanteric regions, assumed mixed cortical/trabecular structures.<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S0007-S2005" disp-level="2"><title>Proximal femur radiographs</title><p>The study will explore if any of the structural bone measurements performed by Imaging Therapeutics, Inc. (ImaTx) software tools are significant in showing changes between measurements performed on hip radiographs taken at baseline and at 52- and 76-week follow-up. Measurements were performed from each available hip radiographic image using ImaTx&#x02019;s software tools. The measurements target the general morphology of the proximal femur bone, as well as properties of the cortical bone and the projected internal bone structure (bone trabeculae) such as structure length, thickness, spacing, connectivity and fragmentation. A total of 30 femoral geometry and cortical macro-anatomical-parameters were measured including hip axis length, neck-shaft angle, neck cortical thickness and shaft cortical thickness. Standardized general processing steps were implemented for each radiograph, the software was semi-automatically placed over nine regions of interest in the proximal femur radiograph and all subsequent image processing and measurement steps were fully automated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> shows an example of a hip X-ray with an overlay of the corresponding regions of interest and extracted bone structures from which all measurements were derived. Measures of micro-anatomical parameters were estimated on segmented dominant structures of projected trabecular patterns. The extracted dominant structures were processed by skeletonization to yield simplified maps of the structures within each region. The skeletonized dominant structures were used to obtain measurements of structure dimension, length, width and thickness, as well as structure distribution and fragmentation, number of nodes and loops, structure intensity distribution, and the range and values for intensity. Algorithms that measure a composite of femoral geometry, cortical dimensions, and trabecular parameters in projection radiographs were used, as described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> For each of the nine regions of interest (ROI) defined over the proximal femur image area, 26 bone parameters were derived.

Subjects were scanned using the standard protocol with an in-scan phantom with known hydroxyapatite concentrations (Mindways Software Inc., Austin, Texas, United States) to calibrate CT values to BMD. To monitor the CT system performance throughout the study, a Mindways QA phantom was scanned in conjunction with the calibration phantom in accordance with the standard prescribed procedures defined by Mindways. Quality review and QCT scan analysis occurred centrally at an image reading facility (BioClinica Inc., Newtown, Pennsylvania, United States). QCT scans were analyzed using the QCTPro&#x02122; (version 4.1.3) system from Mindways Software Inc. From the lumbar spine analysis, average volumetric BMD was calculated.

The total percentage of patients presenting with risk factors for falls at baseline was assessed, 12.9% reported poor vision, 4.9% dizziness, 4.4% difficulty in walking, 1.8% difficulties with body balance, and 1.3% cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study is to understand underlying mechanisms that could account for increased fracture risk in T2DM patients on RSG. The pattern of these fractures is not typical of fractures seen in a typical cohort postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in whom fractures of the central skeleton (spine and hip) are more common. Loss of bone mass, which has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies occurs, but these studies do not fully explain atypical sites of the fractures. A broad range of factors such as potential decrease in bone quality due to post-translational glycation of bone collagen proteins and clinical conditions such as visual impairment and/or increase in risk of falls, and lifestyle, may act synergistically on diabetic women to increase the propensity for fractures.<sup><xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In ovariectomized rats, RSG significantly reduced BMD at the whole body, lumbar spine, and proximal tibia when compared to controls, mainly due to trabecular bone loss. A 14 week trial in 50 postmenopausal non-diabetic women showed a significant reduction in total hip BMD and bone formation markers (P1NP and osteocalcin) in RSG versus placebo cohorts.<sup><xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A redirection of the pathway of stem cells from the osteoblast pathway to adipocyte lineage has been suggested as a potential mechanism by which bone formation could be reduced.<sup><xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The present study will provide information on the action of RSG and MET on multiple indices of bone mass, skeletal micro- and macro-anatomy, estimated strength, and serum markers of bone remodeling and metabolism. The design in a population of postmenopausal women with T2DM was controlled, randomized, and double-blind study. A 24-week open-label follow-up period, in which all participants discontinued their double-blind study medication and were treated with open-label MET, will allow the assessment of whether any effect of RSG on bone density and structure and serum bone markers resolved after discontinuation.</p><p>The study focused upon the femoral neck, a site of substantial cortical bone since the fractures that are being described in these patients treated with RSG were at sites comprised predominantly of cortical bone (upper humerus, hand and foot). To obtain a more complete picture of how TZDs&#x02019; effect skeletal microstructure, imaging techniques such as QCT and hrMRI were employed. This study had several limitations. There are not well accepted techniques to determine bone mass and structure at the distal limbs, sites where fractures were reported in clinical studies with RSG. Femoral neck BMD was chosen as the primary endpoint as changes can be compared with reference databases and clinical implications can be derived from changes over time. The novel image techniques were exploratory and there are not validated reference ranges for its values. The study was neither designed nor powered to demonstrate any differences between RSG versus MET in any of the parameters tested. The study population was limited to postmenopausal women, as they were at highest risk of bone loss and fracture and the results may be limited to that age and gender. Also, the 6 month extension where all subjects are placed on open-label MET may be too short to determine the reversibility of any effects noted with RSG. By its nature and design, this was a hypothesis-generating study.</p><p>Strengths of the study included randomized double-blind design, multiple simultaneous assessments of state-of-the-art imaging technology and laboratory parameters of bone metabolism, remodeling and hormonal function. The population selected was one that is at the highest risk for fracture, and was therefore clinically relevant. The baseline findings were typical of postmenopausal women with T2DM, making the findings to be obtained applicable to this population.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first prospective double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial to simultaneously evaluate the effect of a RSG on bone mass, micro- and macro-structure, and laboratory parameters reflecting bone remodeling mechanisms in a population of postmenopausal women with T2DM. The characterization of the population at baseline is concordant with women at risk for bone loss and subsequent fracture. Understanding potential effects of RSG on the indices to be measured will increase our ability to develop bone protective strategies in patients with T2DM requiring antidiabetic medications.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>This clinical study (protocol number AVD111179) is funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Barbara Kravitz (GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, 2301 Renaissance Boulevard, King of Prussia, PA 19406, USA) for assistance in review and formatting of the manuscript.
