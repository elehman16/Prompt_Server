However, evidence that incremental impact is achieved when they are combined remains limited and inconsistent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fourteen population clusters of approximately 1000 residents each in Zambia&#x02019;s Luangwa and Nyimba districts, which had high pre-existing usage rates (81.7&#x000a0;%) of pyrethroid-impregnated LLINs were quasi-randomly assigned to receive IRS with either of two pyrethroids, namely deltamethrin [Wetable granules (WG)] and lambdacyhalothrin [capsule suspension (CS)], with an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) or CS formulation of the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl (PM), or with no supplementary vector control measure. Diagnostic positivity of patients tested for malaria by community health workers in these clusters was surveyed longitudinally over pre- and post-treatment periods spanning 29&#x000a0;months, over which the treatments were allocated and re-allocated in advance of three sequential rainy seasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Supplementation of LLINs with PM CS offered the greatest initial level of protection against malaria in the first 3&#x000a0;months of application (incremental protective efficacy (IPE) [95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI)]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.63 [CI 0.57, 0.69], P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), followed by lambdacyhalothrin (IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.31 [0.10, 0.47], P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006) and PM EC (IPE, 0.23 [CI 0.15, 0.31], P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and then by deltamethrin (IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.19 [&#x02212;0.01, 0.35], P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.064). Neither pyrethroid formulation provided protection beyond 3&#x000a0;months after spraying, but the protection provided by both PM formulations persisted undiminished for longer periods: 6&#x000a0;months for CS and 12&#x000a0;months for EC. The CS formulation of PM provided greater protection than the combined pyrethroid IRS formulations throughout its effective life IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.79 [0.75, 0.83] over 6&#x000a0;months. The EC formulation of PM provided incremental protection for the first 3&#x000a0;months (IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.23 [0.15, 0.31]) that was approximately equivalent to the two pyrethroid formulations (lambdacyhalothrin, IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.31 [0.10, 0.47] and deltamethrin, IPE [95&#x000a0;% CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.19 [&#x02212;0.01, 0.35]) but the additional protection provided by the former, apparently lasted an entire year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Where universal coverage targets for LLIN utilization has been achieved, supplementing LLINs with IRS using pyrethroids may reduce malaria transmission below levels achieved by LLIN use alone, even in settings where pyrethroid resistance occurs in the vector population. However, far greater reduction of transmission can be achieved under such conditions by supplementing LLINs with IRS using non-pyrethroid insecticide classes, such as organophosphates, so this is a viable approach to mitigating and managing pyrethroid resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12936-016-1143-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>45114</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the two first-choice malaria vector control methods available globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] because they can achieve massive community-wide impact upon malaria transmission, even at partial coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is possible because many of the world&#x02019;s most potent vector species prefer people as a source of blood and must feed several times upon humans inside houses before they are old enough for infectious sporozoite-stage malaria parasites to have fully developed within them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While IRS and LLINs decrease exposure of directly protected humans to infected vectors and vice versa, through contact irritancy or spatial repellency, most of the impact of LLINs and IRS upon human transmission exposure and parasitaemia results from community-level suppression of vector population density and infection prevalence, achieved by reducing their longevity through lethal exposure to their toxic active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The success of these modes of action are influenced by the choice, dosage and formulation of insecticide utilized, as well as its coverage and mode of application, combined with the behavioural and physiological susceptibility of the targeted vector species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Compared to IRS, LLINs coverage is much higher in most endemic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] due to their flexibility of delivery mechanism and cheaper costs of implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, while most African vector populations predominantly feed indoors, at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], they may not rest on the walls after a blood meal or rest for a period insufficient to pick up a lethal dose of the active insecticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, for LLINs to be fully effective they require deliberate active participation of individuals to use them consistently and appropriately, in addition to them being regularly replaced and kept in good repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, IRS requires only initial consent by the community to have their houses sprayed and compliance with not painting or plastering over the sprayed walls for the expected duration of efficacy of the insecticide used. Additionally, a major advantage of IRS over LLINs is simply that the treated surfaces are rarely in direct contact with occupants of protected houses so the safety requirements for active ingredients that may be used are far less stringent and a much wider variety of active ingredients can therefore be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The evidence on the effects of combining IRS and LLINs varies, with some studies suggesting an incremental benefit of using both interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while others suggest that IRS adds no incremental impact relative to LLINs alone and/or vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], that LLINs alone have greater impact than IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and others again indicate that the contrary is true [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These diverse comparisons between IRS and LLINs are based on a variety of outcome measures which include impacts on vector densities or entomological inoculation rates, including prevalence, incidence or diagnostic positivity of parasitaemia among humans, and the relevant costs of providing such protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Currently there are four classes of insecticides approved for use in IRS formats: organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but only the pyrethroids are considered safe enough for use in LLINs. The wide-scale deployment of pyrethroids in both LLIN and IRS formats has undoubtedly exerted considerable selection pressure upon vector populations, resulting in the rapid and widespread emergence of physiological resistance to these active ingredients, which may negatively influence the efficacy of LLINs in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a reduction in use of pyrethroids for IRS, particularly in areas where LLIN deployment has been scaled up to reach high coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, IRS application of multiple insecticides from different classes, ideally with complementary modes of action and non-overlapping resistance mechanisms, in rotations or mosaics is recommended as the optimal means of insecticide resistance management in the short-to-medium term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Unfortunately, the utilization of organochlorines for IRS, particularly DDT, has been discouraged and scaled down due to concerns about potentially negative environmental effects associated with their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The remaining recommended formulations of organophosphates and carbamates have not been extensively used in IRS programmes due to their comparatively high cost and relatively short residual periods of approximately 2&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which necessitates spraying more than once in areas with protracted transmission seasons or perennial transmission. Fortunately, new formulations of the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl (PM) have been brought to market for public health use that appear to offer increased and prolonged efficacy, notably against pyrethroid-resistant vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Given the substantial additional cost of supplementing LLINs with IRS, especially with such expensive new insecticides, and the persisting controversy about whether incremental protection against malaria is accrued, it is important to directly evaluate such combinations at community-level with epidemiological primary outcomes and explanatory entomological secondary outcomes in representative malaria-endemic settings. Thus, the overall aim of the study was to evaluate the incremental impact of supplementary vector control with IRS upon malaria transmission by the widespread and highly efficient African vector <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> in a study area with relatively high usage rates of pyrethroid-impregnated LLINs, using either one of two different formulations of pyrethroids, or one of two different formulations of the new PM organophosphate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in the predominantly rural districts of Luangwa and Nyimba, located in Lusaka and Eastern provinces, respectively, of the Republic of Zambia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>These districts have perennial transmission of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, with the overwhelmingly predominant vector being <italic>An. funestus</italic>, which mediates a mean entomological inoculation rate (EIR) for non-users of LLINs of approximately 70 infectious bites per unprotected person per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Both parasitological and entomological assessments were conducted continuously from January 2011 to March 2013 in Luangwa and from April 2011 to March 2013 in Nyimba district in all clusters.</p><p>The pyrethroid deltamethrin [wettable granule (WG) formulation] was sprayed in all consenting households at the four southernmost clusters in Luangwa in October 2010, immediately before that year&#x02019;s rainy season and initiation of this study. During the study period, three other selected IRS insecticide treatments [capsule suspension (CS) formulation of the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin, as well as the emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and CS formulations of the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl (PM)] were randomly allocated to clusters in advance of each rainy season. In practice this randomized allocation was not strictly adhered to by the implementation agencies in the two districts (District Medical Office (DMO) in Luangwa and Abt Associates under the supervision of the DMO in Nyimba), thus resulting in a quasi-randomized study design, described cartographically in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The parasitological and entomological surveys were conducted by paid CHWs as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and summarized below. In the south of Luangwa district, between October and November 2010, clusters 4, 5, 6, and 7 received pyrethroid-based IRS with deltamethrin (K-Othrine WG<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 250, Bayer Environmental Science, South Africa) as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a.

Trained CHWs conducted HLC from 18.00 to 06.00&#x000a0;h, with the exception of the previously described 2010 studies where the starting time was 19.00 and finished at 07.00.

Mosquitoes were collected for 45&#x000a0;min per hour to allow a 15-min break for rest and refreshment for the collectors. Each hourly collection were labelled and kept for identification to genus and species as described above. The proportion of time that residents spent outdoors and indoors, as well as asleep in bed, was estimated directly from answers to questionnaires during a cross-sectional household survey in April 2010 in Luangwa district, in which people indicated the time they usually went indoors and when they went to the bed as well as when they arose in the morning and when they left their houses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data management and statistical analysis</title><p>The CHW Malaria Register data describing rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results associated with questionnaire responses were double entered into Excel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, verified, reconciled, and then cleaned following descriptive frequency analysis of the distributions of values for each variable.

It also proved to be a more consistent and robust indicator of geographic and temporal variation than absolute numbers of malaria infections detected, presumably because variations in CHW service utilization rates, as well as RDT and ACT availability, occur in both the nominator and denominator of DP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and was therefore treated as the primary epidemiological outcome used for statistical analysis of the effects of various IRS treatments, rather than incidence in terms of detected events per number of participants per unit time.</p><p>Four sequential time period categories, based on the integer number of months since the most recent spray round was completed were created for all the IRS treatments: 1&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months since beginning of the last spray round started, as well as a fifth category combining areas that had not yet received spraying during the study period and those for which the last spray round began more than 12&#x000a0;months ago, which was treated as the reference value. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted to evaluate the association between observed malaria infection risk among human residents and the various IRS treatments applied. Malaria infection status was treated as the binary dependent, with use of an LLIN, having slept in a house that had been treated with IRS in the previous 6&#x000a0;months and the categorized cluster-wide IRS treatments as the independent variables of primary interest. Age category (&#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;4, 5&#x02013;10, 11&#x02013;14, 15&#x02013;24, 25&#x02013;44 and &#x0003e;45&#x000a0;years of age), sex, season (hot and wet from December to April, cool and dry from May to August, and hot and dry from September to November), number of previous RDTs conducted per individual and geographical location (cluster) were also included as independent variables of secondary interest (all categorical except for number of RDTs) while random effects to capture variance associated with nuisance variables of no direct interest were also included in the model (the individual identity number nested within the CHW catchment nested within the study cluster, as well as date of participant contact). IPT use was not included in the final model as an independent variable because it had no apparent effect on malaria infection prevalence (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.8633). Further, in order to test for and quantify incremental impact of PM IRS as a supplement to LLINs, relative to LLINs supplemented with pyrethroid-based IRS, both pyrethroid formulations were represented by a single treatment variable, coding the same periods of months since before spraying. Similarly, in order to test for and quantify the incremental impact of the CS formulation of PM, relative to the EC formulation of the same active ingredient, as well as the two pyrethroid formulations, an additional variable was created which combined any previous treatment with any of the latter three formulations in the reference group. In all cases, incremental protective efficacy (IPE) was calculated as the complement of the odds ratio (OR) estimated directly by these GLMMs (IPE&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02212;OR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Incremental protection of humans against human exposure to mosquito bites and malaria parasite inoculation by IRS treatments</title><p>The effect of different IRS treatment regimens on densities of <italic>An. funestus</italic> species were estimated by fitting GLMMs where <italic>An. funestus</italic> densities were treated as a dependent variable with a Poisson distribution.

Similarly, nightly temporal variance in vector density was accounted for by including date as an additional random effect. The different IRS treatment regimens were coded in terms of time period since the last round of IRS application began, exactly as described above for the epidemiological primary outcomes, so that these treatments could be included as categorical independent variables with which to detect and quantify impact upon these entomological secondary outcomes. In all, the relative rate (RR) at which mosquitoes were captured was calculated as estimated directly by these GLMMs. Unfortunately, efforts to develop laboratory capacity for determining sporozoite infection status by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at NMCC were unsuccessful so neither sporozoite prevalence nor entomological inoculation rate could be assessed as additional entomological secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Physiological resistance to insecticides</title><p>Insecticide susceptibility assays were conducted on 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;day-old F1 generation <italic>An. funestus</italic> as described by the WHO standard protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] using papers impregnated with deltamethrin (0.05&#x000a0;%), lambdacyhalothrin (0.05&#x000a0;%), bendiocarb (0.1&#x000a0;%), malathion (0.1&#x000a0;%) or DDT (4&#x000a0;%).

The model of resistance time trends for the two pyrethroids, the identities of these two insecticides within this class were included as a categorical independent variable.

Alarming rates of resistance to the carbamate bendiocarb were also observed but these did not increase over the course of the study (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.565).

Overall supplementing of LLINs with IRS using PM-CS gave the greatest apparent protection against malaria risk, which lasted for a full 6&#x000a0;months, while IRS with PM-EC conferred less dramatic protection that was comparable with pyrethroids but apparently lasted for one full year. Neither of the two pyrethroid formulations exhibited any incremental protective effect for more than 3&#x000a0;months, but it is notable that LC-CS conferred an apparently greater protective effect than DM-WG. These observations that quasi-randomly assigned IRS treatments conferred additional protection when provided as a supplement to LLIN utilization, are consistent with a variety of other observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], as well as more recent randomized controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The high level of incremental impacts observed, despite sometimes mediocre coverage with IRS, are actually consistent with the predictions of process-explicit models used to support the policy switch to universal coverage for both LLINs and IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], especially for a very anthropophagic mosquito such as <italic>An. funestus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is even more anthropophagic than the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] used as an example mosquito in that simulation paper.</p><p>The high protective effect of PM-CS is also evident in the low densities of <italic>An. funestus</italic> caught in that group. The modest and short-lived protective effect of the two pyrethroid formulations, DM-WG and LC-CS, most probably a result of the emergence of resistance to pyrethroids in the <italic>An. funestus</italic> population present in this study area, consistent with evidence from Benin in west Africa that the protective effect of these insecticide formulations can be dramatically reduced to as little as a month by physiological resistance, even where these specific formulations have a residual activity against susceptible, insectary-reared, mosquitoes for up to 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While this rapid loss of incremental protection towards malaria elimination with pyrethroid-based supplementary IRS is of obvious and very direct concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the encouraging results obtained with IRS using PM, the CS formulation in particular, provide further evidence that pyrethroid resistance may be mitigated and managed in areas of high LLIN coverage using IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], or alternatively impregnating wall linings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] with non-pyrethroids selected on the basis of standard WHO susceptibility assays. These observations are therefore consistent with similar recent reports from several distinct settings across Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and can be readily rationalized on the basis of the combined observations of strong resistance to pyrethroids, complete susceptibility to organophosphates, and strong tendency to feed and presumably rest indoors among the local <italic>An. funestus</italic> population.</p><p>It was expected that PM-CS would be the most persistent because this micro-encapsulated formulation is known to confer residual longevity for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] as confirmed here. However, it was surprising that PM-EC had the longest longevity on these surfaces, apparently lasting 12&#x000a0;months after spraying, contrary to other studies suggesting that PM-EC is ineffective on mud surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and WHO estimates of a residual effect of only 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] but is consistent with one other recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. While it is possible to speculate that the persistence of PM-EC may have resulted from an initial absorption into the porous mud walls in most of the houses in the study areas, followed by slow subsequent release, it is also possible that this is simply the result of a spurious model fit to data from such a limited number of treated clusters with considerable intercluster variation in malaria risk level and seasonality, as presumably occurred for DM-WG, which is highly unlikely to have really increased malaria transmission (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) or vector density (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The observation that impact of both PM formulations and LC-CS upon vector density was greatest between 4 and 6&#x000a0;months after spraying suggests that maximum impact upon the vector population required sustained impact upon several generations of mosquitoes, well into the peak rainy season when they would be expected to grow exponentially and improve in reproductive fitness as the availability of larval habitat rapidly increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>Of course, there are several substantive limitations to this study. While the community-based nature of both the parasitological and entomological surveys, with only modest supervision and quality assurance, does leave some uncertainties about the data quality, recent detailed analyses of these primary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and secondary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] provide reassuring confirmation of their epidemiological relevance and discriminative power. An additional limitation lies in the lack of a comprehensive quality assurance system for the RDTs results, comparing them with better-established tests, such as microscopy, or more sensitive diagnostic tests, such as polymerase chain reaction. In spite of the known limitations in the sensitivity of RDTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], it is encouraging that this specific test kit product, applied in exactly the manner described here, proved a robust means of monitoring infection and disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While this study did not explicitly or comprehensively track the distinct costs of IRS and LLINs, these costs may be assumed to be incurred largely independently of each other because of their distinct delivery methods, and have already been evaluated in detail across a variety of settings by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, the most obvious limitation of this study is that it was not conducted as a rigorous randomized control trial and that deviations from the original randomization plan resulted in only a quasi-randomized design in practice, with known selection biases. This was also coupled with a lack of a statically estimated sample size. An additional considerable limitation arising from dependency on delivery of supplementary IRS through routine programmatic implementation mechanisms was the lack of consistent availability of a single, optimal formulation of a single pyrethroid or a single formulation of PM, so the study was unfortunately fragmented into more treatment arms with smaller numbers of assigned clusters per spray round than originally planned. Also, delays and limitations in the availability of PM formulations in the final year of the study resulted in a mismatch in the timing of application of PM-CS in Nyimba (November 2012), PM-EC and LC-CS (both February 2013).</p><p>So, in summary this study was not fully randomized because the implementation contractors did not fully adhere to the study design stipulated to them by the NMCC. This study may therefore be described as a quasi-randomized experimental evaluation to generate plausible evidence that the IRS treatments provide effective incremental impact beyond that already provided by high coverage with LLINs under near-programmatic conditions. The biggest inherent limitation of observational studies is their vulnerability to selection bias and confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The study largely adhered to its original randomization plan, and some of the most confounding variables were taken into consideration during planning and implementation (stratification of clusters into those that had previously been sprayed with deltamethrin and those that had not) and analysis (additional variables in regression models) phases. However, the deviations from the randomization plan by the implementing agencies were specifically necessitated by product stock availability and motivated by efforts to target IRS to areas where they felt it was needed most, so treatment allocation was clearly systematically biased a priori in these cases. It is therefore prudent to interpret the level of evidence generated conservatively, and to classify this study as being essentially observational in nature. To generate probable evidence of efficacy under more precisely controlled (if somewhat less programmatically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]) conditions would have entailed a rigorous, fully-randomized trial with a registered protocol including sample size estimates, data quality assurance and oversight committees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p>While the shortcomings of this study must be accepted, there is no obvious specific reason to suggest that they are inaccurate, and they do contribute to a relatively limited evidence base regarding the incremental impact of IRS formulations as supplements to LLINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite these study design limitations, the evidence generated remains useful for guiding programmatic selection of IRS treatments. Perhaps just as important, it represents the first effort of the NMCC itself, rather than its specialist research and academic partner institutions, to conduct a cluster-randomized experimental evaluation of malaria transmission control measures. It represents, therefore, an invaluable experience through which the capacity of the NMCC has grown and can hopefully build upon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite these study limitations, the results presented here do provide substantial evidence that: (1) supplementing pyrethroid-based LLINs with pyrethroid-based IRS confers some, albeit short-lived, incremental protection against malaria infection relative to LLINs alone; and, (2) replacing pyrethroids with an alternative insecticide class, in this case a long-lasting CS formulation of the organophosphate PM, as the active ingredient for supplementary IRS confers considerably enhanced protection, relative to IRS with pyrethroids. Supplementing LLINs with IRS using non-pyrethroids therefore appears to be efficacious for mitigating the immediate epidemiological consequences of vector population resistance to pyrethroids, and the observed impact on <italic>An. funestus</italic> densities suggest it may also be a valuable option for managing such resistance traits, ideally by using mosaics, rotations or combinations of complementary active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Of course the primary limitation to the realization of such insecticide resistance management and mitigation plans in practice are: (1) the availability of more efficacious, affordable and diverse insecticide formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]; (2) increased financing for malaria vector control generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]; and, (3) more cost-effective methods for targeting insecticides to vector populations so that both the biological resource coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and mortality rates arising from exposure to their active ingredients are maximized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2016_1143_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
