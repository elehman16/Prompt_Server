Various acceptance and usage issues in relation to telehealth, as used by frail older people and their carers, were investigated. This paper reports participant acceptance of in-home telehealth, and evaluates telehealth acceptance as a predictor for usage compliance. The results indicated that before being trained in and using telehealth, the majority of participants had accepted the technology by agreeing it would be useful and easy to use. This acceptance was also reported post-TCP (up to 12 weeks of usage). The perceived ease of use of the telehealth equipment increased significantly from pre-training and usage to post-TCP (up to 12 weeks of usage) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). There was no change, (pre-training and usage to post-TCP) in the perceived usefulness of the telehealth equipment. The telehealth acceptance constructs of ease of use and usefulness, at pre-telehealth training and usage, were not a significant predictor of future compliance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). Perceived ease of use, at pre-training and usage, had a positive relationship with future compliance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>The reported acceptance of telehealth at both pre- and post-usage, and the result that perceived ease of use increased significantly after equipment usage, is consistent with other findings. Huis et al, in a study utilizing the TAM to explore home telehealth acceptance and compliance in chronic pain management, found that participants with chronic pain had a high acceptance of the telehealth equipment pre- and post-usage, and that perceived ease of use increased significantly after usage, whilst perceived usefulness did not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-rmhp-5-025">11</xref> The present study extends the evidence base by demonstrating that this association is not limited to people with chronic pain, but that the same relationship exists in frail older people with a range of medical conditions that lead to a need for transition care and their carers.</p><p>Huis et al concluded that the increase in perceived ease of use may be due to participants finding the equipment easier to use than initially expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-rmhp-5-025">11</xref> This could be the case in this present study. However, the increase could also be accounted for by the participant&#x02019;s skill at using the telehealth equipment improving with training, resulting in a higher post-training and usage perception of ease of use.</p><p>Also, it should be noted that although the perceived usefulness of the equipment did not significantly increase (pre- to post-usage) the majority of participants and carers had already &#x0201c;strongly agreed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;agreed&#x0201d; to its perceived usefulness at pre-usage. This high level of pre-usage agreement may have influenced the nonsignificant difference in perceived usefulness pre- to post-usage.</p><p>Although the acceptance constructs of perceived ease of use and usefulness, at pre-training and usage, were not a significant predictor of future compliance, perceived ease of use at pre-training and usage was positively correlated with future compliance. This significant relationship is important given that the influences and determinants of telehealth compliance are poorly understood. As such, this relationship needs to be further explored. As previously noted, unless the influences and determinants of compliance are known, interventions to improve compliance are unlikely to be successful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-rmhp-5-025">9</xref> Understanding the contributors to, and influences of, pre-usage perceived ease of use and its relationship with compliance could assist in the development of interventions designed to maintain high usage compliance rates in home telehealth with frail older adults and their carers.</p><p>In this study, although telehealth perceived ease of use, at pre-training and usage, could have been influenced by participant low technology skills, it is unlikely that low technology skills also influenced usage compliance. Any participant with low technology skills when completing the telehealth acceptance questionnaire at pre-training and usage had, through subsequent training and assessment by BCS staff, a competent skill level by the time they used the study equipment. This point is supported by the fact that user error to the end of TCP only accounted for 6% of the failure rate as compared with 30% for noncompliance. If those using the equipment lacked usage skill during the study, then the user error would have contributed to a higher percentage of the reading failure rate, which it did not. Given this, whilst a low technology usage skill level may have influenced perceived ease of use prior to participants being trained in and using the equipment, it most likely did not impact on usage compliance. This is due to all participants being competent in using the equipment by the time monitoring commenced. Future research would benefit by exploring factors that both influence perceived ease of use at pre-training and usage, and also account for the significant relationship between perceived ease of use at pre-training and usage, and future usage compliance.</p><p>This study explored the relationship between telehealth acceptance (measured by the TAM constructs of ease of use and usefulness) and usage compliance. Telehealth acceptance though is not the only factor that has been hypothesized as having a relationship with telehealth usage compliance. Equipment training and support have also been suggested as possibly impacting on differences in compliance rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-rmhp-5-025">17</xref> As previously noted, all participants in this study received the same training and had to be competent in using the equipment before they commenced. As such, it is unlikely that training impacted on differences in usage compliance rates. However, differences in the amount of staff support given to each participant during the study could have been influential. If a participant did not ask for help, staff may not have realized that additional support was needed, and this could have influenced participant compliance. Given the importance of understanding usage compliance, future research is needed to explore factors, apart from acceptance, that could influence or be a determinant of compliance, such as support.</p><p>The TAM responses analyzed for this paper were provided by either a participant, n = 17 (53%), or a carer of a participant, n = 15 (47%). Although it could be suggested that the differences in age and frailty between carers and participants may have resulted in differences in the reported acceptance of the monitoring system, independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test revealed that for this study this was not likely the case. There were no significant differences in the TAM responses provided by the participants or the carers for both pre- and post-telehealth usage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-rmhp-5-025">Table 2</xref>), and follow-up analysis revealed that the magnitude of the effect sizes were small to very small.</p><p>As previously noted, 32 participants and carers who used the telehealth equipment, and completed TCP, recorded a 12% telehealth reading failure rate. This failure rate consisted of staff not following up missed or incomplete readings, equipment failure, participant noncompliance, and user error. This paper examined the relationship between pre-usage telehealth acceptance and compliance. Future research would benefit by investigating the relationship, if any, between preusage telehealth acceptance and the other telehealth failure rate variables.</p><p>A number of limitations of the study should be noted, in particular the small sample size. The strict exclusion criteria was essential, both to maximize participant safety and to ensure reliable readings. This, in turn, resulted in low eligibility and participation rates, which limits the representativeness of this sample and the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>The small sample size also reduced the power of the statistical analysis, which may have, in some instances, resulted in an effect being missed; for example, in the regression analysis which approached, but did not reach, statistical significance at <italic>P</italic> = 0.06. In addition to this, the small sample size resulted in groups being collapsed. Future research in this area would benefit from a larger sample size, which would increase the power of the statistical analysis and allow for groups to not be collapsed.</p><p>It should also be noted that the high rate of usage acceptance could have been influenced by the fact that those who agreed to take part in the study knew that they may possibly receive telehealth equipment. Therefore it is possible that those agreeing to take part were more motivated and had a higher acceptance of the technology. This may have resulted in an over selection of individuals with an established interest and/or comfort in using the equipment.</p><p>Eight participants (totaling 42% of the drop-outs) did not complete the study either because the participant no longer wanted to be part of the study, or their carer, if they had one, no longer wanted them to be part of the study. Unfortunately those participants, or their carer, did not provide a reason for exiting the study beyond the fact that they no longer wished to take part. This is a limitation of the study. However, to determine whether difficulty in using the system was a reason why those participants may have exited, the telehealth reading data were examined. This revealed that all but one of the participants recorded a smaller reading failure rate (which included user error and compliance rates) than the average failure rate of the participants who completed the study. This suggests that the ease of using the equipment was not a likely factor in the reason(s) why they dropped out.</p><p>If a reading was missed or incomplete, the BCS data monitoring officer was required to contact the participant (or their carer) to check on the participant&#x02019;s welfare and to determine, if possible, the reason for the missed or incomplete reading. As such, participants were aware that their vital signs were being monitored as they were provided with feedback about this. However, a limitation was that the BCS data monitoring officer did not, in all instances, follow up missed or incomplete readings, and this may have impacted on the participant&#x02019;s perception of the usefulness of the equipment.</p><p>Strengths of this study include that it was undertaken in the conditions in which the population of frail older people entering transition care after hospital discharge would be using the equipment. Also, this paper explored potential influences and determinants of home telehealth compliance with older people. As this area of research enquiry is one where there are few data, and it relates to safety, the findings are important.</p><p>In conclusion, in what are potentially the largest users of home telehealth, there is currently limited knowledge about the influences and determinants of home telehealth compliance in frail older adults and their carers. As compliance is directly linked to the safe usage of home telehealth, the finding that pre-usage perceived ease of use is related to future compliance is important. Further research is needed to explore not only this relationship but also other potential influences and determinants of home telehealth compliance in this group. Knowledge about the influences and determinants of home telehealth compliance would assist the development of targeted interventions aimed at encouraging high compliance with users who are recording lower reading rates. Given the frailty of this population, and the safety issues relating to usage compliance, this is important.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was conducted in conjunction with Baptist Community Services, NSW and ACT, Australia.
