Its treatment is often symptomatic and includes topical and systemic corticosteroids. Although corticosteroid therapy is usually successful, it has side effects and thus, an alternative treatment is favorable. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of topical curcumin and triamcinolone for treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this study, 50 patients (36 women and 14 men) in the age range of 38 to 73 years with OLP were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received 0.1% triamcinolone or 5% curcumin oral paste three times a day for four weeks. Assessment of the appearance score and severity of pain was done at baseline and at the end of two and four weeks and recorded in the patients&#x02019; questionnaires. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17 software, using the Mann-Whitney and Spearman's tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With respect to pain reduction, nine patients (36%) in the curcumin group and eight patients (32%) in the triamcinolone group showed complete remission. With respect to the appearance score, one patient (4%) in each group showed complete remission. No statistically significant difference was noted between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Application of curcumin is suggested for treatment of OLP because of its desirable anti-inflammatory effects and insignificant side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Curcumin</kwd><kwd>Lichen Planus</kwd><kwd>Triamcinolone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oral lichen planus is an immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology with the mediation of T cells [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], in which the symptoms of patients decrease with an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> counts [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Oral lichen planus lesions can be of reticular, papular, plaque-like, bullous, erythematous (atrophic) and ulcerative forms.</p><p>Ulcerative lesions are the most debilitating form of OLP [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which develop painful symptoms and interfere with eating, speaking, swallowing and tooth brushing [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Corticosteroids are usually successful for controlling the symptoms of the disease [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; but because of the side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy such as secondary candidiasis, telangiectasia, hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal suppression [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], muco-cutaneous atrophy and increased potential of systemic absorption, it may be better to avoid their long-term use [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Curcuma longa is a perennial plant belonging to Zingiberaceae family [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been used for centuries in the Indian traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Its main constituents include three curcuminoids including curcumin (the primary ingredient and the one responsible for its yellow color and anti-inflammatory effect), demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin.</p><p>Chainani-Wu in a systematic review [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and others [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] confirmed the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, wound healing and anticarcinogenic effects as well as safety of curcumin.</p><p>Clinical studies assessing curcuminoids have evaluated its utilization in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, postsurgical inflammation and chronic uveitis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The curcuminoids are safe even in high doses and only a few side effects have been reported [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Since oxidative stress may play a role in pathophysiology of OLP [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and by noting that OLP is a chronic inflammatory disease [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the herbs which have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may efficiently control OLP.</p><p>Chainani-Wu et al, in 2007 and 2012 assessed the efficacy of systemic administration of curcuminoids for treatment of OLP [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Efficacious results were obtained in controlling the signs and symptoms of OLP using high doses of this herb. Concerning noticeable side effects reported by patients who used corticosteroids [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], chronic nature of OLP, risk of oral candidiasis upon usage of topical corticosteroids, and fewer side effects, safety and anti-inflammatory properties of curcuminoids, we aimed to clinically evaluate the efficacy of curcuminoids for treatment of OLP, compared with conventional corticosteroid therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical trial was conducted on 50 patients (36 women and 14 men) in the age range of 38 to 73 and a mean age of 50.66 years. The patients had clinical signs of OLP (atrophic and ulcerative forms), and the disease was confirmed by clinical and histopathological examination.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were pregnancy and lactation, current use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents (curcumin has inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation) [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], current orthodontic treatment, history of gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, gallstones (curcumin may induce gastric irritation and stimulate gall bladder constrictions) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], hepatic diseases (curcumin may cause hepatotoxicity in some mammals including mice and rats) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], any existing malignancy or viral infections in the mouth, history of topical treatment for OLP in the past two weeks or any systemic treatment for OLP in the past four weeks, taking azathioprine, cyclosporine or receiving Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in the past month and history of allergy to corticosteroids or curcumin [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The crushed roots of C. longa L. were purchased from a drugstore in Rasht city in Iran and identified by a research fellow.</p><p>The ground herbal root (1g) was extracted using 10 mL of 96% ethanol boiling in a water bath for three minutes and the least volume of solvent was added to the given aliquot. Each sample was centrifuged at 8000g for 10 minutes; then the supernatant was filtered with a syringe filter (0.45&#x003bc;m). This mixture included curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin in lower amount.</p><p>Patients were given complete information about their disease and also about curcumin and triamcinolone pastes and then they were asked to participate in the study by signing an informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee of Guilan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>This clinical trial was also registered under the code IRCT2001105012950N2. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 25.</p><p>The sample size of 25 was chosen based on expected and actual enrollment of study subjects over a two-month time period. Because of feasibility reasons the enrollment was stopped at 25 subjects. A blocked randomization (block size of six) was used. The pharmacy of Guilan University of Medical Sciences supplied curcuminoids and triamcinolone in the form of similar oral pastes and generated the randomization sequence using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Seattle, WA). Both participants and investigators were blinded to the treatment assignment. All the patients were examined and the age, sex, medical history, smoking status, form and location of oral lesions, duration of the disease, type of treatment received, severity of pain and appearance score were all recorded. Then, the patients received 0.1% triamcinolone or 5% curcumin paste for four weeks and were asked to apply it three times a day after eating and brushing, and then they were advised to avoid eating for 20 minutes. Measurement of the appearance score and severity of pain was done at baseline and at the end of two and four weeks and recorded in the patients&#x02019; questionnaires.</p><p>To determine the severity of pain, we used a visual analog scale (VAS) and patients ranked the severity of pain on a 10-cm horizontal line graded from 0 to 10; 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the most severe pain [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To determine the appearance score, we used the criteria by Thongprasom et al, with the below mentioned classification:

Poor response was defined as less than 50% reduction in signs and symptoms. If the status of lesions showed no change, the case was considered as no response.</p><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS version 17 software using the Mann-Whitney and Spearman&#x02018;s correlation tests. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty-five patients participated in this study.

Therefore, OLP is considered to be a potentially dangerous and malignant disease and has attracted the attention of clinicians [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Most of the previous studies assessed the effects of corticosteroids [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and one immunosuppressive drug and in all of them the results in both participating groups were the same and equally successful; but since topical use of corticosteroids may lead to oral candidiasis and other side effects and also considering the chronic nature of OLP, it would be better to find an alternative treatment. Also, it has been reported that tacrolimus and pimecrolimus may increase the risk of malignancy in patients using these drugs topically for their cutaneous psoriasis. These medicines should be used in limited cases and their consumption is advised to be in minimal doses and for a limited time [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, we used curcumin; its safety, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects have been confirmed in many previous studies [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The clinical efficacy of curcumin was compared with that of a topical corticosteroid, which is the standard treatment for OLP. It was concluded that in addition to effectiveness of curcumin for treatment of OLP, its effects were similar to those of topical corticosteroids, and thus, it can be a suitable alternative to corticosteroids. Chainani-Wu et al. in 2007 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used curcumin for treatment of OLP in a placebo controlled clinical trial. Curcuminoids were prescribed as tablets, at a dosage of 2000mg/day for seven weeks.</p><p>They concluded that systemic administration of curcumin was not successful for treatment of OLP. Systemic administration of curcumin in the study by Chainani-Wu et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was different from its topical administration in the current study; the topical administration increases the efficacy of the drug.</p><p>Chainani-Wu et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] administered a primary dose of systemic prednisone (60 mg/day for the first week) in both groups, which was not done in our study and could have affected their final results. Long periods of observation not only can interfere with patient compliance and cooperation (less subject retention until the end of study), but also can affect the treatment outcomes. For this reason, they recommended future studies with shorter follow-ups. In the current study, the final follow up session was at four weeks. The dosage of curcumin that Chainani-Wu et al, in 2012 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] used in their study for treatment of OLP was higher than the dosage of curcumin in our study. They used systemic curcumin, with a dose of 6000mg/day. Interestingly, they found curcumin to be effective for controlling the signs and symptoms of OLP. It was well tolerated by the patients and its safety was also confirmed at this dosage.</p><p>The observation period was reduced to two weeks in their latter study, which was closer to our study, compared to seven weeks in their former study. Our sample size was similar to their latter study, as they enrolled 20 patients. Concerning their findings, erythema, mucositis and ulceration significantly decreased after using curcuminoids. An interesting finding of our study was the insignificant difference between the two groups in the reduction of pain and appearance score (there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups). The number of patients reporting reduction in appearance score in the curcumin group was more than that in the triamcinolone group (76% in the curcumin group versus 60% in the triamcinolone group); but the number of patients reporting reduction in severity of pain in the triamcinolone group was more than that in the curcumin group (80% in the triamcinolone group versus 76% in the curcumin group). This difference may be explained as:</p><p>Some of the patients complained of burning sensation when applying the curcumin that might have affected the pain and burning sensation during the treatment.</p><p>Half the patients who did not report pain reduction by applying curcumin recalled the same problem with triamcinolone paste previously; this might be due to the topical application of drugs, because the same patients did not have any problem with corticosteroid mouthrinse. At the end of the study, we asked the patients in the curcumin group whether they had used corticosteroids in the form of Orabase or mouthrinse, to compare their efficacy with that of curcumin. Twenty patients (80%) preferred triamcinolone in Orabase to curcumin. Seven patients (35%) had only problems with undesirable yellowish color of curcumin particularly on the gingiva or other exposed areas. The remaining 13 patients (65%) had experienced burning sensation when applying curcumin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Corticosteroids as the conventional treatment for OLP may lead to noticeable side effects and development of other conditions like oral candidiasis. Herbal medicines can be suitable alternatives to synthetic drugs. Application of topical curcumin can be suggested for treatment of OLP because of its desirable anti-inflammatory effects and insignificant side effects. Future studies with larger sample sizes and the drug in the form of mouthrinse are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1-</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
