training on changes in balance ability and abdominal muscle thicknesses of stroke
patients. [Subjects] Thirty stroke patients with hemiplegia were recruited, and they were
randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. [Methods] The experimental group
performed horse riding simulation training, whereas the control group performed trunk
exercises for 8 weeks. Balance ability was measured using a BioRescue system. The
thicknesses of subjects&#x02019; external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis
muscles were measured by ultrasonic imaging. [Results] In the experimental group, balance
ability was significantly improved after training. Similarly, the thickness of the
abdominal muscles on the affected side changed after training in the experimental group,
whereas the control group showed no statistically significant changes. [Conclusion] We
suggest that horse riding simulation training is more effective than trunk exercises at
reducing the center of pressure path length and travel speed and improving the asymmetry
of the abdominal muscles of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Horse riding simulation training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Abdominal muscles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a disease that causes sudden local neurological deficit symptoms due to a
cerebrovascular accident<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke may
decrease postural control and balance ability due to sensory disability, motor disturbance,
muscular weakness, and asymmetric postures resulting from central nervous system damage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced postural control and balance
ability decreases overall physical function, making independent activities of daily living
difficult for stroke patients, and increases the risk of falls. Therefore, improving stroke
patients&#x02019; balance ability is an important therapeutic objective<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to this issue, a recent cross-sectional study
revealed that stroke patients&#x02019; trunk control ability was correlated with balance, gait, and
functional abilities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises intended to improve stroke patients&#x02019; trunk control have been extensively studied
in recent years. Verheyden et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that a group of stroke patients that performed trunk exercises on plinths showed
better improvement in trunk control than a group that received only conventional physical
therapy. Pereira et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted trunk
flexion and extension, and compared trunk muscle activities measured by sEMG on the affected
and unaffected sides of stroke patients. Karthikbabu et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effect of exercise using Swiss balls on the improvement
of trunk muscles. Although many exercise programs for trunk control have been implemented,
there are few programs that can improve subjects&#x02019; balance while maintaining their interest.
Exercise programs using horse riding have been developed recently. Horse riding programs
elicit active trunk and motivate subjects.</p><p>After the first horse riding studies were performed with patients with neurological damage,
hippotherapy was used only to treat children with neurological disorders, mainly cerebral
palsy, to improve their postural control and promote their normal development and functional
recovery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The horse&#x02019;s gait is repetitive and rhythmic, and
causes the center of gravity to move in anterior-posterior, lateral, and upward-downward
directions. Since the patterns of these movements are similar to those of the movements of
the trunk and pelvis during human gait, such exercise is expected to make the subjects feel
as if they were walking<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hippotherapy is
effective in terms of psychological motivation because it arouses subjects&#x02019; interest in
participating in the therapy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and helps in the recovery of many physical functions.
Hippotherapy increases the range of joint motion, strengthens muscles, and improves muscle
tone, postural control, and balance and equilibrium ability. Improvements in postural
control and balance ability are achieved through stimulation of the upper motor neurons
through proprioceptive sensory stimulation inputs<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite these therapeutic effects,
no studies have been conducted on the changes in muscles related to stroke patients&#x02019;
stability and balance after hippotherapy. In this study, the improvement in stroke patients&#x02019;
trunk control and changes in abdominal muscle thicknesses after horse riding simulation
training were examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The purpose of this study was explained to patients diagnosed with stroke at D General
Hospital in Busan, South Korea. Patients willing to participate in the study were recruited,
and those who satisfied the selection criteria were randomly assigned to a control or
experimental group (15 patients per group).</p><p>Subject selection criteria were as follows: patients with hemiplegia and no previous
experience with hippotherapy who could follow verbal instructions, sit and walk
independently (regardless of the use of walking aids), and had no restriction in the range
of joint motion.</p><p>Both groups received central nervous system developmental therapy for 30&#x02005;min. Then, the
experimental group performed horse riding simulation training, while the control group
performed trunk exercises using Swiss balls. Training was performed for 30&#x02005;min per session,
three sessions per week for a total of eight weeks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were evaluated before the intervention and after

explanation of the experimental procedure, and possible side effects of the intervention.
The experiment was conducted after receiving approval from the Human Subjects Research
Ethics Committee of Dong-Eui Medical Center (DEMCIRB-2013-1001).</p><p>The horse riding simulator (EU6441 Core Muscle Trainer; Panasonic, Japan) used is designed
to simulate the effects of horse riding exercises in an indoor environment using
three-directional movements (anterior-posterior, lateral, upward-downward), and has three
different programs and nine levels of exercise intensity. A therapist and an assistant
monitored each subject during horse riding training.</p><p>A balance ability measuring and training system (an analysis system with biofeedback,
AP1153; BioRescue, France) was used to evaluate subjects&#x02019; balance ability. Static balance
ability (center of pressure [COP] path length and COP travel speed) was measured while
subjects stood for 60&#x02005;s with their eyes open. The subjects were prevented from seeing the
monitor to avoid visual feedback, and the position of the feet was maintained during
repeated measurements to eliminate errors resulting from changes in foot positions. All
tests were performed three times, and average values were calculated.</p><p>Ultrasonic imaging equipment (Sonoace X4; Medison, Korea) was used to measure the
thicknesses of the abdominal muscles on both sides. Ultrasonic images were collected using
7.5&#x02005;MHz linear probes. Subjects were instructed to bend their knees to 90&#x000b0; and to maintain a
comfortable posture in a supine position. Linear probes were positioned on both sides,
midway between the bottom of the rib cage and the top of the iliac crest. Images were
collected at the end of expiration<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
thicknesses of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles
were measured three times and their average values were calculated.</p><p>The data were processed using the SPSS 18.0 program. The paired t-test was conducted to
compare the results before and after the intervention within each group and the independent
t-test was used to compare the exercise and control groups before and after the experiment.

balance ability (which is an important issue for stroke patients), and the changes in
abdominal muscle thicknesses of stroke patients. The distance and speed of center of gravity
movements were measured using a Biorescue system, and changes in abdominal muscle
thicknesses were observed by ultrasonography.</p><p>The COP path lengths of before and after the intervention were similar in the control group
(p&#x0003e;0.05), but significantly decreased in the experimental group after horse riding
training. The changes in the speed of COP travel showed that body sway remarkably decreased
in the experimental group after training in comparison with the control group. These changes
presumably occurred because the trunks of the subjects became more stable as a result of
horse riding simulation training, reducing body sway and shaking.</p><p>Regarding abdominal muscle thicknesses, EO was thinner before training on the affected side
than on the unaffected side, resulting in a difference in total abdominal muscle thickness
on the affected and unaffected sides. This is consistent with the results of the study by
English et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, which measured the
abdominal muscles of stroke patients (65&#x02005;years old or older) at rest. Although the mean age
of the subjects in our present study was somewhat lower (55.1&#x000b1;6.1&#x02005;years), similar results
were obtained.</p><p>EO showed differences between the affected and unaffected sides before the experiment. Even
though EO is mainly mobilized during trunk rotation movements, Pereria et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that EO was activated when stroke
patients performed exercises that involved lifting of both legs, and this reportedly
occurred to compensate for the inactivity of the rectus abdominis. Similarly, in our present
study the EO muscle may have activated more to compensate for the weakness of the rectus
abdominal muscles on the affected side of the stroke patients. Another reason for higher EO
activation on the affected side could be that it is located closer to the surface layer than
TrA and IO, which would affect thickness changes because horse riding simulation exercises
induce multi-directional movements.</p><p>Although diverse balance training programs for stroke patients have been reported,
therapeutic approaches using horse riding have rarely been studied with stroke patients as
subjects. Some studies have been conducted with persons with neurological disorders, in
particular children with cerebral palsy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, comparison of our
present results with those of previous studies was difficult. Future studies of horse riding
simulation may lead to an improvement in stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability. Horse riding
simulation training can be fun and interesting for patients, which may increase their
motivation to actively participate in exercise program and thus enhance the improvement of
neurologic functions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it should be studied further.</p><p>Our experiment had several limitations. First, only subjects who could sit independently
were selected. Second, ultrasonic measurement was conducted in a steady state in a supine
position. Third, since the damaged sites and symptoms differed among subjects, standard
subjects could not be selected. Fourth, various medical interventions implemented by clinics
could not be properly controlled. Therefore, in future studies, the effects of hippotherapy
on stroke patients should be examined with a more efficient control and the selection of a
wide range of subjects. Additional information should be provided by comparison (during
ultrasonic measurement) of the degrees of contraction on the affected and unaffected
sides.</p><p>In conclusion, horse riding simulation training may reduce the distance and speed of the
center of gravity movements of stroke patients and reduce the asymmetry of the abdominal
muscles. To improve stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability, diverse uses of horse riding
simulation training should be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a research grant (2013 Academic Expense Grant 2013AA096)
