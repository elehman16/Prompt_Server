The vaginal route of administration allows for localized treatment with low-dose estrogens to relieve symptoms with little to no systemic estrogen exposure.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Potential benefits of vaginal versus oral administration are avoidance of gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass effects, which allows for lower dosing and lower systemic exposure, and potentially a lower incidence of adverse effects.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Despite being proven as clinically efficacious and safe as indicated, use of many vaginal estrogen treatments has been hindered by issues related to route of administration, convenience, and safety concerns with long-term use and systemic exposure.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Respondents in the Real Women's Views of Treatment Options for Menopausal Vaginal Changes (REVIVE) survey frequently reported messiness, difficult administration, inconvenience, and insufficient symptomatic relief as limitations of over-the-counter vaginal moisturizers or lubricants and prescription vaginal products.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Women using vaginal creams also expressed difficulties with administering the correct dosage,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> whereas those using vaginal rings experienced difficulties with insertion and removal as well as concern related to potential dislodging of the ring and hygiene.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Collectively, these issues with currently available products often result in poor patient satisfaction and ultimately poor adherence to the prescribed dosing regimen and longer-term treatment.

Importantly, most women reported that they preferred TX-004HR over their previous treatment. As expected, correlation analyses found that as severity of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness decreased, ease of product use, ease of capsule insertion, patient satisfaction, and the likelihood of using the study treatment again increased. In addition, an increase in the percentage of superficial cells and a decrease in vaginal pH were associated with higher patient satisfaction.</p><p>Data from this study are consistent with previously presented data from a phase 2 trial evaluating TX-004HR 10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;49).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Overall, 96% of the women participating in the study reported that the capsule was easy to insert, and 66% stated that they would &#x0201c;probably&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;definitely&#x0201d; consider using the capsule again.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> More women reported being &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; with TX-004HR 10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g (63%) versus 36% with placebo.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Patient satisfaction with all three doses of TX-004HR (68.6%-76.3%) was considerably higher than that reported in separate studies for currently available vaginal products; in the Women's EMPOWER survey, the percentage of women who were very to extremely satisfied with their vaginal products did not exceed 51%.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, TX-004HR is the only vaginal product to have satisfaction rates that approach (68.5% [4&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g]) or meet (72.8% [10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g] and 76.3% [25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g]) the benchmark for acceptable patient satisfaction of greater than 70%.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, patient satisfaction was correlated, to a varying extent, with improvements in dyspareunia and vaginal dryness severity, percentage of superficial cells, and vaginal pH. Because all four treatments were identical in appearance, patient satisfaction with TX-004HR is likely due to the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of TX-004HR.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The higher than expected satisfaction rate with placebo (56.8%) is likely due to a large placebo response likely resulting from the use of Miglyol, a fractionated coconut oil with potential lubricating properties, in the formulation of the vaginal capsule.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Reductions in the severity of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness being correlated with higher ease of product use and capsule insertion suggest that using the product becomes easier as vaginal physiology improved and severity of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness decreased with TX-004HR.</p><p>The formulation of the capsule may address key limitations of currently available VVA products and, in turn, may contribute to the high rates of satisfaction observed with TX-004HR. Women using vaginal creams reported missing doses because of messiness when filling and inserting the applicator, general unpleasantness of the cream, and leakage.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Additionally, significant safety concerns associated with underdosing or overdosing were reported to cause many women to switch from a vaginal cream to a vaginal tablet.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Women using vaginal rings were found to delay refilling their prescription because they had difficulty removing or inserting the ring; they or their partner could feel the ring; they were concerned about vaginal infection, hygiene, and cleanliness; or because the ring was not the lowest effective dose of estrogen that could be prescribed.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The softgel capsule formulation of TX-004HR may circumvent many of these issues by allowing for accurate dosing and easy administration, which may be more hygienic as an applicator is not necessary. TX-004HR has been designed to rapidly dissolve, with no vaginal secretions required for activation, and therefore, should minimize vaginal discharge, resulting in less messiness.</p><p>A separate analysis of 13,074 American women found that women initiating vaginal tablets versus vaginal cream were more likely to continue therapy for a longer period and exhibited greater adherence to medication, suggested by the authors to be due to less issues with messiness and fixed dosing.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> An online survey of 200 American women reported that 45% of women who use vaginal creams for VVA deliberately used less than the recommended dose to avoid messiness or leakage.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, significantly more women who used vaginal creams reported delaying or not using the medication because of messiness compared with users of vaginal tablets (67% vs 17%).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Another online survey of 423 Swedish women reported that women would be willing to pay more for vaginal tablets than vaginal creams to avoid smudges/leakage.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, women prescribed TX-004HR may be more likely to adhere to treatment due to the demonstrated efficacy of TX-004HR for treating postmenopausal VVA and overall ease of use of the product and inserting the capsule, as well as patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>TX-004HR, an investigational, applicator-free, muco-adhesive, vaginal, softgel capsule of low-dose, solubilized, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol designed to treat postmenopausal VVA provided an improved user experience compared with other currently used vaginal treatments for VVA. The majority of postmenopausal women participating in the REJOICE trial rated using the product and inserting the applicator-free capsule as easy, and when compared with placebo, were more satisfied with TX-004HR, preferred it over their previous VVA treatment, and would consider using TX-004HR again. Together with previously reported improvements in vaginal physiology and severity of dyspareunia, these survey results suggest women prescribed TX-004HR will be satisfied with their vaginal therapy, which may enhance treatment adherence for their postmenopausal VVA and moderate-to-severe dyspareunia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators of the REJOICE trial who participated in the collection of the acceptability data.
