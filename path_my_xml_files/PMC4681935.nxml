stroke patients, 24 were selected based on the study criteria and randomly divided into
two groups: an experimental group (12 patients) and a control group (12 patients). The
patients in both groups participated in 15-minute exercise sessions three times a week for
eight weeks. To analyze the effect of the exercise, muscle strength, the Timed Up and Go

strength, stiffness, pain, language disability, and circulation problems as well as
functional problem with walking, walking up the stairs, standing up, turning around, and
maintaining balance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking ability is a
key indicator of a hemiplegic patient&#x02019;s advanced motor functions and his or her
recovery<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Enhancing independent walking ability is among the primary goals of
treatment. Recovery of walking ability in the rehabilitation program is important because
walking is a complex form of exercise that requires a high level of harmony among
coordination, balance, kinesthetic sense, proprioception, and integrated working of joints
and muscles. Walking is also among the important indicators of independent
functionality<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recovering and improving walking ability is a key goal and plays an
important role in rehabilitation of stroke patients so that they can eventually return to
the workforce and society<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. in Particular,
walking up and down stairs is a basic activity in daily life, but only 5&#x02013;25% of stroke
patients are capable of this activity when they are discharged from a rehabilitation
center<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A Stair gait exercise is among
the exercises that strengthen the lower limbs of stroke patients, and it is frequently used
for transportation and walking on flat ground. Compared with flat-area walking, stair
climbing requires more energy and muscle strength in the lower limbs, as it involves
horizontal movement and vertical ascent at the same time, while keeping the body balanced.
These days, steppers are widely used for lower limb exercise and rehabilitation, which has
benefit of reducing stress on the knee joints<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. They are also recommended for use in
aerobic exercise similar to stair walking, which builds muscle strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, few studies have been conducted on the effect of step climbing on stroke patients.
In this paper, we examine the effect of step climbing and stair gait exercises on walking in
stroke patients to determine determine a more effective therapy for the rehabilitation of
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>For the study, 24 stroke patients were selected who had had hemiplegia for six months or
longer, had been diagnosed based on CT or MRI scanning at S Hospital in the city of Daegu,
and were capable of independent indoor walking a supporting device, which indicates the
capability to understand and follow the researcher&#x02019;s instructions. The participants were
given an explanation of the research purpose and provided consent prior to the study. Among
the 24 participants, 12 were randomly assigned to a step climbing exercise group, and 12
were randomly assigned to a stair gait exercise group.</p><p>Their average duration of disease was 35.04&#x000b1;13.99 months, their average height was
161.8&#x000b1;11.9&#x02005;cm, and their average weight was 58.08&#x000b1;7.76&#x02005;kg. Subject characteristics were
homogeneous at baseline (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The two groups participated in the training three times a week for a total of eight weeks.
Each session lasted 15 minutes and began after basic exercise therapy. The step climbing
exercise group were doing a cross-exercise of the lower limbs, a patient stepped on the
stepper, pushed down one side, and switched to the other side before the foot pad touched
the frame. For safety, the subjects held a handrail during the climbing exercise, and a
therapist oversaw the process and corrected the posture of the patients without directly
touching them. Stair gait exercise group performed a stair exercise. For this exercise, a
set of five wooden steps was made that was 0.8&#x02005;m in width, with each step being 28&#x02005;cm deep
and 10&#x02005;cm long. A therapist assisted patients if their balance was poor, and patients held a
support bar when necessary.</p><p>To test the muscle strength of the lower limbs, a Manual Muscle Tester (Model01163,
Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN, USA) was used on the rectus femoris (RF),
tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GCM) of the stroke-affected side. The RF was
measured while the patients sat down on a chair with a back, with the pressure plate put
against the front of the ankle an instruction was given to straighten the knee. The TA and
GCM were measured on the knee in a long-sitting position. The pressure plate was placed
against the distal side of the foot instep to measure the dorsiflexion of the ankle joint
and against the distal side of the foot sole to measure the plantar flexion. In measuring
muscle strength, the patient&#x02019;s stiffness and compensation mechanism were kept at a minimum
level using a posture and method that enabled a measurement of the target muscles as
accurately as possible<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Measurements
were taken three times, and the average was used. For Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the time
taken for a patient to sit up from a 46&#x02005;cm high chair with an armrest, move 3&#x02005;m forward,
move 3&#x02005;m back, and sit down on the chair was measured. It was measured twice, and the
average of was used. The patients were allowed to wear their daily shoes or support device,
but they could not receive aid from their caretaker or therapist<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure the difference in step length between the
stroke-affected side and the unaffected side, a gait checker (Gait Checker, GHiWell, Seoul,
Republic of Korea) was used. The step length was measured three times, and the average was
used for comparative analysis.</p><p>PASW Statistics 18.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis of the data; a paired
t-test was conducted to examine the changes before and after the exercise in each group; an
independent t-test was conducted to examine changes among the groups based on the changes
before and after the exercise. The level of statistical significance (&#x003b1;) was set at
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Muscle strength changed significantly in both groups after the exercise (p&#x0003c;0.05). In an
intergroup comparison, the RF showed a significant change in the step climbing exercise
group, and the TF showed a significant change in the stair gait exercise group (p&#x0003c;0.05).
The TUG results improved significantly in both groups after the exercise (p&#x0003c;0.05), but
there was no significant difference in the changes in TUG results between the two groups
(p&#x0003e;0.05). Step length improved significantly in both groups after the exercise
(p&#x0003c;0.05), but there was no significant difference in the results between the two groups

stroke patients, 80% lose walking ability, and they begin to recover it within six months.
Enhancing walking ability to restore functions and social activities of stroke patients is
one of the key goals of treatment, and the ability to walk independently is an important
goal of rehabilitation for stroke patients and therapists<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stair gait exercise is part of the rehabilitation program to
efficiently restore the walking ability of stroke patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and previous experiments showed similar effects of the stair gait
exercise and step climbing exercise on strengthening of the lower limbs of stroke patients
when changes in muscle activity were examined using electromyography(EMG)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In comparing the muscle strengths of
patients among different groups, an EMG analysis showed an increase in the muscle strengths
of the RF, GCM, and TA, both in step climbing exercise and stair gait exercise groups<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in this study, patients in
both groups showed significant increases in muscle strength after eight weeks of exercise. A
comparison between the groups showed that the strength of the RF increased more in the step
climbing exercise group than in the stair gait exercise group, while the strength of the TA
increased more significantly in the stair gait exercise group than in the step climbing
exercise group. MacCulloch reported that dorsiflexion of the ankle joint occurs when a
person climbs up stairs in stair gait exercise and showed that maximum dorsiflexion occurs
in the swing phase<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with the
stair gait exercise, which repeatedly stimulates the TA, a person participating in the step
climbing exercise does not need ankle dorsiflexion to climb to the next step, so the muscle
strength of the TA increases relatively less. Damiano reported that in a cross-exercise of
lower limbs, the short moment arm of the bent knee joint is increased with the extension of
the knee to support one&#x02019;s weight, which exerts significant stress on the knee extensor to
stabilize the knee joint<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lu showed
that an increased moment arm requires greater force, and thus, the muscle activity of the
knee extensor is greater than in other walking conditions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The step climbing exercise extends the knee opposite to the
stepping foot, and this could be more effective in strengthening the RF than stair gait
exercise. In comparison of the TUG results, a significant improvement was observed in both
groups after the exercise, but no significant difference was shown between the two groups.
Kim reported that an exercise that increases the muscle strength of the foot instep joint
decreases center of pressure sway in stroke patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park showed that a proprioceptive exercise for the ankle increased
muscle strength and improved the dynamic balance of the affected patients but that the TUG
time fell from 20.47 seconds to 15.27 seconds after six weeks of exercise<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim reported that the step exercise
results in significant improvements in ankle balance and that step exercise could be
effective as an early-stage walking exercise for stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in this study, both groups showed improved TUG
results after the exercise due to increased muscle strength in the lower limbs and improved
dynamic balance. In a comparison of walking ability between the two groups, patients in both
groups showed significant improvements, but no significant difference was observed between
the two groups. Many studies have been performed on the correlation between the muscle
strength of the lower limbs and walking ability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Persch demonstrated increased
muscle strength and improvement in walking-related variables after lower limb strengthening
exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Suzuki reported that five
months after a stroke, the muscle strength of the lower limbs on the stroke-affected side
affected the walking speed in 54% of patients<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park reported that, increased step length and walking speed
because of increased dorsiflexion, contributed to the prevention of foot drop and lower limb
stability upon initial contact in the swing phase and explained that a stable walking
pattern could enhance both static and dynamic stability by reducing postural sway<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Flansbjer argued that improved knee
extensor strength is a significant predictor of the 6&#x02005;m walking distance and endurance and
that improved extensor strength led to an increased walking speed<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim reported that a step exercise could facilitate a
patient&#x02019;s walking pattern when conducting a stepping motion and it could increase walking
speed, as found with the stair gait exercise<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of our study showed that a step climbing exercise affects the muscle strength,
balance, and step length of stroke patients in a manner similar, similar to the stair gait
exercise. Therefore, it can be used as a more efficient treatment for stroke patients.
Future research should be conducted using a larger group of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Peurala</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>K&#x000f6;n&#x000f6;nen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitk&#x000e4;nen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Postural instability in patients with chronic
