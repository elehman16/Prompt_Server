This is due to the method being minimally traumatic, with multifold possibilities for diagnostics and determination of further tactics of surgical treatment, decrease of peritoneal adhesion risk, and good cosmetic results. The cost of treatment also decreases because of shorter terms of in-hospital treatment, less need for post-operational analgesia, etc [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Still, in connection with the introduction of this method of treatment, an anesthesiologist, especially a pediatric one, faces a range of specific problems connected with support of the organism's vital functions during the surgery [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Gas being pumped into the abdominal cavity proportionally raises the pressure inside it, which results in compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta. In particular, under the conditions of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 14 mm Hg in adults the compression of the inferior vena cava causes the decrease of venous inflow by 20%. Kidney blood flow is also in direct correlation with IAP. Under the conditions of IAP of 20&#x02013;25 mm Hg, used in adults during gynecological surgery, the decrease of renal flow and glomerular filtration can cause damage of kidney parenchyma [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Changes in the arterial system are characterized by the increase of peripheral vascular resistance as a result of squeezing of abdominal cavity arterial vessels, and activation of vasoactive substances (of the renin-angiotensin system), caused by reduction of kidney flow. As a result, the heart works in conditions of increased afterload and decreased preload. The main compensatory mechanism of cardiac output increase is the development of tachycardia [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In children the fluctuation of hemodynamics depends not only on the IAP value, but also on age. Sakka <italic>et al</italic>. performed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and hemodynamic assessment during laparoscopic herniotomies in young children at two different levels of IAP, 6 and 12 mm Hg. It was found that after the rise of IAP to 12 mm Hg the cardiac index (CI) decreased significantly. The following decrease of IAP to 6 mm Hg brought the CI back to the initial level [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The influence of a high level of IAP on the respiratory system is also very important. This can be explained by the elevation of the diaphragm and restriction of its mobility. As a result, lung compliance decreases, macro- and microatelectases appear in parts of lungs, functional residual lung capacity decreases, ventilation-perfusion problems progress, pulmonary bypass increases, and hypoxemia, hypoventilation, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis develop [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that modern medical literature offers wide coverage of problems of anesthesiological support in adults during laparoscopies. As far as children are concerned, these aspects are not covered sufficiently; namely, safe IAP levels as well as its influence on hemodynamics and breathing in children of different ages are not defined.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Aim</title><p>The objectives were to study the changes in the mechanics of respiration in children depending on the value of intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic procedures on inguinal hernias, and to compare the effects of different mechanical ventilation modes &#x02013; pressure controlled (PCV) and volume controlled (VCV) ventilation &#x02013; on the mechanics of respiration considering carboxyperitoneum conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0003"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Fifty-two children aged 1&#x02013;12 years undergoing laparoscopic surgery on inguinal hernias were randomly allocated to receive mechanical ventilation using either VCV (<italic>n</italic> = 24) or PCV (<italic>n</italic> = 28) mode.

In patients of both groups peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure (Pmean), TV, and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were registered as well as saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>), and etCO<sub>2</sub> depending on the IAP value. The IAP was measured by the manometer in laparoscopic equipment. Respiratory mechanics values were measured before application of carboxyperitoneum (initial data) and after the gas had been pumped into the abdominal cavity, at the following intra-abdominal pressure values: 6 mm Hg, 8 mm Hg, 10 mm Hg, 12 mm Hg, 14 mm Hg. Then ventilation parameters correction was carried out with the aim of achieving satisfactory minute lung ventilation, oxygenation and normocapnia.

Both peak and mean airway pressures in the VCV and PCV groups were similar 5 min after tracheal intubation. However, at both 10 and 30 min after the start of surgery, the peak airway pressure was significantly decreased and the mean airway pressure was increased in the PCV group, compared with the VCV group. The authors also noted that compliance was significantly higher in the PCV group, but only 5 min after tracheal intubation; after surgery had started there was no difference.</p><p>Another study in gynecological laparoscopic surgery compared the effects of VCV with PCV on respiratory mechanics and noninvasive hemodynamic parameters [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sixty ASA I-II women were randomly allocated to the VCV group (<italic>n</italic> = 30) or PCV group (<italic>n</italic> = 30). In the results, VCV was associated with a significant increase in peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and airway resistance (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Compliance was significantly higher in the PCV group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). No other significant differences were found between the groups.</p><p>In our view, the advantage of the PCV regime in children is related to low lung compliance and the risk of possible loss of respiratory volume in the breathing circuit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Application of carboxyperitoneum causes increased intra-abdominal pressure and restrictive disorders in respiratory mechanics. Intra-abdominal pressure readings within 8&#x02013;12 mm Hg allow laparoscopic procedures to be performed without significant gas exchange disorders in children older than 1 year. Increase of IAP &#x0003e; 12 mm Hg caused significant decrease of Cdyn and increase of etCO<sub>2</sub>. Respiratory mechanics readings correction in PCV mode allows adequate TV and EMV to be reached at lower PIP and Pmean values in comparison with VCV ventilation.</p></sec></body><back><sec
