ARI are a major economic burden on families and the health care system. One in three hospital admissions of children in developing countries is due to pneumonia. Treatment of ARI also often involves the unnecessary or inappropriate use of antibiotics and other drug in outpatient services.</p><p>Clinical features of pneumonia vary; onset is abrupt with headache, chills, cough and high fever. No single clinical sign has a better combination of sensitivity and specificity to detect pneumonia in children under 5 years, than respiratory rate, specifically fast breathing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The WHO ARI program was officially established at global level in 1982 and the shifted its emphasis from biomedical research to operational and program implementation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] On the basis of research and experience in Papua New Guinea and other countries, a standard method for case management has been developed to enable primary health workers to: (a) recognize important signs and symptoms such as fast breathing and chest in-drawing: (b) determine the nature of cases, whether mild, moderate or severe; and (c) decide whether antibiotics should be given and whether patients should be referred to hospitals. The same information has been given to mothers through health education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Since the development of WHO's standard case management guidelines, the program has concentrated on the establishment and expansion of national control programs. According to USAID health reports, in Nepal, standard ARI case management has contributed to a 42% decline in less than 5 mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In India, the acute respiratory disease control program was taken up as a pilot project in year 1990. Since 1992-93 the program is being implemented as part of child survival and safe motherhood (CSSM) program.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In 1996, the WHO control of diarrheal disease (CDD) and ARI program were merged in the Regional Office. This was mainly because both programs were targeted at children under 5 years of age; integrating them made both program more effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Training of health workers in case management with an emphasis on hands-on practice and improving the communication skills of health workers has remained the priority activity for most of the national programs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The measurement of program impact in terms of ARI death reduction in children under 5 years of age remains beyond the reach of most national programs. However, some surveys carried out on limited scale have shown encouraging results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>A.K. Patwari <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found that ARI constituted 26.88% of hospital admissions during 2 years study period. Ninty four percent of all admissions due to ARI were below the age of 5 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Our study was carried out in children attending out patients department of large tertiary care service hospital with an aim of finding out the clinical effectiveness of co-trimoxazole versus amoxicillin for WHO defined non-severe pneumonia by a randomized controlled trial.</p><p>During the period of study, 204 patients with WHO criteria of non-severe pneumonia were included in the study. Out of total 204 cases almost 75% of the cases were below the age of 3 years.

This percentage of radiological positivity in case of pneumonia in our study is similar to the study by Lucas <italic>et al</italic>. (13.79%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and Qazi <italic>et al</italic>. (14%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Blood counts were positive in 18.13% cases. MN Lucas has shown similar% age of positivity in his study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study almost 81.7% of the cases were diagnosed as non severe pneumonia on clinical grounds only. Radiological and hematological investigations were helpful in only small percentage of cases. As tachypnea is the earliest sign of pneumonia before the radiological and laboratory evidence of pneumonia occur, clinical criteria on the basis of respiratory rate, is the best method with combination of high sensitivity and specificity to detect pneumonia in children below 5 years of age.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Out of total 204 cases, study group included 99 (48.52%) cases and control group included 105 (51.48%) cases. Study group was treated with amoxicillin and control group was treated with co-trimoxazole in doses as mentioned in material and methods. The cure rate among children of study group (amoxicillin) was 91.91% cases and in control group (co-trimoxazole) 60.95%. Higher cure rate with amoxicillin in our study is similar to the reports of other workers who have reported cure rates varying from 70.9-93%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Ostroff <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found resistance to co-trimoxazole to be higher as compared to ampicillin for bothy <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>. Susceptibility of <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> to penicillin was 70.9 to 77.6% and co trimoxazole was 73-75% and susceptibility of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> to ampicillin was 93-100% and to co-trimoxazole was 84.9% to 100%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Relatively higher cure rate with amoxicillin in our study could be because of number of factors like availability of medicines free of cost and in sufficient quantity, educated clientele resulting in early reporting to the hospital and regular counseling regarding nature of disease and importance of compliance.</p><p>Cure rate among co-trimoxazole group in our study was 60.95%. Other studies have reported figures from 22.2 to 81%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] It will be seen from the results of various studies that over a period of time the cure rate is showing a gradual decline indicating that resistance to co-trimoxazole is increasing. International clinical epidemiology network (INCLEN), invasive bacterial infection surveillance (IBIS) group, in their study &#x0201c;prospective multi center hospital surveillance of &#x0201c;streptococcus pneumonia disease in India&#x0201d; found resistance of <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> to co-trimoxazole to be around 78%, 85%, 73% and 39% of 217 isolates of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> from Delhi, Madras, Nagpur and Vellore respectively. Since this data was from six centers in different regions collected over 4 years, it is likely to be representative of data from most of the country.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>About 86% of children in amoxicillin group showed clinical cure by third day. Corresponding figure for the co-trimoxazole group was 37%. Compliance of treatment improves significantly when the total duration of therapy is reduced. Shally Awasthy has found good response to amoxicillin after 2 days of treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Shamim Quazi <italic>et al</italic>. in their study of clinical efficacy of 3 days versus 5 days of oral amoxicillin for treatment of childhood pneumonia found that in children with non-severe pneumonia, treatment for three days (79%) was as effective as treatment for 5 days (80%). The most important risk factor for treatment failure was non-compliance, which was also associated with longer duration of therapy. They opined that shorter antibiotic course could help to contain the spread of antimicrobial resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>De Francisco and Chakraborty found good response with 3 days of co-trimoxazole which is contrary to our study. Since this study was done 9 years back and resistance to co-trimoxazole has increased over a period of time, mean period of response to co-trimoxazole appears to have increased too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Further studies are required to find out whether increasing the dose of amoxicillin and cutting down the total duration of therapy to 3 days will achieve cure in 100% cases.</p><p>Total no. of doses to be taken for a full course and cost of one complete course of treatment in each group is different. 15 doses of amoxicillin and 10 doses of co-trimoxazole are required to be taken to complete the course of each drug for 5 days. Cost of amoxicillin for a complete course is approximately 2.3 times higher than co-trimoxazole. Irrespective of the efficacy, this difference in the cost could be an important factor while recommending the standard drug for use in community setting.</p><p>Compliance factor was determined by interviewing children/parents after the complete course of treatment (i.e., 5 days) by inquiring about the no. of doses missed. Compliance among both groups was good. However comparatively, compliance was relatively poorer in amoxicillin group (appro &#x000d7; 84%) compared to co-trimoxazole (90%). Better compliance in co-trimoxazole group is probably related to lesser no of daily doses to be administered to the patient.</p><p>De Francisco in his study with co-trimoxazole found that around 25% cases missed more than 2 doses, giving a compliance factor of 75%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Keeley on the other hand found 100% compliance and attributed it to good counseling of parents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] S. Qazi found high compliance to both drugs with non compliance rate of 3.9% (amoxicillin) to 3.4% (in co-trimoxazole) group. Higher percentage of compliance in our study can be attributed to better counseling and relatively better educated clientele in service set up.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>S.A. Quazi <italic>et al</italic>. in their study over 4 years in Pakistan found that with standard management of ARI as per WHO recommendation in children, the total no. of patients decreased by 26.2% over 4 years, while the under 5 years old ARI patients decreased by nearly 32.7%. The case fatality rate in children admitted with ARI fell from 9.9 to 4.9% similar results were reported from Napoleon.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Children under the age of 3 years are more susceptible to get non severe pneumonia. Clinical criteria as defined by WHO remains the best method to diagnose non severe pneumonia. Amoxicillin is coming up as a fairly good substitute for co-trimoxazole which is showing increasing resistance to most bacteria. The response to treatment with amoxicillin is faster, however, compliance is slightly poorer and cost of treatment high. In order to improve the compliance, better counseling and more studies are required to ascertain the efficacy of amoxicillin in higher dosage over a shorter period of time. Although in various studies including the present one, amoxicillin has come out to be better drug in the treatment of non severe pneumonia, it can not be recommended as the first line drug in community practice because of significantly higher cost especially in poor country like India.
