Hemodynamic instability is a common, but preventable complication of spinal anesthesia. Preloading the circulation with intravenous fluids is considered a safe and effective method of preventing hypotension following spinal anesthesia. We had conducted a study to compare the hemodynamic stability after volume preloading with either Ringer's lactate (RL) or tetrastarch hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or succinylated gelatin (SG) in the patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>It was a prospective, double-blinded and randomized controlled study. Ninety six ASA-I healthy, nonlaboring parturients were randomly divided in 3 groups HES, SG, RL (<italic>n</italic> = 32 each) and received 10 ml/kg HES 130/0.4; 10 ml/kg SG (4% modified fluid gelatin) and 20 ml/kg RL respectively prior to SA scheduled for cesarean section. Heart rate, blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation was measured.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (&#x0003c;100 mm Hg) noted among 5 (15.63%), 12 (37.5%) and 14 (43.75%) parturients in groups HES, SG, RL respectively. Vasopressor (phenylephrine) was used to treat hypotension when SBP &#x0003c;90 mm Hg. Both the results and APGAR scores were comparable in all the groups.

After obtaining approval from the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent from 96 non-laboring healthy parturients (ASA grade I) age group between 20 and 30 years scheduled for elective cesarean section were randomly allocated by computer derived random number into three equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 32) according to preloading fluid they received. Group hydroxyethyl starch (HES) (received 10 ml/kg tetrastarch [HES 130/0.4] or up to a maximum of 500 ml over 20 min), Group SG (received 10 ml/kg SG or up to a maximum of 500 ml over 20 min) and Group RL (received 20 ml/kg RL over 20 min). Infusion started just 20 min prior to spinal anesthesia. Study solution was prepared and wrapped in a black cover by an assistant not contributing in the study and hence that the investigator is blinded to the study solution. The infusion was administered with the help of infusion pump Baxter Flo-Gard 6201<sup>&#x02122;</sup>.</p><p>Pregnancy with hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases, fetal distress, moderate to severe anemia (&#x0003c;8 gm%), hepatorenal compromise, patient refusal, infection at the site of injection, any known allergy to bupivacaine, bleeding diathesis, elevated intracranial pressure, spine deformity and patients with major systemic illness were excluded from the study.</p><p>On arrival at the operation theater, standard multi parameter monitor was attached. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), was recorded as baseline values. After confirming fetal heart sound by an obstetrician, intravenous (IV) access was secured with 18-G cannula in all patients. Under strict aseptic precaution, spinal anesthesia was administered in a sitting position at L3/4 intervertebral space with 26-G Quincke's type spinal needle and 2 ml 0.5% Bupivacaine Heavy along with 0.5 ml Fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g) were administered at the rate of 0.2 ml/s. The patient was then kept in supine with a 15 cm wedge under the right buttock and oxygen was administered at 2-3 l/min through nasal oxygen cannula. 5 IU oxytocin was given as IV bolus after delivery of baby and 10 IU was given as slow IV infusion in RL which continued throughout surgery and also in the post-operative period.</p><p>HR, SBP, DBP and MAP were recorded just after completion of test solution, every 5 min for first 30 min after spinal anesthesia, every 10 min up to end of operation, every 30 min up to 2 h post-operatively. SPO2 and electrocardiogram were monitored continuously in peri- and post-operative period and any adverse effects like nausea-vomiting or any other discomfort was also noted. Any decrease in SBP &#x0003c; 100 mmHg or a drop &#x0003e; 20% of baseline value was considered as hypotension and SBP &#x0003c; 90 mm Hg was treated with bolus IV 80 &#x003bc;g phenylephrine which may be repeated after 5 min if SBP not corrected. Tachycardia was defined as HR &#x0003e; 100 and bradycardia when HR &#x0003c; 60. When HR falls &#x0003c; 50 beats/min injection atropine 0.5 mg IV was administered.</p><p>For the purpose of sample size calculation SBP was taken as a primary parameter of interest. It was calculated that 32 subject will be required per group in order to detect a difference of 6 mmHg between two groups with 80% power and 5% probability of type 1 error respectively. This calculation assumed standard deviations of 15 mmHg for SBP giving a root mean square standardized effect value of 0.4 for three groups. Sample size calculation was done by Statistica version 6.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the raw data were entered into Microsoft excel spread sheet and analyzed by appropriate statistical software, namely Statistica version 6 and SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> statistical package version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normally distributed numerical variables were compared between the groups by Analysis of Variance followed by Tukey's test as <italic>post-hoc</italic> test for comparison between two individual groups.

Other studies until date have failed to prevent hypotension, though the incidence of hypotension was decreased except the study was by Singh and Saha,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] no cases of hypotension after volume preloading.</p><p>Zarychanski <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] evaluated the association of HES use with mortality and acute kidney injury in a systematic review and meta-analysis and finally concluded that HES was associated with a significant increased risk of mortality and acute kidney injury in seriously ill patients. Clinical use of HES for acute volume resuscitation is not warranted due to serious safety concerns. From the above recent studies it seems that harms of HES in some special (like-sepsis) conditions most likely outweigh the benefits and suggest that these products should not be used for acute volume resuscitation of critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>After compilation and comparing of data it has been found that though statistically HES is better than SG and RL for preloading and hemodynamic maintenance of non-laboring parturients during caesarean section, the result is clinically not so significant and hypotension can easily be managed with available vasopressor like- phenylephrine. Incidence of nausea and APGAR scores were also clinically and statistically insignificant.</p><p>Hence we can conclude that RL which is cheap, more physiological and widely available crystalloid which can maintain hemodynamic stability well and free of colloid related hazards is still now a good choice for preloading and maintenance fluid during cesarean section.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
