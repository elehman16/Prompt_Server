Addition of the low toxicity diet-derived agent, curcumin (the active ingredient of turmeric), to standard oxaliplatin-based therapy has shown promise in numerous pre-clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is the first to combine daily oral curcumin with standard care FOLFOX-based (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients with inoperable liver metastases: the CUFOX trial. CUFOX comprises a Phase 1 dose-escalation study (3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3 design) to determine an acceptable target dose of curcumin with which to safely proceed to a Phase IIa open-labelled randomised controlled trial. Thirty three participants with histological or cytological confirmation of inoperable colorectal cancer will then be randomised to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with the addition of daily oral curcumin at the target dose determined in Phase I, or to standard care oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone (recruiting at a ratio of 2:1).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Primary outcome measures will be the determination of a target dose which is both safe and tolerable for long-term administration to individuals in receipt of first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for inoperable colorectal cancer. Secondary outcome measures will include observation of any changes in neuropathic side-effects of chemotherapy, improvement to progression-free or overall survival and identification of putative efficacy biomarkers in plasma.</p><p>The results will be disseminated via presentation at national and international conferences, via publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and via the Cancer Research UK/Department of Health Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre Network.

It carries the second highest cancer-related mortality in Western countries with a lifetime incidence of ~1 in 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Up to a fifth of CRC patients will present with metastatic disease, typically in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and half of those undergoing resection for primary disease will develop metastases. The majority of these patients are not amenable to curative surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and experience a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. The median survival for patients with un-resectable colorectal liver metastases in the absence of chemotherapy is approximately 8&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], compared with up to 24&#x000a0;months with chemotherapy in patients with KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma homologue) wild-type positive cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, approximately 40% of such cancers display chemo-resistance from the outset and eventually all will fail to respond.</p><p>The mainstay of chemotherapy for CRC in most countries has been oxaliplatin-based, commonly with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid, collectively known as FOLFOX. In the UK in 2002, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence first issued guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for oxaliplatin to be combined with 5-FU/folinic acid and administered as first-line therapy. Compared with many cytotoxic regimens, FOLFOX is relatively well tolerated but dose-limiting side-effects are common (reviewed in National Institute of Clinical Excellence CG131 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Diarrhoea, due to mucositis, can occur in up to a third of people receiving 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which can be life threatening. Patients may develop neutropaenia, increasing susceptibility to infection. The majority of patients (90%) will develop oxaliplatin-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and, after nine cycles, up to a third of patients will require dose reduction or cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Strategies for overcoming chemo-resistance and/or augmenting the action of therapy are being investigated with the aim of extending the time that chemotherapy can be tolerated whilst maintaining efficacy and postponing resistance without increased drug toxicities. Naturally occurring dietary agents are attractive in this setting because they offer a potentially favourable side-effect profile with good patient tolerability. Interest in dietary agents has continued as evidence of anti-carcinogenic activity increases (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Curcumin is a derivative of the spice turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>), typical to Asian cuisine. The use of turmeric in the field of medicine was described in Asia thousands of years ago (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Of note, Asian populations experience approximately an eighth of the incidence of bowel cancer than that of Western populations (30.8 versus 3.9 cases per 100,000 in the UK and India, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and diet is likely to be an important underlying factor.</p><p>Curcumin can interact beneficially with a wide variety of pathophysiological processes including maintenance of the cell cycle, carcinogenesis, wound healing and inflammation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). The effects of curcumin in combination with chemotherapy have been explored in a variety of cancer cell lines and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. There is a growing body of pre-clinical evidence repeatedly reporting reductions in tumour volume and metastatic features when curcumin is combined with chemotherapy, as compared to either agent alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We have previously reported that curcumin augments the effect of oxaliplatin against CRC cell lines, and restores efficacy in a cellular model of chemo-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, these findings were reproduced using a xenograft model, where a reduction in tumour size of 53% was observed following treatment with curcumin and oxaliplatin compared to a 16% reduction following treatment with oxaliplatin alone. These pre-clinical data are compelling and have provided the rationale for clinical investigation. Presently, two trials have provided early evidence of efficacy for curcumin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Efficacy of curcumin in the cancer setting has not yet been effectively addressed. Clinical reports of curcumin in combination with any chemotherapy regimen are confined to three small trials (two in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and one in metastatic breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]) plus a case report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These were small studies, not powered for efficacy, and lacked a control arm, but have provided evidence that patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy can tolerate daily curcumin for several months alongside their chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main aims of this study are to: establish a safe and suitable dose of curcumin to administer to patients receiving up to 6&#x000a0;months of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy; collect patient samples for biomarker and pharmacokinetic analysis; record patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life and peripheral neuropathy scores; observe progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>CUFOX (curcumin plus FOLFOX) is a Phase I dose-escalation study rolling in to a Phase IIa randomised controlled trial combining daily oral curcumin (C3-complex; Sabinsa Corp., UT, USA) with standard care FOLFOX-based chemotherapy in patients with histological diagnosis of metastatic CRC and disease measurable by response evaluation criteria for solid tumours (RECIST) 1.1, attending oncology clinics prior to chemotherapy. The study will not incorporate a placebo-controlled arm due to additional expense of sourcing an appropriate placebo. Identification of a suitable placebo is also complicated by the issue that curcumin (E100) is highly coloured and widely used as a food colouring. For Phase IIa, participants will therefore be randomised to FOLFOX&#x02009;+&#x02009;curcumin or FOLFOX only at a ratio of 2:1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study will recruit adults referred to the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust Oncology Department.

Body surface area must also be determined for FOLFOX dosing. Required haematological and clinical chemistry measurements will include haemoglobin, white blood cell count with differential if abnormal, platelet count, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and bilirubin. Chorioembryonic antigen will be measured in all patients at baseline and, if elevated, every 12&#x000a0;weeks thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Phase I traditional escalation response model (3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3) study</title><p>The sample size for Phase 1 is determined by the maximum dose desired (2&#x000a0;g/day based on previous trials within the local populace) and the number of tiers selected to step up to this dose (three tiers; 500&#x000a0;mg/day, 1&#x000a0;g/day and 2&#x000a0;g/day). In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), only three patients per tier will be required (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9); however, the &#x0201c;worse-case&#x0201d; scenario is taken into consideration, allowing resources to repeat each tier once if necessary (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18).</p><p>Three patients meeting the inclusion criteria will receive one oral capsule (500&#x000a0;mg) per day of curcumin (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), commencing 7&#x000a0;days prior to chemotherapy to allow acclimatisation and any curcumin-induced adverse events (AEs) to manifest prior to chemotherapy. In the absence of curcumin-related toxicity after 1&#x000a0;week, patients will commence standard care FOLFOX-based chemotherapy (modified to capecitabine&#x02009;+&#x02009;oxaliplatin, or FOLFOX&#x02009;+&#x02009;bevacizumab where appropriate). After a 4-week enhanced early monitoring phase, and in the absence of curcumin-associated dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in three consecutive patients, a further three participants will be recruited at 1&#x000a0;g/day oral curcumin (two capsules), and then to the maximum target dose of 2&#x000a0;g/day (four capsules). In the event of a DLT attributable to curcumin, the participant will cease involvement in the trial and a further three participants will be recruited at that dose level. If a participant withdraws for a reason unrelated to curcumin, only that participant will be replaced. Independent data monitoring will be convened prior to each dose escalation and prior to commencement of Phase II to ensure patient safety. De-escalation will be mandatory if more than two DLTs due to curcumin among six participants are observed within 4&#x000a0;weeks of commencing curcumin.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Firstly, our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] showed that whilst compliance was excellent (92%) amongst patients receiving 2.35&#x000a0;g taken in five daily capsules, participant questionnaires revealed a potential reluctance to take larger doses which would necessitate either a greater number or size of capsule; secondly, AEs may increase at doses in excess of 4&#x000a0;g, and greater caution must be observed in the presence of chemotherapy; thirdly, the dose required to exert pharmacological effect remains unknown.</p><p>A mouse model of polyp prevention demonstrating efficacy of curcumin proposes that 1.6&#x000a0;g per day delivered in a single dose to humans is likely to be sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Curcumin has been detected in plasma of patients receiving 2&#x000a0;g daily oral curcumin, and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of portal blood and hepatic tissue suggests that 3 to 4&#x000a0;g may be sufficient for activity in organs distal to the gut. Two grammes once a day is expected to be both a well-tolerated amount of curcumin yet also possess the potential to invoke a clinical response. At higher doses, participant compliance is likely to decrease and AEs increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>As the side-effect profile of curcumin in combination with FOLFOX-based therapy is unknown, a dose escalation arm is mandated. In controlled trials researching curcumin as a single agent, the AE incidence has been similar for both control and treatment arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the study by He and colleagues, which recruited patients with CRC in to a treatment and control group, 10/37 (27%) patients taking curcumin experienced diarrhoea compared with 8/32 (25%) in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite this, diarrhoea does appear to be a frequent side effect of curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], although AE symptoms are usually brief and mild.</p><p>The second phase of this trial will look more closely for potential differences to the side-effect profile of FOLFOX brought about by the addition of curcumin, via the inclusion of a control (FOLFOX only) arm. A further novel aspect of this study is to explore the putative anti-neuropathic properties of curcumin (extensively reported in pre-clinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) by use of a peripheral neuropathy scoring system.</p><p>To date, there are no studies providing evidence for clinical efficacy of the low-cost, low-toxicity diet-derived agent curcumin in the treatment of cancer. Relative risk or OS have been reported by studies involving small and heterogenous patient groups taking curcumin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or combined with chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and curcumin does not appear to impact negatively on survival. These studies have reported that it is both safe and feasible to combine curcumin with chemotherapy for several months in cancer patients, but that larger randomised control trials are required to investigate the efficacy of curcumin-chemotherapy regimens. CUFOX is the first randomised controlled trial of its kind and has the potential to provide early evidence of clinical efficacy of curcumin within the chemotherapeutic setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of article submission, the CUFOX trial has recruited 18 of 33 participants to the Phase 2 randomised controlled trial component of the study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>5-FU</term><def><p>5-fluorouracil</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p>colorectal cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CUFOX</term><def><p>curcumin plus FOLFOX</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLT</term><def><p>dose-limiting toxicity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOLFOX</term><def><p>folinic acid/5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p>intravenous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p>progression-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIS</term><def><p>patient information sheet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RECIST</term><def><p>response evaluation criteria for solid tumours</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>GRBI participated in study design, submission of regulatory paperwork, study coordination and helped draft the manuscript.
