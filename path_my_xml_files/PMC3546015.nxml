We previously reported that a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement increased the secretion rate of salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in humans.

They were randomized into two groups; one took placebo tablets during the spring camp and chlorella tablets during the summer camp, while the other took chlorella tablets during the spring camp and placebo tablets during the summer camp. Subjects took these tablets starting 4 weeks before the camp until post-camp saliva sampling. Salivary SIgA concentrations were measured by ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All subjects participated in nearly all training programs, and body-mass changes and subjective physical well-being scores during the camps were comparable between the groups. However, salivary SIgA secretion rate changes were different between these groups.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Rounds of heavy exercise depress salivary SIgA secretion, which results in an increased risk of infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In particular, athletes appear to require infection control during training camps because of the high-intensity physical activity and group living. Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] demonstrated that the secretion rate of salivary SIgA decreased by approximately 25% during a rugby football training camp, and this decrease was inversely related to the number of upper respiratory symptoms. Akimoto <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] also reported that the salivary SIgA secretion rate decreased by approximately 45% during a 3-day soccer competition involving 6 games. These reductions in salivary SIgA secretion in athletes may be preventable with dietary supplements. Indeed, various dietary supplements (<italic>e.g.</italic>, vitamins, bovine colostrum, and probiotics) have been tested for their effects on attenuating or suppressing the intensive exercise-related declines in immune function. However, the recently published position statement of the International Society of Exercise and Immunology noted that no adequate dietary supplements for SIgA secretion have been proposed for athletes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Chlorella is a unicellular green alga that grows in fresh water and contains high levels of proteins, chlorophylls, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers. Previous studies showed that chlorella-derived dietary supplements improved SIgA concentrations in breast milk
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and antibody responses to influenza in subjects aged 50&#x02013;55 years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Based on these findings, we conducted an intervention study and demonstrated that a 4-week chlorella supplementation program increased the salivary SIgA secretion rate by 40% in healthy humans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, it is not known if chlorella intake can attenuate reduced salivary SIgA secretion during a training camp for a competitive sport.</p><p>We hypothesized that a chlorella-derived dietary supplement would attenuate reduced salivary SIgA secretion during a training camp for a competitive sport. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a placebo and a chlorella supplement on the salivary SIgA secretion of participants during a training camp for <italic>kendo</italic>, a traditional Japanese sport, by using a single blinded, placebo-control study design. Although the absolute concentration of salivary SIgA is a good marker of mucosal immune function, a dehydration-induced reduction in the saliva flow rate can result in a sham increase in the SIgA concentration during a training camp. Therefore, we used the salivary SIgA secretion rate (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the total secretion volume per unit time) as the marker, as in previous studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, we compared salivary SIgA concentrations and saliva flow rates as indicators of possible mechanisms underlying the changes in the salivary SIgA secretion rate (<italic>i.e.</italic>, SIgA secretory function of T-cells and SIgA transport function by saliva). <italic>Kendo</italic> is a martial art in which a bamboo sword and protective armor <italic>bogu</italic>; <italic>men</italic> (mask), <italic>do</italic> (breastplate), <italic>kote</italic> (gloves), and <italic>tare</italic> (groin protector)] are used. The basic techniques are striking (<italic>men</italic>, <italic>kote,</italic> and <italic>do</italic>) and frontal thrusts to the neck. A match comprises a duel between two athletes and is the best of three points lasting up to 5 min. Because the match and practice include face-to-face contact, a <italic>kendo</italic> tournament is a risk factor for infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is also evidence that a <italic>kendo</italic> training camp involves high-intensity exercise, which reduces the levels of immune function-related cells including lymphocytes and other white blood cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, we recruited <italic>kendo</italic> athletes as subjects for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Ten female <italic>kendo</italic> athletes who belonged to a national-level university team participated in this study.

None of these athletes used dietary supplements on a regular basis and had no signs, symptoms, or history of overt chronic diseases. The participants were asked not to change their regular lifestyles (<italic>e.g.</italic>, eating habits) while taking the placebo or chlorella tablets during the experimental period. Their mean age was 20.1 &#x000b1; 0.9 years and their mean height was 1.58 &#x000b1; 0.04 m.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Health and Sport Sciences of the University of Tsukuba and conformed to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.

Four weeks before the spring camp, each group was prescribed either placebo or chlorella tablets in a single-blinded manner, which were to be taken at 30 tablets per day (15 tablets&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;twice, after breakfast and dinner). This was in accord with a general prescription for Japanese consumers of this product.</p><p>Based on the methods used in previous studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], saliva samples were obtained four days before the camp, on the second, fourth (middle), and sixth (final) day of the camp, and four days after the spring camp. Tablet intake was stopped after the post-camp saliva sample was collected. Patient compliance with regard to regular intake was documented in intake logs. Fifteen weeks after the end of the spring camp (<italic>i.e.</italic>, after a 15-week washout period), the summer camp trial was commenced. The procedures were the same as those used for the spring camp trial with a few modifications; saliva samples were collected one day before the camp; on the second, third (middle), and fourth (final) day of the camp; and five days after the camp.</p><p>Saliva samples before the spring camp were collected in the morning after overnight fasting. Sampling before the summer camp was done before lunch; subjects were asked to refrain from drinking and eating without water between the end of breakfast and saliva sampling. The time from the last training session to these saliva samplings was &#x0003e;20 h. During the spring and summer camps, saliva samples were collected as soon as possible after the end of the morning training session (<italic>i.e.</italic>, within 60 min). Again, subjects were asked to refrain from drinking and eating without water from the end of breakfast to the sampling. The after-camp saliva samplings were done in the morning after overnight fasting; the time from the last training session was &#x0003e;20 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Training camp</title><p>The <italic>kendo</italic> training camps included two separate training sessions on each day, one in the morning for 3.0 h (0900&#x02013;1200) during both camps and one in the afternoon for 4.0 h during the spring camp (1300&#x02013;1700) and 3.0 h during the summer camp (1400&#x02013;1700). There were no morning sessions on the first day of both camps. These sessions comprised warming-up periods, <italic>kendo</italic> practices, games, breaks, and cooling-down periods.

Although the scores for physical well-being before the camp were slightly lower than a usual level (3.0), all of our subjects participated in nearly all of the training programs. Body mass changes and subjective physical well-being scores during the camp were comparable between the placebo and chlorella groups. Based on these results, we consider that there were no intergroup differences in the physical requirements of this training camp. However, with respect to the baseline levels, salivary SIgA secretion rates decreased only with placebo intake but not with chlorella supplementation. These changes in the salivary SIgA secretion rate were comparable to the changes in the saliva flow rate. There were no changes in salivary SIgA concentrations during the camp. These results suggest that using a chlorella-derived dietary supplement attenuates the reduced salivary SIgA secretion during a training camp for a competitive sport like <italic>kendo</italic>.</p><p>We investigated the immune-enhancing effects of a chlorella-derived dietary supplement by determining the salivary SIgA secretion rates. Salivary SIgA is the first line of defense against respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia and influenza
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recently, Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] investigated salivary SIgA secretion rates, Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (human herpes virus) DNA levels in saliva, and the number of upper respiratory symptoms during a 1-month training camp for rugby football. They found that the salivary SIgA secretion rate was reduced on the day before the first expression of Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus DNA and that the number of symptoms increased after DNA expression. Fahlman <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] also reported that the salivary SIgA secretion rates were lower and the percent of subjects with upper respiratory tract infections was higher among university football players after they completed 6 weeks of very intensive training or 10 weeks of intercollegiate competition as compared to the beginning of the season and a period of rest and to a non-varsity group. The salivary SIgA concentration is also a good index for mucosal immune function. Gleeson <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that the mean salivary SIgA concentration during a 7-month training period for elite swimmers was inversely related to the number of infections contracted. However, salivary SIgA concentrations are unsuitable for investigating any acute effects of exercise training because exercise can affect the saliva flow rate, as demonstrated in this study. Indeed, Gleeson <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that salivary SIgA concentrations before an exercise session were related to the numbers of infections, but the concentrations immediately after the session were not. In light of this, we used the salivary SIgA secretion rate as an index for immunological depression induced by the <italic>kendo</italic> training camp.</p><p>In a previous study, we found that the salivary SIgA secretion rate increased after 4-week intake of a chlorella-derived supplement and that this increase derived primarily from the salivary SIgA concentration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, in the present study, we found no differences in the salivary SIgA secretion rates and concentrations before the camp between the placebo and chlorella groups. Because the salivary SIgA secretion rates before the camp, even in the placebo group, were higher than that we observed in our previous study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the potential for improving the salivary SIgA secretion might have been minimal. In addition, the camp-related decease in salivary SIgA secretion and its attenuation due to chlorella intake were due to changes in saliva flow rates. A possible reason is that a reduced salivary SIgA concentration was offset by a decrease in the saliva flow rate, which could result in no change in salivary SIgA concentrations. <italic>Bogu</italic> (<italic>i.e.</italic>, protective armor) obstructs the skin surface for evaporation and leads to heat accumulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A greater transpiration of saliva during <italic>kendo</italic> practice than during rest may be a reason for the marked decrease in saliva flow rates. However, these are only speculations. Additional studies will be needed to account for the mechanisms responsible for these discrepancies.</p><p>Because saliva samples were collected from the end of the morning training session to lunch during the camp, we consider that the acute and cumulative effects were included in the reduced salivary SIgA secretion during the camp. It is possible that reductions in salivary SIgA secretion after high-intensity exercise are mediated by a cytokine secretory function of T-cells via their expression of polymeric Ig receptors (pIgR) and by autonomic nerve activity via saliva secretion as a vehicle for SIgA. Kimura <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] showed that a brief round of intense exercise resulted in reducing the expression of pIgR mRNA in the submandibular gland, which paralleled a reduced salivary SIgA concentration. In the present study, the saliva flow rate reductions during the training camps were greater than the decreases in salivary SIgA concentrations. Thus, it is possible that the effects of chlorella intake on salivary SIgA secretion during the training camp may be more closely related to autonomic nerve regulation than to T-cell function.</p><p>Immune function is related to various nutrients, such as proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], vitamins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], iron
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and folate
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. With regard to proteins, the SIgA concentrations in saliva and nasal secretions were reportedly lower in protein-calorie malnourished children than in healthy children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, this improved with nutritional support in a hospital
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Vitamin A deficiency has also been shown to decrease SIgA concentrations in the saliva
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and intestinal fluids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] of experimental animals. In addition, a combined deficiency of pyridoxine, a vitamin B6 compound, and pantothenic acid reportedly resulted in decreased antibody titers in human sera
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. From a multicomponent analysis of the chlorella tablets we used, all of these nutrients were detected. Other nutrients that showed possible immune-enhancing effects in previous studies were also detected in chlorella tablets. Unfortunately, in this study, we could not determine which nutrient(s) attenuated the reduced salivary SIgA secretion during the training camp. However, it is reasonable that a wide spectrum of nutrients contributed to maintaining salivary SIgA secretion during the camp, as the individual components were not taken in large doses.</p><p>Various dietary supplements have been tested for their ability to attenuate immunological depression following intensive exercise. However, the reported effects of most nutrients were either negative or controversial; only two nutrients, carbohydrate and quercetin, have been recommended by the international society that specializes in exercise immunology
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, use of carbohydrate supplements before and/or during prolonged exercise has little effect on salivary SIgA secretion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The effect of quercetin on SIgA secretion remains unclear
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, dietary supplements that can attenuate the reduced SIgA secretion during a training camp have yet to be proposed. In this study, the chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement attenuated the decrease in salivary SIgA secretion during the <italic>kendo</italic> training camp, which suggests that supplementation with a mixture of various nutrients may be an efficient method to lower the infection risk in athletes. However, there may be a better composition for infection control in athletes. The next step will be to investigate changes in the serum concentration of nutrients that can affect SIgA secretion and determine the mechanisms involved in the observed effect of chlorella intake in order to determine the best nutritional composition of a dietary supplement for athletes.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, there were differences in the conditions between the spring and summer camps (<italic>e.g.</italic>, number of days and afternoon work-out times). Also, it is possible that the eating habits of our subjects changed during the experimental period and were different between the spring and summer trials. However, we randomly divided our subjects into (1) a spring camp with placebo and summer camp with chlorella group and (2) a spring camp with chlorella and summer camp with placebo group. In addition, we asked the subjects not to change their eating habits during the respective experimental periods (<italic>i.e.</italic>, from the beginning of tablet intake to post-camp saliva sampling). Thus, we consider that the effects of the differences in the conditions between the spring and summer camps on our inter-group comparisons were not remarkable. Second, we calculated saliva flow rates based on mass rather than measuring the actual volume. Because the reported specific gravity of saliva in healthy young humans is approximately 1.003, the saliva flow rate and the salivary SIgA secretion rate would have been only slightly overestimated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the body masses of our subjects did not decrease during the camps compared with their baseline values. A previous study reported that an exercise-induced loss of body mass of 1.1% did not change saliva osmolality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, it was possible to compare these indices obtained before the camp with those during and after the camp. Finally, it is possible that the timing of saliva sampling (before breakfast or before lunch) affected salivary SIgA secretion. A previous study demonstrated that the salivary SIgA concentration was not stable and was higher during the 2 h after awaking, especially during the first 30 min, compared to 3 to 10 h later
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, the tendencies for our samples collected only before and during the summer camp (<italic>i.e.</italic>, samples obtained with the same timing schedule) were nearly identical to those for all samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that using a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement attenuates the reduced salivary SIgA secretion during training camp for a competitive sport. This effect appears to be due mainly to attenuating the decrease in the saliva flow rate and not by changes in salivary SIgA concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SunChlorella Co., Ltd. provided funding for the study and supplied the test supplements used in the study.
