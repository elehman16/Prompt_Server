Traditionally, sniffing position (SP) is recommended to provide a superior glottic visualization, during direct laryngoscopy, enhancing the ease of intubation. Various studies in the last decade of this belief have challenged the need for sniffing position during intubation. We conducted a prospective study comparing the sniffing head position with simple head extension to study the laryngoscopic view and intubation difficulty during direct laryngoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Five-hundred patients were included in this study and randomly distributed to SP or simple head extension. In the sniffing group, an incompressible head ring was placed under the head to raise its height by 7 cm from the neutral plane followed by maximal extension of the head. In the simple extension group, no headrest was placed under the head; however, maximal head extension was given at the time of laryngoscopy. Various factors as ability to mask ventilate, laryngoscopic visualization, intubation difficulty, and posture of the anesthesiologist during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were noted. In the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy (Cormack Grade III and IV), Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS score) was compared between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was no significant difference between two groups in Cormack grades. The IDS score differed significantly between sniffing group and simple extension group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) with an increased difficulty during intubation in the simple head extension.

The ability to have a good visualization of the glottis is the major determinant of easy tracheal intubation. In 1936, Ivan Magill recommended sniffing position (SP) for the best laryngeal exposure.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Bannister and Macbeth proposed the three axes alignment theory (TAAT) advocating that SP causes alignment of laryngeal, pharyngeal, and oral axis causing line of vision to fall on the glottis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Horton <italic>et al</italic>. gave further quantitative dimensions to this concept by defining the angle for neck flexion to be 35&#x000b0; and the plane of face extension with the horizontal at 15&#x000b0;.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Alternative theories to TAAT were propounded by Chou and Wu[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Isono.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Chou and Wu[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] provided an alternative to three axes alignment theory, pointing out that the airway is actually a three-dimensional space. They observed that in majority of the patients with slight head extension, the tongue could be easily displaced and laryngeal exposure was satisfactory. &#x0201c;Obstacle theory&#x0201d; proposed that SP is a &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for laryngoscopy as head elevation in SP moves the anterior obstacles upward, head extension moves posterior obstacle downward, and laryngoscopy moves anterior obstacle upward, thus allowing line of vision to pass through the created space.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The basis of SP was challenged by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>. who could not find any axis alignment in a radiograph obtained during intubation in the SP, thus challenging the anatomical soundness of the SP.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, these findings were criticized subsequently as it was noted that the neck flexion angle in the radiograph was barely 5&#x000b0;.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Benumof noticed that the inability by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>. to observe the alignment may have been a result of failure to position the patients head in a proper SP.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This criticism led to further studies by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>. and they found that the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) was similar between the patients in SP and simple head extension.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, laryngoscopy in these patients was done without administering a muscle relaxant. This could have led to suboptimal conditions for laryngoscopy. Most of the studies[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have studied the Cormack&#x02013;Lehane grading or percentage of glottic opening scoring[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as a predictor for the ease of intubation. However, in our study, we have incorporated the IDS in addition to Cormack&#x02013;Lehane grading (after administration of neuromuscular blocking agents) to assess the ease of intubation during direct laryngoscopy. The use of IDS appears to be more scientific than the comparison of Cormack&#x02013;Lehane grading as direct laryngoscopy is a dynamic act, and many factors as the type of laryngoscopy blade, its lifting force, and airway anatomy determine the ease of intubation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the differences, if any, between SP and simple head extension position, with regard to the incidence of difficult mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, and difficult intubation in adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia with the administration of muscle paralysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This prospective, randomized study was undertaken at a tertiary care hospital in northern India. Five-hundred consecutive, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I&#x02013;III adult patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia needing tracheal intubation were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated in the preanesthetic assessment a day before surgery by an anesthesiologist (Zulfiqar Ali). The following things were noted in the airway assessment: (1) Modified Mallampati Classification as described by Samsoon and Young,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (2) temporomandibular joint mobility, whether interincisor gap was &#x02264;3 cm on mouth opening, (3) forward protrusion of the mandible which was assessed by the ability to move the lower teeth in front of the upper teeth, (4) thyromental distance and sternomental distance - measured from the thyroid notch and upper border of the manubrium sterni to the mentum, respectively, with the head in full extension and the mouth closed, (5) any abnormal dentition in the form of loose, protruding, or missing upper incisors or canine teeth, (6) neck length from the mastoid process to sternal head of clavicle with head in neutral position, (7) the maximum range of head and neck movement &#x0003c;80&#x000b0; or &#x0003e; 80&#x000b0; as described by Wilson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (8) body mass index in kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and (9) presence of short neck, beard, or cervical spondylosis. Patients with ASA Physical Status IV or any abnormal airway anatomy were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were randomized into sniffing group or simple head extension group by a computer-generated randomized table. In the sniffing group, an incompressible head ring was placed under the head to raise its height by 7 cm from the neutral plane. This was followed by maximal extension of the head at the atlanto-occipital joint at the time of laryngoscopy. In the simple extension group, no headrest was placed under the head; however, maximal head extension was given at the time of laryngoscopy. The height of the operating table was adjusted to place the patient's forehead at the level of xiphisternum of the attending anesthesiologist (Zulfiqar Ali). Face mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, glottis visualization, and intubation were done by a senior anesthesiologist (Zulfiqar Ali) with more than 10 years of experience.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and propofol (2 mg/kg) till loss of verbal commands by the patient. Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was used to facilitate the tracheal intubation. Ventilation was done using a mixture of 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide. Mask ventilation was graded as easy, difficult, or impossible [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] as described by Langeron <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] During the induction of anesthesia, a fresh gas flow of oxygen was maintained at 10 L/min.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grading of mask ventilation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Laryngoscopy was performed by the same anesthesiologist (Zulfiqar Ali) using Macintosh size 3 blade.

Intubation was performed with tracheal tube size 7&#x02013;7.5 mm in females and size 8 and 8.5 mm in males. Intubation difficulty was assessed by seven variables of the IDS [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] as described by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] An anesthesiology assistant observed the posture of the anesthesiologist performing laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intubation Difficulty Scale and its grading</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data collected intraoperatively were summarized and compiled.

There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups in the factors [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>] that may be predictive of difficult intubation. Hence, both the groups included demographic and anatomically homogenous population. In the sniffing group, there was a significant gas flow leak from the face mask in three patients and necessity to perform two-handed mask ventilation in two patients. Similarly, in the head extension group, three patients required an increase in oxygen gas flow to 15 L/min and one patient had a gas leak from the face mask. There was no difference in the visualization of the glottis [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>] as assessed by Cormack and Lehane grades with 27 (10.8%) patients having a difficult visualization in sniffing group and 30 (12.0%) patients in simple head extension group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.082).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Demographic profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of patient characteristics predictive of difficult intubation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g004"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of views obtained during laryngoscopy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g005"/></table-wrap><p>The distribution of IDS scores for patients in the two groups is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>.

There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the stance adopted by the anesthesiologists performing laryngoscopy and intubation; in 62% (155 patients) of cases in the simple extension group, the anesthesiologist bent at the knee, or stooped to bring the face closer to the patient during laryngoscopy and intubation to obtain the best laryngeal view compared with 12% (102 patients) in the SP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Variables of the Intubation Difficulty Scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-762-g007"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>Our results showed that the more patients had lower IDS (easier intubations) in SP when compared to simple head extension. The posture adopted by the anesthesiologists was upright in most instances when the patients were intubated in SP than the simple head extension group. We observed in our study that a greater number of patients intubated in the simple head extension position required more than one attempt at intubation, use of ELM, use of alternate techniques, and use of increased force during laryngoscopy compared to those intubated in the SP. Hence, it was easier to intubate in the SP than in the simple head extension. Our study was consistent with the results observed by Levitan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who in their study showed that glottic opening scores measured from 31% in the head flat to 64% in mid-elevation to 87% with maximal elevation positions. Similarly, Park <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared the laryngoscopic views in the neutral position and with different pillows of 3, 6, and 9 cm heights in adult patients. The laryngoscopic view was best with 9 cm elevation and the view improved with the addition of pillows in short-necked patients. They found a significant correlation between the neck length and the pillow height needed to provide the best view.</p><p>Schmitt and Mang[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that head and neck extension beyond SP improved laryngeal view in those patients who had difficult in direct laryngoscopy. In a manikin study conducted by Brindley <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] &#x0201c;win with the chin&#x0201d; analogy resulted in adequate airway positioning in novices being trained for airway management. In a study conducted by Johnson and Goodman,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] a lot of variabilities were seen by the anesthesiologists in mimicking SP; hence, there is a need to standardize the SP. The lack of standardization may lead to the findings observed by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that SP did not really facilitate better glottis visualization and easier intubation.</p><p>Singhal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Sahay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] did a similar study comparing the IDS scores between the SP and simple head extension. Singhal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used suxamethonium for muscle relaxation in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg while Sahay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used vecuronium in contrast to our study. We observed similar results to Singhal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] with better glottis visualization and lower intubation difficulty scores with the use of atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) to facilitate tracheal intubation. Our study had the advantages over both these studies, in that we standardized the height of the operating table to place the patient's forehead at the level of xiphisternum of the attending anesthesiologist. Observations by a single anesthesiologist reduced the interobserver variability and reduced the observer bias between the two groups. In contrast to studies of Singhal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Sahay <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] our study additionally noted the lifting force of the laryngoscope and posture adopted by the anesthesiologists during intubation. A reduced lifting force on the laryngoscope and upright posture was noted when the patients were intubated in SP than the simple head extension group.</p><p>Recent studies by Greenland <italic>et al</italic>. based on magnetic resonance imaging of the airway proposed the two-curve theory &#x02013; primary oropharyngeal curve and secondary pharyngo-glotto-tracheal curve instead of three axes alignment theory. The authors have shown the superiority of SP on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging study done in neutral, extension, head left, and SP in healthy adult volunteers.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] They found a reduction in the area between the line of sight and the airway curve in the SP compared with the neutral position. Although the SP may not result in complete axis alignment on its own, it brings the axis as close as possible in preparation for complete alignment to be achieved by laryngoscopy blade.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Direct laryngoscopy is a dynamic procedure, and multiple maneuvers are needed to improve the glottis view. Many factors such as type and size of the blade, laryngoscopic lifting force, operator experience, and patient airway anatomy affect the degree of glottis exposure and need to be individualized to avoid the bias arising from these factors. Large trials on different patient populations are needed. However, we conclude that with the available evidence so far, and the results from our study, SP is better for optimal laryngeal exposure and ease of intubation. Our study showed that SP conferred a distinct advantage for tracheal intubation as assessed by the intubation difficulty score.
