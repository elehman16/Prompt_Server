It includes both primary and secondary types of dysmenorrhea. For this study, however, we considered only primary dysmenorrhea under the term <italic>Kashtartava</italic> to cover a larger population and to make a pin-pointed assessment criteria. Thus, 40 patients in the age-group of 15&#x02013;25 years suffering from primary dysmenorrhea were registered for the study. Of these patients, 35 completed the course of treatment. The selected patients were randomly allotted into two groups. Group A received <italic>Dashamoola Taila Matra Basti</italic> and group B received <italic>Tila Taila Matra Basti</italic>. These treatments were selected for the <italic>Vatashamaka, Yonishula Prashaman</italic>, and <italic>Shothahara</italic> properties of the drugs. The dose was 60 ml per day and the duration of treatment was for 7 days each cycle for two consecutive cycles. Results were assessed according to a specially prepared grading system for pain, <italic>Alpartava, Yatochitkaladarshana, Praseka, Chhardi, Vibandha, Shrama, Atisara, Vankshana</italic>, Kati, <italic>Janu Shula, Shiroshula, Swedadhikya</italic>, and <italic>Tamodarshana</italic>. Significant improvement was seen in symptoms in both groups, and on comparing the results in the two groups we found that the results were almost equivalent. There was complete remission of symptoms in 38.89% in group A and in 35.39% in group B, while there was marked improvement in 50% in group A and 47.65% in group B. However, there was a marked difference between the two groups with regard to recurrence of symptoms during the follow-up period of 2 months, with recurrence being significantly more in group B. The study suggests that Matra Basti can be a reliable treatment for relieving the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. We recommend that more research be done to confirm the findings of this study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Kashtartava</italic></kwd><kwd>primary dysmenorrhea</kwd><kwd><italic>Matra Basti</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Dashamoola Taila</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Tila Taila</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological problem faced by women during their adolescence. It causes significant discomfort and anxiety for the woman as well as her family. A systematic review of studies from developing countries revealed that about 25%&#x02013;50% of adult women and about 75% of adolescents experience pain during menstruation, with 5%&#x02013;20% reporting severe dysmenorrhea or pain that is severe enough to prevent them from carrying out their day-to-day activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The word <italic>Kashtartava</italic> itself gives an idea of the difficulty experienced during menstruation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] <italic>Kashtartava</italic> can be taken to be the same as the &#x02018;dysmenorrhea&#x02019; of modern medicine. For the present study we only considered primary dysmenorrhea as <italic>Kashtartava</italic> so that we would have clear-cut inclusion and exclusion criteria when selecting patients and to facilitate statistical analysis of data. Primary dysmenorrhea is a condition which causes painful menstruation without any demonstrable pelvic pathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In addition to menstrual pain, many woman experience associated symptoms such as headache, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and leg pains.</p><p>The etiology of uterine pain in primary dysmenorrhea is still not established. But several risk factors have been identified, such as young age, early menarche, positive family history, nulliparity, stress/depression, and smoking. There are many theories regarding the pathophysiology of the condition,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] with the prostaglandin theory being the one that is most generally accepted.</p><p>The treatment usually advocated in modern medicine, i.e., analgesics, antispasmodics, and/or oral contraceptive pills,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] does not provide a long-lasting solution and, besides, may lead to serious adverse effects. As yet there is no treatment regimen that can relieve the entire symptom complex of primary dysmenorrhea. Hence, there is a need to find a safe and long-lasting treatment for the condition. <italic>Kashtartava</italic>, especially when it manifests as primary dysmenorrhea, is a <italic>Vata</italic>-dominant condition. The two drugs that we selected for this study are good <italic>Vatashamaka</italic> drugs according to the classic texts. <italic>Dashamoola</italic> oil has been advocated for the treatment of <italic>Udavarta Yonivyapada</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] which is one of the main disease conditions included under the term <italic>Kashtartava</italic> (primary dysmenorrhea). <italic>Tila Taila</italic> (sesame oil) is the best drug for the treatment of <italic>Vataja</italic> condition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and also has properties of <italic>Yoni Shula Prashamana</italic> and <italic>Garbhashaya Vishodhana</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>The aims of the study were to find out the efficacy of <italic>Matra Basti</italic> on the symptom complex of <italic>Kashtartava</italic> (primary dysmenorrhea) and to compare the efficacies of the two selected drugs in relieving <italic>Kashtartava</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of drugs</title><p>The ten ingredients of dried <italic>Dashamoola</italic> were collected from the pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.Microscopic examination of the powder showed the presence of root as well as stem bark of the plants.

Before administration of <italic>Basti, Abhyanaga</italic> (massage) with <italic>Tila Taila</italic> was done of the back and lower abdomen. Thereafter, <italic>Nadi Sweda</italic> (sudation) was performed. After this <italic>Purvakarma</italic>, the patient was asked to lie down in the left lateral position with the left lower extremity extended and the right lower extremity flexed at the knees and hips. Then 60 ml of lukewarm oil was loaded in an enema syringe. A rubber catheter oleated with oil was attached to the enema syringe. After any air in the enema syringe had been expelled, the rubber catheter was passed through the anus of the patient up to a length of 4 inches and the drug was administered. The patient was asked to take deep breaths during the passage of the catheter and the administration of the drug. The entire oil in the syringe was not administered in order to avoid entrance of <italic>Vayu</italic> into the <italic>Pakvashaya</italic> as it may produce pain. After the administration of <italic>Basti</italic>, the patient was advised assume the supine position. While in this position, the patient's buttocks were gently tapped and the legs were raised for a few minutes so as to raise the waist. These measures were intended to prevent the administered fluid from flowing out too soon. After a short time the patient was allowed to get up from the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, and she was then advised to rest in bed for at least &#x000bd; an hour.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Posology</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-305-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Assessment</title></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Scoring for different parameters was done as follows</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Pain (dysmenorrhea)</title><p>

We did this in order to exclude the pathological cases; however, no disease can be primary according to Ayurvedic principles as every disease has a certain pathology underlying it. Although it is not absolutely correct to say a disease is &#x02018;primary&#x02019; in Ayurvedic terminology, we overlooked this so that we would have clear-cut inclusion and exclusion criteria and also to facilitate statistical analysis of data.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, therefore, we made an effort to classify all disorders with any type of pain or discomfort related to menstruation as either primary or secondary. All menstrual disorders in which pain or discomfort was the most prominent feature were categorized as primary dysmenorrhea; those in which there were local features such as inflammation or systemic features such as fever were considered as secondary dysmenorrhea. There are several conditions, including <italic>Vatala, Vataja Artavadushti, Udavarta, Suchimukhi, and Artavakshaya</italic>, in which there is pain associated with menstruation along with backache, pain in groins, stiffness, etc. but no abnormality of menstruation other than perhaps a decrease in the amount of flow or the duration. This picture suggests that these conditions are a form of primary dysmenorrhea, without any pelvic pathology. Other diseases such as <italic>Sannipataki, Paripluta, Asrugdhara, and Kshina Artava Dushti</italic> show specific menstrual irregularities, i.e., heavy bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, yellow or green colored discharge, yellow or green discoloration, or abnormal odor, etc., along with dysmenorrhea. Some are also associated with fever. Thus, these conditions can be classified as secondary dysmenorrhea, where there is involvement of <italic>Dosha</italic> other than <italic>Vata</italic>.</p><p>The risk factors for <italic>Kashtartava</italic> that we identified in this study were similar to those mentioned for dysmenorrhea [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Early onset of menarche and early age at menarche, which are mentioned as risk factors for dysmenorrhea,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] were found in 68.57% and 77.14% of patients, respectively. The theory postulated to explain this finding is that the pituitary and other endocrine gland do not attain their maturity till the age of 20 years. This can lead to hormonal imbalance and, thus, dysmenorrhea. A positive family history of dysmenorrhea was found in 77.24% of patients, which supports the concept of &#x02018;<italic>Kulaja</italic>&#x02019; in Ayurveda. This is considered as a risk factor in modern science also. Nulliparity, which is considered a risk factor for dysmenorrhea was found in 85.71% of patients. Vaginal delivery removes any stenosis of the cervical canal and thus facilitates the flow of menstrual blood. History of smoking was not found in any patient. This is not surprising as smoking is uncommon among Indian women.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Risk factors of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-305-g003"/></fig><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Nidana</title><p>Almost all the patients were consuming the causative factors of Vata vitiation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. <italic>Vishamashana</italic> (improper dietary habits) was found in 54.28% patients. It is a very important factor for aggravation of <italic>Vata</italic>. Other <italic>Vata</italic>-vitiating dietetic factors were also found in some patients, such as intake of <italic>Laghu</italic> and <italic>Ruksha Guna</italic> (light and ununctuous) diet in 22.85% and intake of <italic>Shita</italic> (cold) diets in 17.14%. <italic>Katu Rasa</italic> dominance was found in 34.28% of patients and this is also known to vitiate <italic>Vata</italic>. Thus, <italic>Vata Vardhaka Nidanas</italic> are important factors for causing <italic>Kashtartava</italic>. With regard to the <italic>Manasika Nidanas</italic> (psychological factors), <italic>Chinta</italic> (worry), <italic>Shoka</italic> (grief), and <italic>Bhaya</italic> (fear) were found in 54.28%, 40%, and 31.42% of patients, respectively. These are <italic>Vatavardhaka</italic> factors and are becoming commoner in young girls because of changing lifestyles. This is an era of competition and young girls have to face more challenges today than in the past.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Nidana related to <italic>Kashtartava</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-305-g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Associated symptoms</title><p>Though hypomenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are not mentioned as the associated symptoms of dysmenorrhea in modern texts, it is described in the Ayurvedic classics as <italic>Yathochitakala Adarshanam</italic> (oligomenorrhea) and <italic>Alpartava</italic> (hypomenorrhea). In our study, 22.85% of patients had <italic>Alpartava</italic> and 37.14% had oligomenorrhea [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Thus, the data regarding this observation are suggestive of the Ayurvedic approach of relation of <italic>Alpartava</italic> with <italic>Kashtartava</italic>. This relationship can be very well explained on the basis of vitiation of <italic>Vata</italic>, as both <italic>Alpartava</italic> and <italic>Kashtartava</italic> are the outcome of <italic>Vata Vriddhi. Aruchi, Shrama, Vibandha</italic>, and <italic>Shiroshula</italic> were found in 54.28%, 74.28%, 54.28%, and 45.71% patients, respectively.
