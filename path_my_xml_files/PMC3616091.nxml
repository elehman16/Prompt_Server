In addition to effects on energy intake the two bariatric techniques may differentially influence energy expenditure (EE). Gastric bypass in rats increases postprandial EE enough to result in elevated EE over 24 hours. This study aimed to investigate alterations in postprandial EE after gastric bypass and VBG in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fourteen women from a randomized clinical trial between gastric bypass (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) and VBG (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) were included. Nine years postoperatively and at weight stability patients were assessed for body composition and calorie intake. EE was measured using indirect calorimetry in a respiratory chamber over 24 hours and focused on the periods surrounding meals and sleep. Blood samples were analysed for postprandial gut hormone responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Groups did not differ regarding body composition or food intake either preoperatively or at study visit. Gastric bypass patients had higher EE postprandially (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.018) and over 24 hours (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.048) compared to VBG patients. Postprandial peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels were higher after gastric bypass (both p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Gastric bypass patients have greater meal induced EE and total 24 hours EE compared to VBG patients when assessed 9 years postoperatively. Postprandial satiety gut hormone responses were exaggerated after gastric bypass compared to VBG. Long-term weight loss maintenance may require significant changes in several physiological mechanisms which will be important to understand if non-surgical approaches are to mimic the effects of bariatric surgery.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study received financial support by the Swedish Research Council (LF; grant no K2010-55X-21432-01-2), the University of Gothenburg (LF, MW) and Sahlgrenska University Hospital (ALF: LF, HL), the Gothenburg Medical Association (MW), Ethicon Endosurgery (HL), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (MB).

While non-surgical therapies are currently of limited efficacy <xref rid="pone.0060280-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, bariatric surgery provides long term body weight loss and maintenance associated with decreased morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0060280-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060280-Sjostrom2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The magnitude of weight loss and metabolic effects are not uniform and show a wide distribution between standard bariatric procedures. For example, gastric bypass has superior long term weight loss maintenance and resolution of co morbidities compared to vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) <xref rid="pone.0060280-Sjostrom1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Buchwald1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, but one of the differences is the increased postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) associated with enhanced satiation after gastric bypass <xref rid="pone.0060280-Borg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The exaggerated GLP-1 or PYY responses after food intake are absent after VBG. Release of GLP-1 and of PYY from endocrine L cells in the distal ileum and colon are attenuated in morbidly obese subjects after food intake <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while exaggerated after gastric bypass <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast to gastric bypass, patients after VBG usually do not report long lasting changes in appetite. Weight loss after VBG, seems primarily due to a narrowed gastric lumen restraining patients from ingesting large meals leading to lowered total calorie intake <xref rid="pone.0060280-Laurenius1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, although food preferences tend to change towards energy rich foods <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Until now, weight loss after bariatric operations has been mainly attributed to reduced food ingestion, whereas effects on energy expenditure have not been fully explored. Diurnal energy expenditure is positively related to body weight and fat free mass <xref rid="pone.0060280-Ravussin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Hence, obese weight-stable individuals have a greater total energy turnover compared to lean individuals. Three major factors account for this observation; 1. the body mass <italic>per se</italic> and particularly the greater amount of lean body mass, both of which consume energy; 2. the postprandial energy expenditure which is higher due to greater food intake and 3. increased energy cost of activities of daily living while having a greater body weight <xref rid="pone.0060280-Bessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Consequently, reduced energy expenditure is a physiological response which may promote weight regain <xref rid="pone.0060280-Froidevaux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060280-Sumithran1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This antagonizes long-term weight loss after diets and at least partly explains why dietary interventions often are unsuccessful in maintaining long-term weight loss.</p><p>Similar to diet induced weight loss, patients after gastric bypass and VBG have a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a function of the amount of weight lost <xref rid="pone.0060280-Thorne1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-vanGemert1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, animal experiments indicate that the pattern of energy expenditure might be different after gastric bypass surgery. We and others demonstrated increased diet-induced energy expenditure in rats after gastric bypass operations compared to sham operated, body weight matched rats <xref rid="pone.0060280-Bueter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Stylopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The diet-induced effects in rats were sufficient to increase 24 hour energy expenditure even though no changes were observed in physical activity or body temperature between groups <xref rid="pone.0060280-Bueter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Stylopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the gastric bypass effects on energy expenditure in humans are controversial with some studies reporting increases and others no change or decreases of energy expenditure <xref rid="pone.0060280-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Carrasco1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060280-Flancbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Discrepancies may be at least partly explained by heterogeneous patient populations and/or limitations of study protocols. Measurements of energy expenditure require great precision and should be performed in a way that allows analysis during daily activities. As robustness of the generated data depends on equipment quality, respiratory chambers for indirect calorimetry over 24 hours provide more accurate data than commonly used hood systems. Body composition measurements by DEXA are also more accurate than anthropometry or bio-impedance.</p><p>Against this background, we hypothesized that gastric bypass in humans results in higher energy expenditure after food intake, <italic>ie</italic> higher postprandial thermogenesis compared to VBG patients. Our secondary outcome was energy expenditure over 24 hours after both surgical techniques. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry in a respiratory chamber using weight stable patients that were matched for weight and body composition 9 years after randomisation to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic vertical-banded gastroplasty <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Gothenburg (Ref 359-09) and was conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki declaration.

Many of the patients who had VBG operations were converted to gastric bypass operations and thus there were only seven of the original 34 female VBG patients available to participate in our study. We further included 7 female gastric bypass patients from the same study that primarily matched the VBG group for gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), preoperative resting energy expenditure and postoperative BMI. All patients were weight stable at least 3 months prior to the study and received similar multivitamin and mineral supplementations for three weeks before the start of investigations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0060280-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic data for both groups with no significant differences in preoperative BMI, body composition or REE as measured with a canopy indirect calorimeter <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

However, there is a growing body of evidence supporting that other mechanisms such as reduced hunger <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, increased satiety <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-leRoux3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, altered taste <xref rid="pone.0060280-Burge1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Scruggs1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, as well as reduced preference for high caloric dense foods <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Brolin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060280-Halmi1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> are responsible for weight loss induction and maintenance after gastric bypass. However, the mechanisms mediating higher postprandial energy expenditure after gastric bypass have not yet been determined. Exclusion of the proximal small bowel from nutrients, and/or the reduction in common channel length may play a role. If so, a similar effect can be expected after biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch. The altered anatomy after gastric bypass surgery may change gastrointestinal and central neuroendocrine signalling after food ingestion, which in turn may induce the increase in energy expenditure. Postprandial release of bile acids and gut hormones such as PYY, oxyntomodulin and GLP-1 are markedly enhanced after gastric bypass and may influence total energy expenditure <xref rid="pone.0060280-Carrasco1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Burge1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our findings that postprandial PYY and GLP-1 responses are still increased nine years following gastric bypass surgery are consistent with the before mentioned hypothesis.</p><p>The present study has several limitations: Energy expenditure prior to surgery was not measured in a 24 hour chamber, but with an indirect calorimeter using a canopy. Although the study only tested patients on one occasion, 9.4 years after surgery the patients were weight stable, healthy and were asked to continue their physical activity, work, sleep and eating habits the week prior to the study. Even though patients were recruited from a randomized controlled trial, the small sample size and the fact that we only studied female patients may limit generalizability. The small sample size may also explain why we did not see a difference in 24 hour energy expenditure when adjusted for lean body mass. We were not able to measure post-prandial thermogenesis for more than 2 hours even though it has been shown to remain elevated up to 5 hours after a meal <xref rid="pone.0060280-Bessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> in resting subjects. Our patients consumed 120 kcal after 2 hours, because the meal frequency of patients after RYGB increases and patients usually eat smaller but more frequent meals <xref rid="pone.0060280-Laurenius1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The protocol used for this study therefore tried to reflect the usual eating pattern of patients after surgery with a small snack 2 hours after dinner which unfortunately prohibited the measurement of postprandial energy expenditure over 5 hours after the evening meal. All patients were asked to exercise during their stay in the chamber, but none of them was able to achieve the predefined physical activity which necessitated exclusion of this period from analysis. Finally, the gastric bypass group exhibited a (non-significant) larger body weight loss and higher age than the VBG group. However, both these results would, if anything, mediate a greater reduction in energy expenditure as oppose to an enhanced energy expenditure as we observed in the gastric bypass group <xref rid="pone.0060280-Carrasco1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060280-Olbers3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the present study indicates that patients treated with gastric bypass had higher early postprandial energy expenditure compared to patients having similar weight loss following a vertical banded gastroplasty. The postprandial effect partly explains why 24 hour energy expenditure is higher in gastric bypass patients and why this operation is superior to vertical banded gastroplasty regarding long-term weight loss maintenance. The yet to be determined gastrointestinal mechanism(s) activating energy expenditure in association with gastric bypass may offer novel therapeutic targets for obesity treatments or allow for better and safer surgical operations to be designed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Bj&#x000f6;rn Henning for his technical expertise in setting up and maintenance of the energy chamber.
