Patients were included in the study after written informed consent was obtained. The study group comprised patients from an urban slum referred for treatment for alcohol dependence. Inclusion criteria were ICD-10(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>) criteria for alcohol dependence, history of having held employment sometime during their life, and living with family. Patients with a history of serious criminal activity or major physical or psychiatric illness were excluded from the study. Patients in the control group consisted of age-matched patients of similar socio-economic background but not residing in the same slum.</p><p>After obtaining written informed consent, both groups were assessed at baseline for socio-demographic details, quantity and frequency of substance use, and related dysfunction. They were also given the Alcohol Problem Questionnaire.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>) Both groups received comprehensive care, predominantly in-patient, which included detoxification and individual, group, and family counseling. The average in-patient stay was 21-28 days.</p><p>Following discharge, the study group received continued care through weekly visits to the community by trained counselors. Follow-up visits were carried out in the community clinic within the slum, and a home visit was subsequently made if the patient did not attend the community clinic. The follow-up visit focused on simple relapse prevention messages and providing support to the patient and families. Patients were encouraged to resume work. For those unable to find work immediately, supported employment at minimum wage was offered in the rehabilitation section of the hospital. Patients in supported employment were also counseled regarding relapse prevention.</p><p>Patients in the control group were given routine fortnightly follow-up visits at the hospital out-patient clinic. Those who did not show up for routine visits were sent a reminder letter.</p><p>Follow-up evaluation was carried out at 3-month intervals following discharge for a total period of 12 months (3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and end of 1 year). At baseline and at the follow-up visits, the information obtained was corroborated by both the patient and family member.</p><p>Data was analyzed using Student's t-test, and paired t-test to compare the study and control groups at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 99 patients were included in the study, with 50 patients in the study group and 49 patients in the control group.

The findings of Project Match,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>) which compared three different time-limited therapies for alcohol dependence, showed that although there were significant improvements in all groups, many patients returned to alcohol use following treatment. This finding also underscores the need for continuing care.

Our findings suggest that monitored &#x02018;after care&#x02019; sustains the improvements made by alcohol dependents during their in-patient treatment. It has been suggested that brief contacts, both actual follow-up(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>) and even telephonic contacts,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>) have the ability to support abstinence and prevent relapses. Our intervention consisted mainly of ongoing personal contact with treating staff, support for person and family, as well as supported employment. Supported employment allows the person to develop good work habits and also allows more frequent contact with counsellors to reinforce recovery and non drug use. Although affiliation with groups like the Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown to improve outcome,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>) attempts to refer to groups such as AA did not work in our study group.</p><p>The study group was identified from a single geographically determined area, a slum. This was because the study emerged from a community-based drug rehabilitation project. Addiction treatment services for marginalized groups living in slums are woefully inadequate particularly in developing countries like India, and for the few who had previously accessed treatment services at the hospital, early relapse had been a rule. The improvements sustained in this project were, therefore, singularly significant. One of the limitations of the study is the ratings on the alcohol drinking that were made at each 3-month follow-up visit, for the prior month alone. Although this may not be reflective of the entire 3-month period, it was done to overcome the problem of retrospective recall.</p><p>Despite the limitations of the study (small sample size, study group drawn from a defined slum area), we have demonstrated, in a prospective design, the sustaining effect of continued care in alcohol dependence. This study emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive and continuing care approach to maintain gains of initial interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was carried out as part of a
