Medications are the most common first-line treatment but often have limited benefit or adverse events. Surgical treatments, such as spinal cord stimulation, are then often considered. External non-invasive peripheral nerve stimulation (EN-PENS) is a form of electrical stimulation that involves placing a pen-shaped electrode onto the skin, which can be easily self-administered by patients.

Pain can persist long after the initial cause has resolved. An estimated 8 in every 100 people in the UK have persistent chronic neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Neuropathic pain is often severely debilitating, it impinges on the physical, economic and emotional well-being of patients and is associated with low quality of life (QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Neuropathic pain is very challenging to manage because of the heterogeneity of its aetiology and underlying mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Current management guidelines are heavily weighted on pharmacotherapy, often with modest outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. When pharmacotherapy management is measured as sub-optimal, either due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief, next-line therapy options include surgical lesioning or neuromodulation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A disadvantage of surgical lesioning is that it is non-adjustable and not reversible. Many procedures such as neurotomies have been discontinued in clinical practice. Neuromodulation therapy involves using electrical or chemical technology that acts directly upon nerves to alter or modulate nerve activity. The majority of neuromodulation technologies are invasive. Treatments such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS) require surgical implants. Less invasive technologies such as percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) involve electrical stimulation of needles inserted within the skin to target peripheral nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A disadvantage of such therapies is that the patient will require invasive procedures to obtain benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Non-invasive neuromodulation technologies include external non-invasive peripheral nerve stimulation (EN-PENS) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). EN-PENS is a neuromodulation technology in which an electrode is positioned on the skin over the injured nerve, and low-frequency electrical stimulation (1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;Hz) is applied to the nerve. This stimulation mode aims to achieve long-lasting analgaesia through a specific mechanism, preferential activation of superficial nociceptive A-delta fibres inducing long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These effects can last up to a few days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], rendering this an attractive stimulation mode for intermittent applications. Patients can also easily be taught to self-administer treatment safely at home.</p><p>In contrast to EN-PENS, TENS, another non-invasive form of neuromodulation, typically activates A-beta fibres not involved in LTD when used in conventional mode (50&#x02013;100&#x000a0;Hz typically) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although when used at very low frequency it may theoretically elicit LTD, it then requires much higher current to overcome the low current density under the electrode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Published evidence regarding the effects of LTD is largely supported by animal and laboratory-based studies, but as yet clinical human study evidence is lacking.</p><p>The first prospective cohort study on the use of EN-PENS in neuropathic pain demonstrated significant pain reduction in persons with chronic neuropathic pain post peripheral nerve injury (PPNI) or complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20, prospectively assessed, 2.8 numerical rating scale (NRS) points average reduction, CI 1.6&#x02013;4.0, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. Significant improvements in QOL (measured using the EuroQol (EQ)-5D-5&#x000a0;L) and function (using the Brief Pain Inventory Interference Subscale and the task-specific scale) were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study identified a trend toward patients with PPNI demonstrating greater reductions in pain for longer periods than patients with CRPS.</p><p>Further review of long-term EN-PENS efficacy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, average follow-up 3.5&#x000a0;years) indicated treatment benefits beyond those immediately following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The analgaesic effect remained stable for at least 1&#x000a0;year, with one to two treatments/day, with no evidence of tolerance.</p><p>This initial study provides proof of concept for the efficacy of EN-PENS in reducing pain in persons with PPNI and CRPS who have moderate to severe pain intensity, with no adverse events reported. These data suggest that this treatment may improve function and QOL. Therefore, the potential of EN-PENS as a safe, effective and cost-effective treatment option for those with chronic neuropathic pain, for whom effective treatment options may be limited, warrants further consideration.</p><p>Aside from the initial study described, current evidence for this modality exists only in the form of conference abstracts describing case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Results report positive responses in terms of immediate pain relief following treatment primarily in patients with neuropathic pain.</p><p>It is important to consider this potentially effective treatment in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a larger group of patients. Previous study results do not allow for the exclusion of possible moderate long-lasting changes in the pain intensity after stopping EN-PENS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; therefore, a crossover RCT design is not feasible.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial is to establish clinical efficacy and a more confident estimate of the effect size of EN-PENS treatment to reduce pain in patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain associated with definite or probable peripheral nerve injury.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of this treatment in terms of QOL and day-to-day function. Further objectives are to gain a better understanding of this modality in respect to mood, self-efficacy (confidence to perform abilities in the presence of pain), reduction of allodynia, potential mode of action, cost-effectiveness and health care resource use (e.g. whether treatment can negate the need for more complex surgical treatments and/or reduce the need for drug treatment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The EN-PENS trial is a single-site, blinded, randomised controlled parallel-group superiority add-on trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio.</p><p>Following screening, 76 patients will be randomised to receive either active or control (sham) treatment (38 in each treatment arm).

The mean observed effect for the treatment group would remain 3.5 only if the control group showed no change over time. There was no control group as part of this study; therefore, we estimated potential control group response based on best available literature. We were unable to identify any systematic reviews indicating baseline pain intensities and placebo responses specifically in RCTs for post-injury neuropathic pain. Therefore, data from a systematic review and meta-analysis on a different post-traumatic neuropathic pain condition, complex regional pain syndrome, was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In this systematic review the pooled mean at baseline for pain (17 studies assessed in the non-active arms) was 6.4. The systematic review illustrated no significant evidence of placebo response at time points comparable to our proposed trial. Given the observed effect size from our published audit, the proposed group difference of 1.5 NRS provides a conservative estimate in relation to between-group effect size differences.</p><p>It is conservatively estimated that there is a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and outcome pain scores; in our audit the correlation was 0.64. With a 5% significance level and 90% power, 26 participants per group are required. Allowing for a 30% dropout, based on results from a prospective patient audit, a sample size of 38 participants per group is required, 76 in total.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data handling</title><p>Stored data will be coded and anonymised information and will be stored securely: all electronic data will be password protected.

The primary analysis will be of observed data only, with missing values omitted from the analysis. Therefore, patients who do not contribute any outcome data will not be analysed. The primary outcome will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Baseline pain scores will be considered as a covariate in the analysis. The mean difference in outcome between the two groups will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. As a secondary analysis of the primary outcome, the pain scores will also be considered an ordinal outcome (as opposed to continuous for the primary analysis).</p><p>A sensitivity analysis will be performed using multiple imputation to address missing values. The extent of missing values will be investigated, as will the nature of variables with missing data. For the sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation will be performed based on either the multivariate normal data distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] or using chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Ordinal logistic regression will be used to compare between groups as an additional sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Secondary and exploratory continuous outcomes will be analysed using ANCOVA as with the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For binary outcomes the number and percentage of patients experiencing the event for each treatment arm will be presented. The relative risk and 95% confidence interval will be presented, and the chi-squared test will be used to determine statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Adverse events will be analysed using descriptive statistics only, as there is unlikely to be sufficient power to formally compare occurrence.</p><p>The occurrence and reasons for missing data will be examined via multiple imputation methods to analyse factors such as self-efficacy in relation to adherence. Additionally, a post hoc analysis will be used to assess whether there is a correlation between efficacy and symptom profiling using the specified Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Health economic analysis</title><p>There are no economic analyses of EN-PENS relevant to a UK context. A de novo prospective economic evaluation is therefore warranted, given the cost differential between the interventions being evaluated and the potential for clinical benefits (should the null hypothesis be disproved). The health economic analysis will adopt the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Costs will include those of treatment, procedures and investigations, contact with primary and secondary care services and personal social services. Resource use will be obtained from patients&#x02019; self-reporting of resource use, captured by telephone questionnaire administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and retrospective case report form.

The primary economic outcomes will be the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, estimated by administering the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L. The number of QALYs experienced by each patient will be calculated as the area under the curve, using the trapezoidal rule, applying the UK tariffs. Total costs will be combined with QALYs to calculate the incremental cost-utility ratio, which will be compared with the &#x000a3;20,000 to &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY threshold of cost-effectiveness. A range of one-way sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the analysis, and multivariate sensitivity analyses will be applied where interaction effects are suspected. The joint uncertainty in costs and benefits will be considered through the application of bootstrapping and the estimation of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Withdrawal of participants</title><p>The study treatment must be discontinued and patients withdrawn if:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Participants decide they no longer wish to continue (see also below)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recommended by the Investigator or another clinician (e.g. due to intercurrent illness during course of study or increased pain following repeated stimulation)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trial is terminated if deemed appropriate by the study staff in consultation with the study&#x02019;s PI and pain consultant.</p></list-item></list>
