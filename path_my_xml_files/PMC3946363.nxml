As noted in the CDC Appendix M, &#x0201c;small mostly unpublished studies suggest that some antiretroviral therapies might alter the pharmacokinetics of combined oral contraceptives.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Progestin-only pills have fewer contraindications than estrogen-containing products, allowing greater use by more women. For example, women with hypertension, a history of venous thrombosis, smokers older than 35 years, and women in the postpartum period may all take progestin-only pills and would be discouraged from using ethinyl estradiol containing combined oral contraceptives. Furthermore, many HIV-positive women have comorbidities that would prevent them from using combined oral contraceptives. Additionally, they have a compelling need for dual contraception with condoms and an alternative method.</p><p>This present study showed that area under the curve of NET is significantly increased by 50% among HIV-infected women taking PI therapy as compared with controls. This ratio met our predefined criteria for a significant interaction, and we rejected the null hypothesis of no interaction. Because many PI, particularly ritonavir, are known to be sytsemic inhibitors of CYP3A4,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and NET is a substrate for CYP3A4<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, we presume that the mechanism of the interaction relates to the activity of this enzyme. In vivo the CYP3A4 inhibition typical of PI resulted in a significantly increased serum NET levels by decreasing systemic metabolism; this finding is supported by the increased area under the curve and increased minimum concentration of NET. The NET half-life is not significantly different between the 2 groups, which may be due to changes in steroid distribution. It is interesting that administration of combined oral contraceptives and PI have resulted in decreased serum ethinyl estradiol vis-&#x000e0;-vis alterations of microsomal enzymes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As per the US Food and Drug Administration Product Insert, ritonavir is known to be an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and drug-to-drug interactions are difficult to predict.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The Hispanic and age demographic of our HIV-positive women at our single site in the United States may not reflect the same demographics of other regions. Our sample size was based on an a priori power analysis; however, it was still small. The variability of serum NET levels between different participants was extremely large, yet comparable to the range published in previous clinical research.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> There is extremely limited or no published data to guide research on minimum serum levels of exogenous hormones for contraceptive efficacy. Other metabolic considerations, such as genetic differences or behaviors that deviated from protocol, may have also contributed to the significant findings. It may be difficult to generalize these results to women who are immunocompromised, who do not have access to clinicians, or who are unable to demonstrate strict adherence to their contraceptive and ARV therapy. The regimens of several participants, including the women who were not taking any ARV therapy, are not the standard recommendations for most ARV-naive HIV-positive women; they were specifically tailored to these women by their infectious disease clinician. Ten of the 16 in the PI group took atazanavir/ritonavir, and the results remained significant when this subset was analyzed. However, only 3 women took darunavir/ritonavir, and 2 took lopinavir/ritonavir. With these small numbers, it is difficult to know if NET is increased among all PI regimens. Additionally, none of the participants were taking other PI agents, such as fosamprenavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, or tipranavir. However, ritonavir is a potent inhibitor, and there remains biologic plausibility that it would increase NET in combination with other PIs.</p><p>The 50% increase in the area of NET noted among women taking PI in our study is not concerning for toxicity and does not warrant dose reduction. Many progestins are well tolerated, exhibit minimal side effects, and have excellent safety profiles.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The safety of this steroid and its metabolites has been demonstrated in clinical trials and postmarket surveillance.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Several current combined oral contraceptive products approved and marketed in the United States contain 1.5 mg of NET in addition to ethinyl estradiol, which is over 4 times as much progestin as the 0.35 mg of NET in the progestin-only pill.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;29</xref> The range of NET levels noted in the both groups of women were comparable with serum NET levels observed in previous clinical trials.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24,26</xref> The dose determined for progestin-only pills contraception was a somewhat arbitrary historic assignment based on suspected bioequivalence of 0.5 mg of chlormadinone acetate.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;34</xref> In preliminary trials with the progestin NET, it was given in doses up to 20 mg, which demonstrates the wide therapeutic index, safety, and minimal toxicity of NET.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Compared with combined oral contraceptives, progestin-only pills require less restrictive screening, have wider distribution potential, and can provide an additional safe contraception option for women with HIV. This is the first trial to describe NET progestin-only pill pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected women taking PI. NET area under the curve is increased by the coadministration of PI. Increased serum NET levels are a surrogate marker of continued therapeutic contraceptive efficacy. These findings should alter current progestin-only pill medical eligibility recommendations for women taking PI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Lorraine Sanchez-Keeland, Penina Segall-Gutierrez, Alice Stek, Hita Vora, Kyle Graham, Stan Louie, Eva Operskalski, Neisha Opper, Sue Ingles, Blanca Ovalle, Laura Sech, staff, and patients at the Maternal Child Adolescent Clinic of Los Angeles County, University of Southern California, for the expert guidance and technical support offered.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the Society of Family Planning, Southern California Clinical, and Translational Science Institute (The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) (through grant UL1TR000130 for J.A.), and the National Institutes of Health Grants (GM068968 and HD070886 for M.N.).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Folger</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Curtis</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Tepper</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
