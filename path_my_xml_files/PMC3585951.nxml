A subsequent phase II study in GERD patients attests to the potential clinical efficacy of lesogaberan at this dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] The aim of the present study, therefore, was to further investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of lesogaberan, including the rate and route of excretion of total radioactivity following oral and intravenous dosing with <sup>14</sup>C-labeled and non-<sup>14</sup>C-labeled lesogaberan. A secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of lesogaberan in terms of adverse events, blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, physical examination, and laboratory safety testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This was a phase I, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study (study code: D9120C00017) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of lesogaberan after oral and intravenous administration in healthy subjects. The study was conducted at a single center in the UK, in accordance with ethical principles and standards described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and was approved by an independent ethics committee.

An oral dose of 100 mg was chosen for study in accordance with the predicted dose range because the therapeutic dose has not yet been established. Results show that lesogaberan was readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration, with a terminal plasma half-life of 11.2 hours. The estimates of bioavailability, V<sub>ss</sub>, CL, and the fraction of the dose of lesogaberan excreted unchanged into the urine were in-line with the results of previous early-stage clinical studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] A relatively large V<sub>ss</sub> (approximately 200 L), coupled with no binding to plasma proteins,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] indicates that lesogaberan demonstrates extensive distribution in the tissues. Overall, the main conclusion of the present study is that the major route of elimination (clearance of parent compound in this case) is metabolism.</p><p>While further studies are planned to determine the metabolic pathway and metabolites of lesogaberan, it is apparent that the kidney represents the major route of clearance of drug-related material because 84% of administered radioactivity was excreted into the urine either as the parent compound or as water-soluble metabolite(s). CL<sub>R</sub> of lesogaberan following intravenous administration, however, only accounted for approximately 22% of CL. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity were also higher than lesogaberan plasma concentrations during a significant proportion of the sampling period. Together, such findings indicate that metabolism is a presumed major route of elimination, followed by renal clearance of drug-related material, and further studies are planned to investigate the metabolic disposition of lesogaberan in terms of specific metabolic pathways. Further research may also be warranted to determine the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the disposition of lesogaberan because this will be relevant for clinical use.</p><p>Previous studies in humans were used to determine the duration of the biologic sampling periods to ensure that virtually no radioactive lesogaberan remained to be excreted after the sampling was completed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] The oral dose (100 mg) was selected on the basis that this dose level is expected to be within the range of therapeutic doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] The intravenous dose and infusion rate were set to yield a similar maximal plasma concentration but lower total systemic exposure, compared with the oral dose.</p><p>Both the oral and intravenous doses of lesogaberan were well tolerated, and neither dosing regimens raised any safety concerns. This finding, albeit limited by the small size of the study, is in-line with those of previous studies that reported that lesogaberan is well tolerated in oral doses of up to 500 mg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study in healthy subjects, lesogaberan administered orally was rapidly absorbed with high bioavailability, extensively metabolized (based on clearance of the parent compound), and the majority of the dose was excreted by the kidneys either as the parent compound or as water-soluble metabolites.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge Deborah Sandall (Principle Investigator) and the research team at AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, UK and M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden) for conducting the study; PRA International-Bioanalytical Laboratory B.V.
