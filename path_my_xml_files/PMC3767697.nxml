Sichuan, Gansu and Shan-xi Provinces in China were the worst affected areas. Kang County is located in the southeastern part of Gansu Province and is near the seismic center of the earthquake. The living conditions in this County dramatically have been changed for entire communities, and normal lives were seriously disrupted. Food supply systems were severely damaged or even completely stopped, and major food shortages became a primary post-earthquake feature.</p><p>In such emergency, past experience has shown that even in previously healthy population, infant and young children's morbidity and mortality often dramatically increased in a very short period <xref rid="pone.0072711-United1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, since infants and young children are the most nutritionally vulnerable group after a natural disaster <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Micronutrient deficiencies were reported to be very common in infants and young children in China <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> as well as many developing countries <xref rid="pone.0072711-Bwibo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Krebs1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and often exacerbated by a general deterioration in macronutrient supply <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on our monitoring data on children under 60 months of age one year after the earthquake in this County <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the prevalence of anemia of 0- months old children and 24&#x02013;59 months old children were 47.5% and 21.5%, respectively; the prevalence of iron and zinc deficiencies were 45.7%, and 65.5%; the prevalence of stunting was 13.6% among the 24&#x02013;59 months old children.</p><p>The period from 6 to 24 months of age is the most critical for a young child because of their rapid growth and an increasing reliance on complementary food. In order to improve nutritional status and reduce the mortality of infants and young children, adequate food-based nutrition interventions should be carried out, since such interventions might play a key role in saving lives through their impact on the nutrition and health of the target population aged 6 to 24 months of age. In the developing countries, food-based interventions have been demonstrated to be an efficiency way to decrease malnutrition and iron-deficient anemia among the children aged 6&#x02013;59 months <xref rid="pone.0072711-Semba1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072711-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Such as iron-fortified milk and noodle or biscuits <xref rid="pone.0072711-Semba1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072711-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and multiple micronutrient-fortified powder <xref rid="pone.0072711-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have been used for intervention to improve growth and other outcomes in young children. However, the effectiveness on using complementary feeding supplements fortified with multiple micronutrients for infants and young children have not been throughout evaluated in the poor areas or disaster areas.</p><p>In order to improve the nutritional status of infants and young children in affected areas, an intervention using complementary food supplements was carried out in Kang County from May 2010 to October 2011. This intervention covered all infants and young children aged 6&#x02013;24 months of age in these areas. This study was supported by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and organized by the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NINFS-CCDC). This paper focuses on the intervention efficiency of complementary food supplements on decreasing malnutrition and anemia prevalence of children from 6 months to 24 months living in disaster areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Kang County, located in high mountain areas, has often been attacked by natural disasters in history. This County belongs to a hardest hit area and life and property losses of local residents were very severe. This county is categorized by the Chinese government as poverty-stricken county, and consists of 20 townships and more than 200&#x02009;000 residents.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>After two years of earthquake, a complementary food supplement trial was conducted across rural sites in all Kang County with baseline levels of high stunting (8.9%%) and anemia prevalence (74.3%) in infants and young children. All resident children from 6 to 18 months of age in villages were daily provided with complementary food supplements (Referred to as &#x0201c;Yingyang Bao&#x0201d; in Chinese) containing multiple vitamins and minerals. This intervention project was approved by the ethic committee of NINFS-CCDC, and written informed consent was obtained from all parents or guardians before enrolling children.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Yingyang Bao distribution</title><p>Yingyang Bao was purchased through public competitive bidding by UNICEF in China, and the product of complementary food supplements produced by Qingdao Biomate Food Company, LTD in China was selected for use in this study. At every three months, Yingyang Bao was distributed to the County Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and then local CDC distributed these products to the township clinics and to the villages. This intervention lasted for one and half years (May 2010&#x0223c;October 2011), Yingyang Bao was distributed to all children aged from 6 to 18 months at the beginning of the project until children reached 24 months of age. The nutritional status data were collected at the baseline, six months, and twelve months and at eighteen months (the end). The nutrition quality and safety were evaluated and monitored by NINFS-CCDC and the third Laboratory (Intertek Group plc and SGS in China) designed by UNICEF.</p><p>This product was specially designed for the elder infants and young children based on a China's National Standard for &#x0201c;General standard for complementary food supplements (GB/T 22570-2008). Ingredients of formulated supplementary foods were as follows (Nutrients/10 g/pack/d): protein 3.0 g from soybean, vitamin A 250 &#x000b5;g, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 200 IU (5 &#x000b5;g), vitamin B<sub>1</sub> 0.3 mg, vitamin B<sub>2</sub> 0.3 mg, iron 5 mg, zinc 5 mg and calcium 250 mg. In addition, one pack contained energy 40 kcal, fat 2.0 g and carbohydrates 2.5 g.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Compliance evaluation</title><p>Staffs designated in each village, township, and county were responsible for filling in the forms of every monthly distribution records of Yingyang Bao, collected the number of local children from 6 to 24 months of age, checked monthly household taking Yingyang Bao table and uploaded these data to Provincial CDC and National CDC for calculating the compliance. The proportion of children taking Yingyang Bao more than 4 times per week accounted for more than 90% calculated by our every monthly distribution records.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Monitoring sample size and time</title><p>Using promotional probability sampling (PPS) methods, total of 250 to 300 children from six-randomized townships sampling from 20 townships were randomly chosen for follow up to evaluate intervention effectiveness at six months, twelve months and eighteen months after start of intervention on May 2010, respectively. In each township, sample size consisted of 30 to 50 children.</p><p>At baseline survey, the number of children investigated in each sampling township and the percentage accounted for local children were as follow 43 in Chengguan (14.1%), 59 in Pingluo (19.5%), 39 in Anmenkou (12.9%), 41 in Yangba (13.6%), 53 in Wangba (17.6%), and 67 in Douba (22.2%); the percentages of children were 33.8% in the group from 6 to 11 months, 37.1% in the group from 12&#x02013;17 months, and 29.1% in the group from 18&#x02013;24 months, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Bias</title><p>Based on the study design and ethic consideration, we could not have a control group during our intervention study in disaster areas. This intervention study is a pre-post design with no control group. Because Kang County located in the high mountain areas and the living place was much decentralized and inaccessible areas, the sample size at each monitoring point was not inconsistent by the reasons that some of the children could not catch up with the measurement due to the bad weather and raining, or inaccessible transportation from their living areas, which could lead to the potential bias.</p><p>Because the baby reached to 6 -month-old continually entered to 6&#x0223c;12 month group and some children from this group transferred into 12&#x0223c;18 month group, such continuing change could also lead to significant bias in intervention efficiency of the 6&#x02013;12 month group.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Methods</title><p>A questionnaire was answered by child's mother or other caregiver at each monitoring time point. The body weight, length and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration were measured to evaluate the growth status, malnutrition and anemia prevalence.</p><p>A platform weighing scale (TC100KA, 0&#x02013;100 kg of capacity and 10 g of accuracy, Huatec company, China) and length scale (YSC-2, 0.1 cm of accuracy, Beijing Guowangxingda weight Scale Company, China) were used to measure body weight and length of children wearing only underwear. Before each measurement, the weighing and length scales were checked with the calibrated weight and length materials. The evaluating nurses should had been trained and evaluated for accuracy and consistency of results.</p><p>Hb concentration of whole blood, taken from the tips of left middle finger, was assayed using the hemocue (HB 301, HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden) in the field sites. Anemia was defined as a Hb level of &#x0003c;110 g/L, for those sites with an altitude over 1000 meters, the anemia prevalence was corrected using the altitude formula based on Hb concentration was increased by 4 g/L per 1000 m when altitude was over 1000 m <xref rid="pone.0072711-Dallman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To determine the level of geographical clustering of blood Hb concentration, we used altitude-adjusted Hb concentration values in children &#x0003c;5 years of age (data available from corresponding author).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Epidata software (Windows version 3.1, Epidata, Denmark) was used to enter and manage the raw data. SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used for the statistical analysis. Main outcome measures included principal determinants of undernutrition and childhood stunting, wasting and underweight. WHO Anthro software was used to calculate the children growth status, the means of body length and weight, length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-age z score (WAZ), and weight-for-length z score (WLZ). Growth status was evaluated by WHO Child Growth Standard (2006), and malnutrition was defined as a z score less than -2. Data were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Basic characteristics</title><p>Evaluation of intervention efficiency and Yingyang Bao distribution were respectively carried out at the baseline, six months, twelve months, and eighteen months by trained staff from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention at the County, Provincial and National levels. Evaluation surveys were carried out at the 4 time points and we assayed 1019 children aged 6&#x02013;24 months of age including 314, 227, 236, and 242 infants and young children from baseline to the end of intervention. Compliance taking Yingyang Bao was more than 90% calculated based on the statistic data provided by villages, townships and county. The percentage of exclusive breastfeeding of infants under 6-months was about 59%. There were only 11% infants and young children aged 0&#x02013;23 months who could have breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery. More than 90% of children from 0&#x02013;23 months old never received any nutritional supplements.

The monitoring results from affected sites in our study showed that the anemia prevalence significantly increased in infants and young children from two months to two years of the earthquake, and this negative effect on girls was more significantly, for example, anemia percentage was respectively 76.2% for girls and 72.3% for boys after two years of earthquake. What are the reasons on the high prevalence of anemia at baseline? The great concerns were the inadequacy of iron intake and most of iron from plant foods (non-heme iron), because non-heme iron is relatively unavailable to the absorptive cells, but this kind of iron could constitute a significant amount of iron intake in such areas <xref rid="pone.0072711-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Increase of anemia prevalence were also associated with a shortage of high quality foods including lack of animal products, dairy and legume products in their daily diets.</p><p>If these children living in such areas could not be quickly given with an adequate nutrition intervention, it would result in increased wasting, more underweight, and greater levels of stunting and wasting, and a higher prevalence of anemia, which could result in the increase of mortality <xref rid="pone.0072711-United1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Nishikiori1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. After the earthquake, the government provided food supplies (a general food basket) for six months which could meet the basic energy and nutrient requirements for adults. The mean per capita cereals (including rice or wheat powder) supply was 500 grams per day after the earthquake, which could provide about 1730 kcal/per day, and if added additional energy from the non-staple food consumption (vegetables and fruits), a general food basket could provide about 2100 kcal energy per person per day that could meet the needs for the basic energy, protein, but fat and micronutrient requirements could not be met. However, for a special physiological state, such as pregnant women, nursing mothers, and infants and young children, these foods could be difficult to meet the needs to a variety of micronutrients so that these populations would be at high risk suffered from vitamin and mineral deficiencies <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072711-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.
