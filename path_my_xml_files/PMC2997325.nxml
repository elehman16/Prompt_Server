Dinnertime insulin LM 50/50 could be replaced with insulin lispro mix 75/25 if needed for fasting glycaemic control.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were 9.5% (PP) and 9.3% (G+L); p = 0.095. Change in A1C (baseline to endpoint) was &#x02212;1.76% (PP) and &#x02212;1.93% (G+L) (p = 0.097) [between-group difference of 0.17 (95% confidence interval: &#x02212;0.03, 0.37)]. Non-inferiority of PP to G+L was not shown based on the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. A1C was lower with G+L at weeks 12 (7.8 vs. 7.9%; p = 0.042), 24 (7.4 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.046), but not at week 36 (7.5 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.405). There were no significant differences in percentages of patients achieving A1C &#x02264;7%, overall hypoglycaemia incidence and rate or weight change. Total daily insulin dosages at endpoint were higher with PP vs. G+L (0.57 vs. 0.51 U/kg; p = 0.017), likely due to more injections (1.98 vs. 1.79; p = 0.011).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both treatments progressively improved glycaemic control in patients with T2D on oral therapy, although non-inferiority of PP to G+L was not shown.

The recently published 10-year follow-up of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study showed that early intervention with intensive glucose control had a &#x02018;legacy effect': early intensive glucose control continued to reduce microvascular complications, and also reduced the risk for myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality during 10 years of post-trial follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies support the clinical utility of initiating insulin therapy early in patients with T2D by adding a single injection of basal insulin to an existing oral regimen in order to achieve and maintain target hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels &#x02264;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. As only 28&#x02013;58% of patients starting on basal insulin analogues in these studies achieved A1C levels &#x0003c;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>], &#x02264;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>] or &#x02264;7.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], there is a potential opportunity to improve blood glucose (BG) levels by adding a rapid-acting insulin at mealtime as recommended if basal insulin analogue is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. The 3-year results of the Treating to Target in Type 2 Diabetes (4-T) study suggest that most patients are likely to need a second type of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>].</p><p>Premixed formulations that contain both basal and prandial insulin could also be used in starting or progressing insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>] but need more study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Of patients receiving twice-daily injections of premix (i.e. biphasic) insulin, &#x0223c;42&#x02013;48% achieved A1C &#x0003c;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>] or &#x02264;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], suggesting potential room for improvement if the regimen is intensified. In subjects without diabetes, &#x0223c;50% of daily insulin secretion is basal and the remainder is postprandial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Thus, an insulin lispro mix of 50% insulin lispro protamine suspension and 50% insulin lispro (LM50/50) more closely reflects physiologic insulin secretion than other premixed formulations and is hypothesized to provide reasonably similar clinical outcomes as a separately dosed basal with bolus insulin regimen.</p><p>In this study, two progressive approaches to starting and intensifying insulin therapy are compared in patients with T2D and inadequate glycaemic control on oral therapy: premix insulin progression (PP) with once- then twice- or thrice-daily LM50/50 insulin administration vs. basal insulin glargine initiated once daily then supplemented with one to three prandial insulin (lispro) injections [insulin glargine plus insulin lispro (G+L)] as needed to meet glycaemic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>This 36-week, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial was conducted in nine countries (Australia, Canada, France, Greece, India, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation and Spain) in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

This study evaluated two progressive regimens for advancing insulin therapy in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2D continuing prestudy OAMs. Both regimens started with once-daily insulin injections and provided increasing mealtime insulin coverage with additional injections, and both resulted in clinically relevant decreases in A1C over the course of the study. While there was no statistically significant difference between groups in A1C reduction at endpoint and non-inferiority was not shown, important observations in each approach may be noteworthy to consider during clinical management.</p><p>During the first 24 weeks, while patients in the G+L group were injecting once-daily insulin glargine and adding another injection, patients' mean A1C was significantly lowered in the G+L vs. PP group. From the 24th to 36th week, when additional mealtime insulin injections were not introduced but dose titrations were allowed, A1C increased slightly in the G+L group and, by endpoint, there were no significant differences between the groups. Most studies evaluating basal insulin added to OAMs in T2D note a decrease in A1C from baseline up to &#x0223c;12 weeks, after which they stabilize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]; whereas, in the present study, the improvement in A1C continued in the G+L group until 24 weeks. Thus, additional efficacy in lowering BG was observed while additional mealtime insulin was introduced. The G+L regimen more effectively lowered FBG compared to the PP regimen, which is consistent with other studies comparing premix to basal insulin analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>], and prandial premixed therapy to basal/bolus therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the PP group, A1C decreased from baseline to 24 weeks almost in parallel with the G+L group, although levels were slightly higher. While PP patients had higher A1C at the 12th and 24th week, patients in this group were able to maintain their A1C levels between the 24th and 36th week; by the end of week 36, there was no difference in A1C between groups. The PP regimen more effectively lowered evening postprandial values compared to G+L therapy. A greater number of patients in the PP vs. G+L group were receiving more than one injection by the end of week 24, which may explain why A1C levels were maintained in this group.</p><p>The higher rate of hypoglycaemia in the G+L vs. PP group occurred after week 24, a point after which no additional mealtime lispro injections could be introduced. Because A1C increased slightly in the G+L group between weeks 24 and 36, the increased rate of hypoglycaemia is unlikely to be the result of lower glucose levels but may have resulted from increasing the insulin dose without adding injections. In contrast, the greater number of injections in the PP group may have allowed administration of higher doses overall without increasing hypoglycaemia. This finding is consistent with the rationale behind multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections (i.e. four injections per day with separate basal and bolus components), where each injection provides a unique opportunity for more flexible dose adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>] to improve glycaemic control while avoiding hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of Rosenstock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] in which LM50/50 with each meal and separately dosed basal/bolus therapy both significantly lowered A1C and was also unable to show non-inferiority. Some important differences and similarities between the two studies are noteworthy. The Rosenstock et al. study included patients already taking insulin and randomized to fixed and intensive regimens with three to four insulin injections, whereas the insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients in our study were started on one injection then gradually escalated to up to three to four injections until week 24. While most patients advanced therapy to more than one injection, not many reached three to four injections; yet within 24&#x02013;36 weeks, mean A1Cs had dropped to &#x0223c;7.5%. Considering that patients in the Rosenstock et al. study had mean A1C of &#x0223c;9.0% at baseline while on once-daily basal insulin (&#x0223c;50 units/day), our results highlight the potential improvement attainable by advancing to more than one injection or providing mealtime insulin coverage to optimize glycaemic control. While greater weight gain has been reported with premixed vs. basal insulin regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>], there were no weight differences between regimens in the Rosenstock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] study or the present study. There were also no differences in hypoglycaemia between regimens in either study.</p><p>An important difference between the two studies is the mean A1C levels at study endpoint. With the intensive insulin therapies in the Rosenstock et al. study, mean A1C at endpoint was &#x0003c;7.0% with both treatments; whereas in the present study, mean A1C at endpoint was 7.6% while patients were on a median of two insulin injections. The difference in achieved mean A1Cs at endpoint again highlights the potential for improvement in glycaemic control by advancing prandial insulin to cover all meals.</p><p>Relatively few other studies have evaluated progressive insulin advancement in the context of a clinical trial. The Orals Plus Apidra and LANTUS (OPAL) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>] evaluated treatment intensification in German patients with T2D not optimally controlled on insulin glargine plus OAMs by adding a single injection of rapid-acting insulin analogue glulisine before breakfast or the main mealtime. This approach also led to significant reductions in A1C. One observational study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] employed a progressive titration of biphasic insulin aspart (NovoLog&#x000ae; Mix 70/30; Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ, USA) from one up to three injections (adding one injection every 16 weeks) in patients with T2D failing OAMs with or without basal insulin, but this study did not have a comparator. By evaluating the addition of &#x02265;1 mealtime insulin injection, employing randomization and active control and involving many countries, the findings in this study may have broader generalizability.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is the open-label design, which was unavoidable given the cloudy vs. clear appearance of the insulin preparations that prevented blinding. This may have contributed to inequality in the numbers of injections given that most practitioners use premix insulin twice daily and insulin glargine once daily. While the protocol allowed titration up to three to four injections, most patients only went up to two injections in spite of endpoint A1Cs not being &#x0003c;7%. It could be argued that tighter control should have been implemented considering that lower A1Cs were achievable with three to four insulin injections, as shown in Rosenstock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. The protocol included an option to switch LM50/50 to LM75/25 if FBG targets were not achievable, and some patients who switched achieved lower A1Cs. More stringent guidelines in the study design for switching to LM75/25 may have been warranted.</p><p>The slight worsening of glycaemic control in the G+L group after 24 weeks emphasizes the importance of being vigilant about getting patients to achieve glycaemic control. The wide variability in the change in A1C (95% CI: &#x02212;0.03, 0.37) reflects the broad differences in patients' responses to these insulin regimens. Other factors may need to be studied to better understand this. The apparent resistance to increasing numbers of injections is a reminder that there are barriers to intensifying insulin therapy that also may need to be considered and addressed to more effectively aim for better glycaemic control earlier in the natural history of T2D. One of these barriers is clinical inertia or failure of health-care providers to initiate or advance therapy in a patient who is not at the recommended therapeutic goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study shows that both the PP and G+L regimens are efficient in lowering A1C even if non-inferiority of PP to G+L could not be shown. These findings support the belief that most patients with T2D will likely need more than one type of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>], and that targeting both fasting and mealtime BG levels is important. These findings may aid physicians as they choose and optimize insulin regimens for individual patients with T2D.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company and is related to study Protocol F3Z-MC-IOOX.
