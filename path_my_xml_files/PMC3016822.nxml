Often, open procedures provide suboptimal visualization for surgical residents in training because of the size of the skin incision or its location. Often this translates into a poor operative educational experience for the more junior members of the surgical team. We chose to perform an open surgical procedure while viewing it via a laparo-scope mounted to the side of the operating room table with an alpha port. These images were then compared in a blinded fashion with those from a boom-mounted camera positioned above the surgical field and a head-mounted camera positioned on the operating surgeon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Participants viewed either a thyroidectomy or a parathyroidectomy performed by the same surgeon and resident. All 3 camera systems were positioned identically for each procedure. During the procedures, all 3 video images (see inset) were transmitted via an internet protocol line at 1.5 megabytes to a remote videoconference center. From this location, all participants viewed either surgical procedure in real time and critiqued the images in a blinded, random fashion. All participants evaluated each image and completed a Likert questionnaire <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Likert questionnaire used by all participants to evaluate surgical video images from the Alpha Port, Sky-Cam, and Head-Cam.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-8-4-367-g01"/></fig><sec><title>Boom-Mounted Image: Sky-Eye Camera (Overhead Camera Systems Inc., Wichita, Kansas)</title><p>A Hitachi 3CCC HVC-20 camera is mounted on a large hydraulic-powered boom that is controlled by a joystick and connected to a JVC video monitor <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>)</bold>.

Particularly for procedures with a limited exposure, this can result in a compromised experience for junior residents, medical students, and other trainees.</p><p>As a result, various imaging modalities have emerged to overcome the inability to see the operative field. One such modality is the head-cam, in which the operating surgeon wears a camera mounted to his or her head with the camera focused on the operative field. The obvious drawback to such a system is that any movement away from the operative field translates into motion artifact for the viewer.</p><p>A second imaging modality is the sky-cam in which a camera fixed to a boom is lowered over the surgical field. Although excellent images can be obtained with such a device, the drawback is that the operating surgeon and assistants often block the field of view resulting in an obscured image.</p><p>With the advent of laparoscopy, many of the above-stated problems associated with traditional open surgery have been eliminated. A significant achievement occurred in 1986 with the introduction of the solid state camera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> This allowed a laparoscopic image to be transmitted electronically to a video monitor, allowing the entire surgical team to view the operative field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup></p><p>We applied the optical principles of the laparoscopic image to an open surgical procedure, in essence, obtaining all of the visual advantages of laparoscopy in an open surgical procedure.</p><p>Thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy were chosen as typical for 2 major problems often encountered while attempting to teach surgical residents and medical students: visualization through a small incision, and secondly, the location of an operative field that is difficult to visualize because it is often obscured by the surgeon and assistant.</p><p>In this study, all participants felt the alpha port/laparo-scope image would benefit surgical education. Although we chose to control the laparoscope with the use of the Aesop robotic arm (Computer Motion Inc, Goleta, GA), this is not essential to accomplish the goals of projecting a high-resolution image onto a monitor for residents/students to view. The laparoscope can simply be mounted onto the side of the operating room table with the alpha port and the scope manually positioned as seen fit by the operating surgeon. The ready availability of laparoscopic equipment in most operating rooms makes this unique approach of teaching very affordable for surgical training programs.</p><p>In this study, we chose to transmit the images to a conference center so that the participants would remain blinded as to which image they were evaluating.</p><p>This is not necessary to enhance the operative educational experience of residents and medical students. A video monitor placed in the operating room will suffice and provide a teaching environment in which the surgeon can instruct, point out pertinent anatomy, and answer questions with minimal disturbance to the flow of the operation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Use of a laparoscope mounted via an alpha port to an operating table provides superior images during open surgery when compared with images from the sky-cam or head-cam systems. The alpha port/laparoscope combination provides a unique and affordable way to teach residents and medical students operative procedures that are otherwise difficult to view due to the location or the size of the incision, or both.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement:</title><p>Supported in part by a grant from NASA.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
