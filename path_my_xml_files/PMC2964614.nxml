The change in 15<sup>th </sup>percentile of lung density (PD15) measured by CT scan was obtained from both trials. All subjects had 1 CT scan at baseline and at least 1 CT scan after treatment. Densitometric data from 119 patients (AAT [Alfalastin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or Prolastin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>], n = 60; placebo, n = 59) were analysed by a statistical/endpoint analysis method. To adjust for lung volume, volume correction was made by including the change in log-transformed total lung volume as a covariate in the statistical model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean follow-up was approximately 2.5 years. The mean change in lung density from baseline to last CT scan was -4.082 g/L for AAT and -6.379 g/L for placebo with a treatment difference of 2.297 (95% CI, 0.669 to 3.926; p = 0.006). The corresponding annual declines were -1.73 and -2.74 g/L/yr, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The overall results of the combined analysis of 2 separate trials of comparable design, and the only 2 controlled clinical trials completed to date, has confirmed that IV AAT augmentation therapy significantly reduces the decline in lung density and may therefore reduce the future risk of mortality in patients with AAT deficiency-related emphysema.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The EXACTLE study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as 'Antitrypsin (AAT) to Treat Emphysema in AAT-Deficient Patients'; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00263887.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In subjects with a hereditary deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), the pathophysiology of emphysema is believed to be a direct consequence of tissue damage caused by a reduced ability of AAT to inactivate neutrophil elastase, which is released by migrating neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is logical that augmentation of the circulating levels (and hence lung levels) of AAT would confer normal protection by restoring the inhibitory capacity of AAT in the lungs. The net result is argued to be retardation of the destructive process and, therefore, the progressive decline in lung physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A strategy of weekly augmentation with AAT was thus introduced in the 1980s, confirming that the attainment of a putative protective level was possible with weekly infusions of AAT at a dose of 60 mg&#x02022;kg<sup>-1 </sup>body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Because the numbers required to perform a controlled clinical trial using forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) are thought to be prohibitive (requiring inclusion of a large number of individuals with a rare disease over many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]), no such study has been undertaken. Despite this, augmentation therapy is widely prescribed using varying treatment intervals and doses of plasma-derived AAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the past, the mainstay of clinical assessment of emphysema was lung function and especially gas transfer measurements, although recent data have indicated that there is differential progression depending on disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Computed tomography (CT) densitometry is a validated and more direct measure of pathological emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that relates well to physiological and clinical features of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], progresses uniformly across disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and has specifically been shown to be the best independent predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In 1999, Dirksen, <italic>et al </italic>reported a 3-year Danish-Dutch controlled study of intravenous (IV) AAT augmentation therapy, with loss of lung tissue measured by CT densitometry as a secondary outcome parameter in 56 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The study suggested a reduction in emphysema progression with AAT augmentation therapy measured by CT, although the p value for the treatment difference obtained (p = 0.07) failed to achieve the conventional level of significance, which may reflect the number of subjects in the trial.</p><p>More recently, the EXAcerbations and CT scan as Lung Endpoints (EXACTLE) study (77 patients studied over 24-30 months), using a similar placebo-controlled trial design of IV AAT, explored CT densitometry as the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Lung density was analysed using 4 different methods of adjustment that corrected for variation in inspiratory levels between scans, and all showed a trend towards efficacy. However, endpoint analysis using a statistical correction for lung volume not only proved to be the most sensitive method of analysis (based on monitoring progression in the placebo group), but also achieved a conventional level of statistical significance with regard to lung tissue loss between both treatment groups. Interestingly, in both the Danish-Dutch and EXACTLE studies, there was little difference in density loss between the AAT and placebo groups within the first year while, subsequently, the difference between the groups increased with time. Furthermore, the effect of therapy in clinical trials is usually determined by endpoint analysis. For these reasons, we chose to re-analyse the Danish-Dutch study using an endpoint analysis, utilising only the first and last available measurement.</p><p>In addition, because of the similar study design and method of CT densitometry, we combined the raw data from both studies to increase the statistical power as suggested in the previous Danish-Dutch study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Characteristics of the study subjects and designs of the Danish-Dutch and EXACTLE studies are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

In the EXACTLE study, 65 patients provided data, 27 from Denmark, 23 from the United Kingdom and 15 from Sweden. The patient disposition by treatment is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><p>In the Danish-Dutch study, the mean (range) length of exposure was 2.52 (0.9-4.2) years to AAT, and 2.55 (0.9-3.9) years to placebo.

For the combined data from both studies, the mean (range) length of exposure to AAT was 2.36 (0.9-4.2) years and to placebo, 2.33 (0.9-3.9) years.</p><p>The characteristics for patients at baseline are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.

The individual and combined analysis of the Danish-Dutch and EXACTLE trials confirms that AAT augmentation therapy has a beneficial effect on the decline in lung density, which is a measure of the progression of emphysema.</p><p>AAT augmentation therapy is an accepted therapeutic regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and an earlier observational study showed better overall survival and reduced FEV<sub>1 </sub>decline (albeit in a subset with moderate airflow obstruction) for patients receiving therapy with varying regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Whereas the recommended regimen is 60 mg&#x02022;kg<sup>-1 </sup>body weight per week, other adopted approaches are likely to be as effective if the nadir AAT level is mostly above the putative protective threshold of 11 &#x003bc;M.</p><p>Preservation of normal lung structure has been the long-term aim of preventive therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, studies of this concept have used FEV<sub>1 </sub>as the endpoint, since it is not only a defining feature of COPD but also reflects patients with a variety of phenotypes, including those with small airways disease and emphysema. Moreover, FEV<sub>1 </sub>is a reasonable marker of a patient's health status and exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and has previously been considered to be the best predictor of respiratory and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This has led to the tenet that the maintenance of FEV<sub>1 </sub>reflects disease stability or a consequent reduction in mortality. Nevertheless, FEV<sub>1 </sub>is a poor surrogate measure for the presence and severity of emphysema and its progression. For instance, it has been demonstrated that patients with apical emphysema may have a preserved FEV<sub>1 </sub>in both AAT deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and usual COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The FEV<sub>1 </sub>data from this combined study confirm that even doubling the number of subjects is inadequate to verify whether augmentation therapy affects this non-specific and relatively insensitive outcome of emphysema. Much larger numbers of subjects studied over a longer period of time are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in order to determine the response of therapy on FEV<sub>1</sub>, even though longitudinal CT data have confirmed that decline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>does generally relate to loss of lung density, but only if sufficient data are analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Extensive observational studies of lung density in AAT deficiency using CT scanning have demonstrated that this parameter not only relates to progressive reduction in FEV<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], health status and exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but is indeed a better predictor of all-cause mortality than FEV<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is possible to extrapolate the findings of this combined analysis to conventional measures such as the FEV<sub>1 </sub>using previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This indicates that the reduction in densitometry quantified here (&#x00f9c;1 HU/year) is equivalent to about a 38 ml difference in FEV<sub>1 </sub>decline in patients in GOLD stage 2.</p><p>However as indicated above the decline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>is not linear throughout the disease process. Therefore, for this and other reasons, stabilisation of emphysema progression, as indicated by CT densitometry, would be as important an aim, if not more so, than preserving FEV<sub>1</sub>. The current combined analysis of the only 2 controlled clinical trials completed to date has confirmed that AAT augmentation therapy significantly reduces the decline in lung density, and may thus reduce the future risk of mortality as well as the deterioration in health status.</p><p>With AAT augmentation therapy becoming widely accepted throughout the United States and Europe, the ability to deliver appropriately powered placebo-controlled clinical trials, particularly those requiring a physiological measurement outcome, has become difficult to justify ethically and even more difficult to deliver. The current analysis, however, provides evidence of augmentation therapy reducing the rate of progression of lung tissue loss. The data, therefore, permit future studies to be powered for comparison of different therapeutic regimens using CT scans rather than physiology (either FEV<sub>1 </sub>or gas transfer). However, it should also be noted that even CT scans, as well as accepted physiological measurements, are only surrogate measures of emphysema. Importantly, the change in physiological endpoints varies throughout the course of the disease, with FEV<sub>1 </sub>decline being greatest in subjects with moderate airflow obstruction (35-79% of predicted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and gas transfer decline being greatest in those with most severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, loss of lung density as assessed by PD15 shows a more constant change across all stages of disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that it is a better marker of the continuing disease process.</p><p>It is not always feasible to conduct powered clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and sometimes a combination of comparable studies is necessary. For example, meta-analysis of several studies has been used to support the use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In clinical medicine, meta-analyses are accepted and useful tools that combine results from several studies to draw conclusions about clinical effectiveness. These can be either based on the analysis of published data (so-called 'aggregated analysis') or by pooling individual patient data (also termed 'integrated analysis') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Trials with different protocols, but with common characteristics, can be pooled for these analyses. An integrated analysis based on individual patient data offers numerous advantages over the use of aggregated data; it is more reliable than aggregate meta-analyses and may thus lead to different conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This approach has been used more frequently in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and also allows, as aggregate analyses similarly do, for the inclusion of different drug substances belonging to the same drug class, and different predefined clinical endpoints in the source studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], provided that the studies have common characteristics to enable the pooling of data.</p><p>Although there were some differences in study characteristics, the EXACTLE and Danish-Dutch trials both had a randomised, placebo-controlled, blinded, parallel design and had a similar CT scan protocol. The 2 studies were comparable with regard to treatment drug, treatment duration and patient characteristics. There is a general belief that maintaining AAT above a protective level of 11 &#x003bc;M is the key to a successful therapeutic outcome, and both studies had treatment regimens that are able to maintain protective levels of AAT, either consistently, or for at least 3 out of the 4 weeks in the monthly regimen used in the Danish-Dutch trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Jadad scale is widely used to assess the methodological quality of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. When evaluated on this scale, the design of the 2 studies met the standards required for their results to be included in a meta- or integrated analysis. Although the principle of meta- or integrated analyses is based on the inclusion of several studies, p values are reported without statistical adjustment of the alpha level.</p><p>Integrating the data from the 2 studies increased the numbers and hence the power of the observations. By using the most sensitive method for assessing emphysema progression (as measured by tissue loss) with endpoint analysis of PD15, the mean data demonstrate a deceleration of lung tissue loss with AAT augmentation therapy with a high degree of statistical significance. It is, however, recognised that progression even in CT densitometry varies between individuals. Thus adequate historical data will remain a prerequisite to therapeutic decision making. Furthermore, it should be noted that the treatment effect may not be demonstrable for the first 12 months of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The exact reasons remain unknown but it is possible that a period of time is required to reverse the established, destructive inflammatory process. This observation clearly has potential impact on the design of future phase 2 and 3 studies in AAT deficiency and support an end point analysis as the best primary outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, the overall results are supportive of the efficacy of AAT augmentation therapy and, importantly, provide confirmatory data to power and analyse future alternative strategies for which long-term IV placebo arms cannot be justified ethically.</p><sec><title>Disclosure of prior abstract publications</title><p>Abstracts of this study have been published by the American Thoracic Society (<italic>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</italic>, Apr 2008;177), and by the European Respiratory Society (<italic>Eur Respir J</italic>, Oct 2008;32(Supplement 52):738s).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Robert A Stockley has received an unrestricted grant from Talecris Biotherapeutics for the Alpha-1 Detection and Programme for Treatment (ADAPT UK registry).
