post-stroke depression. [Subjects] Ninety patients with post-stroke depression were
randomly divided into 3 groups: fluoxetine treatment group (n = 30), hyperbaric oxygen
therapy group (n = 30), and hyperbaric oxygen combined treatment group (n = 30). [Methods]
Fluoxetine treatment group received anti-depression drugs (fluoxetine, 20&#x02005;mg/day),
hyperbaric oxygen therapy group received hyperbaric oxygen (once a day, 5 days/week),
hyperbaric oxygen combined treatment group received fluoxetine and hyperbaric oxygen
treatments as described above. All patients received routine rehabilitation therapy.
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) scores were
evaluated before and at the end of 4th week. The total effective rate of depression
release between the 3 groups was also compared at the end of study. [Results] The end
scores of HAMD and SSS in the 3 groups were significantly lower than those before
treatment. The total effective rate of combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy group after
treatment was higher than the other two groups. [Conclusions] Combined hyperbaric oxygen
therapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with post-stroke depression.
The total effective rate of combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy was higher than other
routine anti post-stroke depression treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</kwd><kwd>Post-stroke depression</kwd><kwd>Fluoxetine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Depression is a frequent and important problem in patients after stroke. Post-stroke
depression (PSD) has been estimated to occur in 33% of patients in the acute stage and in
34% of patients over long term after stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. PSD not only aggravates the cognitive impairment in patients, but
also affects their quality of life, hinders the recovery of nerve function, and markedly
increases the mortality rate<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence,
post-stroke depression has a negative impact on functional recovery. At present, there are
many drugs for treating depression, each with their own advantages. In the last 20&#x02005;years,
there has been great progress in the research on antidepressants, however 15&#x02013;33% of patients
with depression have been identified as insensitive to drug treatments<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is valuable in treating acute carbon-monoxide (CO)
poisoning and air or gas embolism. HBOT can lead to significant neurological improvement in
after stroke even at chronic late stages<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
HBOT-induced neuroprotection enhances neuronal viability via increased tissue oxygen
delivery to the area with diminished blood flow, thus reducing brain edema and improving
metabolism after ischemia<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also could
up-regulate the expression of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth
factor (NGF)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent study has shown
that HBOT is able to significantly improve the degree of depression in the convalescent
stage following cerebral hemorrhage, and promote nerve function recovery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a more pronounced effect of
combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy with anti-depression drugs on patients with post-stroke
depression is not reported. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of HBOT
with anti-depression drugs on patients with depression after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients were selected from inpatients consecutively admitted from January 2012 to
December 2013 to the Rehabilitation Center in Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang CAPF. The
present study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised
1983) and with the approval from the Ethics Committee of the Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang
CAPF. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Ninety patients (49
females and 51 males) were recruited in this study. These patients were randomly assigned
with the help of a computer-generated list to either the fluoxetine treatment group,
hyperbaric oxygen therapy group, or hyperbaric oxygen combined treatment group. There were
30 subjects in each group. All patients were suffering from the first occurrence of stroke
within one month. Patients with disorders of consciousness and complete sensory aphasia
were excluded. A depression assessment was conducted using the Hamilton Depression Scale
(HAMD) and nerve function defect scoring was conducted using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale
(SSS). The three groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, and SSS and HAMD scores

patient&#x02019;s daily life quality, and significantly increase the social-economic costs. The
present study is the first clinical report that demonstrates better clinical outcome
evaluated by HAMD in patients with stroke using combined HBOT and anti-depressant drugs.</p><p>Cerebral hypoxic ischemic injury possibly affects the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia,
frontal cortex, and other areas and causes depression<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, an improvement in the oxygen supply to the brain in
stroke patients can not only reduce the secondary damage to the cerebral cortex and relevant
nerve functions but also promote brain remodeling and functional reorganization in patients
with cerebral apoplexy at the convalescent stage. HBOT increases the expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), GDNF, and NGF, which nourish the cranial nerve,
and promote proliferation and restoration of the neurons<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is reported that HBOT could help decrease the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;
and IL-1&#x003b2;, which have shown to induce depression after stroke<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recently randomized, prospective trial has shown that HBOT can
activate the neuroplasticity of brain tissues in post-stroke patients, even in the chronic
phase<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 6 randomized controlled
trials involving 283 participants update the former summary by Bennett et al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bennett et al used Trouillas Disability
Sca to assess the otcome and found that the disability and functional performance in
individual studies indicated an improvement after HBOT 6 months later.</p><p>Our results from the present study show that fluoxetine treatment, hyperbaric oxygen
therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy with fluoxetine could improve post-stroke depression.
These findings are consistent with previous studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, we found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with
fluoxetine was more effective than the other two treatments. It showed lower HAMD score and
higher total efficacy. We estimate that HBOT with fluoxetine has additive anti-depression
effects than other traditional treatment. The Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) scores were
improved in all three groups after treatment. However, there were no differences between the
three groups at the end because all patients received routine rehabilitation therapy.</p><p>Currently, early antidepressant treatments and timely eradication of the emotional disorder
to promote the recovery of nerve functions has been researched worldwide. In addition to
drug treatment alone, many drug treatments combined with psychological and
electro-acupuncture therapy<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, have been
reported. Post-stroke depression can be controlled by rehabilitation<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, combined HBOT has been used to treat
depression in the recovery stage following stroke with good results and no evident adverse
reaction. Therefore, combined HBO treatment is worthy of further promotion and application
in the clinic.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it was an open study without a negative control group.
Another limitation was the small sample size. While we were able to demonstrate significant
improvement in PSD after combined HBO treatment, this effect needs to be verified with a
larger sample.</p><p>In summary, the findings of the present study show that the PSD can be most improved by
combined HBO treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate the long term prognosis
following this treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Zhe Jiang Province Medical Science Research Fund
